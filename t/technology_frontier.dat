In Germany, the procedure was used earlier to estimate the marginal productivity of R&D and other factors of production (Brockhoff 1970). Since then, {{there have been a}} large number of books and journal articles written on DEA or applying DEA on various sets of problems. Other than comparing efficiency across DMUs within an organization, DEA has also been used to compare efficiency across firms. There are several types of DEA with the most basic being CCR based on Charnes, Cooper & Rhodes, however there are also DEA which address varying returns to scale, either CRS (constant returns to scale) or VRS (variable). The main developments of DEA in the 1970s and 1980s are documented by Seiford & Thrall (1990).|$|E

This is investigated in this analysis of productivity growth in South African manufacturing sectors and represents an alternative to conventional analysis of domestic determinants of productivity. Productivities in U. S. manufacturing sectors serve as the world <b>technology</b> <b>frontier</b> and allow identification of causal effects of South African productivities. The results show the importance of the world <b>technology</b> <b>frontier</b> and we argue that existing studies overlooking the world frontier may have serious omitted variable bias...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of human}} capital {{composition}} {{has been given}} importance {{in the most recent}} endogenous growth models. Assuming that primary as well as secondary education is more suitable for imitation and higher education is more appropriate for innovation, this paper empirically investigates whether the contribution of human capital to productivity growth depends on the composition of human capital and the proximity to <b>technology</b> <b>frontier</b> in a panel of 87 sample countries over the period of 1970 to 2004. The sample is further divided into 28 high, 37 medium, and 22 low income countries to gain some insights into the importance of composition effects of human capital on growth in developing countries relative to their developed counterparts. Using different levels of human capital data from four alternative sources empirical results from system GMM estimator demonstrate that growth enhancing effect of skilled human capital increases with the proximity to the <b>technology</b> <b>frontier</b> only for high and medium income countries. Unskilled human capital is contributing more for low income countries as they move closer to the <b>technology</b> <b>frontier.</b> Matured workers with tertiary education are more growth enhancing for high and medium income countries, whereas younger workers with secondary education are more growth improving for low income countries. Estimated results are consistent across male and female workers. Human capital composition, proximity, <b>technology</b> <b>frontier,</b> growth, GMM, world...|$|E

US ethnic research communities are quantified by applying an ethnic-name database to individual patent records. International patent citations confirm knowledge diffuses through ethnic networks, and manufacturing output in foreign countries increases with an elasticity of approximately 0. 3 to stronger scientific integration with the US frontier. To address reverse-causality concerns, reduced-form specifications exploit exogenous changes in US immigration quotas. Consistent with a model of sector reallocation, output growth in less developed economies is facilitated by employment gains, while more advanced economies experience sharper increases in labor productivity.

40|$|We analyze {{an economy}} where {{entrepreneurs}} engage {{both in the}} adoption of technologies from the world frontier and in innovation activities. The selection of high-ability entrepreneurs is more important for innovation activities. As the economy approaches the <b>technology</b> <b>frontier,</b> selection becomes more important.

Closer to the world <b>technology</b> <b>frontier,</b> there is aswitchtoaninnovation-basedstrategywith short-term relationships, younger firms, less investment and better selection of entrepreneurs. We show that relatively backward economies may switch out of the investment-based strategy too soon, so certain economic institutions and policies, such as limited product market competition, that encourage the investment-based strategy may be beneficial. However, societies that cannot switch out of the investment-based strategy fail converge to the world <b>technology</b> <b>frontier.</b> The likelihood of such non-convergence traps becomes greater when policies and institutions are endogenized, enabling beneficiaries of existing policies can bribe politicians to maintain these policies...|$|E
