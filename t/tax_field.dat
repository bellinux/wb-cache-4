In 1949, Mac Asbill, Sr. joined the Washington office. In 1954, firm co-founder Elbert Tuttle accepted an appointment to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

He {{called on the}} federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor <b>tax</b> <b>fields</b> as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|R
5000|$|When Edgar Benson's {{white paper}} on tax reform was issued in 1969, his {{original}} {{intention was to}} retain estate and gift taxes in conjunction with introducing capital gains tax, with appropriate relief to avoid double taxation. After public consultations were held through hearings by parliamentary committees, he announced that, as [...] "it {{is no longer possible}} to establish a uniform national system of death duties through federal legislation," [...] the federal government would vacate the estate and gift <b>tax</b> <b>field</b> on December 31, 1971. At that time, only British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec were still levying duties of their own.

In South Australia v Commonwealth (1942) 65 CLR 373 (the First Uniform Tax case) {{the scheme}} for the Commonwealth {{to take over}} the income <b>tax</b> <b>field</b> was upheld. The condition imposed by the States Grant Act was that a state not impose its own income tax. The Income Tax Act 1942, set high tax rates (i.e. that would reflect the combined current Commonwealth and State taxes) which made imposing State taxes unattractive or impossible. This was because the Income Tax Assessment Act 1942 required Commonwealth tax to be paid before State taxes. In effect, the scheme meant either the States had to accept grants and stop taxing, or decline grants and try to collect tax at rates which were unsustainable.|$|E

Through the analysis of a recent critical incident in the <b>tax</b> <b>field</b> (Arctic Systems) with which the accounting profession is intimately associated, this paper uses a Bourdieusian lens to unravel the relational complexities of the regulation of tax avoidance at the complex and fuzzy boundary between acceptable and unacceptable tax practice.

We conclude by highlighting how a move towards ‘relational’ regulation might contribute to improved understanding of regulatory processes and practices...|$|E

40|$|At {{the basis}} of conceiving the tax policy of an European Union member state, one must consider, on the one hand, {{fulfilling}} the government's own requirements, {{and on the other}} hand, achieving the objectives set by the EC Treaty. At present, the European Union has a quite harmonized and coordinated tax policy in the indirect <b>taxes</b> <b>field,</b> and partially in the direct <b>taxes</b> <b>field,</b> based on the free movement principle of goods, services, capital and labour; thus, although the member states have the freedom to set operation rules of their own national tax systems, this freedom is conditioned by the compliance with the priority objectives of the founding treaties of the European Union. The member states should avoid adopting discriminating tax measures (which could lead to a disadvantageous treatment for the persons, goods and services or capitals coming from other member states). Sometimes, the restrictions regarding free movement on the internal market are generated by the differences between the national tax systems, so that a certain degree of tax harmonization at the European Union level is necessary. The tax harmonization can be achieved either spontaneously (by means of the forces of the market), by means of active actions {{at the level of the}} European Union (the implementation of common policies, the coordination of the policies, the harmonization of the legislation, etc.) or by means of the passive actions of the European Court of Justice (the interdiction of certain types of conduct of the member states that do not comply with the norms of the European Union). In the absence of the tax harmonization, negative effects can occur, such as: the erosion of the national tax bases, provision of public services and goods at a sub-optimal level, unwanted changes in the structure of the taxes which are levied in the member states, and distortions in assigning resources at the level of the single market...|$|R

As this legal risk {{is a function}} of the approach courts adopt towards them, identifying and understanding it fully is a sine qua non requirement, without which one simply cannot assess the risk ex ante. Confidence in the robustness of such transactions is based partly on the fact that UK courts characterise transactions according to their legal substance, ignoring factors such as economic substance. Courts have developed an approach in the <b>tax</b> <b>field,</b> the so-called “Ramsay Approach”, which can lead them to look beyond legal substance, but the view seems to be held in some quarters that it cannot be applied outside the <b>tax</b> <b>field.</b> It is argued here that, once its true nature is properly understood, this approach not only can but actually has been applied in a number of corporate law cases...|$|E

This paper uses firm-level data for 21 European countries between 1992 and 2004. The paper finds a robust negative correlation between the number of employees and the effective tax burden of companies. This result tends to validate theories arguing that large companies may enjoy a lower tax burden. As a caveat, using total assets as size variable produces a positive relationship. This relationship is however less robust and less economically significant. Corporate taxation; Effective tax rates; political power; political cost. ...|$|R
