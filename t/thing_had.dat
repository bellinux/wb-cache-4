5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E

25|$|For many {{classical}} philosophers, {{nature was}} understood teleologically, meaning that {{every type of}} <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos is even said to have reason. Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal {{part of the human}} mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human mind or soul (psyche), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (thumos) and the passions. Aristotle, Plato's student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He defined the highest human happiness or well being (eudaimonia) as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.|$|E
25|$|Christophe {{was still}} in Grenoble {{at the start of}} stage eleven, when tour {{organiser}} Henri Desgrange gave him a yellow jersey, so that he could easily be recognized. The colour was inspired by the colour of the organizing newspaper l'Auto, although another explanation is that other colours were not available in the post-war shortage. Christophe was not happy with his yellow jersey, and other cyclists called him a canary. At that point in the race, it was likely that Christophe would stay the leader {{until the end of the}} Tour de France, because he remained in that yellow jersey after the Pyrénées and the Alps. In the penultimate stage, Firmin Lambot, who was in second position, more than 28 minutes behind, attacked. Christophe, still leading the race, chased him, but broke his fork close to Valenciennes. The rules were such that cyclists could get no help at all, so Christophe repaired his bicycle himself. This same <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> already cost him the victory in 1913, and would happen to him for a third time in 1922. It took him over two and a half hours, and he had lost the lead to Lambot. In the last stage, Christophe had a record number of punctures, and also lost his second place to Jean Alavoine.|$|E

Others found the conclusion a comforting reminder of the Star Trek television episode [...] "", which aired about 11 years prior in real time.|$|E

500|$|Farrar {{settled on}} the {{preliminary}} look of the wave, and graphics supervisor Jay Riddle used Adobe Photoshop on a Macintosh to establish the final color scheme. Initially the team {{thought they would be}} able to use the same methods to create the wave that hits the Excelsior, but found that it did not convey the scale of the wave—in Riddle's words, [...] "this <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> to look really enormous." [...] The shot was created by manipulating two curved pieces of computer geometry, expanding them as they approached the camera's view. Textures that changed every frame were added to the main wave body and over the top of it to give the impression of great speed. Motion control footage of the Excelsior was then scanned into the computer system and made to interact with the digital wave. ILM's [...] "Praxis effect" [...] shockwave became a common feature in science fiction films depicting the destruction of large objects.|$|E
500|$|Since Titanic's wreck was {{discovered}} in 1985, radical changes have been observed in the marine ecosystem around the ship. The 1996 expedition recorded 75 per cent more brittle stars and sea cucumbers than Ballard's 1985 expedition, while crinoids and sea squirts had taken root all over the sea bed. Red krill had appeared and an unknown organism had built numerous nests across the seabed from black pebbles. The amount of rusticles on the ship had increased greatly. Curiously, the same <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> happened over about the same timescale to {{the wreck of the}} German battleship Bismarck, sunk at a depth of [...] {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic. The mud around the ship was found to contain hundreds of different species of animals. The sudden explosion of life around Titanic may be a result of an increased amount of nutrients falling from the surface, possibly a result of human overfishing eliminating fish that would otherwise have consumed the nutrients.|$|E
500|$|XF-104 53-7787 {{was lost}} on 14 April 1955 after accumulating over 1,000 flying hours when test pilot Herman Salmon {{was forced to}} eject during gun firing trials at [...] The gun malfunctioned during a test firing, and severe {{vibrations}} began to build up which knocked loose the ejection hatch below the cockpit. Cabin pressure was lost with Salmon's pressure suit inflating and covering his face {{so that he could}} not see. Recalling LeVier's harrowing experience with the exploding cannon shell the previous December, Salmon believed that the same <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> happened to him and that he had no option but to eject. He later found out that he could have saved 53-7787 by bringing it down to a lower altitude and waiting for his pressure suit to deflate. With the loss of the armament testbed, Lockheed engineers were forced to find an alternative, and armament trials were continued on a modified Lockheed F-94C Starfire. The two XF-104s amassed an approximate total of 2,500 flight hours.|$|E

500|$|On {{hearing of}} the Dutch show of force, {{aboriginal}} tribes from further afield decided to submit to Dutch rule, either through fear of Dutch military might or hope that such an alliance would prove beneficial to the tribe. Representatives came from Pangsoia (Pangsoya; modern-day Linbian, Pingtung), 100km to the south, to ally themselves with the VOC. The Dutch decided to hold a landdag (a grand convention) to welcome all the villages into the fold and impress them with Dutch largesse and power. This duly took place on 22 February 1636, with 28 villages represented from southern and central Formosa. The governor presented the attendees with robes and staffs of state to symbolise their position, and Robert Junius wrote that [...] "it was delightful to see the friendliness of these people when they {{met for the first}} time, to notice how they kissed each other and gazed at one another. Such a <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> never before been witnessed in this country, as one tribe was nearly always waging war against another." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-1932 Nordisk folkereisning i Norge {{was forced}} to confirm that even though Quisling {{remained}} in the cabinet, he would not {{become a member of}} the party. They further stated that the party programme had no basis in fascism of any kind, including the National Socialism model. This did not dampen criticism of Quisling, who remained constantly in the headlines, although he was gradually earning a reputation as a disciplined and efficient administrator. After he was attacked in his office by a knife-wielding assailant who threw ground pepper in his face on 2 February 1932, some newspapers, instead of focusing on the attack itself, suggested that the assailant had been the jealous husband of one of Quisling's cleaners; others, especially those aligned with the Labour Party, posited that the whole <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> been staged. In November 1932, Labour politician Johan Nygaardsvold put this theory to Parliament, prompting suggestions that charges of slander be brought against him. No charges were brought, and the identity of the assailant has never been confirmed. Quisling later indicated it was an attempt to steal military papers recently left by Swedish Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm Kleen. The so-called [...] "pepper affair" [...] served to polarise opinion about Quisling, and government fears grew concerning reasonably open Soviet elements in Norway who had been active in promoting industrial unrest.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> just happened to him".|$|E
