Kratos can now rapidly switch among the four primary weapons in battle, continuing the same attack combination. Other extra features include the addition of ten Godly Possessions, often hidden near defeated foes and providing additional abilities (e.g., unlimited magic) during bonus play. <b>The</b> <b>challenge</b> mode in this game is called <b>the</b> <b>Challenge</b> of Olympus (seven trials) and is unlocked after the game's completion.
