5|$|Though Stowell's {{hypothesis}} was incorrect, his article rekindled {{interest in the}} Jack the Ripper case, and in 1973 the BBC launched a television series, Jack the Ripper, which investigated the Whitechapel murders. The series mixed documentary and drama; it featured real evidence but was hosted by fictional detectives Barlow and Watt, played by Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor, respectively. The series {{was made into a}} book, The Ripper File, by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd in 1975. The sixth and final programme included a testimony by Joseph Gorman, who called himself Joseph Sickert and claimed to be the illegitimate son of noted painter Walter Sickert. Gorman claimed that Sickert had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> story that implicated not only the royal family but also a host of other famous people in the murders. According to Gorman, Gull committed the murders with the help of accomplices. Stowell had mentioned rumours implicating Gull in his article, but had dismissed them as unfair and false.|$|E

A second tape was played for Pickton, in which an associate named Andrew Bellwood said Pickton mentioned killing prostitutes by handcuffing and strangling them, then bleeding and gutting them before feeding them to pigs.|$|E

500|$|Holloway began {{regularly}} performing monologues, both {{on stage}} and on record, in 1928, with his own creation, Sam Small, in Sam, Sam, Pick oop thy Musket. Over the following years, he recorded more than 20monologues based around the character, most of which he wrote himself. He created Sam Small after Henson had returned from a tour of northern England and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> story about an insubordinate old soldier from the Battle of Waterloo. Holloway developed the character, naming him after a Cockney friend of Henson called Annie Small; the name Sam was chosen at random. Holloway adopted a northern accent for the character. The Times commented, [...] "For absolute delight... {{there is nothing to}} compare with Mr. Stanley Holloway's monologue, concerning a military contretemps on the eve of Waterloo... perfect, even to the curled moustache and the Lancashire accent of the stubborn Guardsman hero." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice's previous albums, such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin. The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross and I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of things that}} happened to me in the past. It was like, really deep conversation, and he was like, you should write about that. And I was like, dude, I didn't want people to judge me for that. But he was right. It was like total therapy." ...|$|E

500|$|The series {{features}} numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> couple of things that have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E
500|$|On , Bloody Disgusting {{reported}} that Kevin Greutert, {{the editor of}} the first five films in the franchise, would make his directorial debut with Saw VI. Newcomer to the series, Andrew Coutts replaced him as editor for the film. Saw VI marked David Armstrong's last time to serve as cinematographer of the series. Mark Burg and Oren Koules again served as producers, with James Wan and Leigh Whannell, creators of the series, executive producing. Charlie Clouser was brought back to compose the score. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, writers of Saw IV and Saw V, returned to write the sixth installment. Melton said that the film had good pacing and a resolution for the series. Greutert commented that Saw VI would have some finality to it, something he always wanted to see in the series. During the early planning stage for the script it was suggested that Mandylor's character, Detective Hoffman, should take on the mafia, but the idea was quickly dismissed as not [...] "feeling Saw enough". [...] Greutert said in a Demon FM interview that Lionsgate <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> week before filming, that Saw VI would be post-converted into 3D. Greutert was upset by this, since the film he envisioned was a 2D film, aesthetically. The plans were later abandoned due to time restraints.|$|E

2500|$|One evening, Haida <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> strange {{story about}} his father: {{when he was}} a college student, he took a leave from his studies and worked in a secluded hot-springs inn where he met man who called himself Midorikawa (whose name {{contains}} [...] "Green"), a jazz pianist from Tokyo who was incredibly talented: [...] "His playing had the power to physically and viscerally move the listener, to transport you to another world." [...] One evening, Midorikawa <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> strange story about himself: one month ago, he had willingly accepted a [...] "death token" [...] condemning him to die two months later unless he could pass it on to another volunteer, but despite his talent he was tired of his life : this near-death experience had opened for him [...] "the doors of perception", making his last weeks more wonderful than the decades he was giving up, and it also made him able to see the color aura of people. During these tales, Tsukuru sometimes felt a sort of confusion between himself, Haida, his father, and Midorikawa.|$|E

It would have ended his career and she wasn't the right woman for him. Do you understand what I'm saying son?" [...] to which Clark nodded affirmatively.

2500|$|While convincing Philip Baker Hall to do {{the film}} by {{explaining}} {{the significance of the}} rain of frogs, the actor <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> story about {{when he was in the}} mountains of Italy and got caught in bad weather—a mix of rain, snow and tiny frogs. Hall had to pull off the road until the storm passed. According to an interview, Hall said that he based the character of Jimmy Gator on real-life TV personalities such as Bob Barker and Arthur Godfrey. The rain of frogs was inspired by the works of Charles Fort and Anderson claims that he was unaware that it was also a reference in The Bible when he first wrote the sequence. At the time the filmmaker came across the notion of a rain of frogs, he was [...] "going through a weird, personal time", and he started to understand [...] "why people turn to religion in times of trouble, and maybe my form of finding religion was reading about rains of frogs and realizing that makes sense to me somehow".|$|E
2500|$|At the front, Orwell {{was shot}} through the throat by a sniper on 20 May 1937 and nearly killed. He wrote in Homage to Catalonia that people {{frequently}} <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> man who is hit through the neck and survives is the luckiest creature alive, but that he personally thought [...] "it would be even luckier not to be hit at all." [...] After having his wounds dressed at a first aid post {{about half a mile}} from the front line, he was transferred to Barbastro and then to Lérida, where he received only an external treatment of his wound. On the 27th he was transferred to Tarragona, and on the 29th from there to Barcelona. On 23 June 1937, Orwell and Eileen, with John McNair and Stafford Cottman, a young English POUM militaman, boarded the morning train from Barcelona to Paris. They safely crossed into France. Sir Richard Rees later wrote that the strain of her experience in Barcelona showed clearly on Eileen's face: [...] "In Eileen Blair I had seen {{for the first time the}} symptoms of a human being living under a political terror." [...] On 13 July 1937, a deposition was presented to the Tribunal for Espionage & High Treason, Valencia, charging the Orwells with 'rabid Trotskyism' and being agents of the POUM.|$|E
