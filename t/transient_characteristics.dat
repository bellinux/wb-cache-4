6000|$|There is, however, {{quite another}} {{direction}} in which the congestion may find relief, and {{that is in the}} [...] "regulation" [...] of the traffic. This has already begun in London in an attack on the crawling cab and in the new bye-laws of the London County Council, whereby certain specified forms of heavy traffic are prohibited the use of the streets between ten and seven. These things may be the first beginning of a process of restriction that may go far. Many people living at the present time, who have grown up amidst the exceptional and possibly very <b>transient</b> <b>characteristics</b> of this time, will be disposed to regard the traffic in the streets of our great cities {{as a part of the}} natural order of things, and as unavoidable as the throng upon the pavement. But indeed the presence of all the chief constituents of this vehicular torrent--the cabs and hansoms, the vans, the omnibuses--everything, indeed, except the few private carriages--are as novel, as distinctively things of the nineteenth century, as the railway train and the needle telegraph. The streets of the great towns of antiquity, the streets of the great towns of the East, the streets of all the mediæval towns, were not intended for any sort of wheeled traffic at all--were designed primarily and chiefly for pedestrians. So it would be, I suppose, in any one's ideal city. Surely Town, in theory at least, is a place one walks about as one walks about a house and garden, dressed with a certain ceremonious elaboration, safe from mud and the hardship and defilement of foul weather, buying, meeting, dining, studying, carousing, seeing the play. It is the growth in size of the city that has necessitated the growth of this coarser traffic that has made [...] "Town" [...] at last so utterly detestable.|$|E

Both the steady-state and <b>transient</b> thermal <b>characteristic</b> of a multiplier chip are analyzed by solving the heat equation via the 3 D finite element method, {{taking into account the}} temperature-dependent material properties. The result shows that the multiplier chips exhibit thermal resistances in the order of 10 3 K/W and thermal time-constants in the order of milliseconds. The analysis also indicates that bonding agents with a better thermal conductivity is required in order to fully exploit benefits of the heat spreader.
