40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{wind tunnel}} test to evaluate the effects of Individual Blade Control (IBC) on the performance, vibration, noise and loads of a UH- 60 A rotor was recently completed in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel [1]. A key component of this {{wind tunnel test}} was an automatic rotor <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that allowed the rotor trim state to be set more precisely, quickly and repeatably than was possible with the rotor operator setting the trim condition manually. The <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> was also able to maintain the desired trim condition through changes in IBC actuation both in open- and closed-loop IBC modes, and through long-period transients in wind tunnel flow. This ability of the <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> to automatically set and maintain a steady rotor trim enabled the effects of different IBC inputs to be compared at common trim conditions and to perform these tests quickly without requiring the rotor operator to re-trim the rotor.

The <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> allowed rotor trim to be set more quickly, precisely and repeatably than in previous wind tunnel tests. This control system also allowed the rotor trim state to be maintained during transients and drift in wind tunnel flow, and through changes in IBC actuation. The ability to maintain a consistent rotor trim state was key to quickly and accurately evaluating the effect of IBC on rotor performance, vibration, noise and loads. This paper presents details of the design {{and implementation of the}} <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> including the rotor system hardware, trim control requirements, and trim control hardware and software implementation.

In order to synthesize the PID-controller, two problems were solved: a new method of synthesizing a robust controller was developed and a mathematical model of an underwater vehicle motion process was derived.

Many different attitude <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> have been designed for Solar Sails {{taking advantage of the}} centre-of-mass(cm) /centre-of- pressure(cp) offset. Most of these proposed systems are at best theoretical and have not been demonstrated. In this paper we build upon a previous proposed scalable bus-based attitude <b>control</b> <b>system</b> for solar sails, which utilised a <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> mass actuator to change the centre of mass and highly reective panels to create a windmill torque, achieving 3 -axis control. As part of testing the proposed system, we have built and demonstrated a <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> mass actuation mechanism for solar sails, taking advantage of an air-bearing table to achieve a virtually frictionless attitude test environment.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a moving mass <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> for maneuvering axisymmetric reentry vehicles. The moving mass trim controller is composed of three equal masses that are independently positioned in order to deliver a desired center of mass position. For a slowly spinning reentry vehicle, the mass offset creates a trim angle-of-attack to generate modest flight path corrections. The control system must maintain the desired position of each mass in the face of large disturbances. A novel algorithm for determining the desired mass positions is developed in conjunction with a preliminary controller design. The controller design is based on classical frequency domain techniques where a bound on the disturbance magnitude is used to formulate the disturbance rejection problem. Simulation results for the controller are presented for a typical reentry vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Trim defines {{conditions}} for both design and analysis based on aircraft models. In fact, we often define these analysis points more broadly than the conditions normally associated with trim conditions to facilitate that analysis or design. In simulations, these analysis points establish initial conditions comparable to flight conditions. Based on aerodynamic and propulsion systems models of an aircraft, trim analysis {{can be used}} to provide the data needed to define the operating envelope or the performance characteristics. Linear models are typically derived at <b>trim</b> points. <b>Control</b> <b>systems</b> are designed and evaluated at points defined by trim conditions. And these trim conditions provide us a starting point for comparing one model against another, one implementation of a model against another implementation of the same model, and the model to flight-derived data. In this paper we define what we mean by trim, examine a variety of trim conditions that have proved useful and derive the equations defining those trim conditions. Finally we present a general approach to trim through constrained minimization of a cost function based on the nonlinear, six-degree-of freedom state equations coupled with the aerodynamic and propulsion system models.

40|$|The current {{generation}} of Airbus long-range civil transport aircraft actively control the centre of gravity of the aircraft by adjusting the fuel distribution between the horizontal tail surface and the forward tanks in order to minimise cruise drag. Here, it is proposed that the current on-off control method could {{be replaced by a}} variable flow rate, provided by a variable speed centrifugal pump. The impacts of this at the aircraftlevelintermsof cruisefuelburnreduction,valveoperationcycle reductionand power consumption are investigated here using an extension to an existing fuel system simulationpackage and ageneric aircraftfuel systemdefinition. Itis shownthat using such a control system reduces fuel burn and the number of valve cycles, which could translate into a reduction in operating costs. The benefit of changing the controller to use tailplane trim angle directly rather than inferred centre of gravity position is assessed, and is shown to further reduce the fuel burn. It is suggested that such centre of gravity could provide significant benefits over the existing method. Steady-state anddynamic models ofcentrifugalpumps,ACinductiondrives andtypical aircraft fuel system pipework components are developed. These are validated against experimentaldatafrom a test rig of a representative system. Test rig simulation results areshowntoagreewell with thosefromexperimentation. Anewsecondary noisesource is developed for the dynamic analysis of the centrifugal pump, and a new acoustic experimental method is developed for the prediction of fluid inductance in pipework components.

RCR aims to improve the efficiency of wood-fired, thermal-oil heating plants by {{using a combination of}} carbon monoxide monitoring and oxygen <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> to automatically adjust the excess air setpoint. Heating plants require the correct amount of oxygen for combustion. Too little excess air does not allow complete combustion, producing a loss in efficiency and wasted fuel.
