40|$|A <b>two-control</b> {{volume is}} {{employed}} for honeycomb-stator/smooth-rotor seals, with a conventional control-volume {{used for the}} through flow and a 'capacitance accumulator' model for the honeycomb cells. The control volume for the honeycomb cells is shown to cause a dramatic reduction in the effective acoustic velocity of the main flow, dropping the lowest acoustic frequency into the frequency range of interest for rotordynamics. In these circumstances, the impedance functions for the seals can not be modeled with conventional (frequency-independent) stiffness, damping, and mass coefficients. More general transfer functions are required {{to account for the}} reaction forces, and calculated here as a lead-lag term for the direct force function and a lag term for the cross-coupled function. These first order functions are simple compared to transfer functions for magnetic bearings or foundations, For synchronous response to imbalance, they can be approximated by running-speed-dependent stiffness and damping coefficients in conventional rotordynamic codes.

Five new techniques (mismatch estimation, uncertainty weighting, finite dimensional inverse, maximum difficulty, dual Lyapunov) were developed. Six existing techniques (additive noise, minimax, multiplant, sensitivity vector augmentation, state dependent noise, residualization) and the mismatch estimation and uncertainty weighting techniques were synthesized and evaluated on the design example. Evaluation and comparison of these six techniques indicated that the minimax and the uncertainty weighting techniques were superior to the other six, and of these two, uncertainty weighting has lower computational requirements. Techniques based on the three remaining new concepts appear promising and are recommended for further research...|$|E
40|$|Different {{studies on}} dietary intake of {{antioxidants}} {{are reported in}} human and showed the improvement of semen quality not only in hypofertile patient but also in healthy men. The reason behind the usage of antioxidant supplements {{in the treatment of}} male infertility {{lies in the fact that}} the spermatozoa are very much susceptible to oxidative stress-induced damage. (1) The effect of dietary supplementation with nutriceuticals plants is receiving increasing attention in the scientific community but little or no data are available on the potential influence on sperm quality in horses. In others mammals, feeding of maca (Lepydium Meyenii) has been demonstrated to positively affect sperm production and quality. (2) In the present study, we investigated the effects of adding maca to the diet of breeding stallions on the motility and acrosome integrity of semen. Starting in May 2014 the diet of two stallions (1 fertile and 1 hypofertile) but not of <b>two-control</b> stallions (1 fertile and 1 hypofertile) was supplemented with maca (20 g/day) for a total of 60 days.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). We {{introduce}} an efficient scheme for quantum state transfer that uses a parity-based mirror inversion technique. We design efficient circuits for implementing mirror inversion in Ising sigma(X) sigma(X) and sigma(Y) sigma(Y) coupled systems and show how to analytically solve for system parameters to implement the operation in these systems. The key feature of our scheme is a three-qubit parity gate, which we design as a <b>two-control</b> one-target qubit gate. The parity gate operation is implemented by only varying a single control parameter of the system Hamiltonian {{and the difficulty of}} implementing this gate is equivalent to that of a controlled-NOT gate in a two-qubit system. By applying a sequence of N + 1 parity-based controlled-unitary operations between nearest-neighbor qubits, where all qubits in an N-qubit chain function either as controls or targets, we are able to reverse the order of all qubits along the array. These operations are accomplished by varying only a single control parameter per data qubit. The control parameter depends on the physical system under consideration and on the choice of the designer. Since every qubit participates in the mirror-inversion process functioning either as a control or target, all nearest-neighbor couplings are used. Therefore, we do not need additional measures to cancel the effect of any unwanted interactions and the quantum cost of our scheme does not increase in systems that do not have the ability shut off couplings. Moreover, our scheme does not require additional ancillas, nor does it use a pre-engineered mirror-periodic Hamiltonian to govern the evolution of the system. Using our mirror inversion scheme, we also show how to implement a SWAP gate between two arbitrary remote qubits, move a block of qubits, and implement efficient computing between two remote qubits in nearest-neighbor layouts.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Purpose: The Purpose of this {{research}} was to design, implement and evaluate a patient centered asthma intervention pilot program directed by physicians and administered by community pharmacists to a group of Managed Care contracted Oregon Health Plan asthmatics. The evaluation was to determine if the proposed intervention could improve the enrolled asthma patient's related education and quality of life while simultaneously creating economic benefit for the sponsoring health plan. Methods: The study was designed to be a prospective, six month pre and posttest quasi-experimental evaluation combined with a Solomon-like <b>two-control</b> group comparison. All patients in the sponsoring health plan twelve years of age and older who had six months of continuous enrollment were eligible. Enrollment of the target patients was voluntary and the time period of the evaluation (November, 1997 to May, 1998) was purposely conducted to capture the notoriously difficult asthma trigger cold and allergy seasons. Information regarding the cost and frequency of pre and post emergency room visits, hospitalizations, physician's office and medications use and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) was collected for the intervention group and control group. Satisfaction information for the major actors was collected and analyzed at posttest. Within group comparisons were conducted using the paired T-test and the unpaired T-test was used for between group comparison. Results: Patients in the intervention group who had their physician and pharmacist fully participate in respectively directing and administering the study protocol showed associated improvements in their quality of life measures. Economic benefit to the health plan is suggested by a cost benefit ratio of 1 : 5. 71 resulting from favorable decreases in health care related resources and improved asthma related medication utilization. Analysis of the satisfaction measures suggests that all the major participants were very satisfied with the intervention. Conclusion: Even though the sample size in this pilot study was relatively small, the resulting information should not be immediately discounted. The evidence suggests that in those cases where the study protocol was followed, favorable economic, HRQL and satisfaction is comparable to larger, previously conducted studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{high-pressure}} centrifugal compressors, honeycomb seals {{are often}} used as replacements for labyrinth seals to enhance dynamic stability. A concern exists {{with the loss of}} this enhanced stability if the honeycomb cavities become clogged with debris over time. So, as a first objective, static and dynamic tests were conducted on a constant-clearance honeycomb and a constant-clearance smooth-bore seal under three inlet preswirl conditions {{to determine the effects of}} inlet preswirl. The resulting leakage flowrate and dynamic parameters, effective stiffness and damping of the seal, were measured for each seal and then compared, with the smooth-bore seal representing the honeycomb seal with completely clogged cells. The second objective was to evaluate a <b>two-control</b> volume theory by Kleynhans and Childs with the measured data under the influence of preswirl. Both seals have a 114. 7 mm bore with a radial clearance of 0. 2 mm from the test rotor. The honeycomb seal has a cell width of 0. 79 mm and cell depth of 3. 2 mm. The target test matrix for each preswirl setting consisted of three exit-to-inlet pressure ratios of 15 %, 35 %, and 50 %, and three rotor speeds out to 20, 200 rpm. The target inlet air pressure was 70 bar-a. Experimental results show that, for a clean honeycomb seal, preswirl has little effect on effective stiffness, Keff*, and decreases effective damping, Ceff*, by about 20 % at the high inlet preswirl ratio (~ 0. 6). However, comparing smooth and honeycomb seal results at higher inlet preswirl shows a potential reduction in Keff* by up to 68 %, and a large drop and shift in positive Ceff* values, which could cause an instability in the lower frequency range. Measured leakage shows a potential increase of about 80 %, regardless of test conditions. A swirl brake at the seal entrance would fix this loss in stability by significantly reducing inlet preswirl. The two-control-volume theory model by Kleynhans and Childs seems to follow the frequency-dependent experimental data well for the honeycomb seal. Theory predicts conservatively (under-predicts) for stability parameters such as k* and Ceff* and for leakage. Predictions for K and Keff may possibly be improved with better measured friction factor coefficients for each seal...|$|E
