40|$|The most {{fundamental}} problem in information retrieval {{is that of}} interpreting information needs of users, typically expressed in a short query. Using the surface level representation of the query is especially unsatisfactory when the information needs are topic specific such as ``US politics'' or ``Space Science'', that seem <b>to</b> <b>require</b> <b>understanding</b> of what the query mean rather than what it is. We suggest that a newly proposed semantic representation of Words (GabrilovichMa 2007) {{can be used to}} support Conceptual Search. Namely, it allows retrieving documents on a given topic even when existing keyword-based search approaches fail. The method we develop allows us to categorize and retrieve documents topically on-the-fly, without looking at the data collection ahead of time, without knowing a-priori the topics of interest and without training topic categorization classifiers. We compare our approach experimentally to state-of-the-art IR techniques and to machine learning based text categorization techniques and demonstrate significant improvement in performance. Moreover, as we show, our method is intrinsically adaptable to new text collections and domains...|$|E

Addressing disaster-induced mobility <b>to</b> promote resilience <b>requires</b> <b>understanding</b> how moving is part of household-level coping strategies in anticipation of and in response to environmental shocks and stresses (Scheffran et al. 2012), and it implies looking at the potential of promoting (further) mobility, of affected households or some of their members, as a possible option for achieving safer living conditions and better access to resources and opportunities (Murray and Williamson 2011). This complements traditional options for addressing displacement through voluntary return, local integration, and relocation of people out of disaster affected areas (IASC 2011).|$|R
30|$|An {{increase}} in seed production following fire in some rhizomatous monocot species {{has been linked}} to post-fire colonization of burned sites (Lamont and Runciman 1993). This effect is not limited to monocots. For example, Hartnett and Richardson (1989) found evidence that seed rain from Florida lady’s nightcap (Bonamia grandiflora) was 10 to 30 times greater after a fire, an increase they ascribed to increased stem densities from both asexual growth and new genet recruitment from seed in the year after fire. Survival of tissue for asexual growth, however, depends in part on fuel size, surrounding fuels, and the season of burn (Monsanto and Agee 2008). Understanding vegetation responses <b>to</b> fire therefore <b>requires</b> <b>understanding</b> propagule dispersal and production, as well as fire conditions.|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} immobility of foam in porous media suppresses {{the formation}} of fingers during oil displacement leading to a more stable displacement which is desired in various processes such as Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) or soil remediation practices. Various parameters may influence the efficiency of foam-assisted oil displacement such as properties of oil, the permeability and heterogeneity of the porous medium and physical and chemical characteristics of foam. In the present work, we have conducted a comprehensive series of experiments using customised Hele-Shaw cells filled with either water or oil to describe the effects of foam quality, permeability of the cell {{as well as the}} injection rate on the apparent viscosity of foam which is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> investigate foam displacement. Our results reveal the significant impact of foam texture and bubble size on the foam apparent viscosity. Foams with smaller bubble sizes have a higher apparent viscosity. This statement only applies (strictly speaking) when the foam quality is constant. However, wet foams with smaller bubbles may have lower apparent viscosity compared to dry foams with larger bubbles. Furthermore, our results show the occurrence of more stable foam-water fronts as foam quality decreases. Besides, the complexity of oil displacement by foam as well as its destabilizing effects on foam displacement has been discussed. Our results extend the physical understanding of foam-assisted liquid displacement in Hele-Shaw cell which is a step <b>to</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> the foam flow behaviour in more complex systems such as porous media...|$|R

Policy responses <b>to</b> corruption <b>require</b> an <b>understanding</b> of the effects of corruption and the determinants of these effects. The fact which appears to have a strong effect in determining the harmfulness of corruption is the balance of power between the state and its clients.

Their true nature and relationship <b>to</b> prominences <b>requires</b> <b>understanding</b> their magnetic structure and dynamic properties. Recently, a controversy has arisen: is the magnetic field organized forming vertical, helical structures or is it dominantly horizontal? And concerning their dynamics, are tornadoes really rotating {{or is it just}} a visual illusion? Here, we analyze four consecutive spectropolarimetric scans of a prominence hosting tornadoes on its legs which help us shed some light on their magnetic and dynamical properties. We show that the magnetic field is very smooth in all the prominence, probably an intrinsic property of the coronal field. The prominence legs have vertical helical fields that show slow temporal variation probably related to the motion of the fibrils. Concerning the dynamics, we argue that 1) if rotation exists, it is intermittent, lasting no more than one hour, and 2) the observed velocity pattern is also consistent with an oscillatory velocity pattern (waves).

Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars. Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.|$|R
40|$|A neuromechanical {{approach}} <b>to</b> control <b>requires</b> <b>understanding</b> how mechanics {{alters the}} potential of neural feedback to control body dynamics. Here, we rewrite activation of individual motor units of a behaving animal to mimic the effects of neural feedback without concomitant changes in other muscles. We target a putative control muscle in the cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis (L.), and simultaneously capture limb and body dynamics through high-speed videography and a micro-accelerometer backpack. We test four neuromechanical control hypotheses. We supported the hypothesis that mechanics linearly translates neural feedback into accelerations and rotations during static postural control. However, during running, the same neural feedback produced a nonlinear acceleration control potential restricted to the vertical plane. Using this, we reject the hypothesis from previous work that this muscle acts primarily to absorb energy from the body. The conversion of the control potential is paralleled by nonlinear changes in limb kinematics, supporting the hypothesis that significant mechanical feedback filters the graded neural feedback for running control. Finally, we insert the same neural feedback signal but at different phases in the dynamics. In this context, mechanical feedback enables turning by changing the timing {{and direction of the}} accelerations produced by the graded neural feedback...|$|R
40|$|After the Chernobyl {{nuclear reactor}} {{accident}} in April 1986, Cs- 137 {{was found to}} be one of the most abundant radionuclides released and the forest ecosystem was one of the most contaminated environments. Long-term management of the forests to minimize the radiation dose <b>to</b> man <b>requires</b> <b>understanding</b> of the cycles of the Cs- 137 and the other radionuclides which were also deposited. Thus, the health physicists responsible for remediation programs in the contaminated zones must have information on the long-term behaviour of the deposited radioactivity. The similarity between the chemical properties of Cs and K and the fact that K has been studied previously as a nutrient in forest productivity may provide an analogue to evaluate the long-term mechanism of the deposited radioactivity. One of the goals of this study is to describe the global cycle of K in forests related to the Cs- 137 contaminant. The first results of an experimental program to measure the deposition of Cs- 137 in the several forest compartments is presented, together with the complementary K results. These data provide information which is necessary to construct a useable model describing the Cs- 137 -transfer after atmospheric contamination of a woodland ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|The {{feedbacks}} {{between the}} water and the carbon cycles are of critical importance to global carbon balances. Forests and forest soils in northern latitudes are important carbon pools because of their potential as sinks for atmospheric carbon. However there are significant unknowns related to the effects of hydrologic variability, mountainous terrain, and landscape heterogeneity in controlling soil carbon dioxide (CO 2) efflux. Mountainous terrain imposes large spatial heterogeneity in the biophysical controls of soil CO 2 production and efflux, including soil temperature, soil water content, vegetation, substrate, and soil physical properties. Further complications are introduced by the superimposed temporal heterogeneity (i. e., the asynchronous response of each variable to changes in environmental conditions).
