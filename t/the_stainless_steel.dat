40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to discuss the {{microstructural}} evolution and mechanical property of the weld metal in <b>the</b> dissimilar <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> during <b>the</b> gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process.

5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called {{stainless}} steel, {{now known as}} martensitic stainless steel. The Patent Office rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without <b>the</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E

40|$|In this report, the {{relation}} between the oxide formation and the pickling behaviour of duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> is investigated. A duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> 2205 (EN 1. 4462), and two single phases, ferritic and austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> with <b>the</b> same composition as the phases inside the 2205, have been annealed. The surface and composition of the oxide have been analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDS), focused ion beam (FIB) and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES). The thickness of the oxide scales increased when the annealing time and temperature were increased. <b>The</b> ferritic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> has <b>the</b> thickest oxide, whereas the austenitic has the thinnest one. Nodules {{in the middle of the}} grains and thick oxides on the grain boundaries are observed on <b>the</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> but also in a lower content on the austenitic phase of duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> <b>The</b> oxide scale on the 2205 is not homogenous, showing different types of oxide depending on the phase. The pickling behaviour of the same samples is also reviewed: oxide surface study and relative weight loss is discussed. <b>The</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> has <b>the</b> highest pickling rate, followed by the 2205 and <b>the</b> ferritic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> respectively. <b>The</b> oxide on <b>the</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> is spalled from the surface mostly on the zones where nodules are placed, whereas the oxide on <b>the</b> ferritic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> is dissolved during the process.

The existence of thicker oxide on the top of grain boundaries, iron-enriched nodules with a porous structure, thick chromium depleted region and non protective silicon oxide could be attributed to the faster pickling rate on <b>the</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and <b>the</b> austenitic phase regions on the 2205.

40|$|When {{hydrogen}} atoms penetrate into <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> hydrogen embrittlement sometimes occurs.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} laser surface melting (LSM) on {{intergranular}} corrosion behaviour of aged austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> (UNS S 30400, S 31603, S 32100 and S 34700) and aged duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> (UNS S 31803 and S 32950) were investigated. LSM of <b>the</b> aged <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> was carried out using a 2. 5. kW CW Nd:YAG laser. The microstructure of <b>the</b> aged <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> after LSM depends on their compositions. After LSM, <b>the</b> aged austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> mainly contain austenite (γ) with some ferrite (δ) as the minor phase, but the carbide phases are completely eliminated. For <b>the</b> aged duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> after LSM, δ becomes the major phase and the δ/γ phase balance is disturbed, whereas the sigma (σ) phase is eliminated. The degree of sensitization (DOS) and corrosion morphology of <b>the</b> aged <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> before and after LSM were determined by the double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) using a potentiostat and SEM observation, respectively.

In this report 316 L and <b>the</b> duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> 2205, 2304 and LDX 2404 have been compared according to corrosion resistance, strength, manufacturing aspects and prices. The steels arranged by increasing corrosion resistance: 316 L < 2304 < LDX 2404 < 2205. The steels arranged by increasing strength (considering the thickness of the plates needed for construction) : 316 L < 2304 < LDX 2404 and 2205.

25|$|The {{unpainted}} stainless body creates challenges during {{restoration of}} the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original ("straight") as possible and imperfections are sculpted back to form with body filler like Bondo or lead (body solder). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the quarter panel). With an unpainted stainless body, <b>the</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain—which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to work-harden. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired; each DeLorean service center today {{has at least one}} experienced body repair person on staff, and there are decades worth of new stainless panels still available in most instances.|$|E
