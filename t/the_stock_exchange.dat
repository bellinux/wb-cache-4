5|$|Allen did {{not feel}} suited to working in a {{department}} store, and on his return home took {{a job with the}} stockbroking company David Bevan and Co. Consequently, he played little cricket in 1933. He planned to be unavailable for the Test matches against the West Indies, but Larwood was injured and Voce out of form, so he was persuaded to play in the first Test. He played little thereafter that season and declined an invitation to tour India with an MCC team. In three games that season, he scored 199 runs and took 13 wickets. That December, he was elected as a member of <b>the</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange.</b>|$|E
5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company.

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Christian IV between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had {{dramatic}} growth as a city. On his initiative {{at the beginning of}} the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on Slotsholmen: the Tøjhus Arsenal and Børsen, <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchange.</b> To foster international trade, the East India Company was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of Christianshavn with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen. Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including Rosenborg Slot and the Rundetårn. In 1658–59, the city withstood a siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault.|$|E

Many of these vessels were purpose-built for the company's needs, and were constructed at shipyards both within Australia and abroad. The company's eventual demise came {{as a result of a}} number of factors, including increased competition from road and rail, the cost of replacing ships after World War II, waterfront disputes and rising costs. As a consequence, after almost 100 years in operation, the company was placed into voluntary receivership and was delisted from <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> in 1955.|$|E

Sunde reallocated his ownership and created Color Group, that would wholly own both Color Line, Scandi Line, Larvik Line and Color Air.

In the general meeting held in December, two of the largest owners of Color Line, Vital Forsikring and the Government Pension Fund of Norway, both were opposed to the merger, as they felt the purchased companies were overvalued. Color Air {{was at the time}} valuated at NOK157 million. After a long process between the miniority shareholders and Color Group, the valuation was adjusted to NOK108 million. In May, Olav Nils Sunde bought the entire Color Group, and delisted it from <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> following the conflict with the other shareholders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Trieste, then subject to Austrian rule, the Jewish {{community}} saw positive change under Maria Theresa's rule. On 19 April 1771, Maria Theresa granted two Sovereign Licenses to the Jews of Trieste, licenses that constitute real regulations. In 1782, with the famous Edict of Tolerance, her son Joseph II admitted the Jews to some charges in <b>the</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> and to other liberal professions. A year later the Jewish primary school was opened {{with the name of}} Scuole Pie Normali Israelitiche. The following year, in 1784, the gates of the Ghetto were opened so that the Jews of Trieste could live together with their fellow citizens of different religions; however most of them continued to live in the Ghetto. Maria Theresa's influence and personal prejudices were limited by the 1780s, and the Jews of Trieste lived in relative peace until the beginning of French rule in the region.|$|E
5|$|McCay {{became the}} sixth Minister for Defence in four years. His predecessor, Senator Anderson Dawson, had chaired a {{committee}} that had produced a detailed report recommending {{the abolition of}} the post of General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces {{and the creation of a}} Council of Defence, a Naval Board and a Military Board. It fell to McCay to implement the report's recommendations and create a five-man Military Board consisting of himself, a finance member and three military officers. McCay preferred the senior member not be styled the Chief of the General Staff. This change would not be made until 1909. At the first meeting of the Council of Defence, McCay rejected the arguments of Captain William Rooke Creswell for the majority of the defence budget to be spent on supporting the British fleet. In 1905 the Reid government collapsed and McCay became a backbencher once more. Since the Federal parliament sat in Parliament House, Melbourne, McCay lived at <b>the</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> Club in Collins Street, Melbourne while his family remained in Castlemaine. He maintained a liaison with a married woman, Ella Gavan Duffy.|$|E
