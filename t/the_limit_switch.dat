After returning to a horizontal position, a limit switch failed and the ride continued to spin for five to ten minutes. The park's first-aid staff treated the children, while one was transported to an area hospital by his parents; the child was not admitted, however. An investigation determined that the ride operator did not engage an emergency stop switch due to a miscommunication between her and her supervisor; the park's ride operators are trained in how to stop their rides in the event of a malfunction.

50|$|Edward E. Freeman {{invented a}} system to control a hot air furnace that uses three {{thermostatic}} switches for its operation. A room thermostat starts the stoker. Another thermostat (or limit switch) opens the stoker circuit when {{the air in the}} furnace reaches a predetermined temperature, irrespective {{of the fact that the}} room thermostat may still call for heat. This second thermostat operates to prevent unsafe conditions due to overheating. The third thermostat is also in the furnace. It controls a fan which forces hot air from the furnace to the rooms. It does not permit the fan to start until the air in the furnace reaches a specified degree of heat. But, at that point, it starts the fan, which continues to run, even though <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> has stopped the stoker, so long as the furnace is hot and the room thermostat calls for heat. The patent was on the combination patent of three thermostatic switches, not on any of the switches alone and not on the combination of the fan switch and <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E

5000|$|It must be {{held that}} Minneapolis-Honeywell has been so using its patent as to tend to create a {{monopoly}} in an unpatented device. Minneapolis-Honeywell has been licensing others and has offered to license Mercoid to manufacture, use and sell a single device which embodies within itself two elements of the Freeman patent, namely, the two thermostats which are placed in the furnace hood, one being the fan switch and the other being <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b> This device, embodying these two elements, is [...] [...] [...] an unpatented device. The Freeman patent is not a patent on either the fan switch or <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> or both of them. It is a patent on a system of furnace control, which requires three thermostats for its operation. It happens that two of those thermostats are a fan switch and a limit switch.

50|$|The torque {{switching}} is {{not only}} used for torque seating in the end position, but it also serves as overload protection over the whole travel and protects the valve against excessive torque. If excessive torque acts upon the closing element in an intermediate position, e.g. due to a trapped object, the torque switching will trip when reaching the set tripping torque. In this situation the end position is not signalled by <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switch.</b> The controls can therefore distinguish between normal operation torque switch tripping {{in one of the}} end positions and switching off in an intermediate position due to excessive torque.|$|E

When the bridge is to be opened, from the control box up at bridge deck level, the bridge operator, who is with Parks Canada, lowers all 4 gates to block traffic from entering the bridge deck. The operator withdraws the 2 wedge cylinders which brings the bridge down a few inches and balanced onto a circular rail track.

5000|$|Electric Semi-automatic label {{dispensers}} were first patented {{in the early}} 1970s. They were originally designed for multiple-row address labels for bulk mailing houses. On average a good mailing house employee could apply approximately 500 labels per hour to envelopes. The label dispenser increased this to over 2,000 per hour. These dispensers advance individual or multiple-row labels and remove them from their lining similar to a manual dispenser, but instead of manually pulling on the liner, label advancement occurs when a trigger on the dispenser detects {{the absence of a}} label, such as when the operator removes the label. The sensor then closes the circuit and engages the motor, dispensing the next label until the sensor once again detects the label which opens the circuit.The first electric dispenser was designed with <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> on the left of a 16" [...] wide machine. 4-up multiple-row labels were loaded into the machine and once activated would advance one row of labels. The operator would take the labels from right to left, so that when the leftmost label was taken, the next row advanced, automatically providing a constant supply of labels to apply. The labels are also peeled without the natural curl that will happen when pulled from the backing paper with fingers. Also, only one hand was needed to take the label, the other hand could be used to move the material the label was being applied to.|$|E

This system consists of three photovoltaic panels which will be analyzed in ME 374 Heat Power Laboratory. Students in this laboratory will examine the performance benefits of the solar panel as it tracks the sun versus when it remains at a fixed orientation. While tracking the sun, mechanical switches are used to ensure the solar panel system does not exceed <b>the</b> rotational <b>limits.</b> To find <b>the</b> correct orientation, the LabVIEW code calculates the location of the sun in terms of azimuth and elevation angles based on the date and time from the computer.

The motor-actuated vacuum door was designed to maintain a medium vacuum of the order of 0. 0001 torr or better while closed, and to provide an opening 15 inches long x 8. 5 inches wide while open for cameras to image Halley's comet. When the electric motor receives the instruction to open the door through the payload battery, timer, and relay circuit, the first operation is to unlock the door.

40|$|Quicksort is the {{preferred}} in-place sorting algorithm in many contexts, since its average computing time on uniformly distributed inputs is Θ(N log N) {{and it is in}} fact faster than most other sorting algorithms on most inputs. Its drawback is that its worst-case time bound is Θ(N). Previous attempts to protect against the worst case by improving the way quicksort chooses pivot elements for partitioning have increased the average computing time too much [...] -one might as well use heapsort, which has a Θ(N log N) worst-case time bound but is on the average 2 to 5 times slower than quicksort. A similar dilemma exists with selection algorithms (for finding the i-th largest element) based on partitioning. This paper describes a simple solution to this dilemma: limit the depth of partitioning, and for subproblems that exceed <b>the</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> to another algorithm with a better worst-case bound. Using heapsort as the "stopper" yields a sorting algorithm that is just as fast as quicksort in the average case but also has an Θ(N log N) worst case time bound. For selection, a hybrid of Hoare's find algorithm, which is linear on average but quadratic in the worst case, and the Blum-Floyd-Pratt-Rivest-Tarjan algorithm is as fast as Hoare's algorithm in practice, yet has a linear worst-case time bound.

40|$|A {{cascaded}} H-bridge multilevel inverter based {{active power}} filter {{with a novel}} direct power control is proposed in this paper. It can be directly connected to medium/high voltage power line without using the bulky transformer or passive filter. Due to <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>switching</b> frequency (typically below 1 kHz) of high-power solid-state devices (GTO/IGCT), multiple synchronous/stationary reference frame current controllers are reviewed and derived. Based on this, a novel current controller is proposed for harmonic current elimination and system power factor compensation. Furthermore, a synchronous/stationary hybrid structure can be derived with fundamental de-coupling control. The instantaneous reactive power theory and synchronous reference frame based control are compared based on mathematical models. A direct power control concept is then derived and proposed.

Shortly, <b>the</b> door closed <b>limit</b> <b>switch</b> is turned off as the door begins to rise.

40|$|Many {{applications}} {{that rely on}} organic electronic circuits still suffer from <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> <b>switching</b> speed of their basic elements - the organic thin film transistor (OTFT). For a given set of materials the OTFT speed scales inversely with {{the square of the}} channel length, the parasitic gate overlap capacitance, and the contact resistance. For maximising speed we pattern transistor channels with lengths from 10 mu m down to the sub-micrometre regime by industrially scalable UV-nanoimprint lithography. The reduction of the overlap capacitance is achieved by minimising the source-drain to gate overlap lengths to values as low as 0. 2 mu m by self-aligned electrode definition using substrate reverse side exposure. Pentacene based organic thin film transistors with an exceptionally low line edge roughness < 20 nm of the channels, a mobility of 0. 1 cm(2) /Vs, and an on-off ratio of 10 (4), are fabricated on 4 '' x 4 '' flexible substrates in a carrier-free process scheme. The stability and spatial distribution of the transistor channel lengths are assessed in detail with standard deviations of L ranging from 185 to 28 nm.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{switched}} Ethernet network that supports real-time communication with guaranteed bit rate and end-to-end delay bound. In our proposal, the source nodes use Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling, while the switch uses First Come First Served (FCFS) to control periodic real-time traffic belonging to logical real-time connections. The schedulability condition is drawn and the end-to-end worst-case delay bound is derived for guaranteed real-time traffic, which also gives, as a sub-result, the needed buffer {{space in the}} switch. Moreover, different traffic classes are prioritized and put into different output queues in the end nodes and the switch, which minimizes the interference with other traffic when transmitting periodic time-critical messages. The solution requires no additional hardware or software modifications of the switch and the underlying standard. It is based purely on software implementation in the end nodes. Furthermore, the EDF scheduling strategy used in the source nodes allows good resource utilization, while the FCFS scheduling used in <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>limits</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> processing overhead.

40|$|Electrostatically {{actuated}} beams {{are common}} elements in microelectromechanical devices {{that serve as}} high-frequency resonators, actuators, and sensors. The present effort serves to develop a comprehensive nonlinear modeling paradigm for such device elements that accounts for nonlinearities due to the electrostatic field, beam deformations, and intermittent mechanical contact. The presence of these complex aspects associated with the force field, the inherent beam behavior and the interactions with rigid obstacles calls for advanced modeling techniques that account for the finite configurational changes via geometrically exact approaches. An immediate practical application is the design of highly sensitive <b>limit</b> <b>switches</b> for use as indicators or control devices in micromechanical systems. <b>The</b> <b>limit</b> <b>switches</b> considered here rely on an abrupt transition of the internal state of the switch between two distinctly different steady-state behaviors {{as a result of}} a small change in the value of a system parameter. The present collaboration will explore a limit-switch design that relies on the abrupt transition associated with the onset of low-velocity impacts between an electrostatically actuated beam element and its environment. This is supported by theoretical predictions indicating a post-trigger response rate that grows beyond all bounds as the threshold parameter value is approached. The proposed phenomenology thus compares favorably with existing designs in terms of guaranteeing a more instantaneous switch response. The proposed research is strongly driven by a combined effort from two complementary backgrounds, that in nonlinear continuum mechanics of Prof. Lacarbonara and that in non-smooth system dynamics and bifurcation theory of Prof. Dankowicz. The outcome of this collaboration is expected to be interesting and highly fruitful to both Institutions, the University of Rome La Sapienza and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, from a transfer-of-knowledge perpective and from merely scientific and technological stanpoints.
