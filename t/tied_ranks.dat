Schreiber's {{solution to the problem of}} how to handle <b>tied</b> <b>ranks</b> is convincing, in my opinion (cf. Pudovkin & Garfield, 2009). The fractional attribution, however, is computationally intensive and cannot be done manually for even moderately large batches of documents. Schreiber attributed scores fractionally to the six percentile rank classes used in the Science and Engineering Indicators of the U. S. National Science Board, and thus missed, in my opinion, the point that fractional attribution at the level of hundred percentiles-or equivalently quantiles as the continuous random variable-is only a linear, and therefore much less complex problem. Given the quantile-values, the non-linear attribution to the six classes or any other evaluation scheme is then a question of aggregation.

Simple methods such as breaking the ties at random or using average rank introduce independence into the data and, hence, lead to biased estimation. We propose an estimation method that treats the ranks of tied data as being interval censored and maximizes a pseudo-likelihood based on interval censored pseudo-observations. A parametric bootstrap procedure that preserves the observed <b>tied</b> <b>ranks</b> in the data is adapted to assess the estimation uncertainty and perform goodness-of-fit tests.

In order to assess the variation within the community, the criteria for ranking and scoring collected from group discussions with men and women groups, were subsequently ranked and / or scored by the individuals. Three nonparametric statistical tests were compared for the analysis.

40|$|Note: Author’s version; page numbers, editing {{vary from}} {{published}} version Ranked lists are encountered {{in research and}} daily life, and it is often of interest to compare these lists, {{even when they are}} incomplete or have only some members in common. An example is document rankings returned for the same query by different search engines. A measure of the similarity between incomplete rankings should handle non-conjointness, weight high ranks more heavily than low, and be monotonic with increasing depth of evaluation; but no measure satisfying all these criteria currently exists. In this article, we propose a new measure having these qualities, namely rank-biased overlap (RBO). The RBO measure is based on a simple probabilistic user model. It provides monotonicity by calculating, at a given depth of evaluation, a base score that is non-decreasing with additional evaluation, and a maximum score that is non-increasing. An extrapolated score can be calculated between these bounds if a point estimate is required. RBO has a parameter which determines the strength of the weighting to top ranks. We extend RBO to handle <b>tied</b> <b>ranks</b> and rankings of different lengths.

40|$|In QTL {{analysis}} of non-normally distributed phenotypes, non-parametric approaches {{have been proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} the use of parametric tests on mathematically transformed data. The non-parametric interval mapping test uses random ranking to deal with ties. Another approach is to assign to each tied individual the average of the <b>tied</b> <b>ranks</b> (midranks). This approach is implemented and compared to the random ranking approach in terms of statistical power and accuracy of the QTL position. Non-normal phenotypes such as bacteria counts showing high numbers of zeros are simulated (0 - 80 % zeros). We show that, for low proportions of zeros, the power estimates are similar but, for high proportions of zeros, the midrank approach is superior to the random ranking approach. For example, with a QTL accounting for 8 % of the total phenotypic variance, a gain from 8 % to 11 % of power can be obtained. Furthermore, the accuracy of the estimated QTL location is increased when using midranks. Therefore, if non-parametric interval mapping is chosen, the midrank approach should be preferred. This test might be especially relevant for the {{analysis of}} disease resistance phenotypes such as those observed when mapping QTLs for resistance to infectious diseases...|$|E
40|$|The Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks (WMPSR) test {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{statistical}} tests used to analyze paired ordinal data in medical research. Apart from methodological problems that arise from calculating ranked differences for ordinal data, the analyzed data sets are often highly skewed (e. g. image quality ratings), leading to floor and ceiling effects that produce a large number of <b>tied</b> <b>ranks</b> and may bias the test statistic. An alternative procedure for analyzing paired ordinal data is the sign test, though it is known to be less powerful than the WMPSR test. The aim of our simulation study is to assess the appropriateness of these two tests (both exact and asymptotic) for paired ordinal data by comparing their type I error and statistical power using data simulated to conform to typical situations in a medical context. Data were simulated by modeling five different distributions and seven different effect sizes for sample sizes ranging from 10 to 100 (10 000 runs were performed for each condition). The results indicate that type I error for the WMPSR test (no matter whether asymptotic or exact) exceeds the nominal type I risk when data are positively skewed (more than 14 % for N = 100), while the WMPSR test's power is comparable to that of the asymptotic sign test under all other conditions. The exact tests generally show a lower power than the asymptotic tests, especially for sample sizes below N = 20. In general, (1) we recommend using asymptotic tests instead of exact tests to analyze paired ordinal data, and (2) the sign test should be generally preferred to the WMPSR test...|$|E

The classical Delphi procedure is the research method used {{for the conduct of}} this study. A five-member advisory board developed a list of seventeen categories under which the competencies would reside. In the first-round questionnaire, the seventeen categories were presented to a Delphi panel of experts who provided up to five competencies required in each category. The first-round returns provided two new categories and 973 competency statements. Duplications were eliminated and 366 competency statements remained in nineteen categories. The second, third, and fourth rounds were a reiterative rating process. The panel was asked to rate the items in the questionnaire based on their relative importance to the intent of the study. The importance rating scale included "very important," "important," "slightly important," and "unimportant. " The means and interquartile ranges were calculated for each statement and provided as feedback in the successive round. Kendall's coefficient of concordance W for <b>tied</b> <b>ranks</b> was used to validate the panel consensus.
