5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands <b>to</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate.

While the original Commission proposal would affect 40,000 – 50,000 firearms legally possessed by Czech citizens, Dutch EU Council Presidency proposal of 4 April 2016 would affect some 400,000 legally owned firearms, i.e. making half of all Czech legally owned firearms illegal with large proportion of gun owners likely refusing to surrender their firearms. The proposal as such is in direct contradiction with Ministry’s long-term objective of lowering of number of illegal firearms and of conducting effective supervision of firearm owners.|$|E
