50|$|Because human infections with Dicrocoelium dendriticum are so rare, {{there are}} {{multiple}} suggestions for treatment. The standard treatment is an anthelmintic such as Praziquantel, <b>Triclabendazole,</b> or Mirazid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triclabendazole</b> is {{the drug}} of choice in fasciolosis as it is highly {{effective}} against both mature and immature flukes. Artemether has been demonstrated in vitro to be equally effective. Though slightly less potent, artesunate is also useful in human fasciolosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triclabendazole,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Egaten among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat liver flukes, specifically fascioliasis and paragonimiasis. It is very effective for both conditions. Treatment in hospital may be required. It is taken by mouth with typically one or two doses being required.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects are}} {{generally}} few, but can include abdominal pain and headaches. Biliary colic may occur due to dying worms. While no harms {{have been found}} with use during pregnancy, <b>triclabendazole</b> has not been well studied in this population. It {{is a member of}} the benzimidazole family of medications for worms.|$|E
5000|$|Praziquantel {{can be used}} {{to treat}} {{individuals}} infected with P. skrjabini parasites. [...] Prazinquatal acts quickly to cure paragonimiasis, showing results after even one day, unlike the previously used drug bithionol, which required extended treatment and involved more severe side effects. [...] The latest drug being investigated to treat paragonimiasis is <b>triclabendazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most benzimidazoles are effective. Mebendazole, <b>triclabendazole</b> and {{fenbendazole}} {{are commonly}} used. Ivermectin and pyrantel pamoate are also effective. The combination of ivermectin 6 μg/kg and pyrantel pamoate at 5.0 mg/kg is 100% efficacious against adult worms in dogs. Human infection {{in case of}} cutaneous larva migrans is treated with oral thiabendazole at 500 mg in 4 daily dose.|$|E
50|$|Praziquantel {{has been}} used to {{effectively}} treat paragonimiasis by separating the tegument. An effectively complete rate of cure may be expected after three days of treatment if there has not been too much permanent damage, such as from intracranial effects. Other medications can also be used such as bithionol, niclofan, and <b>triclabendazole</b> with high cure rates.|$|E
50|$|Benzimidazoles {{are often}} bioactive. Many {{anthelmintic}} drugs (albendazole, mebendazole, <b>triclabendazole</b> etc.) {{belong to the}} benzimidazole class of compounds. Benzimidazole fungicides are commercialized. They act by binding to the fungal microtubules and stopping hyphal growth. It also binds to the spindle microtubules and blocks nuclear division..The benzimidazole opioid family includes a number of strong agents e.g. etonitazene, whose article discusses the family in some depth.|$|E
50|$|Infection is {{detected}} mainly on identification of eggs by microscopic demonstration in faeces or in duodenal aspirate. But other sophisticated {{methods have been}} developed such as ELISA, which {{has become the most}} important clinical technique. Diagnosis by detecting DNAs from eggs in faeces are also developed using PCR, real-time PCR, and LAMP, which are highly sensitive and specific. Imaging diagnosis has been studied in depth and is now widely used. Drugs used to treat infestation include <b>triclabendazole,</b> praziquantel, bithionol, albendazole, levamisole and mebendazole. However, benzimidazoles are very weak as vermicide. As with other trematodes, praziquantel is the drug of choice. Lately, tribendimidine has been acknowledged as an effective and safe drug.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the size}} of the parasite, as adult F. hepatica: 20 - 30 xx 13 mm or adult F. gigantica: 25-75×12 mm, fasciolosis is a big concern. The amount of {{symptoms}} depend on how many worms and what stage the infection is in. The death rate is significant in both sheep and cattle, but generally low among humans. Treatment with <b>triclabendazole</b> has been highly effective against the adult worms as well as various developing stages. Praziquantel is not effective, and older drugs such as bithionol are moderately effective but also cause more side effects. Secondary bacterial infection causing cholangitis has also been a concern and can be treated with antibiotics, and toxaemia may be treated with prednisolone.|$|E
50|$|Fasciolosis is an {{important}} cause of both production and economic losses in the dairy and meat industry. Over the years, the prevalence has increased {{and it is likely}} to continue increasing in the future. Livestock are often treated with Flukicides, which are chemicals toxic to flukes. The two chemicals used are <b>triclabendazole</b> and bithionol. Ivermectin, which is widely used for many helminthic parasites, has low effectivity against F. hepatica, as does praziquantel. For humans, the type of control depends on the setting. One important method is through the strict control over the growth and sales of edible water plants such as watercress. This is particularly important in highly endemic areas. Some farms are irrigated with polluted water, hence, vegetables farmed from such land should be thoroughly washed and cooked before being eaten.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{are usually}} {{visible on the}} {{behaviour}} of the host. Infected sheep and cattle become severely anorexic or digest food inefficiently and become unthrifty. Continuous diarrhoea is an obvious indication of heavy infection in the digestive system, thus a primary diagnosis. The fluid faeces are examined to identify immature flukes. Paramphistomiasis is considered a neglected tropical disease, with no prescription drug for treatment and control. Thus management of infection is based mainly on to reduce the host snail population. There are some treatment strategies demonstrated. A common regime is to drench with hexachloroethane-bentonite-water suspension, which is highly effective against adult parasites. Treatments with reported success (efficacies >90%) are resorantel, oxyclozanide, clorsulon, ivermectin and the combination of bithional and levamisole. Most important commercial anthelmintics are shown to be practically useles, including albendazole, praziquantel, nitroxynil, <b>triclabendazole,</b> profenophos and netobimin; while niclosamide has high efficacy (99%) against immature fluke but not adult fluke, and 2-tertiary-butyl benzthiazole compound (CGA 72630), hexachlorophene and resorantel are highly effective against both adult and immature flukes. An in vitro demonstration shows that plumbagin exhibits high efficacy on adult flukes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{clinical}} {{symptoms in}} cattle include a cauliflower-like growth or granuloma in the nasal cavity, {{associated with a}} [...] "snoring" [...] sound and profuse mucopurulent discharge. In the endemic areas, there are some local cattle which remain negative for S. nasale eggs, others excrete eggs but without exhibiting symptoms, while a large number exhibit symptoms with presence of the eggs in nasal discharge. A different form of nasal schistosomiasis where local cattle are negative for S. nasale but local buffaloes carry it without showing any symptoms {{has been shown to}} exist at Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh; there, cross-bred cattle exhibit snoring disease symptoms with eggs in their nasal discharge. [...] Anthiomaline was the drug of choice, but this leads to relapse of the symptoms after two months of the treatment. Praziquantel proved better than any other drug. Recently, Dr. M. C. Agrawal has successfully treated cases of nasal schistosomiasis by administering <b>triclabendazole.</b> Nevertheless, there are all chances of killing susceptible blood flukes by these less effective drugs resulting in existence of more resistant schistosome population in future generations causing more problems. Schistosoma nasale eggs are boomerang or palaquine shaped.|$|E
40|$|Fascioliasis and paragonimiasis are {{widespread}} foodborne trematode diseases, affecting {{millions of}} people in more than 75 countries.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{suggested}} that <b>triclabendazole,</b> {{a member of the}} benzimidazole group of compounds, possessed efficacy against Schistosoma mansoni. In view of recent indications in praziquantel treatment failures and loss of sensitivity, it is imperative that new anti-schistosomals are developed as contingent treatment options, while resistance alleles, if any, remain at low frequencies. While recent studies have indicated that <b>triclabendazole</b> monotherapy exert weak anti-schistosomal effects, the combinatorial application of <b>triclabendazole</b> with praziquantel has not been explored. To assess this hypothesis, <b>triclabendazole</b> and its metabolites were initially assessed against the many life-stages of Schistosoma mansoni in vitro. Combinatorial drug and isobologram analyses against adult Schistosoma mansoni was also performed, and subsequently applied against other parasitic models (Giardia duodenalis and Haemonchus contortus) to assess the specificity of such effects. Subsequently, the drug combinations were assessed against Schistosoma mansoni in vivo. To further assess the suitability of combinatorial drug applications, an economic model was developed to project the cost-efficacy of praziquantel-triclabendazole drug combinations in a global focus. It was concluded that <b>triclabendazole</b> and its metabolites possessed good efficacy against immature schistosomula, albeit weak efficacy against adult Schistosoma mansoni.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fascioliasis is an {{emerging}} zoonotic disease of considerable veterinary and public health importance. <b>Triclabendazole</b> is the only available drug for treatment. Laboratory studies have documented promising fasciocidal properties of the artemisinins (e. g., artemether). METHODOLOGY: We carried out two exploratory phase- 2 trials to assess the efficacy and safety of oral artemether administered at (i) 6 × 80 mg over 3 consecutive days, and (ii) 3 × 200 mg within 24 h in 36 Fasciola-infected individuals in Egypt. Efficacy was determined by cure rate (CR) and egg reduction rate (ERR) based on multiple Kato-Katz thick smears before and after drug administration. Patients who remained Fasciola-positive following artemether dosing were treated with single 10 mg/kg oral <b>triclabendazole.</b> In case of treatment failure, <b>triclabendazole</b> was re-administered at 20 mg/kg in two divided doses. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CRs achieved with 6 × 80 mg and 3 × 200 mg artemether were 35 % and 6 %, respectively. The corresponding ERRs were 63 % and nil, respectively. Artemether was well tolerated. A high efficacy was observed with <b>triclabendazole</b> administered at 10 mg/kg (16 patients; CR: 67 %, ERR: 94 %) and 20 mg/kg (4 patients; CR: 75 %, ERR: 96 %).

In 2002, only <b>triclabendazole</b> showed high efficacy (> 95 %) against F. hepatica by means of FECRT, wheareas the efficacy of ABZ and CLOR was lower (85 - 63 % and 95 - 72 %, respectively). The IRT showed that IgG levels decreased during the two first days in animal treated with albendazole and clorsulon, although an increase was observed the last day. At the same time, {{a rise in the}} IgG levels was observed in animals treated with <b>triclabendazole.</b> The analysis of the results of 2004 showed that FECRT had low values with the albendazole (17 to 4 %) and clorsulon (48 to 30 %), and percentages from 82 to 76 % were obtained with the <b>triclabendazole.</b> The values of IRT varied between 50 and 20 % in ewes trated with albendazole, wheareas no reduction was observed wit...|$|E
