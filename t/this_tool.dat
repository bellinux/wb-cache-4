5|$|Periyar {{spent over}} fifty years giving speeches, {{propagating}} the realisation {{that everyone is}} an equal citizen and the differences on basis of caste and creeds were man-made to keep the innocent and ignorant as underdogs in the society. Although Periyar's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and more mundane mass, scores of educated people were also swayed. Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool. According to him, all were blessed with <b>this</b> <b>tool,</b> but very few used it. Thus Periyar used reasoning, with respect to subjects of social interest, in his presentations to his audiences. Communal differences in Tamil society were {{considered by many to}} be deep-rooted features until Periyar came to the scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of user-made scenarios or series of scenarios (campaigns) {{for the game}} was made possible using the Scenario Builder. <b>This</b> <b>tool</b> is simpler and easier to learn than comparable editors used in more modern games, but it has fewer capabilities as a result. Ensemble Studios used the Scenario Builder to make the single-player campaigns which shipped with the retail game. Various unofficial sites exist where custom scenarios can be submitted and downloaded. In late 2005, {{it was discovered that}} by modifying various data files, units present in the beta versions of the game could be made available in the editor. Some obscure units include a spaceship and a hero that changes ownership when units move near it. Through data editing, the rules of unit placement can also be modified. This allows units to be placed on any terrain and on top of other units, which creates new possibilities for design. Other significant discoveries include new terrain templates, a mode to triple each unit's hitpoints and a tool to edit map sizes.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the easiest}} face vise to install is the {{self-contained}} iron vise, {{sometimes called the}} 'quick-action' vise (except they are not all quick-action). <b>This</b> <b>tool</b> comes already assembled and only has to be mounted to the bench. Usually, auxiliary wooden jaws are added. The quick-action feature makes setting it much quicker and is quickly taken for granted. Not only are these vises easy to install and use, they are also robust. Their main drawback is the relatively high cost.|$|E
25|$|Bragg is {{most famous}} for his law on the {{diffraction}} of X-rays by crystals. Bragg's law {{makes it possible to}} calculate the positions of the atoms within a crystal from the way in which an X-ray beam is diffracted by the crystal lattice. He made this discovery in 1912, during his first year as a research student in Cambridge.

25|$|Brown-headed nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) {{have been}} {{observed}} to methodically use bark pieces to remove other flakes of bark from a tree. The birds insert the bark piece underneath an attached bark scale, using it like a wedge and lever, to expose hiding insects. Occasionally, they reuse the same piece of bark several times and sometimes even fly short distances carrying the bark flake in their beak. The evolutionary origin of <b>this</b> <b>tool</b> use {{might be related to}} these birds frequently wedging seeds into cracks in the bark to hammer them open with their beak, which can lead to bark coming off.|$|E
25|$|Chromatin immunoprecipitation with {{sequencing}} (ChIP-seq) is {{a method}} used to identify protein binding sites on DNA and assess histone modifications. <b>This</b> <b>tool</b> has enabled examination of epigenetic regulation of browning and helps elucidate the mechanisms by which protein-DNA interactions stimulate the differentiation of beige adipocytes. Studies observing the chromatin landscapes of beige adipocytes have found that adipogenesis of these cells results from the formation of cell specific chromatin landscapes, which regulate the transcriptional program and, ultimately, control differentiation. Using ChIP-seq {{in conjunction with other}} tools, recent studies have identified over 30 transcriptional and epigenetic factors that influence beige adipocyte development.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>this</b> <b>tool</b> for {{evaluating}} models against {{systems that are}} accessible experimentally may be applied in any field, its application to selecting a statistical model via Akaike information criterion are particularly well described in papers and a book by Burnham and Anderson. In a nutshell the Kullback–Leibler divergence of reality from a model may be estimated, to within a constant additive term, by a function (like the squares summed) of the deviations observed between data and the model's predictions. Estimates of such divergence for models that share the same additive term can in turn be used to select among models.|$|E

The {{first of its}} kind, this database maps the principles and rules that guarantee, deny, or {{protect the rights of}} women and girls around the world. <b>This</b> <b>tool</b> for gender equality and human rights activists is annually updated and searchable, and provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of provisions relevant to women's rights and gender equality across various countries throughout the world. Users can search though the database by keyword, and legal provisions are grouped into 16 categories that were carefully defined by reviewing the constitutions from a human rights perspective.|$|E
25|$|Thrilling is {{the process}} of {{threading}} and drilling (accomplished in the reverse order) internal threads using a specialized cutting tool on a CNC mill. The cutting tool tip is shaped like a drill or center-cutting endmill, while the body has a thread-shaped form with a countersink cutter form near the shank. The cutter first plunges to drill the hole. Then the thread is circularly interpolated just like the multiple-form cutter described above. <b>This</b> <b>tool</b> drills, chamfers, and threads a hole all in one compact cycle. The advantage is this process eliminates a tool, tool-holder, and tool change. The disadvantage is that the process is limited to hole depth no greater than three times the diameter of the tool.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{whirling}} arm {{does not produce}} a reliable flow of air impacting the test shape at a normal incidence. Centrifugal forces {{and the fact that}} the object is moving in its own wake mean that detailed examination of the airflow is difficult. Francis Herbert Wenham (1824–1908), a Council Member of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, addressed these issues by inventing, designing and operating the first enclosed wind tunnel in 1871. Once this breakthrough had been achieved, detailed technical data was rapidly extracted by the use of <b>this</b> <b>tool.</b> Wenham and his colleague John Browning are credited with many fundamental discoveries, including the measurement of l/d ratios, and the revelation of the beneficial effects of a high aspect ratio.|$|E
25|$|In {{honor of}} the 36th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969, Google took public domain imagery of the Moon, {{integrated}} it into the Google Maps interface, and created a tool called Google Moon. By default <b>this</b> <b>tool,</b> with a reduced set of features, also displays the points of landing of all Apollo spacecraft {{to land on the}} Moon. It also included an Easter egg, displaying a Swiss cheese design at the highest zoom level, which Google has since removed. A collaborative project between NASA Ames Research Center and Google called the Planetary Content Project integrates and improves the data that is used for Google Moon.

25|$|All {{organizations}} can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments. For instance, former Mayor Martin O’Malley pushed the City of Baltimore to use CitiStat, a performance-measurement data and management {{system that allows}} city officials to maintain statistics on crime trends to condition of potholes. This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency {{in terms of time}} and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million. Even mass transit systems have innovated with hybrid bus fleets to real-time tracking at bus stands.
