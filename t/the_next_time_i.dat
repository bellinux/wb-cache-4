500|$|A {{stopover}} in Bombay, India, {{during the}} band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies {{to write the}} song [...] "See My Friends", released as a single in July 1965. This was an early example of crossover music, {{and one of the}} first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian Subcontinent. Davies had written [...] "See My Friends" [...] with a raga feel after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen. Music historian Jonathan Bellman argues that the song was [...] "extremely influential" [...] on Davies' musical peers: [...] "And while much has been made of the Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' because it was the first pop record to use a sitar, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music." [...] In a widely quoted statement by Barry Fantoni, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: [...] "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must get one of those. The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{enduring}} folklore of the Titanic sinking {{is that the}} musicians played the hymn [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee" [...] as the ship sank, but {{this appears to be}} dubious. The claim surfaced among the earliest reports of the sinking, and the hymn became so closely associated with the Titanic disaster that its opening bars were carved on the grave monument of Titanics bandmaster, Wallace Hartley, one of those who perished. Violet Jessop said in her 1934 account of the disaster that she had heard the hymn being played. In contrast, Archibald Gracie emphatically denied it in his own account, written soon after the sinking, and Radio Operator Harold Bride said that he had heard the band playing ragtime, then [...] "Autumn", by which he may have meant Archibald Joyce's then-popular waltz [...] "Songe d'Automne" [...] (Autumn Dream). George Orrell, the bandmaster of the rescue ship, Carpathia, who spoke with survivors, related: [...] "The ship's band in any emergency is expected to play to calm the passengers. After Titanic struck the iceberg the band began to play bright music, dance music, comic songs– anything that would prevent the passengers from becoming panic-stricken... various awe-stricken passengers began to think of the death that faced them and asked the bandmaster to play hymns. The one which appealed to all was 'Nearer My God to Thee'." [...] According to Gracie, who was near the band until that section of deck went under, the tunes played by the band were [...] "cheerful" [...] but he didn't recognise any of them, claiming that if they had played 'Nearer, My God, to Thee' as claimed in the newspaper [...] "I assuredly should have noticed it and regarded it as a tactless warning of immediate death to us all and one likely to create panic." [...] Several survivors who were among the last to leave the ship claimed that the band continued playing until the slope of the deck became too steep for them to stand, Gracie claimed that the band stopped playing at least 30 minutes before the vessel sank. Several witnesses support this account including A. H. Barkworth, a first-class passenger who testified: [...] "I do not wish to detract from the bravery of anybody, but I might mention that when I first came on deck the band was playing a waltz. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> passed where the band was stationed, the members had thrown down their instruments and were not to be seen." ...|$|E

When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: 'You were worried about it yesterday {{but you do not}} have to worry so much.' Thus, gradually he began to lead to war. And <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> met him, he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: 'My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.' In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and the navy high commands." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keith Uhlich from Slant Magazine was {{positive}} to both season {{one and three}} of Millennium, giving them both {{four out of five}} stars and calling season one: [...] "We are racing toward an apocalypse of our own creation.

[...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B and said it had [...] "great visuals and a commanding performance by Henriksen." [...] Justine Elias from The New York Times was mostly positive to the series and said [...] "If The X-Files, with its offbeat humor and conspiracy theories, wonders about those things that go bump in the night, Millennium explores the darkness – and embraces it." [...] Daily Nebraskan said in their review that the show had [...] "a lot of potential: a good lead actor, a solid premise and a feel that will keep audiences glued to their televisions." ...|$|E

There was a little silence, and when they began to talk again, it was of the engravings at which Fred had just been looking.

60|$|For {{one bright}} breezy {{creature}} I grew {{to feel a}} real regard.

Of the many who called upon her in her charming flat, not one had ever, to my knowledge, offered her consolation or condolence. It seemed to me cruel, callous. The over-burdened heart, finding no outlet for its imprisoned grief, finding no sympathetic ear into which to pour its tale of woe, breaks, we are told; anyhow, it isn't good for it.
