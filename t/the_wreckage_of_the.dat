5|$|In 1986, the {{wreckage}} of an Avenger was found off the Florida coast during the search for <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Space Shuttle Challenger. Aviation archaeologist Jon Myhre raised this wreck from the ocean floor in 1990. He mistakenly believed {{it was one of}} the missing planes.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{part of the}} Department of Transportation, {{were the}} primary {{investigators}} into the crash of Flight 2511. <b>The</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DC-6 {{was taken to a}} hangar at nearby Wilmington Airport, where the fuselage was reassembled on a wood-and-chicken-wire frame. Investigators recovered approximately 90% of the fuselage, which was then assembled on the frame in the Wilmington hangar.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{aircraft}} was salvaged by 63 Maintenance Unit between 11 and 16 May 1941 {{and was taken}} to Oxford to be stored. The aeroplane was armed with four machine guns in the nose but carried no ammunition. Several pieces of the plane still exist, including the two engines {{and a piece of}} the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|A {{fragment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, and {{the medals}} awarded to Doolittle, {{are on display}} at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.|$|R
25|$|Apparently, gears m3, n1-3, p1-2, and q1 did {{not survive}} in <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> <b>The</b> {{functions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pointers were deduced from <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed, and is generally accepted.|$|R
25|$|On December 9, 2008, a {{group of}} volunteers led by {{scientists}} from the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program in St. Augustine, Florida, searched <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> Lake Crescent for <b>the</b> sunken <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alligator.|$|R
5|$|Mackandal has expert {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} the forest, using its herbs and fungi as weapons against the planters. The ecological landscape of Haiti is used to represent <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Revolution, being initially described as fertile and bountiful with the plantations, but later as worn down and bare. The powerful climate of the Caribbean is more similar to Africa than Europe, making nature an ally of the slaves. Natural elements also act on their own, with Henri Christophe's Citadel being attacked by fungi and thunderstorms before its completion.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan {{came under}} intense {{international}} scrutiny after the raid. The Pakistani government denied {{that it had}} sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009. The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. After the raid, there was an unconfirmed report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crashed helicopter.|$|E
5|$|While {{on holiday}} at a {{resort in the}} French Alps with Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Professor Calculus, Tintin reads about a plane crash in the Gosain Than Massif in the Himalayas of Tibet. He then has a vision of his friend Chang Chong-Chen, badly injured and calling for help from <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crashed plane. Convinced of Chang's survival, Tintin flies to Kathmandu, via Delhi, with Snowy and a sceptical Captain Haddock. They hire a Sherpa named Tharkey and, {{accompanied}} by porters, travel overland from Nepal towards the crash site.|$|E
25|$|Following <b>the</b> {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> F-BBDM on <b>the</b> seabed in 1994, a re-investigation of both accidents {{cast doubt}} on <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1950 investigation.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{remaining}} <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boeing {{jumbo jet}} is stored {{about a mile}} from Tattershall, Lincolnshire, at Roger Windley's scrapyard, pending <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American victims' civil case and further legal proceedings. (...) The remains include <b>the</b> nose section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boeing 747, which was cut into several pieces to assist in removal from Tundergarth Hill.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> main <b>wreckage</b> {{consisting}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage, right inner wing, {{and left}} inner wing still with its engine attached, struck the ground inverted {{and was immediately}} consumed by fire. <b>The</b> bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eight passengers were found in what remained <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabin but were burned beyond recognition. <b>The</b> violent gyration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage threw the two pilots through <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cockpit. Their bodies were found unburned [...] from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b> <b>The</b> tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft {{broke away from the}} fuselage and fell to the ground about [...] from <b>the</b> main <b>wreckage.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, the company's former test pilot, Lou Leavitt, had {{purchased}} <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> XR-1A {{at a price}} of 4 cents per pound. Leavitt had formed a new company, Helicopter Air Transport, intending to provide helicopter flight training {{in anticipation of a}} postwar aviation boom, and he returned the XR-1A to flying condition. The projected boom failed to materialise, however, and HAT quickly entered bankruptcy, Leavitt selling the XR-1A to Frank Piasecki, another former Platt-LePage employee who had now started his own helicopter company. Piasecki soon grounded the aircraft due to airworthiness concerns, and used the airframe {{in the development of the}} PA-2B, a planned tiltrotor which failed to proceed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{is driven}} back to Area 51 {{along with two}} other Men in Black, Howard Grodin and Jeff Smoodge. After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
50|$|During 2007 {{and early}} 2008 Blair made Ochberg's Orphans for Rainmaker Films, about <b>the</b> 1921 {{expedition}} <b>of</b> one Isaac Ochberg who saved nearly 200 orphans from <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> post-revolutionary Russia. <b>The</b> film was shortlisted for an Oscar for Short Documentary.|$|R
25|$|Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> nº.XZ450 yielded <b>the</b> {{panel for}} <b>the</b> launch <b>of</b> Sea Eagle missiles, British sources {{have speculated that}} the Argentines {{concluded}} that Sea Eagle had been made operational and this was another factor that kept the Argentine navy in port.|$|R
50|$|Bruning's Bar is a bar {{from the}} 1830s {{that is in}} <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> being restored. It was {{salvaged}} from <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> Bruning's Restaurant, <b>the</b> third oldest restaurant in New Orleans, after Hurricane Katrina. The bar is also used as such during special events.|$|R
5|$|As part of {{the buildup}} to this feud, Hardy {{strongly}} implied that {{he was responsible for}} all of Jeff's accidents leading back to November, including an assault in a hotel stairwell that prevented Jeff from appearing at Survivor Series, an automobile accident where Jeff's car was run off the road, and a pyrotechnics malfunction where {{part of the}} pyro from Jeff's entrance was fired directly at Jeff, in an attempt to stop Jeff holding the WWE Championship. Despite Hardy's attempts to goad Jeff into fighting him, Jeff refused to fight his brother, but, on the March 3 episode of SmackDown!, Jeff viciously attacked him during a promo where Hardy implied that he was also responsible for the fire that burned down Jeff's house, {{going so far as to}} reveal that he had in his possession a dog collar that supposedly belonged to Jeff's dog, Jack (who perished in the fire), that he claimed to have salvaged from <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. At WrestleMania XXV, Hardy defeated Jeff in an Extreme Rules match, and in a stretcher match on the following episode of SmackDown.|$|E
5|$|Mermaid and Loire joined {{battle at}} 07:00, and the {{artillery}} exchange became close and furious after a boarding attempt by Loire was foiled by the helmsman of the British ship. Both ships took severe damage, Mermaid knocking away {{several of her}} opponent's spars, but suffering in turn from the musketry of the soldiers still aboard the Loire. At 09:15, the French vessel lost another spar, and Newman determined to rake his opponent. As he attempted to complete this manoeuvre, a shot from Loire brought down Mermaid's mizzenmast, making her unmanageable and disabling a number of her guns. Seeing an opportunity to escape, the battered Loire disengaged, making significant distance before Newman's crew could clear <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mast. High winds further hampered Mermaid's repair efforts by tearing away several sails and spars and drowning the ship's carpenter when he was blown overboard. By the time Mermaid was ready for action once more, Loire had escaped.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{control over}} the city ended {{following}} {{the chaos of the}} Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established.In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised {{what was left of the}} province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses.|$|E
50|$|After impact, {{the plane}} broke apart and was {{propelled}} {{up the mountain}} approximately 132 ft, coming to rest inverted. A fire broke out, and <b>the</b> residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village came to aid, attempting to put the fire out with hand-held extinguishers. All but one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injured passengers were able to escape <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injured or killed passengers were natives of Nome, Gambell, or Savoonga.|$|R
25|$|Fry and ten <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{children}} died on scene. Two other {{children died}} later in hospital from their injuries and two {{who survived the}} crash recovered from relatively minor injuries. Three men {{who were in the}} maintenance lorry were unhurt and pulled seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minibus occupants clear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children involved were aged between 12 and 13 and were pupils at Hagley RC High School in Hagley, near Birmingham.|$|R
5|$|Removal {{of mines}} and {{obstacles}} from the beach, {{a job that}} had to be performed quickly before the tide came in at 10:30, was <b>the</b> assignment <b>of</b> 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions and the eight dozer tanks. The teams used explosives to destroy beach obstacles and blow gaps in the sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and vehicles. The dozer tanks pushed <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way to create clear lanes for further landings.|$|R
5|$|Shephard soon {{encounters}} more stranded Marine {{units in}} <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base, {{and tries to}} break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{helicopter}} was finally spotted by an IAF Mi-8 helicopter at 0820h (08:20am IST) the following day, less than 24 hours after contact was lost with the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> S-60 was {{transferred}} to the New England Air Museum in the 1970s, and is currently being restored by its new owners, the Connecticut Air and Space Center, in Stratford, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying <b>the</b> stored <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like <b>the</b> violence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sport.|$|R
50|$|He {{suffered}} {{minor injuries}} in the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958, when still only 18 years old. He was the youngest player involved in the crash and the last survivor to be rescued from <b>the</b> mangled <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BEA Elizabethan airliner after he was found unconscious amongst the debris by two journalists five hours after the official search was called off. He had played in the last match before the disaster, the European Cup quarter-final second leg against Red Star Belgrade, and had so far made 10 senior appearances for United.|$|R
500|$|On <b>the</b> {{afternoon}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash, divers {{had recovered}} two bodies from the water. By the next morning, {{a total of}} four bodies had been found, while the other five victims were presumed dead. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> helicopter's <b>wreckage</b> was found in about [...] <b>of</b> water, far from <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane. Aided by a sonar, investigators attempted to discover the plane's debris in deeper water near <b>the</b> mid-channel point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hudson. Their efforts were hindered, however, by poor visibility underwater and a storm on August 9.|$|R
25|$|On 6 and 7 August 2014, divers found {{human remains}} on the wreck which was then moored in the port of Genoa. On 3 November 2014, the final body was {{discovered}} in <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, the British Ministry of Defence {{was engaged}} by the Polish Government to examine <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{aircraft}} for traces of explosives. The {{work will be}} done by scientists based at the Forensic Explosives Laboratory at Fort Halstead, Kent.|$|E
25|$|In early May 1986 {{workers at}} the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport accidentally started {{a fire in the}} cockpit of this aircraft, which {{destroyed}} the cockpit.

2500|$|The Alligator was an inboard paddle-wheel {{steamboat}} that {{operated in}} <b>the</b> interior <b>of</b> north central Florida in the United States from 1888 to 1909. [...] Famed archeologist Clarence Bloomfield Moore leased the steamer {{each year from}} 1891 to 1895 for his annual excursions to explore the St. Johns River and tributaries for Native American artifacts. On November 5, 1909 the paddlesteamer caught fire and sank ending its twenty-one years <b>of</b> service in <b>the</b> passenger and freight business.

500|$|The NTSB report {{estimates}} that around this time, the flight crashed. The aircraft descended without power, clipped several trees and posts, and crashed onto a hill with a 24° slope in Cove Neck, New York. The fuselage partially fragmented into three distinct pieces. The cockpit and forward cabin separated from <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airframe and were hurled over <b>the</b> crest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, {{coming to a}} stop [...] from <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> <b>The</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage stopped within [...] after impact.
