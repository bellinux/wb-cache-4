50|$|AOPDF is a {{programmable}} spectral filter. From {{signal processing}} point of view, the AOPDF {{corresponds to a}} time-variant passive linear <b>transversal</b> <b>filter</b> with a programmable finite impulse response. Phase and amplitude filtering in the AOPDF is achieved by virtue of birefringent acousto-optic effect and can be represented by a convolution between the amplitude of the input optical signal Ein(t) and a programmable acoustical signal S(t/α) proportional to the electrical signal S(t) applied to the Piezoelectric transducer (made typically from lithium niobate). Here, α is a scaling factor equal to {{the ratio of the}} speed of sound v to the speed of light c times the index difference Δn between the ordinary and the extraordinary waves taken along the propagation axis in the crystal. In the limit of low diffraction efficiency the AOPDF behaves as a linear filter and the small value of the α (typically 10−7) allows for the quantitative control of optical signals with frequencies of tens to hundreds terahertz with electrical signals of tens of megahertz, which are readily produced by commercial waveform generators.|$|E

This work {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of digital transmission links over a lumped RC channel when one of three static equalization schemes is utilized: 1. Use of a Sidelobe Transmitter 2. <b>Transversal</b> <b>Filter</b> at the Receiver 3. Frequency Compensation of the Transfer Characteristics to form a rectangular Nyquist Channel. The effect on the probability of error of thermal noise and intersymbol interference is considered. In each of the equalization schemes, the intersymbol interference is reduced to zero, and the waveshape at the transmitter which maximizes the SNR at the receiver decision instant is transmitted. It is found that {{the performance of}} the Sidelobe Transmitter and the <b>Transversal</b> <b>Filter</b> Receiver are equal theoretically and that Frequency Compensation provides the poorest results. The comparisons carried out in this work have utilized the RC channel as an example. Detailed generalization of the comparative performance {{as a function of the}} impulse response of the channel utilized would be desirable but cannot be made readily. An analysis of the coaxial line is planned for the future. The eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenvalues of the system are required in order to evaluate the optimal performance of the Sidelobe Transmitter and <b>Transversal</b> <b>Filter</b> Receiver. For arbitrary impulse responses, these eigenfunctions are usually complex to obtain. However, one is able to state in general that since the Sidelobe Transmitter or <b>Transversal</b> <b>Filter</b> combined with transmission of the optimum waveshape represent the best linear filter, their performance will not be inferior to the Frequency Compensated rectangular Nyquist channel.

Accordingly, the author envisions multiple adaptive lattice filters as channels of sequential processing multichannel lattice stages (SPMLSs) [19 – 22, 50] and proposes to sequentially combine these multiple lattice filters in a CR channel identification task.
