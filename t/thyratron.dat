25|$|While {{this work}} progressed, the teams {{continued}} {{development of the}} basic system. Burcham and Atkinson continued their development of the transmitter section, attempting to generate very short pulses of power to feed the magnetron. They finally settled on a solution using two tubes, a <b>thyratron</b> and a pentode, which produced 1µs pulses at 15kW. GEC preferred a design using a single <b>thyratron,</b> but this was eventually abandoned in favour of the AMRE design. Further work pushed this system to 50kW, producing 10kW of microwaves at a pulse repetition frequency of 2500 cycles per second.|$|E
25|$|High voltage switch for non-coherent keyed power-oscillators These {{modulators}} {{consist of}} a high voltage pulse generator formed from a high voltage supply, a pulse forming network, and a high voltage switch such as a <b>thyratron.</b> They generate short pulses of power to feed, e.g., the magnetron, a special type of vacuum tube that converts DC (usually pulsed) into microwaves. This technology is known as pulsed power. In this way, the transmitted pulse of RF radiation is kept to a defined and usually very short duration.|$|E
25|$|Some thyratrons {{can carry}} large {{currents}} for their physical size. One {{example is the}} miniature type 2D21, often seen in 1950s jukeboxes as control switches for relays. A cold-cathode version of the <b>thyratron,</b> which uses a pool of mercury for its cathode, is called an ignitron; some can switch thousands of amperes. Thyratrons containing hydrogen have a very consistent time delay between their turn-on pulse and full conduction; they behave much like modern silicon-controlled rectifiers, also called thyristors due to their functional similarity to thyratrons. Hydrogen thyratrons have long been used in radar transmitters.|$|E
5000|$|Medium-power <b>thyratrons</b> found {{applications}} in machine tool motor controllers, where <b>thyratrons,</b> operating as phase-controlled rectifiers, are utilized in the tool's armature regulator (zero to [...] "base speed", [...] "constant torque" [...] mode) {{and in the}} tool's field regulator ("base speed" [...] to about twice [...] "base speed", [...] "constant horsepower" [...] mode). Examples include Monarch Machine Tool 10EE lathe, which used <b>thyratrons</b> from 1949 until solid-state devices replaced them in 1984.|$|R

25|$|The first {{electronic}} ignition (a cold cathode type) was tested in 1948 by Delco-Remy, while Lucas introduced a transistorized ignition in 1955, {{which was used}} on BRM and Coventry Climax Formula One engines in 1962. The aftermarket began offering EI that year, with both the AutoLite Electric Transistor 201 and Tung-Sol EI-4 (<b>thyratron</b> capacitive discharge) being available. Pontiac became the first automaker to offer an optional EI, the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic, on some 1963 models; it was also available on some Corvettes. The first commercially available all solid-state (SCR) capacitive discharge ignition was manufactured by Hyland Electronics in Canada also in 1963. Ford fitted a Lucas system on the Lotus 25s entered at Indianapolis the next year, ran a fleet test in 1964, and began offering optional EI on some models in 1965. Beginning in 1958, Earl W. Meyer at Chrysler worked on EI, continuing until 1961 and resulting in use of EI on the company's NASCAR hemis in 1963 and 1964.|$|E
2500|$|An earlier gas filled tube {{device called}} a <b>thyratron</b> {{provided}} a similar electronic switching capability, {{where a small}} control voltage could switch a large current.

2500|$|In 1952, Jewell James Ebers from Bell Labs {{developed}} a prototype solid-state analog of <b>thyratron</b> – a four-layer transistor, or thyristor.

2500|$|Gas-filled tubes such as {{discharge}} {{tubes and}} cold cathode tubes are not hard vacuum tubes, though are always filled with gas {{at less than}} sea-level atmospheric pressure. Types such as the voltage-regulator tube and <b>thyratron</b> resemble hard vacuum tubes and fit in sockets designed for vacuum tubes. Their distinctive orange, red, or purple glow during operation indicates the presence of gas; electrons flowing in a vacuum do not produce light within that region. These types may still {{be referred to as}} [...] "electron tubes" [...] as they do perform electronic functions. High-power rectifiers use mercury vapor to achieve a lower forward voltage drop than high-vacuum tubes.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{special-purpose}} {{tubes are}} constructed with particular {{gases in the}} envelope. For instance, voltage-regulator tubes contain various inert gases such as argon, helium or neon, which will ionize at predictable voltages. The <b>thyratron</b> is a special-purpose tube filled with low-pressure gas or mercury vapor. Like vacuum tubes, it contains a hot cathode and an anode, but also a control electrode which behaves somewhat like the grid of a triode. When the control electrode starts conduction, the gas ionizes, after which the control electrode can no longer stop the current; the tube [...] "latches" [...] into conduction. Removing anode (plate) voltage lets the gas de-ionize, restoring its non-conductive state.|$|E
2500|$|The leading US {{electronics}} companies (Bell Labs, IBM, RCA and General Electric) sought {{solution to}} [...] "the tyranny of numbers" [...] {{in the development}} of discrete components that implemented a given function with a minimum number of attached passive elements. During the vacuum tube era, this approach allowed to reduce the cost of a circuit at the expense of its operation frequency. For example, a memory cell of the 1940s consisted of two triodes and a dozen passive components and ran at frequencies up to 200kHz. A MHz response could be achieved with two pentodes and six diodes per cell. This cell could be replaced by one <b>thyratron</b> with a load resistor and an input capacitor, but the operating frequency of such circuit did not exceed a few kHz.|$|E
50|$|Low-power <b>thyratrons</b> (relay {{tubes and}} trigger tubes) were {{manufactured}} for controlling incandescent lamps, electromechanical relays or solenoids, for bidirectional counters, to perform various functions in Dekatron calculators, for voltage threshold detectors in RC timers, etc. Glow <b>thyratrons</b> were optimized for high gas-discharge light output or even phosphorized {{and used as}} self-displaying shift registers in large-format, crawling-text dot-matrix displays.|$|R

50|$|Some {{vacuum tubes}} present in {{microwave}} installations tend to generate bremsstrahlung x-rays. Magnetrons and especially hydrogen <b>thyratrons</b> {{tend to be}} the worst offenders.|$|R
50|$|They were unsuccessful, but {{did provide}} much {{data on the}} {{advantages}} of such a system, should one be built. Namely; a fast voltage rise time to fire fouled or wet spark plugs, high energy throughout the RPM range resulting in better starting, more power and economy, and lower emissions. A few engineers, scientists, and hobbyists had built CD ignitions throughout the 1950s using thyratrons (tube type). However, thyratrons were unsuitable for use in automobiles for two reasons. They required a warm-up period which was a nuisance, and were vulnerable to vibration which drastically shortened their lifetime. In an automotive application, the <b>thyratron</b> CD ignition would fail in either weeks or months. The unreliability of those early <b>thyratron</b> CD ignitions made them unsuitable for mass production despite providing short term benefits. One company at least, Tung-Sol (a manufacturer of vacuum tubes) marketed a <b>thyratron</b> CD ignition, model Tung-Sol EI-4 in 1962, but it was expensive. Despite the failings of <b>thyratron</b> (tube type) CD ignitions, the improved ignition that they gave made them a worthwhile addition for some drivers. For the Wankel powered NSU Spider of 1964, Bosch resurrected its <b>thyratron</b> method for a CD ignition and used this up until at least 1966. It suffered the same reliability problems as the Tung-Sol EI-4.|$|E

50|$|Another {{use of the}} <b>thyratron</b> was in {{relaxation}} oscillators.

In June 1981 the Finance Committee approved the placing, without competitive tendering, of a blanket order with EEV Ltd (UK) for a total value of up to 2 000 000 Swiss francs to cover {{the supply of}} <b>thyratrons</b> for the years 1982, 1983 and 1984. New blanket orders were subsequently negotiated for three-year periods with the approval of the Finance Committee in 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993. After a new market survey in 1995 - 1996 had confirmed that EEV Ltd is the sole manufacturer of such <b>thyratrons</b> in the CERN Member States, a new blanket order was negotiated in 1996 with the approval of the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is invited to agree to the negotiation, without competitive tendering, of a new blanket order with EEV Ltd (UK) for up to 800 000 pounds sterling to cover the supply of <b>thyratrons</b> for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, subject to revision for deliveries during the years 2001 and 2002.

50|$|High-power <b>thyratrons</b> {{are still}} manufactured, and {{are capable of}} {{operation}} up to tens of kiloamperes (kA) and tens of kilovolts (kV). Modern applications include pulse drivers for pulsed radar equipment, high-energy gas lasers, radiotherapy devices, particle accelerators and in Tesla coils and similar devices. <b>Thyratrons</b> are also used in high-power UHF television transmitters, to protect inductive output tubes from internal shorts, by grounding the incoming high-voltage supply during {{the time it takes}} for a circuit breaker to open and reactive components to drain their stored charges.

50|$|A <b>thyratron</b> {{is a type}} of {{gas-filled}} tube used as a high-power electrical switch and controlled rectifier. Thyratrons can handle much greater currents than similar hard-vacuum tubes. Electron multiplication occurs when the gas becomes ionized, producing a phenomenon known as Townsend discharge. Gases used include mercury vapor, xenon, neon, and (in special high-voltage applications or applications requiring very short switching times) hydrogen. Unlike a vacuum tube (valve), a <b>thyratron</b> cannot be used to amplify signals linearly.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s, <b>thyratrons</b> {{were derived}} from early vacuum tubes such as the UV-200, which {{contained}} {{a small amount of}} argon gas to increase its sensitivity as a radio signal detector; and the German LRS Relay tube, which also contained argon gas. Gas rectifiers, which predated vacuum tubes, such as the argon-filled General Electric [...] "Tungar bulb" [...] and the Cooper-Hewitt mercury-pool rectifier, also provided an influence. Irving Langmuir and G. S. Meikle of GE are usually cited as the first investigators to study controlled rectification in gas tubes, about 1914. The first commercial <b>thyratrons</b> didn't appear until around 1928.|$|R
