25|$|On 16 January 1944, U-66 left Lorient {{for what}} would be her last patrol and the last command of Oberleutnant zur See Gerhard Seehausen (posthumously {{promoted}} to Kapitänleutnant). A month and ten days after departure, U-66 sighted Silvermaple, a 5,313-ton British motor merchant in the convoy ST-12. She was sunk after one torpedo hit. Four days later, the boat came upon the French 5,202-ton St. Louis, which she sank with two torpedoes off Accra, Ghana. The ship broke into three parts, which sank in less than 50 seconds. Four days after the sinking of St. Louis, 'U-66 sank the 4,964-ton British John Holt with two torpedoes, and took the captain, Master Cecil Gordon Hime, and a passenger, Mr Elliott - {{an agent of the}} Holt Shipping Company, prisoner. These men were later lost with the U-boat. Nearly three weeks after the sinking of John Holt, the U-boat came across the 4,257-ton British Matadian, which she torpedoed and sank. After the attack, U-66 was forced <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> in the mud as British patrol craft engaged her. U-66 was supposed to be resupplied by , but this boat, a Milchkuh supply submarine, was sunk on 26 April.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} winning combination of stiffness plus near-infinite adjustability, the Avante suffered {{more than its}} share of problems. Aluminum parts were easily broken, the front suspension had a tendency <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> on jumps and even the handling was subpar when compared to its competition. In a model with a retail price of US$300 ($ in [...] ), these faults were not easily overlooked by racers and sales suffered badly.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to test three {{flexible}} polyurethane foams for mattress for comfort and durability. In particular, they were investigated the effects of foam composition and cell architecture on some physical-mechanical properties of interest for bedding applications and related to foam comfort levels (i. e. surface firmness, hysteresis loss and resistance <b>to</b> <b>bottoming</b> <b>out),</b> and their changes after artificial weathering due to moisture and temperature. The results demonstrated that all the three foams have open cell morphology and similar cell structure, with average cell diameters ranging from 430 to 510 micron and wide cell size distribution. As a consequence, they also show comparable water vapor transport behavior. On the contrary, their mechanical response, in terms of hysteresis loss, surface firmness and resistance <b>to</b> <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> was found strongly dependent on their chemical structure and molecular mobility, as inferred from infrared spectroscopy analysis. During accelerated weathering all the foams undergo oxidations that affected their comfort factors in static conditions, giving a progressive lowering of hysteresis loss, surface firmness and resistance <b>to</b> <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> particularly for the two foams having lower crosslinking level and thus slow recovery rate after compression...|$|R

50|$|The ferry {{is a joint}} {{operation}} of Marion and Yamhill counties, with Marion County taking the responsibility of staffing and operating the ferry. It operates every day that river conditions permit. In summer, low water levels can cause the ferry <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out.</b> Dredging is sometimes employed to deepen the ferry's crossing lane to keep it operating longer during the dry season. During rainy months, high water levels and fast currents can stop ferry operations.|$|E

If the bike dives so far as <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> the front forks, it can also cause {{handling}} and braking problems. One of the purposes of a suspension is to help maintain contact between the tire and road. If the suspension has bottomed out, it is no longer moving as it should, and is no longer helping to maintain contact.|$|E

50|$|In the 2000s, relaxed federal {{borrowing}} standards (including subprime lending {{that allowed}} a borrower {{to purchase a}} home {{with little or no}} money down) may have led directly to a boom in demand for houses. Because it was easy to borrow, many investors bought homes as property speculation with no intent to live in them. Since the demand outstripped the supply, prices rose, giving a short-term profit. This resulted in an inflationary spiral until the bubble burst in 2008 and borrowing standards became stricter, leaving the housing market <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
50|$|Six {{games into}} the first season, WFL franchises were in serious trouble.

The league seemed <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> in September, when two franchises relocated in mid-season. The Houston Texans moved to Shreveport, Louisiana as the Shreveport Steamer, and they were followed a week later by the New York Stars, who relocated to Charlotte as the Charlotte Hornets. On top of this, the Wheels briefly moved one game to London, Ontario (this time with nary a complaint from Canadian officials).|$|E

50|$|From {{an early}} age he endured a uniquely tough upbringing. His father, Dave, joined the Mongrel Mob at just 13. Six years later, he became Auckland president. That troubled path led to six years in jail for armed robbery. Letele's uncle also spent half his life behind bars. Since their release they helped form a {{foundation}} - called Grace - to support families facing similar problems. But, at the time, Letele was forced to find his own way in the world. Not long ago Letele, who played professional rugby league in Australia and France, tipped the scales at a whopping 210 kg. His weight blew out after suffering difficult, lonely times in Australia. The problems stemmed from taking on two supermarkets, only for finance <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out.</b> Close friend and former Selwyn College classmate, Duco promoter David Higgins, was concerned about Letele's health and offered him a lifeline on Parker's undercard.

5000|$|Writer Gary Indiana says of L.A. dingbats, [...] "They {{are not so}} much déclassé or {{redolent of}} actual poverty as they are an {{architecture}} of transience, of three-month leases or month-to-month rentals, in some ways ideal for the dicey professions so many Angelenos follow: illegal hair salons, [...] "therapeutic massage" [...] and a spectrum of feast-or-famine jobs in the entertainment industry, from acting to video editing. One can move from dingbat to dingbat on an income scale that slides up and down, and the very flimsiness of these buildings, which are usually supported on stilts on at least one side to make room for carports, encourages the idea that residing in one is invariably temporary, that the people inside are waiting <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> and segue to a Skid Row hotel, hoping for the right Richard Neutra to come on the market or looking for something in between—a guesthouse in the hills, a Silver Lake triplex with a long-term lease, a bungalow in Atwater Village." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{difference}} between the fully extended length of the suspension and the length compressed {{by the weight of}} the motorcycle and rider is called [...] "total sag" [...] or [...] "race sag".

Topping out occurs when the suspension extends fully and cannot mechanically extend any more. Increasing pre-load increases the initial force on the spring thereby reducing total sag. Decreasing pre-load decreases the initial force in the spring thereby increasing total sag.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} evidence that, in {{a declining}} market, appraisal values may lag notably behind analytical {{measures of the}} discounted present value of commercial property cash flows. For the period 1982 - 92, alternative measures of the economic value of constant-quality office buildings are constructed using two benchmark projections designed to bracket expected future vacancy rates and real rents. Until 1992, the time path for both benchmark series lie consistently below that developed from the appraisal-based Russell/NCREIF office market index. This divergence implies {{that the rate of}} price appreciation reported by the Russell/NCREIF index is distorted: being slow to register price declines when markets first weaken and then having to overstate the rate of decline once the market begins <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out.</b> The distortion may reflect incentives for investment managers and appraisers to smooth potentially temporary price volatility, as well as systematic differences in the character and condition of the properties that tend to trade at different stages of the real estate cycle. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{extremely}} volatile world economy in 2008, tourism demand slowed significantly through the year. The last six months of 2008, in particular, showed an abrupt shift in trends with international tourist arrivals flat or showing negative growth.

40|$|We {{project the}} peak-to-trough decline in home prices {{utilizing}} {{the three most}} popular measures of house prices, which are: (1) the FHFA (formally OFHEO) Index of house values; (2) the FHFA Purchase Only Index; (3) the S&P/Case-Shiller Index of house prices. We utilize six different models to project changes in home prices, including AR, ARIMA, BVAR-level, BVARdifference, BVECM, and Bayesian FA-VAR. The Bayesian FA-VAR outperforms other models in term of simulated out-of-sample {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) criteria. The most important and useful findings of the study, especially for policy makers and investors, are the following; (1) we are projecting for house prices <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out</b> in 2010 : 2 Q when using the FHFA Index and forecast a 8. 70 % drop from its 2007 : 2 Q peak to is 2010 : 2 Q trough; (2) the FHFA Purchase Only Index bottoms out in 2010 : 2 Q following a 12. 24 % peak-to-trough decline, with the peak again in 2007 : 2 Q; (3) the S&P/Case-Shiller Index is expected to drop 32. 85 % from its 2006 : 2 Q peak to its 2010 : 1 Q trough.

40|$|The leading {{time series}} {{of real estate}} returns is the Russell-NCREIF (RN) Property Index. The RN series tracks returns, cash flow plus {{appraised}} capital gains, for multiple property types. To evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} capital-gains component of the office-market return series, this paper constructs two benchmark measures for the present value of projectable office-market cash flows from 1982 to 1991 and compares these with a real value series based on the RN capital-gain component. The RN-based series runs 30 % above the highest of the benchmarks throughout the 1986 - 1989 period. While this overstatement is consistent with the development of a price bubble, failure of the bubble to burst until 1990 - 1991 is implausible. Real estate experts recognized overvaluation in assessments as early as the spring of 1986. The RN Office-Market Index was slow to register price declines when the markets first weakened and then overstated the rate of decline once the market began <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>out.</b> This pattern likely reflects incentives for appraisers to smooth potentially temporary price volatility and for investment managers to maintain appraised values in declining markets. It traces as well as to systematic differences in the character and condition of the properties that lend to trade at different stages of the real estate cycle. These incentives and differences provide reason to believe that other RN indexes were similarly distorted. Copyright American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{first four}} places were won by American cars and American drivers. The winner, Hershel McGriff, drove an Oldsmobile 88 {{at an average}} speed of 142 km/h. Though less powerful, the car was {{substantially}} lighter than its big Lincoln and Cadillac competitors, meaning that it would eventually pull away from them on the steep, winding course. The car (which had cost McGriff and his partners only $1,900, when the winner's purse was 150,000 pesos (around $17,200 U.S. dollars) [...] ), had another advantage in its weight - it was much easier to stop, meaning that McGriff finished the race on his original brake shoes when the big cars were re-shoeing every night. The reason that this was so important was that neither McGriff nor his co-driver were capable {{of even the most}} basic maintenance to the car. McGriff also noted that the control afforded by his manual gearbox gave him a significant advantage the last day on the gravel roads in Chiapas, when he finally passed the Cadillac leading the race. the final miles to the finish were run without oil due <b>to</b> <b>bottoming</b> <b>out</b> the oil pans leaving the engine smoking and rattling to the checkered flag.
