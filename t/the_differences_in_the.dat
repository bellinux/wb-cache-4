5|$|The {{theology}} of Huldrych Zwingli {{was based on}} the Bible, taking scripture as the inspired word of God and placing its authority higher than what he saw as human sources such as the ecumenical councils and the church fathers. He also recognised the human element within the inspiration noting <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canonical gospels.

5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, motion control, cinematics, visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization tool, and a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 which reads all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. The engine is highly customizable and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> target systems' video memory and microarchitecture still necessitate fine-tuning adjustments in the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E
30|$|As for <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pattern {{south of}} the peak (see Fig.  4 a), the cause is {{probably}} due to <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> density and location of the GPS network used (see Table  1) which results in more negative contours <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south <b>in</b> Fig.  3 b.|$|R

5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
5|$|In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v.

The Court rejected {{the application of the}} basic features doctrine owing to <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> making of the Singapore Constitution and the Indian Constitution, {{and the fact that the}} framers of the Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for limitations to be placed on Parliament's power of amendment. The Court also held that, in any case, there had been no violation of the Constitution's basic features on the facts of the case. On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the case on other grounds, and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the basic features doctrine applies in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} iconography for Mahavira is from {{archaeological sites}} in the north Indian city of Mathura. These are variously dated from the 1stcentury BC to the 2ndcentury AD.

5|$|While {{serving as}} the Eton coach, Hirst also worked with young Yorkshire players during the school holidays, and {{maintained}} his coaching connection with the county until shortly before his death. Despite <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> backgrounds of the players, Hirst was equally respected at Eton and when he acted as a coach to the Yorkshire team. At Yorkshire Hirst worked with young players in the cricket nets at Headingley, took charge of indoor trials during the winter, and travelled with the team as coach on a tour to Jamaica in 1936. Many Yorkshire players, with vastly differing temperaments, came under his influence and improved as players. One of Hirst's most notable achievements as a coach was improving the bowling of George Macaulay {{to the point where}} he became a key member of the Yorkshire team.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first named by Moses Ashley Curtis as Boletus ananas in 1848, based on {{specimens}} he found near the Santee River, in South Carolina. In 1909, William Murrill described the new genus Boletellus and made Boletellus ananas the type species. According to Murrill, the taxon Boletus isabellinus, described by Charles Horton Peck in 1897 from specimens collected in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, is a synonym of B.ananas; Peck described this species from undeveloped specimens. Wally Snell later doubted Murrill's conclusion in a 1933 publication; he considered <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spore structure {{too great to}} consider the species conspecific with B.ananas, although he admitted {{it was impossible to}} come to any definitive conclusions until mature fruit bodies and spore prints were available for study. Rolf Singer and colleagues (1992) suggested the name Boletellus coccineus for Boletellus ananas. Singer created this name, however, in the mistaken belief that the earliest available name for the taxon was Boletus coccineus, proposed by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838. However, Fries’s name is an illegitimate later homonym (compare with Boletus coccineus, named by Bulliard in 1791), and Singer’s combination is actually based on Strobilomyces coccineus, named by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1888. The earliest available name for the species is therefore Boletus ananas M.A. Curtis 1848, the basionym of Boletellus ananas.|$|E
