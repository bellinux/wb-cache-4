2500|$|The National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century (MAXXI for short), in Rome, was {{designed}} and built between 1998 and 2010. The main theme of its architecture {{is the sense of}} movement; [...] Everything in the structure seems to be moving and flowing. The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving white walls and an austere black and white colour scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade. Rowan Moore of The Guardian of London described its form as [...] "bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other. The imagery is of flow and movement and it resembles a demented piece of transport architecture. Inside, black steel stairs and bridges, their undersides glowing with white light, fly across a void. <b>They</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> off to the galleries, which are themselves works of frozen motion. The design is intended to generate what Hadid called [...] "confluence, interference and turbulence", ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We have {{at least}} found each other, John," [...] she replied, [...] "and our last days have been spent together. My only prayer now is that if <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> they do not leave me." ...|$|E
6000|$|A-Kor {{looked at}} him closely. [...] "Your own mother would never know you!" [...] he said; [...] "but tell me, what has transpired since <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>you</b> away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hush! What {{good would}} that do? A boy like <b>you?</b> Unless <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>you</b> in hand {{to make you}} a traitor, and offered you your lands if you would swear {{allegiance}} to King Edward, as he calls himself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{young man}} is givin' it to you straight, Abe," [...] replied Tom Dillon, {{pointing}} to Roger. [...] "And these are his friends--all true blue to the core. These other fellers are first-class swindlers. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>you</b> in good an' proper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you,</b> if you won't go? And if {{you should}} go, what good would it do, if you were only to find me here when you came back, {{just the same as}} you left me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{one point}} that we must know," [...] said he. [...] "Are they going to butcher the lot of us, or only Huddlestone? Did <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> for him, or fire at you for your own beaux yeux?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Them coaliers {{is enough}} to make any one swear," [...] said Cap'n George. [...] "If it's any ways fair weather they won't take you outside, and they cut you down from twenty-five dollars to two dollars if <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> inside." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My child, I {{have heard}} the secret {{complaints}} of the chiefs and their mutterings that <b>they</b> will <b>take</b> <b>you</b> and kill you, perhaps soon. While I am alive they are afraid, but when I die <b>they</b> will <b>take</b> <b>you</b> and kill you. I advise {{you to go back}} to Kohala." [...] "I have left you the god; there is your wealth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>they</b> <b>took</b> those chaps then it's likely <b>they</b> will <b>take</b> <b>you</b> now--unless, of course, {{they have}} all the men they want--which I doubt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} I am young and in health," [...] said the boy, [...] "that I more nourish the thoughts, that are born {{of my youth}} and my health. I am fresh from my Maker, soul and body unwrinkled. On thy sick couch, old man, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>thee</b> at advantage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{do we do}} with it now? Ay can't go back to the Kincaid. [...] Rokoff {{would have}} me shot; but you can go back. Ay take you to the sea, and then some of these black men <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to the ship--eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|No, no! It is no use {{trying to}} get out of it. They measure you, and bang your chest and your back, they look at your eyes and make you open your mouth to look at your teeth, but anyhow <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> away for three years.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Wild Bill's {{men come}} on, {{and you give}} them the slip, cry thrice like the 'Bob White,'" [...] said Moore; [...] "if <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you,</b> cry once. If you get off, run {{straight}} to Clayville, and give this note to the officer commanding the cavalry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{hear about}} those children, child, whom I saw running {{about at the}} house where <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>you</b> in, poor dear boy, after your dreadful fall?" [...] says Maria, as they paced the common. [...] "Oh, that fall, Harry! I thought I should have died when I saw it! You needn't squeeze one's arm so. You know you don't care for me?" ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. I {{was very}} {{innocent}} in those days. I thought that when two people loved one another they married. I wasn't a Eurasian then, George. I was {{like any other}} English girl. If you'd married me I shouldn't be what I am now. But <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>you</b> away from me. You never even said good-bye to me. You wrote and told me you'd been transferred to Canton.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} bus routes in the city. <b>They</b> will <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to Metro Manila, Batangas, Laguna, and other {{surrounding}} provinces, cities and towns.|$|R
6000|$|... “Maybe I have, maybe I haven’t. It’s {{too soon}} to see. I can’t tell this season. Every one says I’ve got to wait till next, to see if it’s the same. Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> right up {{for a few weeks}} and then just drop you anywhere. You’ve got to make it a square thing somehow—to drive in a nail.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our courier says <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> {{right up}} to the castle," [...] the young girl continued. [...] "We were going last week, but my mother gave out. She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia. She said she couldn't go. Randolph wouldn't go either; he says he doesn't think much of old castles. But I guess we'll go this week, if we can get Randolph." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not, at present," [...] {{the surgeon}} said decidedly. [...] "Possibly, in ten days, you might without danger be so carried, {{providing}} <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> in short stages and with easy-paced horses; but I {{should say that}} it would be still better, were you to be carried on men's shoulders. There is never any difficulty in hiring men, and you could get relays every eight or ten miles, while {{it would be difficult to}} get horses accustomed to such work." ...|$|E

60|$|GERMAN. [Abruptly] These fellows--if {{you treat}} {{them in this}} manner, at once <b>they</b> <b>take</b> liberties. <b>You</b> see, you will not get your beer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; they can't do that. <b>They</b> wouldn't <b>take</b> <b>you</b> in at {{the county}} jail, but they might make a prison of Puritan Grange. I don't say they will, but they might try it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite certain; if {{you were}} well enough, I would give you a sharp pinch. If {{you are willing to}} venture, I will make my {{preparations}} at once. I have to send to the village; but in three days I shall be ready and, the first night after that the men manage to be on guard together behind, we shall be here. It may be a week, it may be more but, at any rate, don't worry about it if <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> away suddenly. I shall try {{to get you out of}} their hands, somehow." ...|$|E
60|$|At present these burning bushes stand chiefly {{along the}} edge of the meadows, or I {{distinguish}} them afar on the hillsides here and there. Sometimes you will see many small ones in a swamp turned quite crimson when all other trees around are still perfectly green, and the former appear so much the brighter for it. <b>They</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> by surprise, as you are going by on one side, across the fields, thus early in the season, as if it were some gay encampment of the red men, or other foresters, of whose arrival you had not heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{should only}} be able to stay there about two months or a little more, and then I should have to go into a house. I know a very respectable place, where they have a most {{superior}} class of people, and <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> for four guineas a week and no extras. Of course the doctor's extra, but that's all. A friend of mine went there, and the lady who keeps it is a thorough lady. I mean to tell her that my husband's an officer in India and I've come to London for my baby, because it's better for my health." ...|$|E
6000|$|Har: Is not thy Nation {{subject to}} our Lords? [...] Thir Magistrates confest it, when <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>thee</b> [...] As a League-breaker and deliver'd bound [...] Into our hands: for hadst thou not {{committed}} [...] Notorious murder on those thirty men [...] At Askalon, who never did thee harm, [...] Then like a Robber stripdst them of thir robes? [...] The Philistines, when thou hadst broke the league, [...] Went up with armed powers thee only seeking, [...] 1190 [...] To others did no violence nor spoil.|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>you</b> {{because of}} that," [...] Sir Oliver pursued, as if communing with himself. [...] "Being in ignorance perhaps of his deserts, deeming him a saint and martyr, they {{resolved}} to avenge him upon you, and dragged you hither for that purpose." [...] He sighed. [...] "Well, well, Master Leigh, I make {{no doubt that}} knowing yourself for a rascal you have all your life been preparing your neck for a noose; so this will {{come as no surprise}} to you." ...|$|R
60|$|MARGARET. Hold me tight, Daddy, I 'm frightened. I think <b>they</b> want to <b>take</b> <b>you</b> {{away from}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't do that, dear. You are a {{long way}} from your father's house, and they may not know his name; so do not talk about flogging, but only about the money they will get if <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> back. They are poor men, they have had a great deal to suffer, and have been made very savage; so it is best for you to speak kindly and softly to them. Now, dear, let us turn down that collar, so that they can see your face, and take your things off your head, and then go out and speak to them. They are close here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Knight," [...] said Flammock, [...] "I {{am pleased}} you have put your trust {{so far in}} a plain handicraftsman. For the Welsh, I am come from a land for which we were compelled--yearly compelled--to {{struggle}} with the sea; and they who {{can deal with the}} waves in a tempest, need not fear an undisciplined people in their fury. Your daughter shall be as dear to me as mine own; and in that faith you may prick forth--if, indeed, you will not still, like a wiser man, shut gate, down portcullis, up drawbridge, and let your archers and my crossbows man the wall, and tell the knaves you are not the fool that <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Slay me!" [...] begged Ajor. [...] "Let me die at thy loved hands {{rather than}} beneath the knife of this hateful thing, for he will kill me. He has sworn to kill me. Last night he {{captured}} me, and when {{later he would}} have his way with me, I struck him with my fists and with my knife I stabbed him, and then I escaped, leaving him raging in pain and thwarted desire. Today they searched for me and found me; and as I fled, Du-seen ran after me crying that he would slay me. Kill me, my Tom, and then fall upon thine own spear, for they will kill you horribly if <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} it over, Moore," [...] he said; [...] "and {{it seems to me}} the best plan will be to allow you to go quietly away. Your conduct in the fight in the cave in itself showed that you were not voluntarily with the others; and I do not think, therefore, that it is necessary to report you among the prisoners. I suppose the Red Captain's gang have not done any unlawful act beyond taking part in the still business since <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>you</b> away from home?" ...|$|R
60|$|I have {{suffered}} so--not seein' you. Don't leave me again--don't! Stay here. Isn't it {{good to be}} together?--Oh! Poor Larry! How tired you look!--Stay with me. I am so frightened all alone. So frightened <b>they</b> will <b>take</b> <b>you</b> from me.|$|R
5000|$|Gray got his {{nickname}} Dolly from the 19th century song Nellie Gray, composed by Benjamin Hanby. One {{line in the}} song goes darling Nellie Gray, <b>they</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>you</b> away. His teammates mangled and distorted it darling and it became [...] "Dolly." ...|$|R
