40|$|This is {{the first}} study to {{demonstrate}} significant differences between two natural Trinidadian guppy populations in susceptibility to a pathogenic monogenean parasite, Gyrodactylus turnbulli. Following experimental infection with an isogenic laboratory culture of G. turnbulli, fish from <b>the</b> Upper Aripo (<b>UA)</b> lost parasites more slowly and carried up to {{three times as many}} parasites at peak infection than did those from the Lower Aripo (LA). <b>The</b> <b>UA</b> <b>population</b> appeared to be more susceptible than the LA fish, even though fish of both populations were naïve to this particular laboratory strain of G. turnbulli and had not encountered any gyrodactylid infection for at least 65 days. The parasite infection reduced the feeding response and feeding activity of UA and LA fish to a similar extent. Our findings suggest that this ectoparasite may have an important impact on the evolutionary biology of guppies (and possibly of other teleosts), particularly as the prevalence of Gyrodactylus infection in natural populations may be as high as 50 %. We discuss the role of parasite infections on natural and sexual selection, the good genes model and the implications for immunogenetics in small genetically isolated host population...|$|R

40|$|Hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), {{which are}} {{distributed}} throughout the world's oceans, have undergone drastic declines across their range, largely due to anthropogenic factors. Assessing sizes, genetic variability and structure of their populations at global and regional levels {{is critical to the}} development of conservation management strategies. Here, nuclear and mitochondrial markers were used to analyse patterns of parentage and population structure in hawksbill turtles in United Arab Emirates (UAE) waters, utilizing samples from two life stages (hatchlings and juveniles), and to compare <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population</b> with neighboring populations. Weak genetic differentiation was detected between juveniles and hatchlings and between the nesting sites of Dubai and Sir Bu Nair. Parentage analysis suggested that only 53 females and 74 – 80 males contributed to the hatchlings from 67 nests across three nesting sites in UAE (Dubai, Sir Bu Nair, Abu Dhabi). No females were identified as nesting in more than one location. In Dubai and Abu Dhabi, single paternity was the norm (75 %), whereas on Sir Bu Nair, multiple paternity was detected in the majority of nests (67 %). Polygyny was also frequently detected on Sir Bu Nair (15 % of the overall number of males), but not in the other nesting sites. Comparison of <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population</b> with published data from other populations suggests that population structure exists both within the Gulf and between the Gulf and Indian Ocean populations, and that <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population</b> has lower genetic variability than the Seychelles population. Finally, the data suggest that <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population,</b> and the Gulf population overall, experienced a bottleneck/founder event. The observed overall low genetic variability, evidence of population structure in the Gulf, and strong differentiation between the Gulf and the Indian Ocean populations, raises concerns about the sustainability of this species in this near-enclosed basin.

40|$|AbstractTo {{carry out}} their duties more effectively, health care {{professionals}} in the UAE often ask about the population structure and the main causes of mortality and morbidity in the country. This paper summarizes {{what is known about}} these topics drawing on secondary data sources that are available in the public domain, including census data, population estimates, births and deaths, proportionate mortality, age-standardized mortality rates and disability adjusted life-years. There are inconsistencies and flaws in some of this data which this paper will highlight and attempt to explain. Since 2005, <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population</b> has grown substantially owing to high natural growth and high net inward migration and is currently estimated to be about 8. 2 million. In 2008, injuries, heart disease, neoplasms and cerebrovascular disease accounted for 57 % of deaths, and this is well known. Less is reported about the risk of death, disease, injury and disability. The population of the UAE is diverse, and there are variations in mortality and morbidity risk by age-group, sex and nationality. The authors recommend improvements in the timeliness, completeness and consistency of data. They conclude that better data will encourage more analysis which will generate health intelligence leading to health improvement for <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population...</b>|$|E

40|$|The United Arab Emirates (UAE) {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on desalination for water supply in urban areas, which comes at significant financial and environmental costs. Therefore, reducing the demand for water is a strategic objective of water authorities in the UAE. The concentration of <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population</b> in multi-story buildings in urban areas makes residential water conservation, including greywater recycling, a highly attractive option for reducing water demand and wastewater generation. However, the unique composition of <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population</b> poses challenge to adopting water conservation policies that are suitable for the UAE national and expatriate sectors of the population. Furthermore, the current water recycling policies and legal framework do not encourage greywater recycling for internal use in residential buildings. In this study, a framework for assessing the potential and feasibility of water conservation, including greywater recycling, in multi-storey and detached dwellings in the UAE was developed and discussed. The results confirmed that significant potential existed for reducing the residential water demand in the UAE through adopting simple water conservation measures and greywater recycling in multi-story buildings. The discussion was extended to proposing greywater recycling systems suitable for multi-story buildings in the UAE. Such systems involve partial greywater recycling from the higher floors of multi-storey buildings to serve the toilet flushing needs of the whole building and locating greywater treatment systems on the roofs of buildings...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{indigenous}} positive psychology {{that addresses}} the human development needs of Emirati and expatriate residents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is proposed. A positive psychology approach leverages inherent, yet often neglected, social, cultural, and religious strengths to mobilize growth. Yet, psychology practitioners and researchers frequently focus on ill-being and weakness. Further, many psychology practitioners are non-Emiratis who tend to employ traditional psychological models from the West, which are perhaps incongruous to the UAE context; hence our call for an indigenous positive psychology. Psychological models rooted in Western notions of secular individualism run contrary to the UAE’s collectivistic and non-secular orientations. Moreover, focusing on the negatives, avoiding religion, and endorsing Western ideals of normality (disguised though they may be), can harm the psychological fabric of <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population.</b> Although the field of psychology is expanding, a vision for practice and research is imperative; thus, {{the introduction of a}} framework for the development of an indigenous positive psychology that supports culturally appropriate strengths is relevant and timely. To do so, the tenets of positive psychology are reviewed, and steps necessary for the development of a...|$|E

Seeds from the Egyptian population germinated significantly greater and faster than those of UAE. Seeds stored for four months at room temperatures have little dormancy and germinate at wide range of temperatures and light conditions, but seeds stored four months in the natural habitat lost their ability to germinate and rotted 10 days after incubation.

40|$|Background: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} country {{composed of a}} multinational population with varying educational backgrounds, religious beliefs, and cultural practices, which pose a challenge for population-based public health strategies. A number of public health issues significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in the UAE. This article summarises {{the findings of a}} panel of medical and public health specialists from UAE University and various government health agencies commissioned to report on the health status of <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population.</b> Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to retrieve peer-reviewed articles on health in the UAE, and unpublished data were provided by government health authorities and local hospitals. Results: The panel reviewed and evaluated all available evidence to list and rank (1 =highest priority) the top four main public health issues: 1) Cardiovascular disease accounted for more than 25 % of deaths in 2010; 2) Injury caused 17 % of mortality for all age groups in 2010; 3) Cancer accounted for 10 % of all deaths in 2010, and the incidence of all cancers is projected to double by 2020; and 4) Respiratory disorders were the second most common non-fatal condition in 2010. Conclusion: The major public health challenges posed by certain personal (e. g. ethnicity, family history), lifestyle, occupational, and environmental factors associated with the development of chronic disease are not isolated to the UAE; rather, they form part of a global health problem, which requires international collaboration and action. Future research should focus on population-based public health interventions that target the factors associated with the development of various chronic diseases...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{question in the}} analysis of fertility is does the type of marital union matter? Is women's fertility affected by their marital union type? Does being in a monogamous or polygynous union have any effect on the number of children women will have? What is the nature of this difference? Does the social setting play a role? And, what kind of role does it have? Most studies, especially those based on African societies, where polygyny is most prevalent, note that female fertility is negatively associated with polygyny. This dissertation examines the polygyny-fertility relationship among married women in a different social setting, namely in an oil-rich country, that is, the United Arab Emirates. Using data from the 1999 National Family Survey for the Characteristics of the Native Households in the UAE, I was able to examine the effect of fertility using two statistical methods to model my dependent variables: Logistic Regression and Negative Binomial Regression. My findings show that when controlling for numerous biological and social variables, polygyny has a positive effect on women?s current fertility, which is the likelihood of having a baby in the past 12 months, but a negative effect on women?s cumulative fertility, which is the children ever born to them. However, when the number of wives in the union was introduced into the models, polygyny effect on women?s current and cumulative fertility has disappeared, i. e., polygyny no longer has a significant effect on women?s fertility. I discuss the implications of these findings for UAE national policy to increase the fertility of UAE women, an important consideration given that UAE nationals comprise only 20 percent of <b>the</b> <b>UAE</b> <b>population</b> in 2005...|$|E
