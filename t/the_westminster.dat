5|$|Meanwhile, the Cumberland Presbytery, also {{within the}} Kentucky Synod, faced a {{shortage}} of ministers and decided to license clergy candidates who were less educated than was typical and who could not subscribe completely to <b>the</b> <b>Westminster</b> Confession.

In 1810, ministers dissatisfied with {{the actions of the}} synod formed the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (CPC).

5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the covenant of works and covenant of grace. <b>The</b> <b>Westminster</b> Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works (sometimes called the covenant of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. <b>The</b> <b>Westminster</b> divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|E
5|$|George Reid {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in <b>the</b> <b>Westminster</b> tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.|$|E
