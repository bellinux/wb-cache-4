25|$|We {{look for}} a solid and impregnable barrier of the Democracies against the three Axis powers, and we refuse to accept the dictum that the Pacific {{struggle}} must {{be treated as a}} subordinate segment of the general conflict. By that it is not meant that any one of the other theatres of war is of less importance than the Pacific, but that Australia asks for a concerted plan evoking the greatest strength at the Democracies' disposal, determined upon hurling Japan back. The Australian Government, therefore regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say {{in the direction of the}} Democracies' fighting plan. Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom. We know the problems that the United Kingdom faces. We know the dangers of dispersal of strength, but we know too, that Australia can go and Britain can still hold on. We are, therefore, determined that Australia shall not go, and we shall exert all our energies towards the shaping of a plan, with the United States as its keystone, which will give <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>country</b> some confidence of being able to hold out until the tide of battle swings against the enemy.|$|E

Rubenstein commented [...] "I have always believed that this was an important document <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>country,</b> even though it wasn't drafted in our country.

500|$|Lord Curzon {{decided that}} [...] "so rare a {{treasure}} [...] should neither be lost <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>country</b> nor desecrated by irreverent hands". Curzon made enquiries about buying the castle, but Cubitt {{did not wish}} to sell. However, after Cubitt's death, Curzon was able to make a deal with Cubitt's son, and he bought Bodiam Castle and its lands in 1916. Curzon began a programme of investigation at Bodiam in 1919, and with architect William Weir restored parts of the castle. The moat, on average about [...] deep but [...] deep in the southeast corner, was drained and [...] of mud and silt removed; during excavations the original footings of the bridges to the castle were discovered. Nearby hedges and fences were removed to provide an unobscured view of the castle. There were excavations in the interior, and a well was discovered {{in the basement of the}} southwest tower. Vegetation was cleared, stonework repaired, and the original floor level re-established throughout the castle. A cottage was built to provide a museum to display the finds from the excavations and a home for a caretaker. Bodiam Castle was given to the National Trust in 1925.|$|E

Because of that, I have sent one of my samurai, Hasekura Rokuemon, as my representative to accompany Luis Sotelo across the seas to Rome, to give you a stamp of obedience and to kiss your feet. Further, as our country and Nueva España are neighbouring countries, could you intervene so that we can discuss with the King of Spain, for the benefit of dispatching missionaries across the seas."

On one occasion, while Northrup was pregnant, Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion. She recalled that [...] "with or without an argument, there'd be an upsurge of violence. The veins in his forehead would engorge" [...] and he would hit her [...] "out of the blue", breaking her eardrum in one attack. Despite this, she still [...] "felt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged. I felt as though he had given so much <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>country</b> and I couldn't even bring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor, had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar." [...] He told her that he didn't want to be married [...] "for I can buy my friends whenever I want them" [...] but he could not divorce either, as the stigma would hurt his reputation. Instead, he said, if Northrup really loved him she should kill herself.|$|E

500|$|Nelson's {{passage from}} Sicily to Alexandria was uneventful, the journey taking six days. Due to {{his lack of}} frigates, Nelson was unable to scout to the flanks of his advance {{and as a result}} only spoke with three {{merchant}} ships, none of which had useful information about the French fleet. The lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 June, when the British fleet sighted four sails to the southeast. Although Captain Thomas Thompson of HMS Leander requested permission to investigate the strangers, Nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading, believing the French to be five days ahead and wishing to reach Alexandria as rapidly as possible. Had British frigates been available to approach and investigate the distant squadron, they might have discovered that they were scouts for the main French fleet, which was only a short distance away. The French frigate had sighted the British fleet and reported its presence to Bonaparte, who adjusted his convoy's direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory. As a result, Nelson's fleet passed north of the French to the east of Malta during the night in a heavy mist. Although Nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard Orient, his lookouts did not observe the French ships and the British fleet continued ahead without deviating. When dawn broke the following day, Bonaparte's diversion to the northeast had taken his convoy {{out of sight of the}} British fleet, which continued to the southeast undisturbed. On 28 June, Mutine [...] arrived at Alexandria ahead of Nelson's fleet, and discovered that the French fleet was not in the harbour. Once the main fleet had arrived, attempts were made to contact the British Consul George Baldwin, but these failed as he had been dismissed by the British government shortly before and had left the city. As a result, official diplomatic channels were closed to Nelson. A message warning of the French approach was carried to the Ottoman governor Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim by Hardy in Mutine. Kurayyim replied that he had not seen the French fleet, and that he would enforce the Ottoman Empire's neutrality and forbid both the British and the French from entering the harbour or landing on the coast. He was dismissive of the British warnings: [...] "It is impossible that the French should come <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>country.</b> They have no business here and we are not at war with them." [...] Without Baldwin no further entries could be made, and when there was still no sign of the French on the morning of 29 June, Nelson decided to turn back northeast and take another pass across the central Mediterranean towards Corfu, following a more northerly course than his first voyage.|$|E
