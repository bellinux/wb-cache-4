25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that Herod was born around 73 BCE in Idumea, south of Judea.. However, some authors <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in about 72/71 BCE. He {{was the second}} son of Antipater the Idumaean, a high-ranking official under ethnarch Hyrcanus II, and Cypros, a Nabatean. Herod's father was by descent an Edomite whose ancestors had converted to Judaism. Herod was raised as a Jew.|$|E

25|$|The royal {{inscriptions}} of the Assyrian king Adad-nirari I (c. 13071275 BC) relate how the vassal king Shattuara of Mitanni rebelled {{and committed}} hostile acts against Assyria. How this Shattuara {{was related to}} the dynasty of Partatama is unclear. Some scholars <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the second son of Artatama II, and the brother of Shattiwazza's one-time rival Shuttarna. Adad-nirari claims to have captured King Shattuara and brought him to Ashur, where he took an oath as a vassal. Afterwards, he was allowed to return to Mitanni, where he paid Adad-nirari regular tribute. This must have happened during the reign of the Hittite King Mursili II, but there is no exact date.|$|E
25|$|The {{plaintiff}} in that suit, Robert Blankenship, charged that DeLay {{and a third}} partner in Albo Pest Control had breached the partnership agreement by trying to force {{him out of the}} business without buying him out. Blankenship filed suit, charging DeLay and the other partner with breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, wrongful termination, and loss of corporate expectancy. While being deposed in that suit, DeLay claimed that he did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an officer or director of Albo and that he believed that he had resigned two or three years previously. However, his congressional disclosure forms, including one filed subsequent to the deposition, stated that he was either president or chairman of the company between 1985 and 1994. Blankenship also alleged that Albo money had been spent on DeLay's congressional campaigns, in violation of federal and state law. DeLay and Blankenship settled for an undisclosed sum. Blankenship's attorney said that had he known about the congressional disclosure forms, he would have referred the case to the Harris County district attorney's office for a perjury prosecution.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of July 9, 1937 Gershwin {{collapsed}} in Harburg's house, {{where he had been}} working on the score of The Goldwyn Follies. He was rushed back to Cedars of Lebanon, and fell into a coma. Only then did his doctors <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> suffering from a brain tumor. Leonore called George's close friend Emil Mosbacher and explained the dire need to find a neurosurgeon. Mosbacher immediately called pioneering neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in Boston, who, retired for several years by then, recommended Dr. Walter Dandy, who was on a boat fishing in Chesapeake Bay with the governor of Maryland. Mosbacher then called the White House and had a Coast Guard cutter sent to find the governor's yacht and bring Dandy quickly to shore. Mosbacher then chartered a plane and flew Dandy to Newark Airport, where he was to catch a plane to Los Angeles; however, by that time, Gershwin's condition was critical and the need for surgery immediate. In the early hours of July 11th doctors at Cedars removed a large brain tumour, believed to have been a glioblastoma, but Gershwin died on the morning of July 11, 1937, at the age of 38.|$|E

Historians <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> probably the son of the outlawed South Saxon thegn Wulfnoth Cild.

It was conducted quietly and behind the scenes, to avoid the appearance that his bid for governorship was less than genuine, and also to avoid an internal Republican feud with the incumbent US senator William D. Washburn. Before the 17th Amendment went into effect in 1914, U.S. senators were elected by their state legislatures. Nelson's {{campaign for}} Minnesota's second Senate seat was a [...] "still hunt," [...] consisting of building support among incoming legislators while letting Washburn <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> running unopposed for the Republican nomination.|$|E

Moore's [...] "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." [...] Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as Glory and Youngblood, as well as a three-part mini-series known as Judgment Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying [...] "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him.

2500|$|The account offers short {{characterizations}} {{of many other}} writers who crossed paths with Cioculescu, including critics such as Lovinescu (who [...] "had the capacity to contain his feelings and maintain his smile") and Alexandru Rosetti ("of an unsettling beauty" [...] and [...] "a gentleman"), novelists such as Camil Petrescu (depicted as a megalomaniac) and Mihail Sorbul (whose appearance reportedly made a waiter <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> exiled Soviet politico Leo Trotsky), poets such as Ion Barbu (who did most of his work in coffeehouses), Păstorel Teodoreanu (who had memorized and could recite over 500 lines from the poetry of Paul Verlaine). Among the more unusual aspects of his memoir pieces is their frank discussion of substance abuse and drug addiction among his colleagues, in particular Ion Barbu's heavy use of narcotics, inhalants and caffeine. In his depiction of Bucharest's bohemian scene, the author also sketches the portraits of writers Alexandru Cazaban, Victor Eftimiu, Oscar Lemnaru, Adrian Maniu, Ion Minulescu, Cezar Petrescu, Liviu Rebreanu, and of actor Puiu Iancovescu. The book includes recollections of many other literary figures whom Cioculescu befriended or was acquainted with, among them Constantin Beldie, Marthe Bibesco, Lucian Blaga, Pompiliu Constantinescu, Dinu Pillat, Tudor Şoimaru and Ionel Teodoreanu.|$|E

In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, [...] "I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will." [...] In Wittgenstein's Culture and Value, it is found, [...] "Is what I am doing [...] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." [...] His close friend Norman Malcolm would write, [...] "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers."

2500|$|After Frémont's forces halted their advance {{into the}} Valley {{following}} McDowell, Jackson next turned to defeating Banks. On May 21, Jackson marched his command east from New Market and proceeded northward. Their speed of forced marching {{was typical of}} the campaign and earned his infantrymen the nickname of [...] "Jackson's foot cavalry". He sent his horse cavalry directly north to make Banks <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to attack Strasburg, but his plan was to defeat the small outpost at Front Royal and quickly attack Banks's line of communication at Harpers Ferry. On May 23, at the Battle of Front Royal, Jackson's army surprised and overran the pickets of the 1,000-man Union garrison, capturing nearly 700 of the garrison while suffering fewer than forty casualties himself. Jackson's victory forced Banks from Strasburg into a rapid retreat towards Winchester. Although Jackson attempted to pursue, his troops were exhausted and looted Union supply trains, slowing them down immensely. On May 25, at the First Battle of Winchester, Banks's army was attacked by converging Confederate columns and was soundly defeated, losing over 1,300 casualties and much of his supplies (including 9,000 small arms, a half million rounds of ammunition, and several tons of supplies); they withdrew north across the Potomac River. Jackson attempted pursuit but was unsuccessful, due to looting by Ashby's cavalry and the exhaustion of his infantry; after a few days of rest, he followed Banks's forces as far as Harpers Ferry, where he skirmished with the Union garrison.|$|E
