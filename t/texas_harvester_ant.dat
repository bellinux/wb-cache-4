40|$|Western <b>harvester</b> <b>ants,</b> Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, are seed eaters {{that occur}} in short- and mid-grass prairies. <b>Harvester</b> <b>ants</b> are {{efficient}} seed predators but {{they may also be}} seed dispersers. We examined what ants collect to address that question. We also studied how different cattle grazing intensities affected <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> nest densities. Items collected by western <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> foragers returning to their nests were categorized as non-seeds, seeds, and nothing. <b>Harvester</b> <b>ants</b> collected large amounts of non-seeds (48 %), followed by seeds (33 %) and nothing (19 %). Western <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> tolerate some environmental stress caused by grazing because nest densities were highest in moderately grazed grasslands. Interestingly, other aboveground arthropods in Colorado grasslands are reported to decrease in response to grazing, especially moderate to heavy grazing regimes. <b>Harvester</b> <b>ants</b> prefer to collect seeds but do not collect them exclusively...|$|R

25|$|Pogonomyrmex {{barbatus}} is {{a species}} of <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> from the genus Pogonomyrmex. Its common names include red <b>ant</b> and red <b>harvester</b> <b>ant.</b> These large (5– to 7-mm) ants prefer arid chaparral habitats and are native to the Southwestern United States. Nests are made underground (up to 2.5 m deep) in exposed areas. Their diets consist primarily of seeds, and they consequently participate in myrmecochory, an ant-plant interaction through which the ants gain nutrients and the plants benefit through seed dispersal. Red <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> are often mistaken for fire ants, but are not closely related to any fire ant species, native or introduced.|$|R

25|$|Red <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> are a {{favorite}} food for desert horned lizards. <b>Harvester</b> <b>ants</b> defend their colonies vigorously against real or perceived attacks, whether by {{large or small}} animals.

40|$|Facilitation, {{when one}} species enhances the {{environment}} or performance of another species, can be highly localized in space. While facilitation in plant communities has been intensely studied, the role of facilitation in shaping animal communities is less well understood. In the Chihuahuan Desert, both kangaroo rats and <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> depend on the abundant seeds of annual plants. Kangaroo rats, however, are hypothesized to facilitate <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> through soil disturbance and selective seed predation rather than competing with them. I used a spatially explicit approach to examine whether a positive or negative interaction exists between banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) mounds and rough <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> (Pogonomyrmex rugosus) colonies. The presence of a scale-dependent interaction between mounds and colonies was tested by comparing fitted spatial point process models with and without interspecific effects. Also, the effect of proximity to a mound on colony mortality and spatial patterns of surviving colonies was examined. The spatial pattern of kangaroo rat mounds and <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> colonies was consistent with a positive interspecific interaction at small scales (, 10 m). Mortality risk of vulnerable, recently founded <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> colonies was lower when located close to a kangaroo rat mound and proximity to a mound partly predicted the spatial pattern of surviving colonies. My findings support localized facilitation of <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> by kangaroo rats, likely mediated through ecosystem engineering and foraging effects on plant cover and composition. The scale-dependent effect of kangaroo rats on abiotic and biotic factors appears to resul...|$|R

30|$|The {{increase}} in <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> numbers {{also seemed to}} cause an ant specialist, the horned lizard (Phrynosoma coronatum Blainville), to {{increase in}} number, but this observation was not formally quantified (Matsuda et al. 2011). Complicated trophic effects such as this would likely diminish with close proximity to human habitation as fewer <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> were found in postfire urban fragments (Suarez et al. 1998). In this case, {{it was thought that}} the decreases in native ants might be a result of competition and predation by invasive, irrigation-dependent Argentine ants. In contrast to the decreasing <b>harvester</b> <b>ant</b> numbers, postfire spider and carabid beetle numbers, two other predator groups, were positively correlated with Argentine ant abundance (Bolger et al. 2000).|$|R

We report a case of anaphylaxis in Tucson caused by a sting of Pogonomyrmex rugosus. In addition, due to the severity of their sting, <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> can also become a nuisance pest when they infest urban environments.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{completed}} during the summers of 2014 and 2015 to continue {{research on the}} relationship between <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> (Pogonomyrmex salinus) and slickspot peppergrass (Lepidium papilliferum). Slickspot peppergrass is a rare mustard endemic to south western Idaho. Over the past century, the species has declined in abundance, {{largely as a result of}} habitat degradation and fragmentation. In addition to these reasons for decline, seed foraging by <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> and plant destruction by <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> and small mammal herbivores have been recently indicated as potential factors. This study confirmed that <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> remove large numbers of L. papilliferum seeds. Specifically, we found that 90 – 100 % of the seeds produced by individual plants were often removed by ants, regardless of the number of seeds within the foraging range of a colony. Nevertheless, although intensive seed foraging was common, we estimated that the number of seeds available to individual ant colonies often exceeded the colony’s capacity for seed removal. Thus, when seed numbers are high, predator satiation may be a viable mechanism for L. papilliferum seeds to escape seed removal by <b>harvester</b> <b>ants.</b> In addition to documenting the occurrence and intensity of seed removal by ants, we confirmed that small mammals and <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> sometimes act as herbivores on leaf and (in the case of mammals) root tissues. Mortality as a result of herbivory was at times high, although understanding the causes of variation in patterns of herbivory will require further study. In addition to investigating seed predation and herbivory on naturally occurring plants, we evaluated whether seed introductions represent a viable tool for recovery of slickspot peppergrass. We were successful in germinating L. papilliferum seeds, although our efforts were severely hampered by seed predation by <b>harvester</b> <b>ants.</b> In order for seed introductions to become a feasible approach to recovery efforts for L. papilliferum, a method to mitigate the effects of seed predation will be needed.

50|$|<b>Harvester</b> <b>ant</b> is {{a common}} name {{for any of the}} species or genera of ants that collect seeds (called seed predation), or {{mushrooms}} {{as in the case of}} Euprenolepis procera, which are stored in the nest in communal chambers called granaries. Seed harvesting by some desert ants is an adaptation to the lack of typical ant resources such as prey or honeydew from hemipterans. <b>Harvester</b> <b>ants</b> increase seed dispersal and protection, and provide nutrients that increase seedling survival of the desert plants. In addition, ants provide soil aeration through the creation of galleries and chambers, mix deep and upper layers of soil, and incorporate organic refuse into the soil.|$|R
50|$|About 70% of the Texas horned lizard's diet {{is made up}} of <b>harvester</b> <b>ants,</b> {{though they}} {{supplement}} these with termites, beetles, and grasshoppers.

25|$|The main {{food source}} for red <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> usually {{consists}} of seeds, which they hoard in great numbers.

Seed collection {{on behalf of the}} red <b>harvester</b> <b>ants</b> benefits their ecosystem through the process of myrmecochory, in which ants aid in the dispersal of seeds while foraging for food. Both plants and ants benefit from this relationship: the plants increase their dispersal range and density, while the ants benefit from acquiring nutrients and ensuring a more secure food supply in future harvests. This is typically understood as a mutualistic interaction. Dead insects are also collected during foraging.|$|R
