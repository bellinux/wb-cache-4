In December 2000, the Council approached {{the management of the}} neighbouring shopping centre, Port Central, about a possible joint venture on the site, and the Council endorsed further negotiations on 28 May 2001. <b>The</b> <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> was expected to cost around A$13.5 million, with the Council contributing A$7.3 million. <b>The</b> <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> collapsed in August 2002 because the Council was not prepared to accommodate the needs of their commercial partner to make the project viable, and decided to go it alone.

The costs blew out considerably by 28 June 2004, when the Council unanimously backed the project, outlays had already reached A$15A$20 million, and by late 2007 they had reached A$41.7 million. This was due to a range of factors including, that the Council bought and demolished neighbouring shops to make the facility big enough to include meeting rooms and conference facilities, and a drain built by convicts in the 19th century, and still in remarkably good condition, was discovered by archaeologists and needed to be preserved.|$|E

5|$|The CFM56 first ran in 1974. In April 1979, <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> had not {{received}} a single order in five years and was two weeks away from being dissolved.

The first engines entered service in 1982. Several fan blade failure incidents were experienced during the CFM56's early service, including one failure that was a cause of the Kegworth air disaster, and some engine variants experienced problems caused by flight through rain and hail. Both these issues were resolved with engine modifications.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s, Vestfoldfly never {{received}} a concession for a regular, scheduled flight from Sandefjord to Oslo. The {{reason was that}} the Skien-based Fjellfly held the concession for the routes from Oslo to Sandefjord, Tønsberg and Skien. Fjellfly never used its landing rights at Sandefjord, but nevertheless still hindered Vestfoldfly from starting a competing route. Skaunfelt eventually split his activity in two, demerging the aviation school and renaming it Den Norske Luftfartsskole, which remained in operation until 1999. The other activity was renamed Norsk Flytjeneste. In 1969, Norsk Flytjeneste and Jotun, a large Sandefjord-based industrial company, established Penguin Air Service, where Norsk Flytjeneste owned 25 percent of the shares. Penguin Air Service company bought a six-seat Piper PA-31 Navajo and started charter services for Jotun.

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to study}} the impact of {{cultural}} differences on the ownership structure of international <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> in China. It is reasoned that foreign investors, when faced with larger culture-related investment uncertainties, may have the incentive to acquire more control rights to contain the risks by acquiring more equity shares in <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> <b>ventures.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Data on international <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> in China were {{used to test the}} theory. The data contain 941 observations from Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjing, covering a 13 -year time span. Pooled ordinary least square is used in the model estimation. Findings – Cultural distance between China and foreign countries was found to increase the foreign equity share in <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> <b>ventures,</b> a finding contrary to traditional view. In addition, it was found that cultural distance in different dimensions does not play an equal role in affecting foreign equity shares. Last, there is significant evidence that the allocation of ownership between foreign and domestic investors in <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> is influenced by the investor's relative importance in supplying different types of resources. Originality/value – The paper introduces a new perspective into the study of culture and international <b>joint</b> <b>venture.</b> Foreign investors may be able to reduce investment risk by increasing equity shares, which gives them more internal control, in international <b>joint</b> <b>ventures.</b> In contrast, <b>the</b> traditional view is that larger cultural distance tends to discourage foreign equity ownership.
