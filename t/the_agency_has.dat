5|$|The River Board Act of 1950 {{sought to}} replace the Catchment Boards with larger organisations, and from 1950 the East Sussex River Board took over the {{responsibilities}} {{of most of the}} catchments in East Sussex, but the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board became part of the Kent River Board. Further changes followed the Water Resources Act 1963, and responsibility passed to the Kent and Sussex River Authorities in 1964. Ten years later, these structures were replaced by unitary authorities, who had responsibility for the supply of drinking water and for the drainage function of rivers. This lasted until the passing of the Water Act 1989, which split apart the two functions, and management of the river became the responsibility of the National Rivers Authority, Southern Region. Finally in April 1996, the National Rivers Authority was abolished with the formation of the Environment Agency. <b>The</b> <b>agency</b> <b>has</b> responsibility for drainage and water quality, {{and in the case of}} some rivers, it holds the navigation rights. The Rother is unusual, in that while it is under the jurisdiction of the Environment Agency, it is a free river, and so a licence is not required to use it. The Environment Agency also acts as the harbour authority for Rye Harbour, another unique situation, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs acts as a signatory to the Harbour of Rye Bylaws.|$|E
