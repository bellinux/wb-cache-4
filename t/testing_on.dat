5|$|Construction of {{the three}} {{prototype}}s began in late 1945 and the first prototype began manufacturer's <b>testing</b> <b>on</b> 30 December. The ground testing revealed that the engine exhaust caused a low-pressure area under the rear fuselage which caused the fighter to tilt tail-down during engine tests. The rigidly mounted heatshield caused {{the underside of the}} rear fuselage to deform because the steel and the duralumin skin of the fuselage had different expansion ratios when heated. The rear fuselage and the heatshield were both redesigned to eliminate these problems. On 23 March the prototype was trucked to the Flight Research Institute (LII)'s airfield at Ramenskoye to begin preparations for flight testing.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to some strengthening, there were alterations {{to the air}} intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an inflatable lip to smooth the intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of these devices, so they were replaced with conventional suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval <b>testing</b> <b>on</b> board the commando carrier HMS Bulwark in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The Kestrel became the prototype for pre-production Harriers.|$|E

On 19 February, West Mercia Police confirmed that a man had been arrested and was helping them with their inquiries. The following day, authorities announced that the suspect was English and had been arrested in Poole, Dorset in a joint operation between West Mercia and Dorset Police.

5|$|Symptomatic {{carriers}} of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a {{lower than normal}} blood clotting factor {{that can lead to}} heavy bleeding. DNA <b>testing</b> <b>on</b> the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they may have been afflicted by the disease as well. Alexei's hemophilia was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The PCA 3 <b>test</b> <b>on</b> urine {{can improve}} {{specificity}} in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and could prevent unnecessary prostate biopsies. In this study, we evaluated the PCA 3 <b>test</b> <b>on</b> prostatic fluid and compared {{this with the}} PCA 3 <b>test</b> <b>on</b> urine in a clinical research setting. METHODS: Prostatic fluid and urine samples from 67 men were collected following digital rectal examination (DRE). The sediments were analyzed using the quantitative APTIMA PCA 3 test. The results were compared with prostate biopsy results. RESULTS: Using a PCA 3 score of 66 as a cut-off value, the <b>test</b> <b>on</b> prostatic fluid had 65 % sensitivity {{for the detection of}} PCa, 82 % specificity and a negative predictive value of 82 %. At a cut-off value of 43, the <b>test</b> <b>on</b> urine had 61 % sensitivity, 80 % specificity and a negative predictive value of 80 %.
