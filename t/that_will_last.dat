5|$|Bolton Wanderers had a {{long-established}} {{partnership with}} sporting goods firm Reebok, which {{was formed in}} the town. Between 1997 and 2009 this partnership encompassed shirt sponsorship, kit manufacture and stadium naming rights. The combined shirt sponsorship (1990–2009) and kit manufacture (1993–2012) deals covering 22 years represent the longest kit partnership in English football history. The stadium's naming rights were held by Reebok since its opening in 1997 and was due to run {{until the end of}} the 2015–16 season. Bolton's kit manufacturer from the 2014–15 season changed to Italian sportswear brand Macron who also manufacture kits for clubs including Aston Villa, Lazio and Napoli. The stadium was also re-branded as the Macron Stadium from July 2014 in an agreement <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>last</b> for an initial four years.|$|E

5|$|The ground teams carry {{equipment}} on their person {{that they use}} while in the field. This equipment includes flashlights, signal mirrors, tactical vests, safety vests, and food <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>last</b> them at least 24hours. The equipment carried by ground teams varies much by the mission at hand. Urban direction finding (UDF) missions necessitate only a small kit of gear. But intensive mountain search and rescue can require packs that provide for up to 72 hours of operational supplies and tool for the location, rescue and extraction of lost or crashed parties. This gear includes the above, plus additional water, meals, and survival gear. Although a standardized list {{is provided by the}} national command, many teams modify the list to match the needs of the mission.|$|E

When a bird first {{returns to the}} colony it will dance with many partners, but {{after a number of}} years the number of birds an individual will interact with drops, until one partner is chosen and a pair is formed. They then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique to that one pair.

25|$|In 1975, after {{disputes}} with the Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP), nine teams {{pulled out of}} BAP's jurisdiction and founded the professional Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), taking along all the best players with them. This caused the BAP to send weakened teams in the subsequent international tournaments, as professionals {{are not allowed to}} play. The Filipinos fail to defend their Asian championship in 1975, with India earning a shock blowout win to deny the Philippines a top-4 finish. The Chinese won the championship, beginning their unbeaten championship run <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>last</b> into 1983. The nationals were denied of a top 4 finish in the 1977 Asian Championship, losing this time to Malaysia. The Philippines then hosted the 1978 FIBA World Championship, losing all of the games via blowouts to finish last in the final round.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{starts with}} a {{flattering}} question to the beloved—"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" [...] The beloved is [...] "more lovely and more temperate" [...] than a summer's day. The speaker lists some negative things about summer: it is short—"summer's lease hath all too short a date"—and sometimes the sun is too hot—"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines." [...] However, the beloved has beauty <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>last</b> forever, unlike the fleeting beauty of a summer's day. By putting his love's beauty into the form of poetry, the poet is preserving it forever. [...] "So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee." [...] The lover's beauty will live on, through the poem which will {{last as long as}} it can be read.|$|E

[...] Two days later, Coburn apologized, saying he wanted to congratulate the owners of Tonalist and adding, [...] "I wanted so much for [...] to win the Triple Crown for the people of America." [...] Steve Haskin of Blood-Horse magazine summarized the race stating, [...] "when I think back... the one image <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>last</b> forever will be of an exhausted colt walking back through the tunnel with a bloodstained foot, his head down and breathing hard, and every vein protruding from his sweat-soaked body.

500|$|Joseph {{increased}} {{her teaching}} commitments by often deputising for Holst, both at James Allen's and at SPGS. She also continued in her {{role of the}} composer's amanuensis, and was invited to attend the private premiere of The Planets, on 29 September 1918 at the Queen's Hall, where Adrian Boult conducted the Queen's Hall orchestra. She later wrote: [...] "From the moment of Mars... to the last sound of Neptune, {{it was a big}} thing <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>last</b> all our lives, I think". She was able to draw on her classical education at Girton when she helped to translate the [...] apocryphal work The Acts of John from the original Greek, to provide the text for Holst's Hymn of Jesus (1917); for the same work she prepared a vocal score and an arrangement for piano, strings and organ. She and Holst combined to produce a women's voices version (two sopranos and an alto) of William Byrd's Mass for Three Voices, and Joseph worked alone to produce an orchestral accompaniment for Samuel Wesley's Sing Aloud with Gladness. This latter work was prepared for the 1917 Whitsun musical festival, one of an annual series of such festivals that Holst masterminded, first at his home town of [...] Thaxted, in later years at assorted venues including Dulwich, Chichester and Canterbury. Joseph became a key figure in these festivals, as organiser, performer and composer. At Thaxted in 1918 two of her compositions were performed: Hymn for female voices (now lost), and an orchestral piece, Barbara Noel's Morris, which Joseph wrote to mark her friendship with the daughter of Conrad Noel, Thaxted's vicar.|$|E
