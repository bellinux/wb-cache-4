Base on a review of the literature, majority of the studies had identified a negative relationship between leadership style and employees ’ turnover intention in various fields of industries. This study was conducted on the academic staff in a community college in Malaysia. The results of this study did not support the outcome of previous research. Although, transformational and transformational leadership styles are found to have negative relationship to employee turnover intention but the correlation of these two variables are not significant.

40|$|The study {{sought to}} advance {{knowledge}} between leadership style and teacher's use of technology. This quantitative research study investigated the relationship between principal leadership style determined by the MLQ (Bass & Avolio, 1989) and the perceived Role Messages (Katz & Kahn, 1978) teachers' receive {{about the use of}} technology in English and Mathematics. The Role Messages teachers receive from the principal influence the teachers' use of technology. A qualitative instrument, The Role Message Perception Interview for Administrator (RMPI-A) was used to confirm principal's leadership style in the <b>transformation,</b> <b>transactional,</b> and passive/avoidant areas. A transformational leader builds trust, inspires teachers, acts with integrity, encourages innovative thinking, and coaches people to move the teachers to a higher level of commitment. A transactional leader is more concerned with monitoring for mistakes and rewarding achievement. A passive/avoidant leader chooses to use his time dealing with crises and avoids involvement (Bass & Avolio, 1994). Sixty-three teachers of Mathematics and English at each of the five urban high schools responded to the Perceived Role Message Survey for Teachers (RMPS-T), a 56 -question survey about the use of technology. The principal's leadership style was compared to their teachers' perception among the five high schools. The responses by teachers on the RMPS-T for the transformational sub-section showed significant differences among teacher responses on school culture (p = 0. 0159), there were no other significant differences among transformational sub-sections. On the transactional sub-section showed significant differences among teacher responses on evaluator monitors (p = 0. 122), and differences among the my principal rewards me sub-section, but not significant (p = 0. 009). On the passive/avoidant the sub-section there were no significant differences. The {{study sought to}} show connection between teachers' gender, age, subject taught, the number of college credits earned, and the number of hours of professional development when compared to the number of uses of technology. The findings showed a difference among teacher responses based on gender, but not significant. There were no other significant differences. The results will assist high school principals in understanding how leadership style can impact the use of technology...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{exploratory}} {{in nature and}} tested the theory of transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership as perceived by teachers and their principal as successful measures of principal leadership on school climate and student achievement. The threefold {{purpose of this study}} was to examine: (1) The leadership style as perceived by the teacher and the principal (transformational, transactional, or laissez-faire) that describes the school principals in selected elementary magnet and non-magnet schools in the Wake County Public School System. (2) The relationship between the leadership style (transformational, transactional, or laissez-faire) of the school principal and the school 2 ̆ 7 s climate in selected elementary magnet and non-magnet schools in the Wake County Public School System. (3) The relationship between the leadership style (transformational, transactional, or laissez-faire) of the school principal and student achievement in selected elementary magnet and non-magnet schools in the Wake County Public School System. ^ The study was conducted with selected elementary schools in the Wake County Public School System. The sample population consisted of 600 teachers; 1999 North Carolina End-of-Grade Tests scores for 13, 266 students in grades three, four, and five; 20 elementary magnet schools; 20 elementary non-magnet schools; and 40 principals in schools categorized as elementary magnet and non-magnet. ^ Three instruments were used to gather data. The first instrument was the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire Form (5 X-Short) which was developed by Bass and Avolio (1995). This instrument served as the measure of principal leadership style (transformational, transactional, or laissez-faire). The second instrument that was used in this study is the NASSP School Climate Survey (NASSP, 1987). It served as the measure of school climate. The North Carolina 1999 End-of-Grade Tests percentage scores for reading and mathematics served as the instrument to measure student achievement. ^ Data for the study was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Descriptive statistical analyses (means and standard deviations) and One-Way Analysis of Variance were the statistical procedures used to test and describe the data for the six hypotheses. ^ The results of this study indicated that there was no significant difference between principals 2 ̆ 7 self ratings and teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of transactional and laissez-faire leadership styles in magnet schools. There was a significant difference in principals 2 ̆ 7 self ratings and teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of transformational leadership styles in magnet schools. In non-magnet schools, there was no significant difference between principals 2 ̆ 7 self ratings and teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of transformational and laissez-faire leadership styles. There was a significant difference in principals 2 ̆ 7 self ratings and teachers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of transactional leadership styles. ^ It was also found that there was a significant relationship between the school climate subscale, administration, and laissez-faire leadership in magnet schools. In non-magnet schools no significant relationship existed between the ten subscales of school climate and the three leadership styles (<b>transformation,</b> <b>transactional,</b> or laissez-faire). This study further indicated that no significant relationship existed between student achievement and transformational, transactional, or laissez-faire leadership in elementary magnet and non-magnet schools. ...|$|E

Organizational knowledge creation theory explains how organizational members create and acquire knowledge via socialization, externalization, internalization, and combination. An online survey, designed to measure knowledge creation, <b>transformation</b> and <b>transactional</b> leadership styles, was filled by 92 college students with internship experience. The results indicate that students learn via (a) socialization and internalization when their supervisors exhibit transformational leadership; (b) externalization and combination when their supervisors show transactional leadership. By understanding the leadership style of the supervisors, students could seek opportunities better suited to their learning styles.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a logical extension to Microsoft Business Framework (MBF) called Analytical View (AV). AV {{consists of three}} components: Model Service for design time, Business Intelligence Entity (BIE) for programming model, and IntellDrill for runtime navigation between OLTP and OLAP data sources. AV feature-set fulfills enterprise application requirements for Analysis and Decision Support, complementing the transactional feature-set currently provided by MBF. Model Service automatically transforms an "object oriented model (transactional view) " to a "multi-dimensional model (analytical view) " without the traditional Extraction/Transformation/Loading (ETL) overhead and complexity. It infers dimensionality from the object layer where richer metadata is stored, eliminating the "guesswork " that a traditional data warehousing process requires when going through physical database schema. BI Entities are classes code-generated by Model Service. As an intrinsic part of the framework, BI Entities enable a consistent object oriented way of programming model with strong types and rich semantics for OLAP, similar to what MBF object persistence technology does for OLTP data. More importantly, data contained in BI Entities have {{a higher degree of}} "application awareness, " such as the integrated application level security and customizability. IntelliDrill links together all the information islands in MBF using metadata. Because of the automatic <b>transformation</b> from <b>transactional</b> view to analytical view enabled by Model Service, {{we have the ability to}} understand natively what kind of drillability an object would have, thus making information navigation in MBF fully discover-able with built-in ontology...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{determine}} the relationship between emotional intelligence and leadership emergence and transformational, transactional, and passive-avoidant leadership styles. Prior research has indicated that emotional intelligence is positively correlated with leader effectiveness. However, the relationship between emotional intelligence and additional aspects of leadership and leadership styles has not been thoroughly investigated. The current study hypothesized that emotional intelligence would be positively correlated with leadership emergence, and transformational and transactional leadership styles, and negatively correlated with a passive-avoidant leadership style. Additionally, it was hypothesized that leadership emergence would be positively correlated with transformational and transactional leadership styles, and negatively correlated with a passive-avoidant leadership style. The 555 full-time employed adults who made up the participants for this study completed surveys measuring their levels on each variable based on their self-reported behaviors. The results suggested that emotional intelligence is positively correlated to leadership emergence, and transformational and transactional leadership styles, and leadership emergence was positively correlated to <b>transformation</b> and <b>transactional</b> leadership styles. Emotional intelligence was also negatively correlated with passive-avoidant leadership style. There was no significant correlation found between leadership emergence and passive-avoidant leadership style. The findings support the use of emotional intelligence scales as a predictor of leadership behavior, and the application of these scales for employee selection and training practices in the workplace. The current study encourages future research into the subtypes of emotional intelligence and their impact on various qualities of leadership...|$|R
40|$|Language {{run-time}} {{systems are}} routinely used to host potentially buggy or malicious codelets — software modules, agents, applets, etc. — in a secure environment. A number of techniques exist for managing access control to system services {{and even for}} terminating codelets once they’ve been determined to be misbehaving. However, because codelets can be terminated anywhere in their execution, a codelet’s internal state might become inconsistent; restarting the codelet could result in unexpected behavior. Any state the codelet shares with other codelets may likewise become inconsistent, destabilizing those codelets as well. To address these problems, we have designed a mechanism, strictly using code-to-code <b>transformations,</b> which provides <b>transactional</b> rollback support for codelets. Each instance of a codelet is run in its own transaction, and standard (ACID) transactional semantics apply. All changes made by the codelet are automatically rolled back when the corresponding transaction aborts. We discuss a transactional rollback implementation for Java, and present its performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. The {{general purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} and identify whether a potential trend exists between emotional intelligence (EI) and effective leadership. This research will further more assist in determining whether possible trends exist between emotional intelligence and leadership and whether these leaders can be distinguished from others by means of leadership styles. Thus two specific leadership styles are investigated being transformational or transactional. Given the research literature an expectation exists that a statistically significant difference will be found between leadership effectiveness and EI. Leadership effectiveness refers to either transformational or transactional leadership. Insight will also be gained into whether male or female student leaders practice either <b>transformation</b> or <b>transactional</b> leadership styles. The existence of EI is identifiable with the effective leadership style of transformational leadership more than a transactional leadership style. The sample was identified as the student leaders from 14 house committees as approved by the Dean of Students at the University of Johannesburg’s Auckland Park Kingsway campus. Approval to sample the current SRC members for the university was also obtained. The sample ultimately entailed 123 respondents (98. 4 %) of a possible 125 respondents from all the committees in the institution. Two measuring instruments were utilised for the purpose of the study and were set up to test emotional intelligence and leadership. The statistical procedures utilised in the analysis of the data included demographic distributions, factor analyses and t-test. The findings revealed that there was insufficient evidence to support the objective that specific trends exist between emotional intelligence and leadership effectiveness or whether EI relates more strongly with a transformational or transactional leadership style. There were however relevant relationships between female respondents and the transformational leadership style within the specific sample thus supporting a secondary objective of the study...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies on}} {{leadership}} {{and on the}} relationship between leadership style and various individual and organisational outcomes have utilised either of two questionnaire instruments for the measurement of leader behaviour. These are StodgiIl 2 ̆ 7 s (1963) Leadership Behaviour Description Questionnaire (LBDQ), and the Multi-factor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) of Bass (1985). The first is based on the two dimensions of leader behaviour, Initiating Structure and Consideration, while the MLQ focuses on the distinction between <b>Transformation</b> and <b>Transactional</b> leadership styles. In recent years there has been growing interest in the study of self-managing teams, and much of the literature has argued that such groups give rise to higher performance and higher levels of worker satisfaction and commitment. Attention has therefore been directed at the types of leader behaviours which are appropriate for the success of self-managing teams. Manz and Sims (1989, 1991) introduced the concept of "Super leadership", which is the set of leadership behaviours which encourages self-leadership by followers in order that they can successfully accomplish tasks that were traditionally done by their superiors. Self-leadership is described in terms of a broad view of self-influence that encompasses self-management strategies as well as strategies for managing the motivational values of the task, such as the feeling of competence, self-control, etc. (Manz, 1986, 1992). Manz and Sims (1987) developed the Self-Management Leadership Questionnaire (SMLQ) as a measure of such leader behaviours. The behavioural dimensions contained in the questionnaire reflect three broad established streams of literature, namely, 1) behavioural self-control (eg. Bandura, 1969) and self-management (Mahoney and Amkoff, 1978); 2) intrinsic motivation (Deci, 1975; Hoffman, 1981), and 3) the use of mental imagery, self-talk and positive thinking (Neck and Manz., 1992; Kendall et al., 1990). The six dimensions tapped by the SMLQ are: Self-observation, Rehearsal, Self Goal-setting, Self Criticism, Self Reinforcement, and Self Expectation. The study reported in this paper investigates the relationship between the newer leadership dimensions measured by the Manz and Sims 2 ̆ 7 s SMLQ questionnaire and the more established dimensions of Transformational and Transactional leadership style, Initiating Structure and Consideration, as measured by the LBDQ and MLQ. It also explores the relationship between the above leadership style factors and a number of work related attitudes, including job satisfaction, commitment and faith in management. Questionnaires containing items measuring the above leadership style dimensions and work related attitudes were distributed to members of selfmanaged teams in a large manufacturing organisation. A total of 318 useable questionnaires were returned. These were subjected to a series of correlational and regression analyses. The results showed that the scales measured by the SMLQ represented leadership style dimensions which are distinct from those measured by the older and more established LBDQ and MLQ instruments. Furthermore, the SMLQ measures were predictive of follower worker attitudes to an extent comparable with those for the older leadership style dimensions. It was also found that the SMLQ measures provided statistically significant additional predictive power after having statistically controlled for predictive effects of the older leadership measures...|$|R
