As the shows were mostly performed at night the par was illuminated with an oil lamp. Shadow puppet theatre likely originated in Central Asia-China or in India in the 1st millennium BCE. By at least around 200 BCE the figures on cloth {{seem to have been}} replaced with puppetry in Indian [...] "tholu bomalatta" [...] shows. These are performed behind a thin screen with flat, jointed puppets made of colorfully painted <b>transparent</b> <b>leather.</b> The puppets are held close to the screen and lit from behind, while hands and arms are manipulated with attached canes and lower legs swinging freely from the knee.|$|E

Shadow play {{can be regarded as}} a step in this direction. The casting of shadows of actors, dancers and/or hands (shadowgraphy) has probably been practiced since very early prehistoric times. Shadow puppetry was hinted at in Plato's Allegory of the Cave (circa 380 BCE), but more likely developed in India around 200 BCE. Indian [...] "tholu bomalatta" [...] shows are performed behind a screen with flat, jointed puppets made of colorfully painted <b>transparent</b> <b>leather.</b> The puppets are held close to the screen and lit from behind, more or less projecting the moving figures on the screen while hands and arms are manipulated with attached canes and lower legs swinging freely from the knee.|$|E
