5|$|There {{could conceivably}} be other planets in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> do not transit the star, {{but they would}} only be {{detectable}} by the effects of their gravity on {{the motion of the}} visible planets (much as how Neptune was discovered).|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower level has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, {{there is no room for}} a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E

5|$|By 1936, several U.S. {{highways}} {{had been}} added to <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> took over parts of State Highway 8's route. US-62, added in 1930, took over the Lawton–Anadarko portion of the road. US-277 took {{over much of the}} remaining route between Randlett and Lawton. In addition, a US-70N had been created that overlaid US-277 between Randlett and the split with SH-5 west of Walters. These changes to the U.S. route system precipitated the truncation of SH-8 in 1936. On 1936-03-13, the section of the route between Anadarko and the state line was dropped. However, a new road between Anadarko and Cyril had been built; this became part of SH-8 and set the highway's southern terminus at its present location.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, {{a divided}} highway {{designated}} Alternate US24 (US24A) was opened {{from the state}} line north to Erie. After World War II, the MSHD planned to convert several highways {{in the state to}} freeways. In planning maps from 1947, the modern I-75 corridor was included in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> later became the Interstate Highway System. It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Kate {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low pressure that was first identified on 22 February 2006, within a monsoonal trough. The system rapidly intensified throughout the day, with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology issuing their first advisory on <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> evening. Upon being classified, the system was immediately declared Tropical Cyclone Kate, skipping tropical low status. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 13P. The storm had developed well-defined, upper-level outflow enhanced by diffluence over the system.|$|E
5|$|For decades, Gulf {{operated}} filling stations on the Pennsylvania Turnpike toll {{highway system}} alongside the Howard Johnson's restaurants at the Turnpike's travel plazas (which correspond to European motorway service areas). This began in 1950 {{with the opening}} of the Philadelphia Extension, and Gulf added more filling stations as the system was extended. The Standard Oil Company of Pennsylvania (now part of Exxon) had exclusive rights to provide filling station services on the sections of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> opened prior to 1950, principally the Irwin-to-Carlisle section.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} features of Golden Sun is the collection and manipulation of creatures called Djinn. The Djinn are scattered in hiding throughout the game; once found, they can be allocated to each character. They {{form the basis of}} the game's statistic enhancement, as well as <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> dictates the character's Psynergy capabilities. Attaching different Djinn to different characters modifies that character's character class, subsequently modifying hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform.|$|E

5|$|The G {{operates}} {{at all times}} between Court Square in Long Island City, Queens, and Church Avenue in Kensington, Brooklyn, making local stops along its entire route. The G is the only non-shuttle service in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> does not serve Manhattan. It suffers from constant service disruptions, infrequent train headways, few free transfers to other services, and low rolling stock capacity, leading to criticism from politicians and residents of the neighborhoods through which it travels. Since the 2000s, several improvements {{have been made to}} the G, including a route extension in Brooklyn and a full-route audit that identified solutions for issues on the G service.|$|E
5|$|The Red Line is {{the only}} line in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> does not share its tracks with another Metrorail line. The Amtrak and MARC tracks do, however, run {{parallel}} to the Red Line tracks between Washington Union Station and Silver Spring {{as well as between}} Twinbrook and Shady Grove stations. These tracks used {{to be part of the}} former Batimore & Ohio Railroad route. MARC uses this parallel route when traveling between Washington and Martinsburg, West Virginia. Amtrak, on the other hand, uses this parallel route when traveling the Capitol Limited route between Washington and Chicago Union Station. Although MARC does stop at the Silver Spring and Rockville stations between Washington and West Virginia, Amtrak only stops at Rockville between Washington and Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Francesca {{were from a}} {{tropical}} low that formed in the Australia region on January28, east of the Cocos Islands. This was near the same place that Eddy had formed a week prior. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> became Francesca moved west-southwestward due to a ridge to the south. On January30 it crossed into the South-West Indian Ocean, where wind shear prevented significant development. On January31, the system intensified into a tropical depression, and late {{the next day the}} JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S. Wind shear diminished on February2, which allowed the depression to strengthen into Tropical Storm Francesca after convection increased. It continued to intensify steadily, becoming a tropical cyclone on February3. The next day, the JTWC upgraded Francesca to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane.|$|E

30|$|Although from an ASR perspective, the EPIC {{database}} {{is easier}} {{compared to the}} MAVIR database, not all <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> obtained a better performance than that on the MAVIR data due to the domain change. The fusion strategy {{played an important role}} in alleviating this issue, since <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> do not employ any fusion strategy degrade their performance to a greater extent with respect to the MAVIR test data, whereas <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> are based on fusion obtain similar or better performance than that obtained in the MAVIR test data.|$|R
5|$|The {{possibility}} that stellar evolution of either Sirius A or Sirius B could {{be responsible for}} this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers {{on the grounds that}} the timescale of thousands of years is too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> would be expected had such a change taken place. An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance. Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic scintillations of the star when rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red, white and blue hues when near the horizon.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> {{would become}} Hurricane Alicia {{originated}} {{from the western}} end of a frontal trough that stretched from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. Satellite pictures showed a meso-scale low pressure area that had moved off the Alabama and Mississippi coasts near the trough and was possibly the precursor system to Alicia. Pressures in the Gulf of Mexico were high and stayed high during the early development stages. On August 15, a ship recorded a minimal pressure of 1015millibars (29.99inHg), when the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Alicia. With high environmental pressures around it, Alicia remained a small system.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Delia {{originated}} from a tropical wave that formed over the central Caribbean Sea in late August 1973. Tracking towards the west-northwest, convective activity increased {{and the overall}} structure of the system improved. By August31, a weak {{area of low pressure}} formed over the Gulf of Honduras. This system tracked northward and further organized into a tropical depression just off the southeastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on September1. Gradually intensifying, the depression became a tropical storm on September3 as it turned towards the west. In accordance with its upgrade, it was given the name Delia. This upgrade followed a reconnaissance mission into <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> found sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h). A complex steering pattern formed later that day, resulting in a more hostile environment for the cyclone.|$|E

We also implemented <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> selected automatically good features and were able to obtain a prefixed precision (85 %) at the cost of coverage. <b>The</b> <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> used all <b>the</b> features were identified as BCU-ehu-dlist-all and <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> selected some features as BCU-ehu-dlistbest. ...|$|R
5|$|Typhoon Ivan {{originated}} {{from an area}} of disturbed weather near the equator {{during the first week}} of October 1997. Two equatorial troughs, one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere developed from this system. Three resultant areas of low pressure formed; one in the Southern Hemisphere developed into Tropical Cyclone Lusi on October8, and two north of the equator steadily tracked westward. The eastern low developed into Typhoon Joan, while the western cyclone became <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> would intensify into Typhoon Ivan. Situated in an environment without significant convective activity, this system initially struggled to become organized. However, the disturbance began to mature, and by October11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) discovered a low-level circulation center, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the following day.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan, the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US2 to a freeway between St. Ignace and Sault St. Marie. In {{planning}} maps from 1947, this highway corridor was included in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> later became the Interstates. It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system. The proposed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 (I‑75).|$|E
5|$|Almost immediately, {{the company}} began looking at the {{possibility}} of converting {{all or part of the}} system into railways. W A Povis, their engineer, was convinced that railways could be built along the routes at around half the cost of building a new line. The move was opposed by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal who argued that closing bits of the inland waterways system would have serious repercussions on the parts left. Robert Stephenson suggested that a number of railways and canals should amalgamate, to reduce competition when bills were presented to Parliament. The canals to join the Ellesmere and Chester Company were the eastern and western branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. Although some would be converted to railways, the route from Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Barbridge Junction was part of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> would be retained as a waterway, on which salt was a major source of revenue. The plans resulted in the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1846. The new company could raise £3.3 million of new capital, in addition to that already in existence, with another £1.1 million if necessary. They prompted new railways, but before any of the existing canals were converted, the company was leased to the London and North Western Railway, who took control in June 1847. They allowed the Shropshire Union to continue to operate fairly independently, and by 1849, the idea of conversion had been dropped, as the canals could still operate profitably.|$|E
