A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. <b>The</b> <b>waitress</b> invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, {{but it is clear that}} Jerry, George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves. They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, to which all three ask what the apartment's rent is.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, <b>the</b> <b>waitress</b> {{returns to}} find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two {{opposing}} racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E

5|$|The video's main {{theme is}} a romantic fantasy narrative. It {{begins with a}} montage of pencil {{drawings}} in a comic-book style representing motorcycle sidecar racing, in which the hero, played by Morten Harket, is pursued by two opponents, {{one of whom is}} played by English actor Philip Jackson. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey (Harket's girlfriend at the time), is seen drinking coffee and reading the comic book in a coffee shop. As the woman reads, <b>the</b> <b>waitress</b> brings her the bill. The comic's hero, after winning the race, seemingly winks at the woman from the page. His pencil-drawn hand reaches out of the comic book, inviting the woman into it. Once inside, she too appears in the pencil-drawn form, as he sings to her and introduces her to his black-and-white world which features a sort of looking-glass portal where people and objects look real on one side and pencil-drawn on the other.|$|E

25|$|Winyah {{was one of}} {{the best}} known {{landmarks}} of the vicinity of New Rochelle up until May 5, 1897, when the residence burned to the ground along with its many valuable contents. The mansion was purchased from Col. Richard Lathers by Col. C. H. Green, President of Columbia Construction and Navigation Company. He occupied it with his wife and four-year-old nephew, and three servants including a 'waitress', 'laundress' and cook. In the early morning hours <b>the</b> <b>waitress</b> awoke to the smell of smoke alerting the other occupants to flee the house. The cook ran into New Rochelle village to secure assistance. The Fire Department, with two engines, a horse cart, and a truck, responded, though the mansion was about one and a half miles from the center of town. When they arrived, however, their attempt to get water from a hydrant was unavailable due to pebbles stuck within it. Nearly 100 men came with fire apparatus, but without water they could do nothing to stop the flames. Green offered a reward if anyone could save two pictures from the gallery within the home however nothing could be saved and within two hours the entire structure was in ruins. The sixty-nine-foot tower in the front of the home collapsed into the center of the burning building and only two brick chimneys were left standing in the end.|$|E

The purpose of the evening, {{according}} to Blitz, was for the actors to [...] "be comfortable around each other inhabiting their roles without self-consciousness", as each of their roles required them to act in potentially embarrassing ways.|$|E

[...] "The Bill" [...] focuses on four men—Archie, Malcolm, Kevin and Craig—arguing over who should pay the bill in a restaurant at closing time, much {{to the dismay of}} <b>the</b> <b>waitress</b> Anya. It addresses themes of masculinity and competition, while the English north/south divide is a recurring issue; Craig, the visiting southerner, is wealthier than the other three, and unfamiliar with some of their terminology.|$|E

2500|$|In her 1991 {{study of}} waitresses in Philadelphia, Paules {{examines}} how these workers assert control and protect their self identity during interactions with customers. In restaurant work, Paules argues, workers' subordination to customers is reinforced through [...] "cultural symbols that originate from deeply rooted assumptions about service work." [...] Because <b>the</b> <b>waitresses</b> were not strictly regulated by their employers, waitresses' interactions with customers were controlled by <b>the</b> <b>waitresses</b> themselves. Although they are stigmatized by the stereotypes and assumptions of servitude surrounding restaurant work, <b>the</b> <b>waitresses</b> studied were not negatively affected by {{their interactions with}} customers. To the contrary, they viewed their ability to manage their emotions as a valuable skill {{that could be used}} to gain control over customers. Thus, <b>the</b> Philadelphia <b>waitresses</b> took advantage of the lack of employer-regulated emotional labor in order to avoid the potentially negative consequences of emotional labor.|$|R

500|$|Many actresses {{who read}} for Phoebe {{arrived at the}} {{audition}} in character, wearing [...] "bell bottoms and clunky shoes and nose rings". [...] Kathy Griffin and Jane Lynch auditioned for the role. Lisa Kudrow won the role because the producers liked her as Ursula, <b>the</b> <b>waitress</b> in Mad About You. She was second to be cast, though there was about a month between her and Schwimmer being signed on. Many of the actors seen by Moonves were [...] "too theatrical" [...] in performing comedy; Crane described the six successful actors as being {{the only ones who}} [...] "nailed" [...] their parts. The six actors {{met for the first time}} altogether at the read-through on April 28, 1994. John Allen Nelson and Clea Lewis guest-star as Paul and Franny, Monica's date and co-worker respectively. Cynthia Mann appears as a Central Perk waitress.|$|E
500|$|Catherine O'Hara {{originally}} {{agreed to}} provide the voice of Collette <b>the</b> <b>waitress,</b> {{and went into the}} studio and recorded her part for the character. According to Mike Reiss, [...] "Something about her did not animate correctly. The voice did not work for our purposes." [...] Jo Ann Harris, a regular voice actor in the show, had recorded a temporary track using an impression of Shelley Long's character Diane Chambers from Cheers. The producers thought it fit the role better and used it instead of O'Hara, although O'Hara is still credited {{at the end of the}} episode. Sam Simon had previously written for Cheers, and contributed much of Collette's dialogue, as he was familiar with writing dialogue for Diane. Originally, there was more to the subplot featuring Moe and Colette, but it was cut because the writers felt it did not work. The third act opens with a parody of [...] "Where Everybody Knows Your Name", the theme song from Cheers. The parody was written by Jeff Martin, and the sequence was designed by future Simpsons director Nancy Kruse.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Waitresses</b> were co-founded at the Woman's Building by Feminist Studio Workshop (FSW) {{graduates}} Jerri Allyn and Anne Gauldin in 1977. The two {{formed the}} group after Allyn saw Gauldin {{perform at the}} FSW, where Gauldin blackened her eyes, served drinks; attempting to convey that the drinks and <b>the</b> role of <b>waitressing</b> was poisonous. Allyn was deeply moved, having been working as a waitress for seven years. Their first performance was Ready to Order? in which Allyn, Gauldin, Patti Nicklaus, Jamie Wildman and Denise Yarfitz participated in. The group eventually grew to 14 people, including Elizabeth Canelake, Anne Mavor, Anita Green, and Chutney Gunderson Berry. <b>The</b> <b>Waitresses</b> performed until 1985. They are credited as a precursor to feminist art advocates the Guerrilla Girls. Currently, <b>The</b> <b>Waitresses</b> are featured in an exhibition about the Woman's Building, [...] "Doin' It In Public", at Otis College of Art and Design.|$|R
500|$|M-57 is a rural, two-lane highway {{crossing}} the south central Lower Peninsula. The western terminus is at US131, [...] north of Grand Rapids near Rockford in northern Kent County.

From Rockford, M-57 runs east through rural farmland on 14Mile Road into southern Montcalm County. East of the county line, the highway follows Carson City Road into the outskirts of Greenville. M-57 runs through a retail corridor before becoming Washington Street in town where it meets M-91. [...] Washington Street crosses the Flat River and exits Greenville. Continuing eastward, the trunkline passes through more farmland on Carson City Road. It meets M-66 at a rural four-way intersection before passing into Carson City near the Gratiot county line. M-57 follows Cleveland Road, passing {{to the south of}} the communities of Middleton and Perrinton. Near Pompeii, M-57 meets US127 at a folded diamond interchange along the expressway portion of the latter highway.|$|E

500|$|The {{basic premise}} of the episode {{is similar to the}} film Cocktail. Several {{references}} are made to the sitcom Cheers. Collette <b>the</b> <b>waitress</b> is a parody of Cheers character Diane Chambers, and the [...] "theme sequence" [...] for Flaming Moe's, is a direct parody of the famous Cheers theme. Barney Gumble is given a Norm Peterson entrance. Aerosmith sings [...] "Walk This Way" [...] in Moe's Tavern and [...] "Young Lust" [...] during the closing credits. When Homer reveals the secret of the [...] "Flaming Moe", the scene has many parallels to The Phantom of the Opera including Homer standing high up in the roof, covering half of his face. The scene in which Professor Frink analyzes a [...] "Flaming Moe" [...] is an homage to The Nutty Professor. The scene where Bart runs away from Lisa and her friends makes reference to the Alfred Hitchcock film North by Northwest. Lionel Hutz says that a drink can not be copyrighted, citing the [...] "Frank Wallbanger case of '78". This refers to the Harvey Wallbanger cocktail. Near the end of the episode, several bars with names similar to [...] "Flaming Moe's" [...] can be seen.
