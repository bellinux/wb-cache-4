5|$|Weezer {{recorded}} The Kitchen Tapes as {{an attempt}} to create a buzz around L.A. The band eventually attracted attention from major-label A reps looking for alternative rock bands while performing on the same bill as the band <b>That</b> <b>Dog.</b> They were then signed to DGC Records on June 26, 1993, by Todd Sullivan, an A rep from Geffen Records.|$|E
5|$|Songs {{from the}} Black Hole is an unfinished, {{unreleased}} album by the American alternative rock band Weezer recorded between 1994 and 1996. Intended {{to follow their}} 1994 self-titled debut album, {{it was to be}} a science fiction rock opera that expressed songwriter Rivers Cuomo's mixed feelings about rock and roll success. Its six characters were to be voiced by Cuomo, guitarist Brian Bell and bassist Matt Sharp of Weezer, Rachel Haden of <b>That</b> <b>Dog</b> and the Rentals, Joan Wasser of the Dambuilders, and Weezer collaborator Karl Koch.|$|E
5|$|The Amps toured {{throughout}} 1995 and 1996. Early performances, before releasing Pacer, included June 1995 {{shows in}} Dayton: one with Poster Children and another with Guided by Voices. They toured with Guided by Voices and Chavez in the United Kingdom in September, in {{cities such as}} London, Glasgow, and Sheffield, and played another show with Guided by Voices in Ohio in October. The Amps performed a series of US concerts in October and November with Sonic Youth, including shows in Detroit and Chicago with Helium, in Seattle and Portland with Bikini Kill, and in Los Angeles with Mike Watt. Following the concerts with Sonic Youth, the Amps did a tour of Europe. In January 1996, they played the Summersault festival in Australia. That year, the Amps toured with the Foo Fighters in the United States, in locations such as Chicago (with <b>That</b> <b>Dog),</b> Worcester, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas (with Jawbreaker). In 1995 or 1996, they also played shows with the Tasties and Brainiac.|$|E
5000|$|The {{proposal}} <b>that</b> <b>dogs</b> {{can detect}} cancer attracted widespread {{coverage in the}} general media.In 2015 the Huffington Post reported that studies have suggested <b>that</b> <b>dogs</b> {{may be able to}} detect lung cancer, melanoma, breast cancer and bladder cancer, and <b>that</b> <b>dogs</b> can be trained to detect cancer in 93% of cases. [...] In 2016, actress Shannen Doherty told Entertainment Tonight in an interview <b>that</b> her <b>dog</b> identified her breast cancer before doctors could diagnose it.

25|$|In 2007, a {{study found}} <b>that</b> <b>dog</b> {{domestication}} {{was accompanied by}} selection at three genes with key roles in starch digestion: AMY2B, MGAMand SGLT1, and was a striking case of parallel evolution when coping with an increasingly starch-rich diet caused similar adaptive responses in dogs and humans.|$|E
25|$|These dogs, or strains {{and crosses}} thereof, {{must be kept}} on a strong, short lead (less than 2 metres / 6'7") by a person over 16 years of age who is capable of {{controlling}} them. The dog/s must be securely muzzled too. A recent study conducted in Ireland found <b>that</b> <b>dog</b> bite injuries significantly increased since the introduction of such legislation, although data from before {{the introduction of the}} ban was not included. The study reported <b>that</b> <b>dog</b> bite hospitalisations may rise as a result of targeting dog breeds due to reinforcing incorrect stereotypes of the dangerousness of certain breeds and assuming the safety of others simply due to their breed may result in people incorrectly interacting with dogs from both categories.|$|E
25|$|Dog barking {{can be a}} {{nuisance}} to neighbours, and is a common problem <b>that</b> <b>dog</b> owners or their neighbours may face. Many dogs can bark at 100 dBA. Even at 17.5 yards away and with the dog outside a closed window, the noise level of a barking dog can be well over the level that causes psychological distress. Different kinds of barking often require different kinds of approach to reduction.|$|E

25|$|According to a 2013 {{survey on}} VietNamNet, with the {{participation}} of more than 3,000 readers, showed {{that the majority of}} people, at 80%, still supported eating dog meat. Up to 66 percent of the readers said <b>that</b> <b>dog</b> meat is nutritious food and it has been traditional food for a very long time. Some 13 percent said eating dog meat is okay but dog slaughtering must be strictly controlled, avoid embarrassing images.|$|E
25|$|Eating dog meat is {{considered}} entirely taboo. However, Brittonic and Irish texts which {{date from the}} early Christian period suggest <b>that</b> <b>dog</b> meat was sometimes consumed but possibly in ritual contexts such as Druidic ritual trance. Sacrificial dog bones are often recovered from archaeological sites; however, they were typically treated differently, as were horses, from other food animals. One of Ireland's mythological heroes, Cuchulainn, had two geasa, or vows, {{one of which was}} to avoid the meat of dogs. The breaking of his geasa led to his death in the Irish mythology.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 {{study in}} Ireland found <b>that</b> <b>dog</b> bite {{injuries}} greatly increased since {{the introduction of}} legislation targeting specific dog breeds. This study also suggested that targeting dog breeds may actually contribute to increases in dog-bite hospitalisations through the reinforcing of incorrect stereotypes of risk being determined by breed.

50|$|In 1884, the AKC began {{requiring}} <b>that</b> all <b>dog</b> participants {{be registered}} with the AKC and recognized for conformation show competition. In 2016, there are 199 breeds and varieties eligible for Westminster. Because of the show's popularity and prestige, starting in 1992 the AKC limited entries by requiring <b>that</b> <b>dogs</b> must have already earned their breed championship before appearing at Westminster. Later, that rule was amended to require <b>that</b> <b>dogs</b> {{have one of the}} two required major wins towards their championship titles, but need not be finished champions to enter.|$|R

50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} archaeological traces {{of the existence of}} dogs in the United States can be dated back to 9,000 to 35,000 years ago. It is generally held <b>that</b> <b>dogs</b> came to America after crossing from Siberia to Alaska, and it was during this period that the domestication of dogs began in America. The sequence divergence in this clade proposes <b>that</b> <b>dogs</b> originated about 100,000 years ago.|$|R
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>dog</b> domestication occurred in Europe or Siberia, see Origin of the domestic dog. The traditional African dog is a descendant of dogs that had been interbred with local wolves in the East and came to Africa. Their earliest presence {{has been established in}} Egypt and dated to 4700 BC. Archaeological records show that, from then on, the dog spread rapidly along the Nile into Sudan and even beyond. At the same time, migrations, trade, and transhumance took it deep into the Sahara. By 2000 BC, this moving frontier stopped for a long period. Meanwhile, throughout the Egyptian dynasties, the breeding of swift and slender hounds together with a variety of common dogs became very popular.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes {{joined forces}} with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings. The project was {{a throwback to the}} early days of Dog Eat Dog as it focused on the {{hardcore}} style <b>that</b> <b>Dog</b> Eat Dog had originally displayed on their first two releases. The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just For The Fun Of It in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, as part of the Eastpak Resistance Tour. In 2004, All Boro Kings quietly disbanded.|$|E
25|$|Ancient DNA {{supports}} the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>dog</b> domestication preceded {{the emergence of}} agriculture and was initiated close to the Last Glacial Maximum 27,000 YBP when hunter-gatherers preyed on megafauna, and when proto-dogs might {{have taken advantage of}} carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kill-sites. Wolves were probably attracted to human campfires by the smell of meat being cooked and discarded refuse in the vicinity, first loosely attaching themselves and then considering these as part of their home territory where their warning growls would alert humans to the approach of outsiders. The wolves most likely drawn to human camps were the less-aggressive, subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress thresholds, less wary around humans, and therefore better candidates for domestication. The earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the neotonization of skull morphology and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a {{reduction in the number of}} teeth, which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression. This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process.|$|E

50|$|There is {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>dogs</b> can discriminate the emotional expressions of human faces. In addition, {{they seem to}} respond to faces in somewhat {{the same way as}} humans. For example, humans tend to gaze at the right side of a person's face, which {{may be related to the}} use of right brain hemisphere for facial recognition. Research indicates <b>that</b> <b>dogs</b> also fixate the right side of a human face, but not <b>that</b> of other <b>dogs</b> or other animals. Dogs are the only non-primate species known to do so.|$|R
500|$|On September25, a {{tropical}} wave spawned {{a tropical}} storm about [...] east of the Lesser Antilles. Given the name Dog, the storm moved northwestward for its entire duration. On September26, Hurricane Hunters observed winds of , which indicated <b>that</b> <b>Dog</b> strengthened to just below hurricane intensity. The plane also estimated winds of around , although {{they were unable to}} locate a closed center of circulation. After approaching hurricane status,, Dog began a marked weakening trend, with winds of only 50mph (85km/h) by September27. Continuing to weaken, the storm dissipated on September29. The Weather Bureau advised ships to avoid the storm, but overall Dog did not affect land. As the Hurricane Hunters did not reported a well-defined circulation, there was a possibility Dog was not a tropical cyclone; the report of the 1952 season assessed <b>that</b> <b>Dog</b> remained a tropical wave.|$|E
