40|$|Morbidities {{related to}} atherosclerosis, such as acute {{coronary}} syndromes (ACS) including unstable angina and myocardial infarction, remain {{leading causes of}} mortality. Unstable plaques are inflamed and infiltrated with macrophages and T lymphocytes. Activated dendritic cells interact with T cells, yielding predominantly Th 1 responses involving interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), while the role of interleukin 17 (IL- 17) is questionable. The expansion of CD 28 nullCD 4 or CD 8 T cells as well as pattern recognition receptors activation (especially Toll-like receptors; TLR 2 and TLR 4) is characteristic for unstable plaque. Inflammation modifies platelet and fibrin clot characteristics, which are critical for ACS. Understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms of atherothrombosis, bridging inflammation, oxidative stress and immune regulation, will allow {{for the detection of}} subjects at risk, through the use of novel biomarkers and imaging techniques including intravascular ultrasound, molecular <b>targeting,</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (MRI) and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Moreover, understanding the specific inflammatory pathways of plaque rupture and atherothrombosis may allow for immunomodulation of ACS. Statins and anti-platelet drugs are anti-inflammatory, but importance of immune events in ACS warrants the introduction of novel, specific treatments directed either on cytokines, TLRs or inflammasomes. While the prime time for the introduction of immunologically inspired diagnostic tests and treatments for atherosclerosis have not come yet, we are closer than ever before to finally being able to benefit from this vast body of experimental and clinical evidence.

Water-soluble and tumor-targeting superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were synthesized by loading hydrophobic SPIONs into micelles assembled from an amphiphilic block copolymer poly(ethylene glycol) -poly(&epsilon;-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) bearing folate in the distal ends of PEG chains. Compared to the water-soluble SPIONs obtained by small molecular surfactant coating, ultrasmall SPION encapsulation with PEG-PCL micelles (PEG-PCL-SPIONs) simultaneously increases transverse (r 2) and decreases longitudinal (r 1) magnetic resonance (MR) relaxivities of water proton in micelle solution, leading to a notably high r 2 /r 1 ratio up to 78, which makes the PEG-PCL-SPIONs a highly sensitive MR imaging (MRI) T 2 contrast agent. The mean size of folate-attached SPION micelles (Fa-PEG-PCL-SPIONs) is 44 &plusmn; 3 nm on average, ideal for in vivo MRI applications in which long circulation is greatly determined by small particle size and is highly desirable. Prussian blue staining of BEL- 7402 cells over-expressing folate receptors, after incubation with micelle-containing medium, demonstrated that folate functionalization of the magnetic particles significantly enhanced their cell uptake. The potential of Fa-PEG-PCL-SPIONs as a potent MRI probe for in vivo tumor detection was assessed. At 3 hours after intravenous injection of the Fa-PEG-PCL-SPION solution into mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts of human BEL- 7402 hepatoma, a 41. 2 % signal intensity decrease was detected in the T 2 -weighted MR images of the tumor, indicating the efficient accumulation of Fa-PEG-PCL-SPIONs in the tumor tissue.

We report the encapsulation of superparamagnetic iron platinum nanoparticles (SIPPs) and paclitaxel {{in a mixture of}} polyethyleneglycolated, fluorescent, and biotin-functionalized phospholipids to create multifunctional SIPP-PTX micelles (SPMs) that were conjugated to an antibody against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for the specific <b>targeting,</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (MRI), and treatment of human prostate cancer xenografts in mice. Results: SPMs were 45. 4 &plusmn; 24. 9 nm in diameter and composed of 160. 7 &plusmn; 22. 9 &micro;g/mL iron, 247. 0 &plusmn; 33. 4 &micro;g/mL platinum, and 702. 6 &plusmn; 206. 0 &micro;g/mL paclitaxel. Drug release measurements showed that, at 37 &deg;C, half of the paclitaxel was released in 30. 2 hours in serum and two times faster in saline. Binding assays suggested that PSMA-targeted SPMs specifically bound to C 4 - 2 human prostate cancer cells in vitro and released paclitaxel into the cells. In vitro, paclitaxel was 2. 2 and 1. 6 times more cytotoxic than SPMs to C 4 - 2 cells at 24 and 48 hours of incubation, respectively. After 72 hours of incubation, paclitaxel and SPMs were equally cytotoxic. SPMs had MRI transverse relaxivities of 389 &plusmn; 15. 5 Hz/mM iron, and SIPP micelles with and without drug caused MRI contrast enhancement in vivo. Conclusion: Only PSMA-targeted SPMs and paclitaxel significantly prevented growth of C 4 - 2 prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, mice injected with PSMA-targeted SPMs showed significantly more paclitaxel and platinum in tumors, compared with nontargeted SPM-injected and paclitaxel-injected mice.

Intravascular administration of the targeted contrast agent was performed at approximately 1 day following status epilepticus. The control group received diazepam prior to pilocarpine to prevent status epilepticus. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> of rats was performed before and after contrast administration. Comparison with quantitative T₂ measurements was also performed. At the end of the study, brains were removed for ex vivo <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> and histology.

In particular these occurred in the periventricular organs, the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. Relatively little contrast agent binding was observed in the control group. T₂ relaxation times were not significantly increased for the hippocampus or the cerebral cortex in post status epilepticus animals. These results demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo imaging of seizure-induced inflammation in an animal model of epilepsy. The antibody targeted MRI contrast agent identified regions of acute inflammation following status epilepticus and may provide an early marker of brain injury.

After conjugation of EGFRmAb with SPIONs, the magnetic characteristics of EGFRmAb-SPIONs were investigated. Thereafter, the targeting abilities of EGFRmAb-SPIONs with MRI were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed in EGFR-positive C 6 glioma cells in vitro and in a Wistar rat model bearing C 6 glioma in vivo. Furthermore, the preliminary biocompatibility and toxicity of EGFRmAb-SPIONs were evaluated in normal rats through hematology assays and histopathologic analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance and Student t-test, with a significance level of p <. 05. From the results of EGFRmAb-SPION characterizations, the average particle size was 10. 21 nm and the hydrodynamic diameter was 161. 5 ± 2. 12 nm. The saturation magnetization was 55 emu/g·Fe, and T 2 relaxivity was 92. 73 s− 1 mM− 1 in distilled water. The preferential accumulation of the EGFRmAb-SPIONs within glioma and subsequent MRI contrast enhancement were demonstrated both in vitro in C 6 cells and in vivo in rats bearing C 6 glioma. After intravenous administration of EGFRmAb-SPIONs, T 2 -weighted MRI of the rat model with brain glioma exhibited an apparent hypointense region within glioma from 2 to 48 hours. The maximal image contrast was reached at 24 hours, where the signal intensity decreased and the R 2 value increased by 30 % compared to baseline. However, T 2 -weighted imaging of the rat model administered with SPIONs showed no visible signal changes within the tumor over the same time period. Moreover, no evident toxicities in vitro and in vivo with EGFRmAb-SPIONs were clearly identified based on the laboratory examinations.

MPIO (size: 1 � m) were conjugated to anti-LIBS or control single-chain antibody. Following guidewire injury to mouse femoral artery, platelet adhesion was present after 24 h. Mice were perfused with anti-LIBS-MPIO (or control MPIO) via the left ventricle and 11. 7 -tesla MRI was performed on femoral arteries ex vivo. A 3 D gradient echo sequence attained an isotropic resolution of 25 � m. MPIO binding, quantified by MRI, was 4 -fold higher with anti-LIBS-MPIO in comparison to control MPIO (p! 0. 01).

Although iron-based oxide materials like magnetite and maghemite have been commonly used in pharmaceutical and biomedical fields, cobalt- and platinum-based oxides either alone or in combination with iron have also been investigated. In biological applications, the particle surface is normally exposed to physiological environments and would be oxidized if bare particles are directly used. Apart from this, the bare particles are very sensitive to agglomeration to produce a large cluster due to their large surface to volume ratio and dipole–dipole interactions. All these undesirable consequences damage magnetic structures, and properties as well as their end performance. Thus, prior to using these metallic nanoparticles for human body applications, the aspects of their surface modification must be addressed. It is worth mentioning here that a rational modification of a nanoparticle's surfaces not only prevents agglomeration but also guarantees its enhanced biocompatibility, water solubility, and non-specific adsorption to cells (Indira et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} studies have provided evidence for vascular remodeling, for example, angiogenesis, after cerebral ischemia, which may {{play a significant role}} in post-stroke brain plasticity and recovery. Molecular imaging can provide unique in vivo whole-brain information on alterations in the expression of specific endothelial markers. A possible <b>target</b> for molecular <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (MRI) of post-stroke (neo) vascularization is platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1). Here we describe significantly increased PECAM- 1 mRNA levels in ipsilesional brain tissue at 6 h, 24 h and 3 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice, and elevated PECAM- 1 staining throughout the lesion at 3, 7 and 21 days post-stroke. The potential of micron-sized particles of iron oxide (MPIO) conjugated with PECAM- 1 -targeted antibodies, that is, αPECAM- 1 -MPIO, to expose stroke-induced PECAM- 1 upregulation with molecular MRI was assessed. In vitro studies demonstrated that PECAM- 1 -expressing brain endothelial cells could be effectively labeled with αPECAM- 1 -MPIO, giving rise to a fourfold increase in MRI relaxation rate...|$|R

Their nanoscale size, large surface area, unique capabilities, and negligible side effects make NPs highly effective for biomedical applications such as cancer therapy, thrombolysis, and molecular imaging. In particular, nontoxic superparamagnetic magnetic NPs (MNPs) with functionalized surface coatings can conjugate chemotherapeutic drugs or be used to target ligands/proteins, making them useful for drug delivery, <b>targeted</b> therapy, <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging,</b> transfection, and cell/protein/DNA separation. To optimize the therapeutic efficacy of MNPs for a specific application, three issues must be addressed. First, the efficacy of magnetic targeting/guidance is dependent on particle magnetization, which can be controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions during synthesis. Second, the tendency of MNPs to aggregate limits their therapeutic use in vivo; surface modifications to produce high positive or negative charges can reduce this tendency. Finally, the surface of MNPs can be coated with drugs which can be rapidly released after injection, resulting in targeting of low doses of the drug. Drugs therefore need to be conjugated to MNPs such that their release is delayed and their thermal stability enhanced. This chapter describes the creation of nanocarriers with a high drug-loading capacity comprised of a high-magnetization MNP core and a shell of aqueous, stable, conducting polyaniline derivatives and their applications in cancer therapy. It further summarizes some newly developed methods to synthesize and modify the surfaces of MNPs and their biomedical applications.

40|$|Therapeutic {{applications}} of synchrotron X-rays such as microbeam (MRT) and minibeam (MBRT) radiation therapy promise significant advantages over conventional clinical techniques for some diseases if successfully transferred to clinical practice. Preclinical studies show {{clear evidence that}} a number of normal tissues in animal models display a tolerance to much higher doses from MRT compared with conventional radiotherapy. However, a wide spread in the parameters studied makes it difficult to make any conclusions about the associated tumour control or normal tissue complication probabilities. To facilitate more systematic and reproducible preclinical synchrotron radiotherapy studies, a dedicated preclinical station including small-animal irradiation stage was designed and installed at the Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) at the Australian Synchrotron. The stage was characterized in terms of the accuracy and reliability of the vertical scanning speed, as this is the key variable in dose delivery. The measured speed was found to be within 1 % of the nominal speed for the range of speeds measured by an interferometer. Furthermore, dose measurements confirm the expected relationship between speed and dose and show that the measured dose is independent of the scan direction. Important dosimetric parameters such as peak dose, valley dose, the collimator output factor and peak-to-valley dose ratio are presented for 5 mm × 5 mm, 10 mm × 10 mm and 20 mm × 20 mm field sizes. Finally, a feasibility study on three glioma-bearing rats was performed. MRT and MBRT doses were prescribed to achieve an average dose of 65 Gy in the <b>target,</b> and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> follow-up was performed at various time points after irradiation to follow the tumour volume.

40|$|Word {{recognition}} {{research with}} alphabetical scripts has revealed a facilitatory neighborhood size effect, whereby naming of words with more orthographic neighbors is faster {{than that of}} words with fewer neighbors. Preliminary behavioral evidence in Chinese revealed both facilitatory and inhibitory neighborhood size effects, depending on whether there are higher-frequency neighbors (HFNs) than the <b>target.</b> This functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> study examined the neural substrates of the neighborhood size effect with silent naming. Neighborhood size and the HFN factor were factorially manipulated. Behavioral results replicated previous findings showing that larger neighborhood size facilitated naming {{in the absence of}} HFNs, but inhibited naming in their presence. Imaging results identified greater activation in the left middle frontal gyrus for small than larger neighborhood size, and bilateral inferior frontal activations for the with-HFN condition as compared with the without-HFN condition. Critically, there was an interaction in the right middle occipital gyrus showing greater activation for large than for small neighborhood size in the absence of HFNs but no neighborhood size effect in their presence. The results support a proposal that, in addition to a facilitatory contribution from orthographic activation of neighborhoods, naming is also affected by whether there are higher-frequency neighbors, particularly in scripts with deep orthography, where orthographically similar words can be pronounced very differently...|$|R
40|$|To {{avoid the}} {{overheating}} effect of excitation light {{and improve the}} efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) of upconversion nanoplatform, a novel nanoprobe based on 808 nm-excited upconversion nanocomposites (T-UCNPs@Ce 6 @mSiO 2) with low heating effect and deep penetration has been successfully constructed for <b>targeted</b> upconversion luminescence, <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (MRI) and high-efficacy PDT in HER 2 -overexpressed breast cancer. In this nanocomposite, photosensitizers (Ce 6) were covalently conjugated inside of mesoporous silica to enhance the PDT efficacy by shortening the distance of fluorescence resonance energy transfer and to decrease the cytotoxicity by preventing the undesired leakage of Ce 6. Compared with UCNPs@mSiO 2 @Ce 6, UCNPs@Ce 6 @mSiO 2 greatly promoted the singlet oxygen generation and amplified the PDT efficacy under the excitation of 808 nm laser. Importantly, the designed nanoprobe can greatly improve the uptake of HER 2 -positive cells and tumors by modifying the site-specific peptide, and the invivo experiments showed excellent MRI and PDT via intravenous injection by modeling MDA-MB- 435 tumor-bearing nude mice. Our strategy may provide an effective solution for overcoming the heating effect and improving the PDT efficacy of upconversion nanoprobes, and has potential application in visualized theranostics of HER 2 -overexpressed breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic power of molecular markers in men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) using apparently benign areas as <b>targeted</b> by <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (MRI). Methods: In the study, 99 consecutive men with clinical suspicion of PCa in a prospective controlled trial (IMPROD, NCT 01864135) were included. In addition to 12 -core systematic and MRI-targeted biopsies, cores from normal-appearing prostate areas, based on clinical examination, ultrasound, and biparametric prostate MRI, were obtained. The RNA transcript levels of ACSM 1, AMACR, CACNA 1 D, DLX 1, KLK 3, PCA 3, PLA 2 G 7, RHOU, SPINK 1, SPON 2, TMPRSS 2 -ERG, and TDRD 1 were measured with quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Of the 99 men, 69 were diagnosed with PCa, 31 with primary Gleason pattern 3 and 38 with primary Gleason 4 or 5. TDRD 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were 1. 3 times higher (P = 0. 029) and the presence of TMPRSS 2 -ERG mRNAs more frequent in biopsies from men diagnosed with PCa (27 / 69, 39 %) than in men without (5 / 30, 16 %) (P = 0. 035). The 2 markers identified aggressive PCa defined as Gleason sum≥ 7 at biopsy: median TDRD 1 mRNA level was 1. 4 higher (P = 0. 005) and TMPRSS 2 -ERG expression more frequent (P< 0. 001) in high-grade cancer. A multivariate analysis of mRNA expression of 11 candidate genes combined with KLK 3, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), percentage-free PSA, and prostate volume improved the discrimination between aggressive and nonaggressive PCa (area under the curve = 0. 77) compared with the use of the candidate genes or clinical parameters alone. However, serum PSA, percentage-free PSA, and prostate volume resulted in the best discrimination between non-organ-confined PCa (T 3) from organ-confined PCa (T 2) and healthy prostate (area under the curve = 0. 86). Conclusions: Of the 11 studied genes, TDRD 1 and TMPRSS 2 -ERG were able to statistically significantly differentiate men with PCa from men without it as single markers. However, a multivariate analysis using 15 features outperformed each individual marker in identifying aggressive PCa. © 2016 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of oncology, {{research}} is now focused {{on the development of}} theranostic nanosystems that combine the functions of drug delivery and imaging for diagnosis/monitoring. In this context, we designed polyethylene glycol (PEG) ylated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) for the delivery of doxorubicin (DOX), an antineoplastic agent. These DOX-loaded PEGylated SPIONs, or DLPS, should be useful for the delivery of DOX in vivo, as well as for <b>magnetic</b> drug <b>targeting</b> (MDT) and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (MRI). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potential applications of DLPS in vivo as drug carrier systems for the reduction of xenograft breast tumors induced in nude mice. Prior to the animal model experiments, the main internalization pathways for the nanovectors in MDA-MB 435 breast cancer cells were determined to be based on caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The time- and quantity-dependence of the nanoparticle uptake by the cells altered the in vitro cytotoxicity of the DLPS. The in vitro antiproliferative effect of the DLPS was dependent not only on DOX concentration, but also on the efficacy of nanoparticle internalization. Evaluation of the effect of DLPS treatment on xenograft tumors in nude mice showed that DLPS limited tumor growth in a manner comparable to that of free DOX under normal conditions of tumor growth. The application of an external magnetic field on tumors, i. e., MDT, did not improve the efficacy of the DLPS treatment. Nevertheless, the vectorization of DOX with DLPS appears to limit the hematologic side effects usually associated with DOX treatment...|$|R
