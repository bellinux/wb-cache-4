5|$|Cornelis Suijk—a former {{director}} of the Anne Frank Foundation and president of the U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation—announced in 1999 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possession of five pages that had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary prior to publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before his death in 1980. The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by Anne Frank about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother. Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001. Since then, they have been included in new editions of the diary.|$|E
5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation. He felt {{he had become a}} journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few of his teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his career}} with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E

5|$|He {{suffered}} an ankle injury in a reserve match against Darlington on 8 January 2008, {{and returned to}} the team for a 2–2 draw away to Altrincham 11 days later. He was dropped from the team against Halifax Town in favour of loanee Leo Fortune-West, and even though manager Walker assured Brodie <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club's long-term plans, Brodie reacted angrily to being substituted for Fortune-West at home to Ebbsfleet United on 29 March 2008. He finished his first full season at York with 14 goals in 48 appearances, as they finished 14th in the Conference Premier. In April 2008, the club took up its option of extending his contract until the end of 2008–09. Newly promoted Conference North club Gateshead made an inquiry for Brodie in June 2008, which was rejected by York. Gateshead later had a four-figure bid rejected, which would have been doubled if they would have won promotion into the Conference Premier the following season.|$|E
5|$|His {{record in}} matches was equally impressive: at Berlin in 1890 {{he drew a}} short {{play-off}} match against his brother Berthold; and won all his other matches from 1889 to 1893, mostly against top-class opponents: Curt von Bardeleben (1889; ranked 9th {{best player in the}} world by Chessmetrics at that time), Jacques Mieses (1889; ranked 11th), Henry Edward Bird (1890; then 60 years old; ranked 29th), Berthold Englisch (1890; ranked 18th), Joseph Henry Blackburne (1892, without losing a game; Blackburne was aged 51 then, but still 9th in the world), Jackson Showalter (1892–93; 22nd) and Celso Golmayo Zúpide (1893; 29th). Chessmetrics calculates that Emanuel Lasker became the world's strongest player in mid-1890, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top ten {{from the very beginning of}} his recorded career in 1889.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} begins on November 3, 1966 with Guevara {{arriving}} in Bolivia {{disguised as a}} middle-aged representative of the Organization of American States hailing from Uruguay, who subsequently drives into the mountains to meet his men. The film is organized {{by the number of}} days <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite his status as a foreigner. By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to be mistaken for a cocaine smuggler, and the Bolivian Communist Party, led by Mario Monje, refuse to support the armed struggle. On Day 100, {{there is a shortage of}} food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and Bolivian followers.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, tengu {{came to be}} feared as the {{vigilant}} protectors {{of certain}} forests. In the 1764 collection of strange stories , a tale tells {{of a man who}} wanders into a deep valley while gathering leaves, only to be faced with a sudden and ferocious hailstorm. A group of peasants later tell him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley where the guhin live, and anyone who takes a single leaf from that place will surely die. In the , written in 1849, the author describes the customs of the wood-cutters of Mino Province, who used a sort of rice cake called kuhin-mochi to placate the tengu, who would otherwise perpetrate all sorts of mischief. In other provinces a special kind of fish called okoze was offered to the tengu by woodsmen and hunters, in exchange for a successful day's work. The people of Ishikawa Prefecture have until recently believed that the tengu loathe mackerel, and have used this fish as a charm against kidnappings and hauntings by the mischievous spirits.|$|E
5|$|The couple moved {{repeatedly}} {{over the}} following year – first to Laguna Beach, California, then to Santa Catalina Island, California, New York City, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard's first wife's home at South Colby, Washington. Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce {{on the grounds of}} desertion and non-support, and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Northrup, let alone that he had married her. The arrival of Hubbard and Northrup three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard's family, who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly. Northrup had no idea of Hubbard's first marriage or why people were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her that his parents were still married. She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard caught up with her and convinced her to stay, saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of getting a divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Northrup was legal. The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947, where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines.|$|E
5|$|With Spider-Man cast, filming was set {{to begin}} the {{following}} November in New York City and on Sony soundstages. The film was set for release a year later, but when the film was postponed to be released on May 3, 2002, filming officially began on January 8, 2001 in Culver City, California. After {{the terrorist attacks on}} September 11, 2001, certain sequences were re-filmed, and images of the Twin Towers were digitally erased from the film. Sony's Stage 29 was used for Peter's Forest Hills home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Peter takes on Bonesaw McGraw (Randy Savage). Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in Downey, California. On March 6, forty-five-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $58,805.|$|E
