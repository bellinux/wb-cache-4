The key objective is to explore the structures and processes used by regional destinations to foster innovation. The eleven case studies represent many different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> and many different forms of tourism. Innovation is employed for different purposes including initiation of organised tourism activity, rejuvenation <b>of</b> tired <b>destinations</b> and, significantly, the linking of tourism with other spheres of economic and community development...|$|R
5000|$|Several {{different}} types of technology {{have been used for}} destination signs, from simple rigid placards held in place by a frame or clips, to rollsigns, to various types of computerized, electronically controlled signs, such as flip-dot, LCD or LED displays. All of these can still be found in use today, but most transit-vehicle destination signs now in use in North America and Europe are electronic signs. In the USA, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 specifies certain design criteria for transit-vehicle destination signs, such as maximum and minimum character height-to-width ratio and contrast level, to ensure the signs are sufficiently readable to visually impaired persons. [...] In the 2010s, LED signs have replaced flip-dot signs as the most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> sign in new buses and rail transit vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Drag {{and drop}} {{operation}} {{is one of}} the key capabilities of any Graphical User Interface. The user can do quite complex operations simply by visually dragging and dropping objects from one location to another. It saves user from remembering and typing a lot of commands. The result of a drag and drop operation may vary depending the type of source object and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> object. For example dragging a file and dropping on a folder may copy or move the file to the destination folder, dropping that file to a remote FTP location may upload that file using internet, dropping that file on a printer icon may print that file, dropping that file on the trash can may delete that file, and dropping that file on an executable may play or open or compute or manipulate that file. Although a drag and drop operation prima facie seems to be a simple operation, it can become extremely complicated depending on the type of source objects dragged and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> objects selected for dropping. There are many limitations of a conventional drag and drop operation. This article points out the difficulties of a drag and drop operation and illustrates the solutions disclosed by various inventions to overcome those difficulties.

40|$|Existing {{urban and}} {{suburban}} development patterns and the subsequent automobile dependence are leading to increased traffic congestion and air pollution. In response to the growing ills caused by urban sprawl, {{there has been an}} increased interest in creating more “livable” communities in which destinations are brought closer to ones home or workplace (that is, achieving travel needs through land use planning). While several reports suggest best practices for integrated land use-planning, little research has focused on examining detailed relationships between actual travel behavior and mean distance to various services. For example, how far will pedestrians travel to access different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>destinations?</b> How to know if the “one quarter mile assumption” that is often bantered about is reliable? How far will bicyclists travel to cycle on a bicycle only facility? How far do people drive for their common retail needs? To examine these questions, this research makes use of available travel survey data for the Twin Cities region. A primary outcome of this research is to examine different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> and accurately and robustly estimate distance decay models for auto and non-auto travel modes, and also to comment on its applicability for: (a) different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> travel, and (b) development of accessibility measures that incorporate this information.

These data are taken from the March CPS because the CPS-ORG does not include information on place of residence in the previous year. Ideally, we should compute internal migration with t- 1 as the base period. But the March CPS does not provide PMSA/MSA of residence in year t- 1. Thus, while we can compute internal migration with t- 1 as the base year, we cannot stratify our data in t- 1 by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> (traditional versus new high growth versus new low-growth).

Moreover, perceived and objectively assessed environmental attributes, including proximity <b>of</b> <b>destinations,</b> may influence walking behavior in different ways. This study compares perceived and objectively assessed distance to several different destinations and examines whether correspondence between objective and perceived distance is influenced by age, gender, neighborhood walkability, and walking behavior. Distances to most destinations close to home are overestimated, whereas distances to those farther away are underestimated. Perceived and objective distances to certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>destinations</b> are differentially associated with walking behavior.

In this paper, an econometric analysis of the possible determinants of economic performance of full service airlines after liberalisation has been carried out.

The {{vast majority of the}} moves, however, are within the same state. About 1 % of Mexicans in the traditional destinations and 4 to 6 % of Mexicans in the new destinations lived in a different state in the preceding year 11.

40|$|Even though spuriously, {{there is}} plenty of {{evidence}} that links race and ethnicity with street crime at the individual and aggregate levels. Typically, higher levels of disadvantage are linked to higher crime levels. However, despite the average low socioeconomic status of Latinos, the low crime proneness?particularly?of first-generation Latino immigrants has been well established in the literature with plenty of quantifiable evidence. This phenomenon has been called the Latino Criminological Paradox, or the Latino Paradox of Crime. In this dissertation, I use crime data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study 2000 (NNCS) and demographic data from 2000 Census? Summary File 3 (SF 3) to assess whether a ?paradox? exists. Then, I analyze the extent of this so-called ?paradox? in terms of exposure to crime for Latino and non-Latino groups in traditional and non-traditional Latino immigrant destinations. I conclude my dissertation with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Ordered Logistic Regression analyses to assess the effect that different variables have on crime rates and over-exposure to crime in 64 metropolitan areas. This research shows that a Latino Criminological Paradox exists regardless of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> in which immigrants settle. Even when Latino immigrants are residentially segregated to a similar extent than that of Black populations, immigrants are exposed to less crime in their neighborhoods. This research also shows that Latino immigrants experience some upward social mobility (in terms of residential attainment) after a period of 10 years of residence in the United States. In addition, I found no evidence to suggest that this ?paradox? is more noticeable in traditional Latino immigrant destination than in non-traditional destinations, nor that residential attainment varies by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> One of the major contributions of this research is that it focuses on the residential segregation of Latino immigrants and its correlation with exposure to crime. Unlike previous literature, this research does not focus on criminal victimization or offending. In addition, this research analyzes data from 91 cities across the country, something that?to my understanding?has not been done before...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} agrarian structures on the migration behavior and destination of rural household heads and individuals in Kenya. To explore the complexity of migration we extend the standard Harris-Todaro framework to account for land inequality and size as well as <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> Using logistic regressions, we show that Kenyan household heads born in districts with higher land inequality, smaller per capita land and lower per capita rural income {{are more likely to}} migrate. We show that for individuals whose incomes are squeezed by larger land inequality, migration from villages to suburban Nairobi, smaller cities, and villages in different districts could be a preferable strategy to migrating to Metro Nairobi. The impact of land inequality is more significant for male than female migration. Moreover, the level of education, age, marital status, gender, religion and distance to Nairobi play a role in migration behavior...|$|E
40|$|As {{concerns}} such as growing {{traffic congestion}} continue to mount in communities nationwide, {{there is increasing}} attention devoted {{to the role of}} infrastructure investments in affecting travel behavior. Several movements stemming from the fields of urban planning, transportation, and landscape architecture suggest that bringing trip origins and destinations closer together is a necessary step to reduce overall travel distances and promote use of “active transportation ” modes such as walking and bicycling. A key component to understanding the effectiveness of this approach, however, lies in knowing how close destinations need to be for residents to know they exist- and subsequently walk or bike to them. Equally important is understanding how individual’s perception of walking distance to destinations differs from the actual distance and how these perceptions vary by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> (i. e., bank, coffee shop, etc.) or socio-demographic group. This research focuses on understanding perceptions of individual proximity to urban businesses and facilities and associated measurement issues. We use the results of a mail survey administered to residents living in urban, inner suburban, and outer suburban contexts in the Twin Cities, Minnesota region to analyze three aspects of distance perception.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a method called Predestination {{that uses a}} history <b>of</b> a driver’s <b>destinations,</b> along with data about driving behaviors, to predict where a driver is going as a trip progresses. Driving behaviors include <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>destinations,</b> driving efficiency, and trip times. Beyond considering previously visited destinations, Predestination leverages an open-world modeling methodology that considers the likelihood of users visiting previously unobserved locations based on trends in the data and on the background properties of locations. This allows our algorithm to smoothly transition between “out of the box ” with no training data to more fully trained with increasing numbers of observations. Multiple components of the analysis are fused via Bayesian inference to produce a probabilistic map <b>of</b> <b>destinations.</b> Our algorithm was trained and tested on hold-out data drawn from a database of GPS driving data gathered from 169 different subjects who drove 7, 335 different trips. ...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{competition}} among international tourism destinations has turned many countries to seek growth from destination branding and positioning strategies. The most popular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> {{of interest for}} positioning studies has been countries, followed by states and very few {{studies have focused on}} city products. This study aims at contributing to city marketing and positioning literature. The objectives of this study are two-fold: firstly to identify whether cognitive images of Cape Town are perceived differently from that of Johannesburg, Durban and Pretoria, and secondly, whether demographic and travelling characteristics have an impact on image perceptions. A systematic sample of international visitors was interviewed using the face-to-face method, which led to a response rate of 199 completed questionnaires. Correspondence analysis revealed that Cape Town was perceived to be similar to the other three cities on attributes such as service levels, variety of accommodation, and transport and infrastructure. The other three cities were rated worse than Cape Town in terms of variety of activities, attractions and scenery, and to some extent safety. Additional analyses showed that demographic and travelling characteristics had a significant influence on perceived image of the various cities. The results of the study therefore suggest that attributes such as nightlife, friendly people and culture could be used more effectively to differentiate Cape Town. Thereof, the marketing implications are highlighted...|$|E

The casino industry is growing intensively in the territory of Montenegro and a question arises whether casino tourism development is an opportunity or a danger for Montenegro and its sustainability. The goals of this paper are to show and assess the current offerings and potential for development of casino tourism in Montenegro, to point out advantages and challenges in development of casino tourism in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> Econometric models {{were used for the}} needs of this paper (time series correlations and regression for defining relation between casino business and tourism, ARIMA model for prognosis of casino business in the context of tourism until 2020).

The main finding suggests that casino tourism in Montenegro is not sufficiently developed, but that we can boast of a high-quality casino offering such as Slovenia. Limitations lie in the lack of data over a long period and the non-existence of the records on number of casino tourists in Montenegro.

40|$|Health is an {{integral}} part of a traveler's experience. It affects overall satisfaction levels during travels and ultimately, quality of life. An individual's previous experience with travel in general as well as a particular <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> may affect perceived stress levels. In turn, stress levels may affect immunological functioning of the body, particularly in regards to infectious illnesses, which are primarily encountered by travelers abroad. The main goal of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived stress, health behaviors, travel experience, and type, severity, length, and impact of illness experienced during travel to tropical destinations. Participants for this study were recruited at the International Airport in San Diego, through travel websites, and through individual referrals. The initial interview assessed levels of perceived stress, health practices prior to the trip, and overall travel experience. Upon return from the trip, a follow-up interview assessed type, length, severity, and impact of illness experienced during travel as well as health behaviors practiced during the trip. Travelers who experienced greater levels of stress prior to traveling also reported performing fewer general health practices during the two weeks prior to the trip. Greater levels of perceived stress prior to the trip also predicted fewer precautionary health behaviors during the trip. No relationship was found between travel experience and pre-travel perceived stress. Finally, neither travel-specific health behaviors nor perceived stress prior to the trip were found to be predictive of illness outcomes during the trip...|$|E
