500|$|Shortly after {{entering}} New Paltz, the trail crosses a bridge over Plattekill Creek. The masonry for {{the bridge was}} completed by late June 1870, and <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> was done by July. Originally made of wood, the bridge was accidentally set on fire in 1880 by ashes or sparks from a passing train. This prompted the railroad to coat its rail ties with tin while replacing its wooden bridges with ones made of stone. The bridge's original abutments were made of Shawangunk conglomerate. It was rebuilt in 1912, and crosses the Plattekill Creek at a height of [...] The Shawangunk Ridge is visible from the bridge.|$|E

50|$|The Hurricane Canal is a hand-excavated {{irrigation}} canal that diverted {{water from the}} Virgin River to the vicinity of Hurricane, Utah. The 7.5 mi canal was built starting in 1891 and completed in 1904. The work included a diversion dam on the Virgin River, the 12 ft wide canal grade with an 8 ft wide by 4 ft deep channel, {{and a series of}} flumes and <b>trestles.</b> <b>Work</b> was done by local men, mainly between November and May. The work was paid for by the canal's shareholders, whose lands on the Hurricane Bench were to be irrigated by the canal. Allotments were limited to 20 acre for shareholder. The 2000 acre of new agricultural lands allowed the settlement of Hurricane after 1906.|$|R
6000|$|What is it now--nine thirty? Ah, {{then we must}} be {{nearing the}} town,--this big bush that we are passing through, you {{remember}} it surely as the great swamp just {{this side of the}} bridge over the Ossawippi? There is the bridge itself, and the long roar of the train as it rushes sounding over the <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> that rises above the marsh. Hear the clatter as we pass the semaphores and switch lights! We must be close in now! ...|$|E
60|$|Brooke {{set out for}} the settlement, {{and slept}} at a ranch on the way, where he left his horse which had fallen lame, for it was a two days' journey, while {{it was late in the}} {{afternoon}} when he sat down to rest where the trail crossed a bridge. The latter was a somewhat rudimentary log structure put together with the axe and saw alone, of a width that would just allow one of the light wagons in use in that country to cross over it, and, as the bottom of the hollow the river swirled through was level there, an ungainly piece of <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> carried the road up to it. There was a long, white rapid not far away, and the roar of it rang in deep vibrations among the rocks above. Brooke, who had walked a long way, found the pulsating sound soothing, while the fragrance the dusky cedars distilled had its usual drowsy effect on him, and as he watched the glancing water slide by his eyes grew heavy.|$|E
60|$|I {{have just}} {{received}} yours and Mary's letters and {{really did not}} know that I had been so negligent as not to have written to you before. I did write from Camp Yates, but since receiving yours remember that I did not get to finish it at the time, and have neglected it since. The fact is that since I took command of this regiment I have had no spare time, and flatter myself, and believe I am sustained in my judgment by my officers and men, that I have done as much for the improvement and efficiency of this regiment as was ever done for a command in the same length of time.--You will see that I am in Missouri. Yesterday I went out as far as Palmyra and stationed my regiment along the railroad {{for the protection of the}} bridges, <b>trestle</b> <b>work,</b> etc. The day before I sent a small command, all I could spare, to relieve Colonel Smith who was surrounded by secessionists. He effected his relief, however, before they got there. To-morrow I start for Monroe, where I shall fall in with Colonel Palmer and one company of horse and two pieces of artillery. One regiment and a battalion of infantry will move on to Mexico, North Missouri road, and all of us together will try to nab the notorious Tom Harris with his 1200 secessionists. His men are mounted, and I have but little faith in getting many of them. The notorious Jim Green who was let off on his parole of honor but a few days ago, has gone towards them with a strong company well armed. If he is caught it will prove bad work for him.|$|E

50|$|Multispan plate-girder bridges {{may be an}} {{economical}} way to span gaps {{longer than}} can be spanned by a single girder. Spacing of piers between the Abutments {{is dependent on the}} capacity of the selected plate girders. Separate plate girder bridges span between each pair of abutments in order to allow for expansion joints between the spans. Concrete is commonly used for low piers, while steel <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> may be used for high bridges.|$|E

5000|$|Gitt also {{recommended}} a bridge crossing for the Monocacy river 30 feet above its bed, requiring a truss bridge with two spans of 150 feet each connecting to wooden <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> {{on the west}} shore of about 300 feet in length, and 15 feet high with masonry foundations up to the [...] "high water" [...] mark.(Gitt, page 43) Gitt also noted {{that some of the}} ravine crossings would be replaced with embankments within ten to twelve years. Bridge spans were required for Big Pipe Creek (100 feet), Little Pipe Creek and Antietam required spans of 80-90 feet and 60 feet for Owings Creek.(Gitt, page 44) ...|$|E
5000|$|Bracut (formerly, Brainard) is an unincorporated {{community}} in Humboldt County, California. It {{is located on}} the Northwestern Pacific Railroad 3 mi south of Arcata, at an elevation of 16 feet (5 m). The name originated as a contraction of the railway cut through Brainard hill in the Humboldt Bay salt marsh. Railway <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> originally connected the hill south to Eureka and north to Arcata. Much of the hill was subsequently excavated to provide fill to replace the original trestle work; and the railway fill prism became a dike encouraging conversion of the inland salt marsh to pasture land. [...] The leveled hill is now the site of several large structures remaining from previous lumber operations, a District 1 CalTrans yard, and a KOA campground.|$|E
5000|$|The new station, {{which opened}} on 31 October 1938 (the earlier station closing {{permanently}} the previous night), {{was designed to}} be completely subterranean, providing a much-needed pedestrian underpass for the road above. However, in order to accommodate the space needed for this, and the platforms below, the existing track required lowering by more than seven feet. To achieve this task whilst still keeping the track open during the day, the bed underneath the track was excavated, and the track held up by a timber <b>trestle</b> <b>work.</b> Then, once excavation was complete and the new station constructed around the site, an army of over 900 workmen lowered the whole track simultaneously in one night, using overhead hooks to suspend the track when necessary. The hooks [...]|$|E

5000|$|Sherman's army reached Meridian on February 14, 1864. Still {{unaware of}} Smith's defeat at West Point {{and the one}} to come at Okolona, Sherman decided to {{continue}} waiting for Smith in Meridian until the morning of February 20, when he gave up and returned to Vicksburg. While he and his army were waiting, Sherman ordered his troops [...] "to wipe the appointed meeting place off the map" [...] by destroying the railroads and burning much of the area to the ground. Sherman's troops destroyed 115 mi of railroad, 61 bridges, 6075 ft of <b>trestle</b> <b>work,</b> 20 locomotives, 28 cars, and 3 steam sawmills. After the troops departed, inhabitants of the city were without food for some days, but the soldiers had not directly inflicted any personal injuries during the attack.

50|$|The journey {{started with}} Orders {{received}} on December 10, 1862 They passed the river into West TN on December 15. In the short interval seldom {{in the annals}} of war had more hard swift riding as many sharp recounters, affluent in results, been crowded in the same short space. That command averaged over 20 miles per day fought three well contested engagements with diurnal skirmishes, had destroyed 50 large and small bridges on the Mobile and Ohio RR had broken up so much <b>trestle</b> <b>work</b> of the road as to render the RR useless until after the war. They had captured and burned 18 or 20 stockades, captured or killed 2500 of the enemy, taken or disabled 10 pieces of field artillery, captured 50 wagons and ambulances with their teams, had captured 10,000 stands of small arms, one million rounds of ammo, having returned thoroughly armed equipped including blankets, never resting a full night. Forrest left on the 10th/11th with woeful preparation of weapons and supplies, returned with each man fully armed a surplus of 500 Enfield rifles, 1800 blankets, knapsacks, and a seasoned fighting force.|$|E
