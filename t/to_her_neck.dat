5|$|In Japan, D.Gray-man {{has been}} put on hiatus many times; once due to Hoshino falling seriously ill with Norovirus and another because of an injury <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> However the series {{continued}} shortly after in both cases. In November 2008, Weekly Shōnen Jump announced that Hoshino was again putting the series on hold due to an injured wrist. Publication resumed in March 2009. The series once again went on hiatus on May 11. The series resumed in the seasonal magazine Akamaru Jump on August 17, 2009. Following the release in Akamaru Jump, D.Gray-Man resumed its serialization on November 4, 2009 in the monthly-release Japanese manga magazine, Jump Square. Additionally, Hoshino was one of the multiple manga authors that celebrated the 10th anniversary of the manga series Naruto by drawing her own rendition of the main character, Naruto Uzumaki.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E
25|$|Autopsy {{revealed}} that Yamamoto suffered trauma caused by gunshot wounds <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and torso despite {{her use of}} body armor and that {{the primary cause of}} her death was internal bleeding and rapid blood loss. It was further revealed by the autopsy that she had been shot nine times and that the cause of her death was a bullet to the neck, damaging her spinal cord.|$|E
60|$|Brand's horse {{seemed to}} stumble, {{and his face}} was {{invisible}} for a moment as he stooped down <b>to</b> pat <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> When he looked up there was a curious gleam in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|The Marchioness {{changed the}} motion of her head, which had not yet left off nodding, and {{suddenly}} began to shake it from side to side, with a vehemence which threatened <b>to</b> dislocate <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... “Someone had <b>to</b> stick <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> out for {{the cause}} of muscular women … and I’ve got no regrets about that... not one”, she said. One of her catchphrases was [...] "Get built without guilt".|$|R
25|$|Bertha fell mysteriously ill, {{suffering}} the same symptoms as Laura. After consulting with a specially ordered priestly doctor, the General realized that Bertha was being visited by a vampire. He hid {{with a sword}} and waited until a large black creature crawled onto his niece's bed and <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> He leapt from his hiding place and attacked the beast, which {{took the form of}} Millarca. She fled through the locked door, unharmed. Bertha died immediately afterward.|$|E
25|$|Forensic {{pathologist}} Martin Sage {{performed the}} autopsy the next day, and found Elliott died from blood loss. Two wounds pierced {{her heart and}} one lung, with other wounds <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and throat severing the main artery and the major vein. In total she received 216 separate injuries, mostly stab wounds from a knife blade, with some inflicted by scissors. Additionally there were seven blunt force injuries. The pathologist found some defensive wounds, and that the attack targeted aspects of beauty and was intended to disfigure.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the birth}} of her fourth child, Luke, Yates became depressed. On June 16, 1999, Rusty found her shaking and chewing her fingers. The next day, she {{attempted}} to commit suicide by overdosing on pills. She was admitted to the hospital and prescribed antidepressants. Soon after her release, she begged Rusty to let her die as she held a knife up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Once again hospitalized, she was given a cocktail of medications including Haldol, an anti-psychotic drug. Her condition improved immediately and she was prescribed it on her release. After that, Rusty moved the family into a small house for the sake of her health. She appeared temporarily stabilized.|$|E
50|$|Burying someone up <b>to</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> in sand, or burying oneself, {{is another}} popular beach activity.|$|R
5000|$|Lady Necklace (17-20): The middle sister, {{she is able}} <b>to</b> extend <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> {{great lengths}} & {{possesses}} telescopic vision in her third eye. She disguised herself as the abusing and indifferent mother of Akomaru's [...] "Kasumi guise". Killed by Dairen'oh.|$|R
6000|$|The soft blush had now overspread {{the whole}} of the girl's face, even down <b>to</b> <b>her</b> graceful <b>neck.</b> She waited to see Marguerite comfortably {{installed}} in an armchair, then she resumed shyly: ...|$|R
25|$|In 1988 Chikatilo {{killed three}} times, murdering an {{unidentified}} woman in Krasny Sulin in April and two boys in May and July. His first murder victim was lured off a train at Krasny Sulin before Chikatilo bound her hands {{behind her back}} and stuffed her mouth with dirt, before severing her nose from her face and inflicting numerous knife wounds <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Chikatilo then bludgeoned her {{to death with a}} slab of concrete; her body was found on 6 April. Investigators noted that the knife wounds inflicted upon this victim were similar to those inflicted on the victims linked to the manhunt and killed between 1982 and 1985, but as the woman had been killed with a slab of concrete and had not been disemboweled, investigators were unsure whether to link this murder to the investigation. In May, Chikatilo killed a 9-year-old boy, named Aleksey Voronko, in Ilovaisk, Ukraine. The boy's wounds left no doubt the killer had struck again, and this murder was linked to the manhunt. On 14 July, Chikatilo killed 15-year-old Yevgeny Muratov at Donleskhoz station near Shakhty. Muratov's murder was also linked to the investigation, although his body was not found until April 1989. Although his remains were largely skeletal, Muratov's autopsy revealed he had been emasculated, and suffered at least 30 knife wounds.|$|E
2500|$|A {{post-mortem}} examination revealed Maher {{had suffered a}} stab wound to her left wrist, bruising <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> blunt force trauma with a cinder block {{to the area of}} her right eyebrow, and lacerations to her right arm. [...] Maher's left breast had been removed and placed into her mouth. At the time of Maher's murder, Dupas had been out of prison for just over a year after serving time for rape offences and was no longer {{under the supervision of the}} government corrections agency, Corrections Victoria.|$|E
2500|$|A {{garbage bag}} {{was used to}} suffocate her, as it was found around her head. She had also been {{physically}} abused and raped. Creek had been bitten on the neck and was beaten and slashed in the facial area. The bite had caused compression <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> which {{played a role in}} her death. The word [...] "hi" [...] was written on the girl's palm, which was raised in an upward position. A price tag from a bookstore was observed to have been present on one of her arms. She wore few clothes, as some were likely removed in the process of the assault, including her jacket and backpack containing personal items. Her underwear was later discovered inside of her pants pocket. A possible explanation to why some of her belongings were not found at the scene is that the murderer may have taken souvenirs. Authorities surmise that Creek may have been murdered by someone that may have received prostitution services from her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Florence." [...] And the two parted, hating {{each other}} as only female enemies can hate. But Florence, {{when she was in}} the carriage, threw herself on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>neck</b> and kissed <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lapham {{answered}} nothing; {{but when}} she met Penelope she gave the girl's wan face a sharp look, and began <b>to</b> whimper on <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|R
6000|$|This {{brings to}} my memory {{a passage in}} Montaigne, of a common prostitute, who, in the {{storming}} of a town, when a soldier came up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chamber, and offered violence <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chastity, rather chose <b>to</b> venture <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> by leaping out of the window, than suffer a rape; yet still continued her trade of lewdness, whilst she had any customers left.[6] ...|$|R
60|$|She {{repeated}} the question--repeated it almost humbly. The child {{put his hand}} up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and kissed her.|$|E
60|$|Lenore flushed scarlet. She {{was less}} {{angry with her}} little sister than with the incomprehensible fact of a playful word {{bringing}} the blood stingingly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and face.|$|E
60|$|Again {{came the}} two {{soldiers}} {{to the cottage}} and seized the girl, carried her to the river bank, tied a stone <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and flung her into the water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks be to God, we are saved!" [...] murmured Mrs Stanley, as {{her husband}} {{assisted}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> rise and led her {{beyond the reach of}} the waves, while Edith still clung with a deadly grasp <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>neck.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Now was {{the golden}} time. Joan drove her spurs home and waved the advance with her sword. [...] "Follow me!" [...] she cried, and bent <b>her</b> head <b>to</b> <b>her</b> horse's <b>neck</b> and sped away like the wind! ...|$|R
50|$|Then, she and {{her sister}} were taken up to the platform. The executioner asked his helpers <b>to</b> take <b>her</b> first for the sake of order, as her sister was quiet and passive. He told them <b>to</b> hold <b>her</b> firmly, <b>to</b> {{preserve}} his reputation. She kicked and screamed about vengeance, and cursed and fought every step of the way. It finally took four men just <b>to</b> get <b>her</b> up <b>to</b> the platform. On the platform, three men sat on <b>her</b> <b>to</b> hold <b>her</b> down, a fourth pulled <b>her</b> hair <b>to</b> expose <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> and a fifth struggled <b>to</b> press <b>her</b> head down <b>to</b> get <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> in place. The executioner aimed and struck. The audience cheered at a perfect strike as <b>her</b> head fell <b>to</b> the ground. <b>Her</b> sister was quickly dealt with, and then the corpse of Anna Månsdotter was decapitated. The three heads and bodies were nailed onto ladders and dropped onto the stakes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope mamma {{will be the}} happier," [...] said Gwendolen, in a more cheerful way, {{lifting her}} hands {{backward}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and moving toward the door. She wanted to waive those higher considerations.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} put into her own hand by the postman on his morning rounds. She flushed down <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> on receipt of it, and turned it over and over. 'It is mine?' she said.|$|E
6000|$|She ran {{forward with}} long leaps {{out of the}} cornfield and caught it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> and mumbled its wet cheeks with hungry kisses. [...] "Oh, my honey, my honey! Did it think its mother had left--" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Terry had {{at times}} seen these wheelless {{vehicles}} shoot {{from the top}} of a mountain to the bottom like a balloon with the gas out, and had also heard of occasional accidents in connection with them. Stoutly she vowed that nothing should induce <b>her</b> <b>to</b> trust <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> one of them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am the Lady of Love,' she said. 'Look!' She {{raised her}} arms, and the thin, loose sleeves falling back {{displayed}} their roundness and exquisite shape; {{she lifted her}} head, and Amyntas thrilled <b>to</b> cover <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> with kisses. At last she loosened her girdle, and when the silken tunic fell <b>to</b> <b>her</b> feet she stood before him in perfect loveliness.|$|R
6000|$|He bent <b>to</b> kiss <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> [...] "I don't {{want to be}} unfair. I guess love is a great thing, all right. But {{think it}} would stand much {{of that kind of}} stuff? Oh, honey, am I so bad? Can't you like me at all? I've--I've been so fond of you!" ...|$|R
60|$|Putting {{its tiny}} hand up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> and holding it there, within her dress, {{next to her}} distracted heart, she set its {{sleeping}} face against her: closely, steadily, against her: and sped onward to the River.|$|E
6000|$|... "People say {{youth is}} pleasant; I myself find middle age far pleasanter," [...] she remarked, {{removing}} hair pins and combs, and taking up her brush. When it fell loose her hair only came down <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E
60|$|So he {{went out}} sadly and told his guards that the empress was {{to be buried in}} the earth up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> so that {{everyone}} might know what would happen to those who dared to deceive the emperor.|$|E
50|$|Her examination, {{which was}} {{recorded}} by Samuel Parris, was notable {{for the fact}} she was asked <b>to</b> re-pin <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> cloth, which seemingly caused the afflicted girls, including Mary Walcott, Abigail Williams, and Mercy Lewis to be pricked, {{to the point of}} drawing blood, according to the transcript. Mary maintained her innocence.|$|R
5000|$|Several months later, Song Qian meets Nana {{and tells}} her that {{everything}} is over. The camera turns to reveal that Xiao Ai is grasping Nana and about <b>to</b> slash <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> saying that [...] "once Nana is killed, they (Xiao Ai and Song Qian) can be together". Song Qian is shocked, but slowly gives a smile.|$|R
6000|$|Prometheus-like {{from heaven}} she stole [...] The fire that through those silken lashes [...] In darkest glances seems to roll, [...] From eyes that cannot hide their flashes: [...] And as along her bosom steal [...] In {{lengthened}} flow her raven tresses, [...] You'd swear each clustering lock could feel, [...] And curled <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> caresses.|$|R
