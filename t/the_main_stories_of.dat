25|$|The {{preparation}} for the next season for Žalgiris began during the 2016 LKL finals, with Žalgiris signing point guard Léo Westermann to replace the departing Jerome Randle. After the season, Pocius, Hanlan, Vougioukas, and long time Žalgiris players Siim-Sander Vene and Kaspars Vecvagars, all left the team, while Žalgiris choose to retain the services of Seibutis and Motum. Žalgiris also re-signed Edgaras Ulanovas. One of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> the off-season became the situation of head coach Jasikevičius, who was pursued by FC Barcelona Bàsquet to become their new head coach, {{but in the end}} decided to remain with Žalgiris. During the entire previous season, the main problem for the team was the lack of a good shooter – to fix the problem, Žalgiris signed Kevin Pangos, and to replace Vougioukas at center, Žalgiris took Augusto Lima from Real Madrid on loan. Žalgiris also signed the returning Artūras Milaknis to a 3-year deal. Isaiah Hartenstein, a very talented prospect from Germany, who was signed during the previous season, is also scheduled to make his debut in the upcoming season. In August, Žalgiris signed Antanas Kavaliauskas, the captain of Lietuvos Rytas, in a rather controversial decision, as Kavaliauskas had previously promised to never play for Žalgiris, with Kavaliauskas apologizing to fans soon after the signing was announced. With the signing of Kavaliauskas, the formation of the team was complete. In February, Žalgiris won the first title of the 2017 season, winning the King Mindaugas Cup by defeating BC Neptūnas in the first round 81:58, BC Vytautas in the semi-finals 76:55, and BC Lietkabelis in the finals 84:63, while rival and 2016 champion Lietuvos rytas was eliminated in the first round. Edgaras Ulanovas won the tournament MVP. In the Euroleague, Žalgiris exceeded all expectations – many pre-season experts believed that Žalgiris will finish in last place, which motivated the team. Under leadership of coach Jasikevičius, Žalgiris finished in 10th place, just 2 games out of the playoffs, with wins over teams like PBC CSKA Moscow, the defending champion, playoff teams like Saski Baskonia, Anadolu Efes S.K. and Panathinaikos B.C., and beating and actually finishing ahead of FC Barcelona Bàsquet and Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C., with a 14–16 record. Players like Brock Motum, Léo Westermann, Edgaras Ulanovas and Lukas Lekavičius blossomed and shined, and team captain Paulius Jankūnas played one of his best seasons of his career, leading the team in scoring and rebounding. The LKL became a formality, as Žalgiris easily finished in 1st place with just a few losses, and easily crushed and swept long tome rival Lietuvos rytas. In the LKL playoffs, Žalgiris beat BC Dzūkija in the quaterfinals 3:0, beat BC Neptūnas 3:1 in the semi-finals, and faced BC Lietkabelis in the finals, as Lietkabelis beat Rytas in the semi-final. The only team to give Žalgiris some trouble in the regular season, Lietkabelis fought hard, but a win in Game 2 would be the only win of the series – Žalgiris won the series 4:1, their 7th consecutive LKL championship and finished a very good season. The 2016–2017 season is considered {{as one of the best}} in modern Žalgiris history.|$|E

40|$|This article {{sounds a}} cautionary note about the {{instrumental}} use of celebrity advocacy to (re) engage audiences in public life. It begins by setting out the steps {{necessary to achieve}} public recognition of a social problem requiring a response. It then presents empirical evidence which suggests that those most interested in celebrity, while also paying attention to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> the day, are also least likely to participate in any form of politics. However, this does {{not rule out the}} possibility of forging a link between celebrity and public engagement, raising questions about what would potentially sustain such an articulation. After discussing the broader cultural context of celebrity advocacy in which perceived authenticity functions valorised form of symbolic capital, the article outlines a phenomenological approach to understanding the uses audiences make of celebrity advocacy, using the example of a Ewan McGregor UNICEF appeal for illustration. It concludes that while media encounters with celebrities can underpin a viewer’s sense of self, this is as likely to lead to the rationalisation of inaction as a positive response to a charity appeal...|$|E
40|$|Joseph Dietzgen {{remains an}} anomaly within the Marxist canon for his {{adherence}} to a monism which very deliberately collapses the psychological, epistemological and ontological into a ‘social democratic’ materialism within which subjectivity is an immanent feature of the single substantive universe. Dietzgen’s distinctive adoption of a monism which owes much – largely unacknowledged – both to Spinoza and to Romanticism, offers {{the possibility of a}} counternarrative to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>stories</b> <b>of</b> official communism and democratic socialism. Such a narrative might be used to retrieve and reconstruct aspects of the Marxist tradition which more comfortably accommodate its conceptual apparatuses to the philosophical requirements of an age of ecological crisis. Why? Firstly, because of the inheritance partially shared by Dietzgen’s Marxism and by ecological Deep Green theory, from Spinoza through Schelling to the early Marx; Secondly, because Dietzgen’s ideas very loosely presaged something of the scientific revolution of the early twentieth century, and because some of those who were influenced by Dietzgen such as Bogdanov were quick to accept the new physics and to turn them to an ontological project which was more thoroughly holist, pedagogical and ecological in outlook than the emerging Leninist orthodoxy; Thirdly, because the expression of the heritage of Spinozism and Romanticism in the development of later twentieth century ecosophical thinking rather parallels {{the ways in which the}} anomalous Marxism of Dietzgen moved towards the pedagogical; his project was, from the outset one which intended to promote cosmological reorientation as a key feature of social democratic change; Fourthly, Dietzgen’ s philosophy of internal relations, though largely neglected within Marxism, found echoes in the process philosophy of Whitehead, which itself took a strongly ecological direction. It has been argued that if Dietzgen and his anomalous tendency within Marxism are to have any relevance to the current period, one must have regard for the way in which the sciences of physics, and of biology (in particular neurology) have developed, and re-read a less deterministic philosophy of science through Dietzgen accordingly. In this study, Dietzgen’s ideas have been stretched and reconstructed to bring to light more explicitly features of the thinking of both his forebears and his philosophical successors. The philosophy of Mathews and Naess enrich our understanding of how we might reshape ourselves in this period to affect a transformation towards human flourishing. Such a transformation is embodied in every child, as an emergent subjectivity. Both Dietzgen and Mathews have powerfully critiqued the egocentric, atomic self of bourgeois society. The extent to which an individual born to such a society fails to register their orientation towards their own activity, their class, their species and their land community is the measure of an adaptive pathology, the continuance of which take us further from viability as a species.
