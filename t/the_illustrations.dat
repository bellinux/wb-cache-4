5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914, Beebe's {{pheasant}} monograph {{was essentially}} complete in manuscript. While the text was written by Beebe, <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> were provided by several artists: Robert Bruce Horsfall, who had accompanied Beebe on the expedition, painted the environmental scenes for the illustrations' backgrounds, while the pheasants themselves were painted by other artists including George Edward Lodge, Charles R. Knight, and Louis Agassiz Fuertes. Due to the elaborate nature of the book's color artwork, no American publisher was considered capable of reproducing it. The publisher which Beebe chose for his work was George Witherby and Sons of London, {{as a result of}} their success publishing the artwork of John James Audubon. The reproduction of <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> themselves was to be handled by several companies in Germany and Austria. Reproductions of <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> were in the process of being printed when World War I began, holding up the completion of the project for the next four years.|$|E

5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in <b>the</b> <b>illustrations.</b> Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>illustration</b> depicts no one {{specific}} moment from the play. In Act 1, Titus decides to avenge {{the death of}} his own sons in battle by sacrificing Tamora's eldest son, Alarbus, prompting her to plead with him for her son's life, which is what she is pictured doing in <b>the</b> <b>illustration.</b> In <b>the</b> play, however, when Tamora is pleading with Titus for the release of Alarbus (who isn't present in <b>the</b> <b>illustration),</b> Aaron is still a prisoner. In <b>the</b> <b>illustration,</b> he is free and armed.|$|R

5|$|Book of the Dead papyri {{were often}} {{the work of}} several {{different}} scribes and artists whose work was literally pasted together. It is usually possible to identify the style {{of more than one}} scribe used on a given manuscript, even when the manuscript is a shorter one. The text and illustrations were produced by different scribes; {{there are a number of}} Books where the text was completed but <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> were left empty.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age Bauer had to adapt his {{illustrations}} to contemporary printing technique. Full-color was expensive, so <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> were made in one color plus black. As the process developed and his works became in greater demand, his pictures were eventually printed in full color.|$|E
5|$|Having {{relocated}} to north Wales by 1985, West met with Harrison regularly {{over a period}} of two years at the latter's Oxfordshire estate, Friar Park. The pair discussed the images required for all of Harrison's songs, in order to ensure empathy between <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> and the message behind the lyrics. West worked up pencil sketches, which he would submit to Harrison, before completing the final watercolour illustrations.|$|E
500|$|Often {{the artist}} drew <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> in reverse, and {{directly}} onto a block; {{in other cases}} the printer copied <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> from a drawing. After the 1860s, images could be photographically projected onto the blocks, although it was {{more difficult for the}} printer to carve the reliefs without leaving the distinctive lines of <b>the</b> <b>illustration.</b> Books printed by Evans have been reproduced using some of the original blocks which have [...] "remained in continuous use for over a century".|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> cover <b>illustration</b> is a {{depiction}} of the Earth System, highlighting the complexities of and cross-scale interactions between the different elements of the system. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> mirrors <b>the</b> programme structure of IGBP, which is built around the Earth System compartments of land, atmosphere and ocean, the interfaces between these compartments, and system-wide integration. At the centre of <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> is <b>the</b> Earth – reflecting the IGBP focus on the Earth System – with a superimposed grid indicating the importance of Earth System modelling. <b>The</b> <b>illustration</b> emphasises <b>the</b> importance of physical, chemical and biological processes from the molecular to the global scale. Evidence of human activities is apparent in each Earth System compartment, reflecting the growing focus of IGBP and research partners on the coupled human-environment system. <b>The</b> <b>illustration</b> was commissioned by IGBP to help communicate IGBP science and to strengthen visual integration across IGBP products...|$|R
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} plates {{were included in}} The Indian Antiquary and the Epigraphia Indica over the first fifty years of publication, but having <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> produced abroad was not without its disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London three times before they reached Bombay safely.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Genji was copied and {{illustrated}} {{in various forms}} as early as a century after Murasaki's death. The Genji Monogatari Emaki, is a late Heian era 12th-century handscroll, consisting of four scrolls, 19 paintings, and 20 sheets of calligraphy. <b>The</b> <b>illustrations,</b> definitively dated to between 1110 and 1120, have been tentatively attributed to Fujiwara no Takachika and the calligraphy to various well-known contemporary calligraphers. The scroll is housed at the Gotoh Museum and the Tokugawa Art Museum.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>illustrations</b> and {{ornamentation}} of the Book of Kells surpass that {{of other}} Insular Gospel books in extravagance and complexity. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, together with Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations.|$|E
40|$|We've built {{a system}} for {{creating}} pen-and-ink illustrations that uses three components: darkness, texture, and orientation. Previous systems have used the first two. To allow the user to specify the third one, orientation, we have built an interactive direction field editor in which the user effectively'paints'directions onto <b>the</b> <b>illustration.</b> <b>The</b> system then automatically creates <b>the</b> <b>illustration</b> at <b>the</b> requested output scale. ...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>illustrations</b> are, {{according}} to the Preface, made from Wallace's own sketches, photographs, or specimens. Wallace thanks Walter and Henry Woodbury for some photographs of scenery and native people. He acknowledges William Wilson Saunders and Mr Pascoe for horned flies and very rare longhorn beetles: all the rest were from his own enormous collection.|$|E
5|$|This, David's fourth book, {{reverted to}} some extent to {{the pattern of the}} first two, drawing {{extensively}} on her articles previously published in magazines. She had severed her ties with the publishers Macdonalds, who had acquired the publishing rights to her first three books when her original publisher was forced out of business. Her new publisher was the Museum Press of London. <b>The</b> <b>illustrations</b> were by Adrian Daintrey.|$|E
5|$|A {{panelled}} stone {{structure in}} the church, carved with processions of bearded and robed figures under arches, seems to reproduce details found in the Book of Cerne, a work associated with Bishop Æthelwold of Lichfield (818–830). The panels, which may originally have been the outer part of a sarcophagus built to hold {{the remains of a}} high status person such as Saint Hardulph, are dated by their similarity to <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> in the Book of Cerne to the first third of the ninth century. According to a medieval calendar of saints, the Benedictine monks at Breedon celebrated Hardulph's feast day on 21 August.|$|E

Walter, Liturgy and <b>the</b> <b>Illustration</b> of Gregory of Nazianzeri's Homilies. — The {{method of}} {{studying}} {{the transmission of}} manuscript illuminations, as presented by K.

5|$|A {{version of}} the tale was {{composed}} by Potter in 1903, but set aside to develop other projects. In 1904, she failed to complete a book of nursery rhymes for Warnes, and the 1903 tale was accepted in its stead. Potter elaborated its setting and storyline, and developed the tale more fully before publication. <b>The</b> <b>illustrations</b> depict the cottages and gardens of Sawrey, a village in the Lake District near Potter's Hill Top farm, and {{have been described as}} some of the most exquisite Potter ever produced. Ribby was modelled on a cat living in Sawrey, Duchess on two Pomeranians belonging to Potter's neighbour Mrs Rogerson, Tabitha Twitchit on Potter's cat at Hill Top, and Dr Maggoty on the magpies in the London Zoological Gardens.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} that some of <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states {{that many of the}} taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E
5|$|During a rainy {{holiday in}} Hastings {{at the end}} of November 1903, Potter {{outlined}} a tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called Something very very NICE. She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden to do justice to the detail of <b>the</b> <b>illustrations,</b> but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of iron ore deposits {{in the north of}} Sweden, Lappland became a frontier for industrial development, instead of an exotic wilderness of the Sami culture and midnight sun. Opportunistically, Carl Adam Victor Lundholm published his Lappland, det stora svenska framtidslandet (Lappland, the great Swedish land of the future). He engaged noted Swedish artists—such as Karl Tirén, Alfred Thörne, Per Daniel Holm and Hjalmar Lindberg—to create <b>the</b> <b>illustrations.</b> Since Bauer was an inexperienced illustrator by comparison, Lundholm tested his abilities by sending him to create some drawings of Sami people at Skansen.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the Swiss {{publisher}} Urs Graf Verlag Bern {{produced the}} first facsimile of the Book of Kells. The {{majority of the}} pages were reproduced in black-and-white photographs, but the edition also featured forty-eight colour reproductions, including all the full-page decorations. Under licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin, Thames and Hudson produced a second facsimile edition in 1974. This edition included all the full-page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative section of the ornamentation of the text pages, together with some enlarged details of <b>the</b> <b>illustrations.</b> The reproductions were all in full colour, with photography by John Kennedy, Green Studio, Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{became a}} popular subject of {{paintings}} and illustrations highlighting {{her as a}} virtuous woman and poet. She is often shown at her desk in Ishimyama Temple, staring at the moon for inspiration. Tosa Mitsuoki made her the subject of hanging scrolls in the 17th century. The Tale of Genji became a favorite subject of Japanese ukiyo-e artists for centuries with artists such as Hiroshige, Kiyonaga, and Utamaro illustrating various editions of the novel. While early Genji art was considered symbolic of court culture, {{by the middle of}} the Edo period the mass-produced ukiyo-e prints made <b>the</b> <b>illustrations</b> accessible for the samurai classes and commoners.|$|E
