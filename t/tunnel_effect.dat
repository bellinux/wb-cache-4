5|$|The Dove Street Festival of Lights – Begun 1990, the Dove Street Festival of Lights {{takes place}} each December. It began when a local {{family on the}} street adopted their {{daughter}} and wanted to dedicate an event to her. Local families on Dove street decorated the entire street with holiday lights, connecting the homes {{together to create a}} light <b>tunnel</b> <b>effect.</b> Previously, the Glee Club of the Miami University of Ohio serenaded residents with holiday songs. Town volunteers collect donations of money, food and toys at the festival that are given to The Deep Well Project, a local charity. In recent years the festival has moved from the original Dove Street to Shelter Cove Lane where the town can assist in the electrical costs.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the drums}} were {{recorded}} {{prior to the}} guitars, Bart had to write his guitar riffs {{so that they would}} compliment the drums and not vice versa. Bart elaborated, [...] "Following the September sessions I went back to work out the harmonies and write {{a whole new set of}} guitars trying to see them from a different point of view. The main challenge was to stay within the parameters of the drums - either that or we would have to re-record them again. So I had to be very creative to make the songs interesting without introducing new sections or tempo changes. This is why there are so many harmonies and counter melodies. It was challenging - often I would just jam to the recorded tracks for a long time trying to find a different vibe then that already recorded... this is best apparent on To the Bitter End or <b>Tunnel</b> <b>Effect.</b> If you listen to both guitars, they're doing widely different things yet compliment each other really well." ...|$|E

40|$|As {{a popular}} {{application}} of electrochemical anodic dissolution, electropolishing is extensively {{adopted in the}} surface finishing industries of metals. Anodic dissolution is a complex reaction with many process parameters and chemical properties involved. A simple explanation of the mechanism of morphology formation during the EP reaction is still lacking. This study examines the morphology formation of stainless steel 304 at the same location on the specimen as the process evolves. Based on these observations, the basic mechanisms of morphology formation in EP process are proposed. The bubble shielding effect (BSE) and the broken bubble <b>tunnelling</b> <b>effect</b> (BBTE) explain the raised and dented morphologies, respectively. The broken bubble <b>tunnelling</b> <b>effect</b> (BBTE) explains the formation mechanism of pitting holes and the bubble shielding effect (BSE) explains the limitation of surface roughness of electropolishing process.

In addition, to avoid meshing the thickness of the graphene sheets and in view of their very high aspect ratio, a highly conducting surface model is employed.
