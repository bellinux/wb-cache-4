Both GIMPs are glycoproteins that contain N- and O-linked carbohydrates. The N-linked carbohydrates were exclusively of the complex type.

2500|$|An image being edited in GIMP can {{consist of}} many layers in a stack. The user manual {{suggests}} that [...] "A good way <b>to</b> visualize a <b>GIMP</b> image is as {{a stack of}} transparencies," [...] where in GIMP terminology, each transparency is a layer. Each layer in an image {{is made up of}} several channels. In an RGB image, there are normally 3 or 4 channels, each consisting of a red, green and blue channel. Color sublayers look like slightly different gray images, but when put together they make a complete image. The fourth channel that may be part of a layer is the alpha channel (or layer mask). This channel measures opacity where a whole or part of an image can be completely visible, partially visible or invisible. Each layer has a layer mode that can be set to change the colors in the image.|$|R

40|$|The Material Point Method (MPM) is a {{computational}} method which allows solid mechanics {{problems to be}} modelled using material points which move through a fixed background grid. State variables are stored at these material points and tracked throughout the simulation. The MPM is ideal for modelling geomechanics problems that require the ability to capture large deformations and non-linear material behaviour. A well documented grid crossing error exists in the MPM which occurs when material points move between grid elements. The Generalised Interpolation Material Point (GIMP) method was proposed to alleviate this problem [2]. An implicit implementation of the GIMP method is used in this work. Conventional analysis techniques constructed in terms of stress and strain are able to handle large deformations well, however {{they are unable to}} deal with structural instabilities such as shear banding. Because there is no measure relating to the microstructure of the analysed material, the width of a shear band is highly mesh dependent. Gradient theories enrich these conventional theories with the addition of higher-order terms to include a length scale. Using gradient methods it is possible to model a shear band with a finite thickness without it being mesh dependent. Although there has been lots of work on gradient theories within the Finite Element Method (FEM) it is an area which has received less attention in the MPM. In this work an existing gradient elasto-plasticity theory [4], used with the FEM, is applied <b>to</b> the <b>GIMP</b> method. The MPM and GIMP method are first introduced and the key equations that are required to include gradient elasto-plasticity are detailed. The effect of introducing a length scale is then demonstrated in a numerical example...|$|R
40|$|Background: With the {{adoption}} of a completely electronic workflow by several journals and the advent of telepathology, digital imaging has {{become an integral part of}} every scientific research. However, manipulating digital images is very easy, and it can lead to misinterpretations. Aim: To analyse the impact of manipulating digital images on their diagnosis. Design: Digital images were obtained from Papanicolaou-stained smears of dysplastic and normal oral epithelium. They were manipulated using GNU Image Manipulation Program (<b>GIMP)</b> <b>to</b> alter their brightness and contrast and color levels. A Power Point presentation composed of slides of these manipulated images along with the unaltered originals arranged randomly was created. The presentation was shown to five observers individually who rated the images as normal, mild, moderate or severe dysplasia. Weighted k statistics was used to measure and assess the levels of agreement between observers. Results: Levels of agreement between manipulated images and original images varied greatly among observers. Variation in diagnosis was in the form of overdiagnosis or under-diagnosis, usually by one grade. Conclusion: Global manipulations of digital images of cytological slides can significantly affect their interpretation. Such manipulations should therefore be kept to a minimum, and avoided wherever possible...|$|R
