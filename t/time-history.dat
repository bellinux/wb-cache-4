30|$|Dynamic site {{response}} is usually implemented using an equivalent-linear approach through analyses based on <b>time-histories</b> or random vibration theory (RVT). In the RVT approach the input motion is characterized {{in the frequency}} domain by means of Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS) or power spectral densities so {{that the need for}} selecting/developing multiple suitable <b>time-histories</b> is avoided. Nevertheless, past studies have found that RVT may produce results that differ significantly from empirically determined site amplification functions and from the time history approach. This work is aimed to further understand the potential differences in the results from RVT and <b>time-histories</b> based approaches by performing a comprehensive numerical evaluation that takes into account the effect of the input intensity level, input spectral shape, site conditions, and the methodology used to produce the input FAS. The results obtained corroborate that RVT over-predictions occur mainly at the site fundamental frequencies and are larger for relatively soft soil deposits with significant impedance contrast at the soil/rock interface. However, in the soft site evaluated the magnitude of the over-prediction was rather insensitive to the increase in the inelastic demand, conversely, the over-prediction in the stiffer site increased as the site softened due to the rising inelastic demand.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDisplacement <b>time-histories</b> {{derived from}} accelerograms of three recent {{earthquakes}} in western North America (Hector Mine, Mw 7. 1; Denali, Mw 7. 9; and San Simeon, Mw 6. 5) {{have been shown}} to feature large long-period (∼ 10 s) ground-motion cycles. Such long-period displacements cause a localized peak within the displacement response spectrum that is currently not considered within any earthquake engineering design spectra. These displacement pulses have also been shown to be persistent and to feature on <b>time-histories</b> from widely separated stations (∼ 20 km). Broadband and accelerometric data from the Les Saintes earthquake sequence of 2004 – 2006 (4. 9 ⩽Mw⩽ 5. 3) recorded on Guadeloupe (French Antilles) are shown in this article to feature similar long-period motions. The broadband data are used to independently corroborate the displacement <b>time-histories</b> derived through high-pass filtering and double integration of accelerometric data. It is shown that high-quality broadband data are suitable for this purpose. The long-period motions observed cause a localized peak in displacement response spectra at periods between 5 and 10 s. It is suggested here that the cause of these large-amplitude long-period motions are specific source mechanisms, which may possibly involve the presence of fluids within the source. The form of the displacement response spectra from these <b>time-histories</b> is significantly different from the spectral shape specified in recent seismic design codes since the peak in the spectra is at a much greater period than expected. This leads to an underestimation of spectral displacements for periods between about 5 and 10 s. Therefore, if these observed long-period cycles are a common feature of earthquake ground motions the standard form of displacement design spectra may need to be reconsidered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{probabilistic}} {{dynamic analysis}} of a five-storey building subjected to a stochastic earthquake Ground-Motion (GM) is presented. The entire soil-structure system is considered in the analysis. The stochastic GM <b>time-histories</b> {{are based on a}} real recorded time history. The probabilistic dynamic analysis is performed using the classical Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) methodology. As is well known, this method requires a great number of calls of the deterministic model. To overcome the inconvenience of the time cost, a simple deterministic model based on the "macro-element " concept is used. The main advantage of the macro-element is that the time cost for a single deterministic calculation is relatively small and thus, this model is suitable for the probabilistic dynamic analysis. The simulation of the stochastic GM <b>time-histories</b> is done using a fully non-stationary stochastic model in both the time and the frequency domains. This model employs filtering of a discretized white-noise process. Non-stationarity is achieved by modulating the intensity and by varying the filter properties in time. As for the probabilistic analysis, a large number of samples (say 100, 000) of the stochastic GM <b>time-histories</b> is generated using Monte Carlo technique. For each sample, a dynamic calculation using the macro-element is performed and the following responses are retained for the probabilistic analysis: (i) the maximum horizontal displacement at the top of th...|$|R

40|$|<b>Time-history</b> {{analysis}} {{is the most}} reliable method {{for the assessment of}} the behaviour of bridges subjected to seismic loads. It has been widely used in recent years on the evaluation of the seismic vulnerability of bridges. The selection of seismic motions {{is one of the most}} important issues for the <b>time-history</b> analysis. This thesis discusses four different methods for obtaining spectrum-compatible acceleration time histories (i. e., accelerograms) of seismic motions. Based on these methods, four sets of accelerograms compatible with the design spectrum for Montreal were selected for this study. These included (i) scaled real accelerograms, (ii) modified real accelerograms, (iii) simulated accelerograms, and (iv) artificial accelerograms. The selected sets were used as excitation motions in the nonlinear analysis of two existing bridges in Montreal. The bridges included a three-span continuous concrete slab bridge and a three-span continuous slab-girder type bridge. These two bridges are considered to be representative of typical highway bridges in Quebec. A number of response parameters, such as, the deck displacement, bearing displacement, column curvature ductility, and base shear were used for the evaluation of the effects of the selected sets on the response of the bridges. Based on the results from the analysis, simulated accelerograms are recommended for use in the <b>time-history</b> analysis of the bridges. Furthermore, a study was conducted on the investigation of the minimum number of accelerograms required for both linear and nonlinear <b>time-history</b> analyses. Two different scaling methods, i. e., partial area under the spectrum and the spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the bridge, were used to obtain the bridge responses. It was found that 5 accelerograms are sufficient for the linear <b>time-history</b> analysis and 10 accelerograms are required for the nonlinear <b>time-history</b> analysis based on the results from the two bridges considered in this study...|$|E
30|$|<b>Time-histories</b> and RVT {{approaches}} are both grounded on the EQL method, {{the main difference}} is in the fashion the seismic input is defined. In the first method, the input consists of time histories while for the RVT based approach, the input is represented by a FAS or PSD. In both cases to comply with most design codes requirements the inputs need to be compatible with a design response spectrum. In the <b>time-histories</b> approach, the variability of ground motions may generate significant different responses and levels of nonlinearity [3], thus, a number of inputs to perform the analysis several times are required to obtain a steady average site response. Since the input is defined in the time domain, Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) are used to convert it to the frequency domain, where all the calculations are performed. The resulting time history at the ground surface is obtained applying the inverse FFT to the Fourier coefficients estimated after {{the application of the}} transfer functions.|$|R

In the paper a simple approach for selecting and scaling a set of real accelerograms was followed which took into consideration magnitude and distance search windows, record-to-record variability of spectral ordinates {{with respect to the}} target spectrum and the prevention of seismic event domination within a set.
