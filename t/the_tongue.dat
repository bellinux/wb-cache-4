5|$|Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve {{release of}} air {{flow through the}} nasal cavity, and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along both sides of <b>the</b> <b>tongue),</b> and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are {{characterized}} by how <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> is positioned relative to the air stream.|$|E
5|$|These {{muscles are}} {{involved}} in moving and manipulating <b>the</b> <b>tongue.</b> The left and right genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding <b>the</b> <b>tongue.</b> The muscles, attached to {{the underside of the}} top and back parts of <b>the</b> <b>tongue,</b> cause <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E
5|$|Down {{the middle}} of the sublingua is a thick {{strengthening}} rod called the plica mediana or lytta, which connects the sublingua to the underside of <b>the</b> <b>tongue,</b> and is part of the lingual septum (septum of <b>the</b> <b>tongue).</b> The thickness and size of the plica mediana can vary between species, and except in treeshrews, it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E

5|$|Palatography {{involves}} {{the painting of}} a colored substance onto <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> which is then transferred onto the palate during articulation. A picture is then taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in fieldwork, {{it can be difficult}} to collect large amounts of data.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of <b>the</b> <b>tongue,</b> {{except for the}} palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> muscles it supplies into <b>the</b> <b>tongue.</b> There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus {{near the bottom of}} the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E

5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{serrated}} {{and often}} keratinized {{tip of the}} sublingua is free to move small distances along the underside of <b>the</b> <b>tongue,</b> {{while the majority of}} its length adheres to the underside of <b>the</b> <b>tongue.</b> These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and attach {{to the base of the}} sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve (XII) exits the skull using the hypoglossal canal in the occipital bone and reaches <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> to control {{almost all of}} the muscles involved in movements of this organ.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E

5|$|The tip of <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> {{probably}} {{acts as a}} {{suction cup}} and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer <b>the</b> <b>tongue,</b> the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E

5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support.

The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches <b>the</b> <b>tongue</b> and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
