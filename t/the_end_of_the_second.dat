5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three Icelandic banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular short-term financing. As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> quarter of 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion Icelandic krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007. The assets of the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system {{in comparison with the}} Icelandic economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E
