40|$|In this paper, a {{detailed}} <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> mathematical formulation and a simplified one <b>dimensional</b> <b>model</b> for the numerical simulation {{of the flow}} and coupled heat and mass transport in a gas channel coated with adsorbing material are presented. In the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>model,</b> the velocity distribution of the gas flow is obtained by solving the momentum equation. The coupled heat and mass transport phenomena are locally described in both the gas channel and the adsorbent layer, and the concomitant adsorbate adsorption and desorption processes are taken into account. In the one <b>dimensional</b> <b>model,</b> the gas flow is assumed as a plug flow, and the heat and mass transfer across the solid-fluid interface is estimated by empirical transfer coefficients. A comparative study between the detailed <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>model</b> and a simplified one <b>dimensional</b> <b>model</b> is carried out. Both model predictions are compared with experimental data available from literature. The heat and adsorbate concentration gradients observed in both radial and circumferential directions indicate that the detailed <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>model</b> is desired. The time-dependent variations of temperature and heat flux distributions at the interface between the gas channel and the adsorbent layer justify {{the use of the}} more detailed <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>model.</b> <b>Three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>modelling</b> is essential to obtain accurate predictions for cases where the solid side transport resistances are dominating...|$|R

In his paper, The Data Model Concept in Statistical Mapping, he claims that by visualizing data in a three dimensional model cartographers could devise a “systematic and rational method for preparing choroplethic maps”. Jenks used the analogy of a “blanket of error” to describe the need to use elements other than the mean to generalize data. The <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>models</b> were created to help Jenks visualize the difference between data classes.

The project was financed by the National Geographic Society and Villas and Ars Longa, two private companies, and supported by National Institute of Anthropology and History, Mexico. It is one of 80 sites detected by the Southeast Campeche Archaeological Reconnaissance Project, which launched in 1996. Prior to this discovery by archaeologists, very little was known about this part of the region. Evidence of logging suggests locals were aware of the site. This is because of the difficulty in accessing the area due to difficult terrain and overgrown vegetation. To reach the area, the team of archaeologists spent four weeks reopening an abandoned and heavily overgrown dirt-road. Without the discovery with aerial photography, it is likely this site would have remained hidden for much longer. The project surveyed the three urban cores of the site to create maps and <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>models.</b>|$|E
