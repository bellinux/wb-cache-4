5|$|In 1622, several parishioners of Boxgrove, near Chichester in west Sussex, were {{prosecuted for}} playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday, 5 May. There were three {{reasons for the}} prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another {{reflected}} concern about church windows {{which may or may}} not have been broken; the third was <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt! The latter reason was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman to hit the ball twice and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous, as the incidents involving Jasper Vinall and Henry Brand were to drastically confirm.|$|E

500|$|The {{city was}} unable {{to raise money to}} build the museum, and the stones were damaged in five fires. The first came soon after the crates were set down in Golden Gate Park. Morgan said that [...] "piles of burning boxes were pulled over and down by the Fire Department, many hurled over a hundred and fifty feet." [...] Hearst died in 1951, and Morgan died in 1957; neither of them saw {{anything}} built with the stones. Two fires in 1959 appeared to be arson, and many of the fire-heated stones were weakened or cracked from sudden cooling by water. In 1960, Steilberg was hired to inspect the stones once again; he used a ball-peen hammer to lightly strike each stone and listen for a solid ringing tone, or a dull thud which indicated cracking. He found <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than half the stones were sound.|$|E

[...] However, the historian and philosopher of biology John S. Wilkins notes that Aristotle did not say [...] "all flies have four legs"; he wrote that one particular animal, the ephemeron or mayfly, [...] "moves with four feet and four wings: and, I may observe in passing, this creature is exceptional not only in regard to the duration of its existence, whence it receives its name, but also because though a quadruped it has wings also." [...] Mayflies do in fact walk on four legs, the front pair not being adapted for walking, so, Wilkins concludes, Aristotle was correct.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the novel, Balzac {{declares}} (in English): [...] "All is true". Although the characters and situations are fictions, the details employed– and their reflection of the realities of life in Paris at the time– faithfully render the world of the Maison Vauquer. The rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève (where the house is located) presents [...] "a grim look about the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls". The interiors of the house are painstakingly described, from the shabby sitting room ("Nothing can be more depressing") to the coverings on the walls depicting a feast ("papers <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> suburban tavern would have disdained")– an ironic decoration in a house known for its wretched food. Balzac owed the former detail to the expertise of his friend Hyacinthe de Latouche, who was trained in the practice of hanging wallpaper. The house is even defined by its repulsive smell, unique to the poor boardinghouse.|$|E

Shortly before the final nine episodes of the first season were to begin airing, co-creator Ryan Murphy, when asked at PaleyFest in March 2010 whether her fathers would be appearing, replied: [...] "Not this season. We've never met them; I think that's a great surprise. I think you want to hold <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit."

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 990 feet long, {{was released}} on February 28, 1911.

The acting of the Thanhouser tot is great, giving the picture the greater part of the interest it contains. The other players acquit themselves well." [...] The Moving Picture World largely agreed, but stated that the film only had one or two parts of the film were weak and the photography and acting were good. The Morning Telegraph found that the film would have been more logical should a scene with a police court to release the artist, for the police {{would not have been able}} to release them otherwise after the charges had been brought forth. The New York Dramatic Mirror review however states that this scene did occur with Marie acting outside the room and being consulted by an officer, whereupon the action take place off camera.
