Air-jet looms have been introduced {{to a lot of}} weaving mills widely and rapidly in spite of their uncertainness of weft running. Thus researchers concerned with <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> have paid a great interest in air-jet weft insertion technology. Developments of measuring devices, photographic technology, control devices, and personal computers brought active {{research work}} in the fields of the air jet weft insertion: especially spreads of personal computers have facilitated to solve almost all types of equations of motion.

40|$|Innovation of {{products}} {{is the key}} to survival. At this exhibition, we saw some trends of the innovation and development directions of <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> Important innovation criteria include energy saving, flexibility, quality, product diversification as well as higher productivity. Flexibility and versatility are the key demands of fabric manufacturers, which drive the development of fabric formation technologies. Among <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> exhibited at the show, flexible rapier machines dominated the sector (36 companies). Air jets came second (32 companies), followed by water jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> (8 companies), projectile <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> and others. <b>For</b> projectile <b>weaving</b> <b>machines,</b> there were only three companies. For shuttle looms, there were five. Most of companies focussed on shuttleless <b>weaving</b> <b>machines,</b> especially air jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> and rapier <b>weaving</b> <b>machine.</b> These two technologies are likely to dominate over others in the near future. ITMA Asia + CITME 2008 was also a window to see the technological gap between Chinese textile machine manufacturing sector and international manufacturers, although the product quality and diversification of China's textile machinery have made remarkable progress in the past two decades. For the Chinese textile machinery industry, global science and technology develops with each passing day, it is a long-term goal to transform textile industry with modern technologies {{to keep pace with the}} international trend of informatics technologies and keep on enhancing the continuous innovation capability.

40|$|In Textile industry, {{production}} is mostly key concern for Industry owner. This always has attracted researchers and machines manufacturers {{to make new}} developments in process and machines. Air-jet {{is one of the}} leading and successful highest productive <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> However, it is now well established that due to add of charges of compressed air, manufacturing cost of air-jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> is higher as compared with rapier and projectile <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> This is why countries having energy issues do not prefer air-jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> comparing projectile <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> In this regard, several researchers and machine manufacturers have continuously been working to improve the efficiency of air-jet weft insertion. However, industry practice is as important as design made by researchers. The aim of this research is to investigate the air consumption of air-jet weaving on industrial scale practice. In this study, five <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> of same manufacturer and model were selected. It was observed that despite of manufacturing same quality of fabric, air consumption was varying almost in all <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> Conventionally, mill workers adopt hit and trial practice in weaving industry including airpressure setting which leads to variation of nozzle pressure. Main reason of disparity of air consumption in air-jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> may be variation of distance from compressor to <b>weaving</b> <b>machines,</b> number of joints, un-necessary valve opening and pipes leakages cause an increase of compressed air consumption...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} {{innovative}} lightweight materials are rapidly {{increased in the}} recent years, owing to their cost-effective, high-strength, environmentally-sound use of materials and process technologies, {{in addition to that}} they reduce the weight of a product. The characteristics of 3 D-spacer fabrics {{as one of the most}} important lightweight materials in future are multifaceted not only owing to its extremely light materials, but also because of exceptionally high stiffness to weight ratio compared to other constructions. It is also one possible method for improving the properties of fabric-reinforced composites. It can enhance the through-the-thickness properties, such as shear strength, dimensional stability, damage, tolerance, and fracture toughness that are critical for many structural applications. Spacer fabric has been employed in high-technology applications because of its critical mechanical properties related to high tensile strength, tear strength and stiffness. Furthermore, its multidirectional structures allow with more reinforcement along the thickness direction leading to an increase in stiffness and strength properties. The fundamental aim of this thesis exists in the development of a new kind of <b>woven</b> spacer fabrics <b>for</b> the light weight composites materials, in an effort to weave spacer fabrics that can not be realized with the old technology which are mentioned above. Therefore, the work in brief focuses on two main goals: 1. Development of a new kind of spacer fabrics for composites in the lightweight constructions. 2. Development of special devices of a narrow <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> standing the process of the new kind of spacer fabrics production. The slippage strength test had to be carried out for the floated warp yarns through the ground fabrics by using different elements of woven fabric structures variables represented in different fabric constructions, different weft densities and different repeats of constructions by using different materials. The importance of this test related to the backward-movement of the floated warp yarns which is the crucial stage in the weaving process of spacer fabrics during the backward-movement. The results of this test determine the required forces for the backward-movement, on the other side it is the best method to observe the behavior of structure elements during the backward movement. The results of the slippage strength had been statistically analyzed, and the <b>weaving</b> process <b>for</b> the spacer fabrics had been achieved. It was concluded that the best properties <b>for</b> the <b>woven</b> spacer fabrics and the optimum case <b>for</b> the <b>weaving</b> process on the test <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> had been achieved when the following items are realized: Development of the narrow <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> is closed in assisting operations, let-off and take-up and enhancement for take-up processes. Extra let-off and take-up devices must be constructed at the <b>weaving</b> <b>machine.</b> Extra let-off device has to be used for controlling the floated warp yarns of ground fabrics. On the other side, extra take-up and the developed take-up devices have to be used <b>for</b> controlling the <b>woven</b> spacer fabrics. The experimental results give fundamental knowledges for the next steps in research and development of woven spacer fabrics made of high-performance yarns on the wide <b>weaving</b> <b>machine.</b> Die Ziele der Arbeit bestanden in der Entwicklung der Geometrie der Spacer Fabrics und der notwendigen Falteneinrichtung an der Bandwebmaschine. Spacer Fabrics werden ausschließlich aus zwei Deckflächen, die durch eingewebte Stege verbunden sind, gefertigt. Zur Entwicklung der Spacer Fabrics muss eine Doppelnadel-Bandwebmaschine mit zwei Webfächern eingesetzt werden. Für die Faltenwebeinrichtung werden der entwickelte Extra-Kettablass und der Extra-Abzug benötigt. Der Antrieb und die Steuerung des Extra-Abzuges erfolgen durch einen Synchronantrieb und der Antrieb und die Steuerung des Extra-Ablasses durch Pneumatik.
