50|$|A ChipTAN {{generator}} is {{not tied}} to a particular account; instead, the user must insert their bank card during use. The TAN generated is specific to the bank card {{as well as to}} the current <b>transaction</b> <b>details.</b> There are two variants: In the older variant, the <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> (at least amount and account number) must be entered manually. In the modern variant, the user enters the transaction online, then the TAN generator reads the <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> via a flickering barcode on the computer screen (using photodetectors). It then shows the <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> on its own screen to the user for confirmation before generating the TAN.|$|E

50|$|Once {{costs are}} {{appended}} to accounting or billing tables, the <b>detailed</b> <b>transactions</b> from an ECRS may be “rolled up” to higher-level totals for movement to invoices, statements and bills. However, the <b>detailed</b> <b>transactions</b> can remain in interim ECRS tables or files for subsequent reporting. Retaining the <b>detail</b> <b>transactions</b> minimizes {{the number of}} transactions {{that need to be}} loaded into the accounting system, but still allows access to the detail for auditing purposes, or for justifying certain types of expenses to clients, customers or bill recipients.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{contribute}} a visual exploration system for analyzing {{the behavior of}} individual entities exchanging Bitcoins. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, popular for allowing pseudonymous financial transactions. The Bitcoin blockchain is the public ledger of the Bitcoin system holding data on millions of individual transactions between pseudonymous addresses. These addresses belong to individual entities such as people, services, or enterprises. Understanding how the Bitcoin system is used, however, is difficult because it is unclear which addresses {{belong to the same}} entities. Our tool addresses thisproblem by clustering addresses and displaying <b>transaction</b> <b>detail</b> for individual entitie...|$|R

50|$|During {{the mid to}} late 1980s, {{fuel cards}} began to use {{magnetic}} strip technology. This meant fuel cards could be processed by a retailer electronically and reduced the risk of human error when recording <b>transaction</b> <b>details.</b>|$|E
50|$|Transaction {{verification}} is {{the generic}} term {{to describe the}} Internet-based security method of verifying that the actual content of a transaction has not been altered by the fraudulent techniques known as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) and Man-in-the-Browser (MitB). This form of transaction protection is alternatively known as Transaction Intent Verification (TIV). Transaction Verification must utilise either Out-of-band technology (the use of two separate channels) or an independent signing device, e.g. a programmable card-reader, capable of having transactional information re-keyed into {{it in order to}} create a code cryptographically linked to the underlying <b>transaction</b> <b>detail.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a new cache organization in a Chip Multiprocessors (CMP) environment. We introduce Nahalal, an architecture whose novel floorplan topology partitions cached data {{according to its}} usage (shared versus private data), and thus enables fast access to shared data for all processors while preserving the vicinity of private data to each processor. The Nahalal architecture combines {{the best of both}} shared caches and private caches, enabling fast accesses to data as in private caches while eliminating the need for inter-cache coherence <b>transactions.</b> <b>Detailed</b> simulations in Simics demonstrate that Nahalal decreases cache access latency by up to 41. 1 % compared to traditional CMP designs, yielding performance gains of up to 12. 65 % in run time...|$|R
50|$|Dark pools are {{recorded}} {{to the national}} consolidated tape. However, they {{are recorded}} as over-the-counter <b>transactions.</b> Therefore, <b>detailed</b> information about the volumes and types of transactions is left to the crossing network to report to clients if they desire and are contractually obligated.|$|R
50|$|Any online {{transaction}} (Fund transfer, Add payee, Online broking,End of day confirmation)can be acknowledged by digitally signing the <b>transaction</b> <b>details.</b> This ensures confidentiality,integrity {{and more importantly}} non repudiation. Acknowledgment of the transaction thus made cannot be repudiated later.|$|E
5000|$|Sign: This mode is an {{extension}} of the previous, where not only a random [...] "challenge" [...] value, but also crucial <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> such as the transferred value, the currency, and recipient's account number have to be typed into the CAP reader.|$|E
50|$|One {{effective}} way to perform Transaction Verification in a mass usage environment is to replay the <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> to the user by placing a real-time, automated call to the user before the transaction is committed, or to send these details in SMS with a confirmation code.|$|E

5000|$|... pushTAN is an app-based TAN scheme by German Sparkassen {{banking group}} {{reducing}} {{some of the}} shortcomings of the mTAN scheme. It eliminates the cost of SMS messages and is not susceptible to SIM card fraud, since the messages are sent via a special text-messaging application to the user's smartphone using an encrypted Internet connection. Just like mTAN, the scheme allows the user to cross-check the <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> against hidden manipulations carried out by Trojans on the user's PC by including the actual <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> the bank received in the pushTAN message. Although analogous to using mTAN with a smartphone, there is {{the risk of a}} parallel malware infection of PC and smartphone. To reduce this risk the pushTAN app ceases to function if the mobile device is rooted or jailbroken. In late 2014 the Deutsche Kreditbank (DKB) also adopted the pushTAN scheme.|$|E
5000|$|In e-commerce, {{businesses}} exchange millions [...] {{of electronic}} documents to track delivery information using computer to computer communication techniques like email, FTP and EDI. These documents contain {{a variety of}} <b>transaction</b> <b>details,</b> including information regarding purchase orders, invoices, shipping details, product specifications, and price quotes. Electronic documents can exchange new data as well as corrections to previously transmitted messages.|$|E
50|$|In North America, {{commissions}} on {{real estate}} transactions are negotiable and new services in real estate trends have created ways to negotiate rates.

It may also be done by a new CEO hired specifically to make the difficult and controversial decisions required to save or reposition the company. It generally involves financing debt, selling portions of the company to investors, and reorganizing or reducing operations.|$|E
50|$|However, iTANs {{are still}} {{susceptible}} to man-in-the-middle attacks, including phishing attacks where the attacker tricks the user into logging into a forged {{copy of the}} bank's website and man-in-the-browser attacks which allow the attacker to secretly swap the <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> {{in the background of}} the PC as well as to conceal the actual transactions carried out by the attacker in the online account overview.|$|E

The products act as gateways that connect the radio access network to the IP network. The gateways allow the service provider to have fine control over the end user experience of the high bandwidth/low latency applications, <b>transaction</b> accounting <b>details</b> and access control.|$|R
5000|$|InternetCash {{faced the}} choice of {{piggybacking}} on existing payment networks, {{such as those of}} Visa and MasterCard, or to build its own payment network. It chose the latter in order to offer better security, especially on the Internet payment side. Therefore, InternetCash required merchants to redirect the customer to a new web page, which was operated by InternetCash and was called the [...] "InternetCash payment window", where they would type in their card number and PIN. Part of the card number together with the <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> and timestamp was then digitally signed by that window (using InternetCash's hardware encryption devices) and then sent back to the merchant for storage and reference. The digital signature and the <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> were then sent to InternetCash's payment server, where the transaction was completed. This two-stage approach allowed full flexibility on the deployment of the [...] "InternetCash Payment Window", which was effectively providing the payment security to the system, so it could be run on separate servers than the actual [...] "banking" [...] system, which maintained the card balances and performed the transactions.|$|E
50|$|However, as {{more and}} more animals were sold under formula pricing, other contract, or captive supply arrangements, the open cash markets became less helpful as benchmarks. On the {{argument}} that such arrangements also enabled packers to more easily conceal potential anti-competitive practices, Congress passed the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-78, Title IX). This law requires large packers and importers to report prices and other <b>transaction</b> <b>details</b> to the Agricultural Marketing Service.|$|E
