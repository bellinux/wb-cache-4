They learn about what kinds of things affect the leader and the group, and what style of leadership is appropriate. They learn to select a style of leadership based on the job and the group situation.|$|E
5|$|The Achaeans were {{demoralized}} by this battle; Aratus {{declined the}} generalship, and when both Athens and the Aetolian League turned down their appeals, they sued Cleomenes for peace. Initially, Cleomenes advanced only minor requests, {{but as the}} talks continued, his demands became greater and he eventually insisted <b>that</b> <b>leadership</b> of the League be surrendered to him. In exchange, {{he would return to}} the Achaeans the prisoners and strongholds he had seized. The Achaeans invited Cleomenes to Lerna, where they were holding council. While marching there, Cleomenes drank too much water, which caused him to lose his voice and cough up blood—a situation that forced him to return to Sparta.|$|E

5000|$|One view is <b>that</b> sharing <b>leadership</b> {{among more}} people does not {{necessarily}} bring positive student outcomes. Some researchers have called the influence of shared leadership into question, suggesting that the influence of shared leadership is statistically non-significant (Leithwood & Jantzi, 1999), and indicating <b>that</b> shared <b>leadership</b> is [...] "not a significant factor for students' participation in or engagement with school" [...] (Silins et al., 2002). Timperley (2005, p. 417) also underlines the significance of promoting the quality of shared <b>leadership</b> activities, emphasizing <b>that</b> shared <b>leadership</b> has risks associated with [...] "greater distribution of incompetence." ...|$|R
50|$|Conversely, it {{has been}} argued <b>that</b> shared <b>leadership</b> is {{positively}} related to students' achievement. In addition, shared leadership enables teachers to employ certain methodologies or instructional content. Leithwood and Mascall(2008) conclude <b>that</b> shared <b>leadership</b> eventually influences students' math achievement indirectly by effecting teacher motivation. Similarly, a study by Heck and Hallinger(2009) shows that the development of school shared leadership has an indirect impact on students' academic growth in math, mutually reinforcing academic capacity of teachers and students over time. Researchers and writers, such as Camburn and Han(2009), have also remarked <b>that</b> widespread <b>leadership</b> promotes teachers exposure to plentiful instructional resources and the likelihood that they will employ these instruction practices. Camburn and Han's study (2009), however, does not present empirical evidence <b>that</b> shared <b>leadership</b> is associated with students' outcomes.|$|R
25|$|As an {{authority}}, priesthood is {{the authority}} {{by which a}} bearer may perform ecclesiastical acts of service {{in the name of}} God. Latter Day Saints believe that acts (and in particular, ordinances) performed by one with priesthood authority are recognized by God and are binding in heaven, on earth, and in the afterlife. In addition, Latter Day Saints believe <b>that</b> <b>leadership</b> positions within the church are legitimized by the priesthood authority.|$|E
25|$|In November 1818, {{just before}} the General Council meeting with the U.S. Indian agent Joseph McMinn {{assigned}} {{to deal with the}} Cherokee, Ross became president of the National Committee, a position he would hold through 1827. The Council selected Ross for <b>that</b> <b>leadership</b> position because they believed he had the diplomatic skills necessary to rebuff American requests to cede Cherokee lands. He soon refused McMinn's offer of $200,000 US, conditioned upon the Cherokee voluntarily removing themselves beyond the Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|According to a Gallup Poll taken February 911 2007, {{responders}} {{who supported}} Giuliani were {{asked why they}} supported him.

Another poll taken by Marist showed that 42% of Giuliani supporters believed <b>that</b> <b>leadership</b> {{is the most important}} quality for a candidate, compared to 34% of McCain supporters who believed the same.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we aim {{to explore}} the link between {{transformational}} leadership and job crafting. We predict <b>that</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> will stimulate employee job crafting (seeking resources, seeking challenges, and reducing demands) by increasing their adaptability; but <b>that</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> will be less effective when employees {{have higher levels of}} organizational identification. We collected data from 185 dyads of subordinates and supervisors. Supervisors rated their own transformational leadership and subordinates' adaptability, and subordinates rated their own job crafting and organizational identification. Results from structural equation modelling analyses partially supported our hypotheses. In general our findings suggest <b>that</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> is associated with more expansion job crafting (seeking resources and seeking challenges) via adaptability, particularly for employees with lower organizational identification. We conclude <b>that</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> is an important antecedent of employee adaptability and proactivity at work...|$|R

25|$|In August 2012 in an International Herald Tribune op-ed, Harvard University {{professor}} and director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation Hal S. Scott called for a global response to the Euro-zone crisis. He wrote that two failures to address European problems around German power had led to world wars in the 20th century and that the current crisis was also beyond the capacity of Europe, with Germany again at the center, to solve on their own. Accepting <b>that</b> <b>leadership</b> transitions were underway in both China and America, Scott called on all concerned—with Japan included with China and America—to begin organizing a global restructuring through the International Monetary Fund with possibly a Bretton Woods II conference as part of the process.|$|E

He took over a company that had stagnated since its merger three years earlier, and that The Economist deemed [...] "mediocre". As head of Diageo he transformed the consumer goods company into a streamlined premium drinks business. Walsh said:"While Diageo had positions in drinks, <b>that</b> <b>leadership</b> was marginal – capital was not limitless. My view, supported by colleagues on the board, was that we should focus on where we can be a global leader.
