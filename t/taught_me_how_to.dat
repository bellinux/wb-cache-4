500|$|Willis {{was born}} in Sunderland, County Durham, {{and grew up in}} the Surrey village of Stoke d'Abernon near Cobham, having moved there at the age of six. His father was an {{employee}} of the BBC, and Willis had an elder brother named David with whom he played cricket in the garden, and an elder sister. In 1965, Willis added his third name [...] "Dylan" [...] by deed poll in honour of American musician Bob Dylan, of whom he is a fan. Willis was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, playing [...] his early cricket for Stoke d'Abernon Cricket Club, where he later became Vice President and Life Member, and two seasons for the Cobham Avorians. He was also an avid schoolboy footballer, but was not a natural athlete and loathed rugby, which was the school's dominant sport. Willis recalled in 2009 that during his school years [...] "in the winter when the muscled brethren were playing, I used to play football with the school old boys. This <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> drink cider and vomit it up on Surbiton station, and other life-altering lessons."

500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody who can give you faith {{and the belief that}} you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency".

5000|$|Chadwick {{was born}} in the suburb of Barnes, in western London, and {{attended}} Merchant Taylors' School in Northwood. While there he expressed an interest in being an artist, though his art master suggested architecture was a more realistic option. Accordingly, Chadwick became a trainee draughtsman, working first at the offices of architects Donald Hamilton and then Eugen Carl Kauffman, and finally for Rodney Thomas. Chadwick took great inspiration from Thomas, whose interest in contemporary European architecture and design had a significant effect on his development. His training in architectural drawing was the only formal education he received as an artist.

The {{magazine}} listed its box art, which depicts a ninja with a burning city in the background, {{as one of its}} favorite designs in the NES library. The magazine's Editor in Chief Chris Slate was equally impressed by the game's box art. He also reminisced the game's high level of difficulty with its re-spawning enemies and enemy birds that knocked players into pits, saying this game [...] "may have <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> curse". He further praised gameplay features such as clinging on walls and using ninpo techniques, and he noted the game's cinematic cutscenes, including the ominous opening sequence that featured two ninjas who launch into the air at each other and clashing their swords in the moonlight. He said that [...] "Ninja Gaiden was about as cool as an 8-bit game could be, especially for ninja-crazed kids of the '80s who, like me, had worn out their VHS copies of Enter the Ninja". In a July2011 issue, Retro Gamer listed the game's opening {{as one of the most}} popular ones at the time. The magazine noted how its usage of cutscenes, animations, and overall presentation put the game above most other action titles at the time. While it lauded the controls and gameplay elements, as with other reviews, it criticized the difficulty, calling it [...] "one of the most challenging games on the console". It noted how defeated enemies re-spawn in certain spots, how enemies are placed on the edges of platforms, and the structure of the final level.|$|E

40|$|Mars is a {{hard place}} to land on, but my {{internship}} with NASA's Aerosciences & Flight Mechanics branch has shown me {{the ways in which}} men and women will one day land safely. I work on Mars Aerocapture, an aeroassist maneuver that reduces the fuel necessary to "capture" into Martian orbit before a descent. The spacecraft flies through the Martian atmosphere to lose energy through heating before it exits back into space, this time at a slower velocity and in orbit around Mars. Spacecraft will need to maneuver through the Martian atmosphere to accurately hit their orbit, and they will need to survive the generated heat. Engineering teams need simulation data to continue their designs, and the guidance algorithm that ensures a proper orbit insertion needs to be refined - two jobs that fell to me at the summer's start. Engineers within my branch have developed two concept aerocapture vehicles, and I run simulations on their behavior during the maneuver. I also test and refine the guidance algorithm. I spent the first few weeks familiarizing myself with the simulation software, troubleshooting various guidance bugs and writing code. Everything runs smoothly now, and I recently sent my first set of trajectory data to a Thermal Protection System group so they can incorporate it into their heat-bearing material designs. I hope to generate plenty of data {{in the next few weeks}} for various engineering groups before my internship ends mid-August. My major accomplishment so far is improving the guidance algorithm. It is a relatively new algorithm that promises higher accuracy and fuel efficiency, but it hasn't undergone extensive testing yet. I've had the opportunity to work with the principal developer - a professor at Iowa State University - to find and fix several issues. I was also assigned the task of expanding the branch's aerodynamic heating simulation software. I am excited to do this because engineers in the future will use my work to generate meaningful data and make design decisions. My internship has <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> teach myself. There are no tutors, study sessions or professor office hours. When I am given an assignment I am expected <b>to</b> figure out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> accomplish it, and I have grown in my problem solving abilities. My summer experience has reinforced my drive to work at NASA, and I can definitely see myself working full time on the aerocapture project, or something similar...|$|R

5000|$|In 1930 Noël Coward cast Olivier as Victor Prynne in his {{new play}} Private Lives, which opened at the new Phoenix Theatre in London in September. Coward and Gertrude Lawrence played the lead roles, Elyot Chase and Amanda Prynne. Victor is a {{secondary}} character, along with Sybil Chase; the author called them [...] "extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down and stood up again". To make them credible spouses for Amanda and Elyot, Coward was determined that two outstandingly attractive performers should play the parts. Olivier played Victor in the West End and then on Broadway; Adrianne Allen was Sybil in London, but could not go to New York, where the part was taken by Esmond. In addition to giving the 23-year-old Olivier his first successful West End role, Coward became something of a mentor. In the late 1960s Olivier told Sheridan Morley: He gave {{me a sense of}} balance, of right and wrong. He would make me read; I never used to read anything at all. I remember he said, [...] "Right, my boy, Wuthering Heights, Of Human Bondage and The Old Wives' Tale by Arnold Bennett. That'll do, those are three of the best. Read them". I did. ...
