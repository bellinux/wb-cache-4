40|$|The {{mainshaft}} {{support bearings}} of long life turbopumps {{for use on}} the space shuttle were evaluated to determine possible causes of failure. Specific aspects examined include the sensitivity of 15 degree versus 25 degree contact angle bearings with regard to heat damage and thermal runaway, the L/D aspects of the turbine end bearing pair with regard <b>to</b> <b>hang-up</b> due to cocking, the hang-up required to support a 44. 5 KN axial load without cartridge slipping, the outer race growth {{as a result of}} a 44. 5 KN axial load, and bearing torque as a function of axial load. Results indicate that hang-up of the cartridge due to bearing heating is a serious problem especially if poor lubrication of the bearing occurs and that race growth due to axial load can contribute to cartridge lock-up. The experimental evaluation of bearing performance under axial loads indicates that the bearing torque is a strong function of surface lubrication...|$|E

40|$|The Analog Devices ADV 212 was {{initially}} tested for single event effects (SEE) at the Texas AM University Cyclotron Facility (TAMU) in July of 2013. Testing revealed a sensitivity <b>to</b> device <b>hang-ups</b> classified as single event functional interrupts (SEFI), soft data errors classified as single event upsets (SEU), and, of particular concern, single event latch-ups (SEL). All error types occurred so frequently {{as to make}} accurate measurements of the exposure time, and thus total particle fluence, challenging. To mitigate some of the risk posed by single event latch-ups, circuitry {{was added to the}} electrical design to detect a high current event and automatically recycle power and reboot the device. An additional heavy-ion test was scheduled to validate the operation of the recovery circuitry and the continuing functionality of the ADV 212 after a substantial number of latch-up events. As a secondary goal, more precise data would be gathered by an improved test method, described in this test report...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{research to}} improve safety during transport of ore and waste in underground mines. Field tests are underway in mines in Idaho and Montana. Strains measured on structural support members in an ore pass provided information about total forces {{acting on the}} structure as material was dumped into it. Results show that measured static loads were considerably less than actual total weight of the material dumped and that dynamic loads were subject to many factors, such as effects of blasting <b>to</b> remove <b>hang-ups.</b> Comparisons of measurements and computer results using a particle flow code indicated that several difficulties remain before achieving realistic determinations and models of the dynamic effects of particle flow in ort: passes and impact loads on the gates. Impact loads were overestimated in computer analyses as compared to loads measured in field tests.

40|$|To {{older workers}} the {{problems}} of the cervical rib seemed simple and straightforward. The patient complained of pain and weakness in the hand; radiographs disclosed a cervical rib, and symptoms were attributed <b>to</b> a <b>hang-up</b> of the plexus on the abnormal rib. Pressure became excessive, chiefly at the age of thirty to forty years, as the result of drooping of the shoulder girdle and it might be made worse by a post-fixed plexus. This no doubt is still true of most cases to-day, but increasing experience has shown that the subject is by no means so cut and dried as had been thought. A number of patients whose symptoms were typical showed no cervical rib on radiographic examination; radiologists reported frequent examples of cervical rib without ill consequences; and moreover it became clear that some patients were suffering from extensive thrombosis in the arteries of the hand and arm. The subject appealed to many observers and an extensive literature accumulated, much of it consisting of armchair theory supported only by isolated cases. In this article, which is based upon a fairly extensive operative and anatomical experience, an attempt is made to sort facts from fallacy in an admittedly difficult and controversial subject. In any review it is clear that an appeal to findings at operation is of first importance...|$|R

40|$|Sublevel caving (SLC) is {{a highly}} {{productive}} mining method with the major disadvantages of irrepressible ore loss and dilution. The confined blasting situation of SLC rings is commonly regarded {{to have a significant}} impact upon the material flow characteristics and hence on the overall performance. The initial conditions for the ore flow after blasting are unknown, as both the blasted geometry and the fragmentation itself are normally hidden. However, when opening a new drawpoint and in hang-up situations an inspection of the actual conditions is feasible. For this purpose, a remotely operated 3 D photogrammetry system was custom built and used to reconstruct the ring front and/or cavity as a geo-referenced mesh model with colour information. Various blasting situations have been observed and this allowed a deeper study of the i) broken geometry and height, ii) over- and underbreak and their effects on subsequently blasted rings, iii) interaction effects between adjacent holes/rings, iv) drilling accuracy based on identified boreholes and v) mapping of geological structures and their influence on the blast result. The capabilities of the 3 D image acquisition system to evaluate the blasting results are demonstrated with an example, in which a series of blasts were surveyed. Monitoring under hang-up situations, has then revealed the actual effects from confined blasting and gravity flow related issues. The 3 D photogrammetry system is now increasingly being used <b>to</b> study <b>hang-ups.</b> By revealing and quantifying hitherto inaccessible information, the system {{has proven to be a}} valuable tool in increasing the understanding of both SLC breakage and flow.

40|$|The Space Shuttle is {{connected}} to the mobile launch platform (MLP) by four aft skirt hold down studs on each solid rocket booster (SRB). Prior to lift-off, the frangible nuts inside the aft skirt blast containers are severed into two nut halves by two pyrotechnic booster cartridges. This action releases the Space Shuttle and allows the hold down studs to eject through the aft skirt bore and then down into the MLP. USBI has been tasked to upgrade the blast container for two specific reasons: (1) To eliminate lead for environmental concerns, and (2) To reduce the chance of nut recontact with the holddown stud. Nut recontact with the stud has been identified as a likely contributor <b>to</b> stud <b>hang-ups.</b> This upgrade will replace the lead liner with a unique open cell aluminum foam material, that has commercial and military uses. The aluminum foam used as an energy absorber is a proven design in many other aerospace/defense applications. Additional benefits of using the open cell, energy absorbent aluminum foam in place of the solid lead liner are: (1) Lead handling / exposure and possible contamination, along with hazardous waste disposal, will be eliminated; (2) Approximately 200 lbs. weight savings will be contributed to each Space Shuttle flight by using aluminum foam instead of lead; (3) The new aluminum liner is designed to catch all shrapnel from frangible nuts, thus virtually eliminating chance of debris exiting the HDP and causing potential damage to the vehicle; (4) Using the lighter aluminum liner instead of lead, allows for easier assembly and disassembly of blast container elements, which also improves safety, operator handling, and the efficiency of operations...|$|R
30|$|It is an {{interesting}} feature of loans generally in language contact situations {{around the world that}} they frequently undergo some modification to the meaning and/or pronunciation during the borrowing process, and Modern Standard Chinese is no exception to this (cf. Ding et al. 2017). Since loans are often (but by no means always) adopted from L 2 to fill a perceived “gap” in the lexical resources of L 1, the semantic designation of the borrowed expression may shift slightly to fit around or between existing semantic designations in L 1. A relatively well-known example of this is the loan word angst, which in its donor language German is used in a very general sense to refer to fear of any kind but which is used in English in a much narrower sense to refer to psychological fears or <b>hang-ups.</b> <b>To</b> take an example in the opposite direction, the English word job has been borrowed into German to refer primarily to paid work of a temporary or casual nature, while the autochthonous German word Arbeit is used more generally for any kind of work.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{detecting}} a given set {{of words in}} fluent speech {{is one of the}} most interesting topics in speech recognition for practical real time applications. This paper present the TELEMACO system for automatic voice dialling which is based on the use of the keyword spotting technology to detect the dialling commands in fluent speech used by the IBERCOM Spanish telephone system. The user interface is based on a PC computer with a DSP board. The DSP board runs the speech recognition task and the interaction with the telephone line. The keyword vocabulary is composed by commands <b>to</b> dial, answer, <b>hang-up,</b> cancel, recall, store, etc. Each keyword is modeled by means of a discrete Hidden Markov Model. To model the non-keyword speech, syllabic fillers models and background models are used. The keyword spotting algorithm is a null grammar time-synchronous Viterbi search with two search spaces. The first search is over all the models (keywords and fillers) and the second search is only over the filler model. Thus, we can compare the behaviour of the filler model with the candidate keyword for each detection and decide if the keyword has been uttered or not. This process is done frame by frame. When a keyword is detected, the DSP board send the recognition word to the PC to take the corresponding action. The system has been implemented in a Windows environment.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) {{has been used}} to detect changes in dopamine's {{presence}} in the brain's extracellular space. The dopamine signals detected result from several simultaneous biophysical processes. Because these processes currently cannot be directly measured, a mathematical model which quantitatively explains FSCV data is necessary to describe their natures and magnitudes. I have created a simple mathematical model which posits that diffusion of dopamine in the brain follows a unidirectional first order kinetic scheme from its source. The model, using just three parameters, produces excellent fits to dopamine responses evoked by short electrical stimuli. These parameters are: Rp (release), kU (fuptake) and kT (mass transport). When longer stimulations are performed, the addition of a term kR, which modifies Rp by an exponential, is adequate to fit nearly all observed dopamine responses in the anaesthesized rat brain. To complement this work, I have determined that the ubiquitous failure of dopamine concentration changes as measured by FSCV to return <b>to</b> baseline, called <b>hang-up,</b> is an artifact caused by a form of long duration adsorption to the carbon fiber electrodes commonly used to measure dopamine. I have developed a mathematical correction for this artifact. In addition, I have experimentally determined that the observed first order behavior of the mass transport parameter kT arises essentially entirely from the brain itself, rather than the adsorption kinetics of dopamine at the electrode. Finally, having established a sound theoretical framework for understanding the biological and instrumental origins of dopamine signals in the brain, I have used this model to study both anatomical differences in dopamine signaling, as well as the biophysical effects of the drug buproprion, an antidepressant. These studies have found that the density of dopamine signaling is greatest in the dorsolateral striatum, and that this high density of signaling is enabled by high rates of dopamine uptake, which attenuate the spatial range of dopamine signaling. I anticipate that this work is a necessary step towards the comprehensive mechanistic dissection of cellular signaling, and I hope it will prove invaluable to future progress...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis U. S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{accidents}} statistics {{have identified}} ore-pass hazards {{as a significant}} safety problem in U. S. underground metal mines. The statistics show that nearly 75 % of injuries are directly or indirectly related to pulling or freeing of ore-pass chutes, the use of hand tools in ore passes, fails of broken rock in ore passes and structural failures of chutes or gates and ore-pass walls. Researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are investigating hazards in and around ore passes in hard rock mines. Risk assessment methods, such as fault-tree analysis, have been employed to identify the most probable causes of orepass failures, define research priorities and analyse the factors that result in malfunctioning and unsafe ore passes. Static and dynamic loads are being measured in a laboratory setting {{with the use of}} a reduced-scale orepass mock-up. Field tests are being initiated in mine ore passes to determine static and dynamic loads. Data from the test ore passes are being compared with data from the mine to characterize true system behaviour. Computer modelling with the use of closed-form solutions, finite-element analyses and a newly developed particle flow code predicts static and dynamic leads from the flow and the impact of ore and waste in the ore pass. Preliminary results indicate that dynamic impacts from ore and waste rock might be considerably greater than expected. The total static load is substantially less than is typically used fur the structural design of chute and gate support members. It is suggested that damping factors, normal and shear stiffness and mass frictional characteristics have a significant effect on particle flow and resulting impact loads. This is being verified with the use of results from laboratory tests, field tests and particle flow analyses. Ore passes are vertical or steeply inclined openings in a rock mass through which ore and waste are transported and where they mar also be stored. A typical underground mining system is shown in Fig. 1. The arrows indicate the locations of ore passes and loading pockets and their relative configurations. The control of material flow is potentially one of the most hazardous operations in underground mining. According to MSHA data. most of the ore pass-related accidents in the U. S. A. are associated with the loading-unloading cycle and removal of blockages from ore passes. In particular, attempts <b>to</b> free ore <b>hang-ups</b> have resulted in multiple fatalities. The hazards are obvious; there is uncertainty as to when the ore will break loose and miners are unable to escape falling rock to a safe location. Although ore passes and chutes and gate systems for underground metal and non-metal mines roust meet the requirements specified in the U. S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Parts 57 and 75, recent structural failures of ore-pass linings and gates have underlined the lack of adequate ore-pass design standards available to both MSHA enforcement staff and mine engineers. Because of the importance of an ore pass to the safe operation of a mine design criteria need to be assessed and new guidelines developed. Researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory of the Nationals Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are investigating hazards in and around ore passes in hard rock mines and studying design criteria for ore passes. The near-term goal is to conduct laboratory and field experiments and computer modelling to evaluate the ore-pass design criteria currently used. Literature searches, field sit...|$|R
