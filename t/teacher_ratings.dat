40|$|International audienceA {{handedness}} polymorphism {{exists in}} all human populations so far investigated, {{at least since}} the Palaeolithic. Handedness is a heritable trait, and a possible evolutionary explanation for the higher prevalence of right-handers is the association of left-handedness with some deleterious traits. In this context, the persistence of left-handers remains unexplained. Reproductive success {{has been shown to be}} dependent on cultural success in many human societies. This study is the first attempt to consider the importance of social status to evolutionary processes related to handedness. We conducted a survey in French public primary schools to look for a possible association between laterality, school performance, and leadership skills. This study revealed only weak associations, and a sex effect. For primary-school girls, we report a negative association between several indicators of left-sidedness and <b>teacher's</b> <b>ratings</b> of school performance and leadership skills. For primary-school boys, we report a positive association between left-handedness for writing and <b>teacher's</b> <b>ratings</b> of school performance. The present study did not reveal any strong relation between laterality and school performance, but has shown that general school performance is not independent of laterality, and that the effect is opposite in males and females.

40|$|Background: Dissociation – {{a pattern}} of general {{disruption}} in memory and consciousness – {{has been found to}} be an important cognitive component of children’s and adults coping with severe trauma. Dissociative experiences include amnesia, identity disturbance, age regression, difficulty with con-centration, and trance states. Stable individual differences in dissociative behaviors may represent a dissociative tendency trait that varies in the population independent of the influence of trauma. Method: In the current study, we examined genetic and environmental sources of variance in some of these behaviors by comparing 86 pairs of adoptive siblings and 102 pairs of full siblings from the Colorado Adoption Project (parents and <b>teachers</b> <b>ratings),</b> and 218 pairs of identical and 173 pairs of same-sex fraternal twins from the British Register for Child Twins (parents ratings). The study used a dissociation scale comprised of six CBCL items. Results: Developmentally, there was no change in mean dissociation scores across middle childhood and adolescence, and individual differences were moderately stable. Both parents and <b>teachers</b> <b>ratings</b> showed moderate to substantial amounts of genetic and nonshared environmental variance and negligible shared environmental variance, and most of the parent–teacher agreement in their ratings was accounted for by overlapping genetic vari-ance.

These social classes may correspond roughly to aggressive and withdrawn children. Other independent predictors included the children's academic skill (combining the results of several tests and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings),</b> parental discipline (based on researcher observations of aversion and punishment), parental monitoring (based on scores assigned during parent and subject interviews), and antisocial behavior and involvement with antisocial peers (aggregates of parent, teacher, and subject ratings).

5000|$|In Western countries, only {{children}} {{are often the}} subject of a stereotype that equates them with [...] "spoiled brats". G.

Even today, only children are commonly stereotyped as [...] "spoiled, selfish, and bratty". While many only children receive a lot of attention and resources for their development, it is not clear that as a class they are overindulged or differ significantly from children with siblings. Susan Newman, a social psychologist at Rutgers University and the author of Parenting an Only Child, says that this is a myth. [...] "People articulate that only children are spoiled, they're aggressive, they're bossy, they're lonely, they're maladjusted", she said. [...] "There have been hundreds and hundreds of research studies that show that only children are no different from their peers." [...] However, differences have been found. Research involving <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> of U.S. children's social and interpersonal skills has scored only children lower in self-control and interpersonal skills.

Second, perceptions of Indonesian secondary school teachers’ interpersonal behaviour as perceived by students and teachers were studied with the QTI. Third, differences between students’ and teachers’ perceptions regarding interpersonal teacher behaviour were compared. The QTI itself is based on the Model of Interpersonal Behaviour which maps teacher behaviour in terms of Influence (Dominance–Submission) and Proximity (Cooperation–Opposition). In this study, an Indonesian version of the QTI was constructed and distributed to 2, 380 students of 69 teachers from 85 classes (grade 7 – 9) from 12 public lower secondary schools in Indonesia.

While the students' ratings of their own behavior correlated highly with the <b>teacher's</b> <b>ratings</b> and evaluations made by independent observers, the self-evaluations did not lead to a reduction in disruptive behavior. A token reinforcement program, in which the teacher rated the students' level of appropriate behavior and in which the students traded earned rating points for prizes, clearly led to a reduction of disruptive behavior. When the students were given the opportunity to evaluate their own behavior and to receive rewards in exchange for the evaluation, they returned to their former rates of disruptive behavior...|$|R
5000|$|The study, {{called the}} Waterloo Longitudinal Project, {{followed}} {{a group of}} 88 mostly middle-class male and female children from grade 2 (average age 7 years) to grade 9 (age 14). As a result of attrition, only 60 of the subjects remained in the study for the full seven years. The main independent variable {{in the study was}} a classification of second-grade children by social type. To differentiate between the aggressive, withdrawn, and socially competent second-grade children, the researchers constructed aggregates of several measures. In one scale, the Revised Class Play method pioneered by Masten, Morison, and Pellegrini, children were asked to nominate peers who best fit into each of the three social categories. Three of the seven items designed to measure isolation were deleted, however, because they seemed to record peer rejection rather than withdrawal, and in two cases (e.g. [...] "someone who has trouble making friends") were as applicable to aggressive children as to their withdrawn peers—underscoring the tendency of the two groups of unpopular children to overlap. Other indicators added to the aggregate measures of aggression, withdrawal, and social competence were a peer-assessed sociometric rating of each child's popularity, <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings,</b> and observations by the researchers during 15-minute play sessions. The dependent measures consisted of questionnaire items regarding each ninth-grade adolescent's delinquency and substance abuse, perceived security in both family and peer groups, loneliness, and self-regard.|$|E
40|$|English {{learners}} (EL) are one {{the largest}} population {{groups within the}} public schools in United States. Their academic achievement is lower than their monolingual peers in several areas. Working memory (WM), a cognitive process, {{has been identified as}} one of the predictors of poor academic achievement in both monolingual English speaking and EL children. Children at risk for learning problems have poor WM capacity. In addition, teachers have been acknowledged as one of the primary sources for identifying children at risk for learning problems. This study investigated the relationship between teachers’ ratings of ELs’ WM and students’ actual WM performance. Because WM is composed of several components, a determination was made as to whether <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> are related to isolated components of WM or whether ratings are predictive of all components. Because <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> are context specific (student make-up of classroom), multilevel modeling was used to identify whether <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> accurately predict EL children’s performance on WM tasks. Additionally, covariates related to student characteristics and achievement were entered in the model to determine whether unique variance related to <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> was sustained in predictions of WM performance. The results suggest that <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> do predict both general WM and isolated components of WM in both English and Spanish.

40|$|Parent {{and teacher}} {{perspectives}} of young children’s social competence were compared by analyzing parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> of 30 dual language learners and 30 monolingual native English-speaking children. Parents and teachers rated {{children on the}} Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) rating scales. Participants were 60 parents and 9 teachers of 3 -to- 5 year-old children who attended a Head Start preschool center. For each child, one parent and one teacher completed an SSIS rating scale, resulting in two rating scales for each child. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether (a) parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> were significantly different on SSIS measures of social competence for young children and (b) whether parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> were significantly different for children based on children’s language designation. In particular, this study examined both social skills and problem behaviors when looking for differences in parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings.</b> Results indicated that parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> were significantly different for four of the subscales based on participant category, meaning that the SSIS ratings differed based on whether parents or teachers were completing the rating scales. For the social skills subscale, empathy, results indicated that teachers were likely to give children higher ratings than parents. On the externalizing, internalizing, and hyperactivity/inattention subscales, which are all Problem Behaviors subscales, parent ratings for children were higher than <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings,</b> and these differences were statistically significant. Parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> on two subscales also differed for children based on their language designation. Results from analysis of the communication subscale, which is a social skills subscale, indicated that parents and teachers rated dual language learners higher than monolingual native English-speaking children. From the Problem Behaviors scale, parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> for bullying were higher for monolingual native English-speaking children than for dual language learners. Findings from this study also indicate that dual language learners received higher ratings on communication scales and lower ratings on bullying scales than their native English-speaking peers. Further research should more closely examine the relationship between these two constructs. The role of language in the development of social competence is still not well understood, however it is important to understand the developmental trajectory of dual language learners in order to provide the most appropriate educational experiences opportunities for children and their families and improve outcomes...|$|E
