5|$|While in Hawaiʻi, Pitman and {{his older}} sister Mary {{attended}} Mrs.Wetmore's children's school in Hilo. The school was located at the Wetmores' residence on Church Street. Taught by Lucy Sheldon Taylor Wetmore, the wife of American missionary doctor and government physician Charles Hinckley Wetmore, {{who had come to}} Hawaii in 1848 with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), the two elder Pitman children received their education in English rather than Hawaiian. This was unusual since Hawaiian was the official language of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, and all other schools in Hilo were conducted in the Hawaiian language. Mrs.Wetmore taught the children reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic and singing, while also reinforcing the curriculum with a strong adherence to the principles of the Protestant faith. Like the Pitman siblings, many of <b>their</b> <b>classmates</b> were also of half-Hawaiian (hapa-kanaka) descent with a majority of them being Chinese-Hawaiians (hapa-pake).|$|E

40|$|Social {{media has}} quickly become an {{integral}} part of day-to-day interaction for many university students. By infusing usage of the popular social networking site Instagram into the curriculum of three French 1002 classes, this exploratory study aimed to investigate the role of image as a tool to support learning writing in the L 2 in a lower division French class.

25|$|During {{and after}} the initial investigations, social cliques within high schools were widely discussed. One {{perception}} formed was that both Klebold and Harris had been isolated from <b>their</b> <b>classmates,</b> prompting feelings of helplessness, insecurity, and depression, {{as well as a}} strong need for attention. This concept has been questioned, as both Harris and Klebold had a close circle of friends and a wider informal social group.|$|E

25|$|In life achievements, grit {{may be as}} {{important}} as talent. College students at an elite university who scored high in grit also earned higher GPAs than <b>their</b> <b>classmates,</b> despite having lower SAT scores. In a study at the West Point military academy it was found that grit was a more reliable predictor of first summer retention than self-control or a summary measure of cadet quality. Gritty competitors at the Scripps National Spelling Bee outranked other competitors who scored lower in grit, at least partially due to accumulated practice.|$|E
