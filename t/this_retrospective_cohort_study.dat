The aim of <b>this</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>cohort</b> <b>study</b> is to compare the results of single-access laparoscopic rectal resection (SALR) versus multiaccess laparoscopic rectal resection with a mean follow-up of 24 months. METHODS: <b>This</b> <b>retrospective</b> <b>cohort</b> <b>study</b> enrolled 42 patients. Between January 2010 and June 2012, 21 SALRs were performed. These patients were compared with a group of 21 other patients who had undergone multiport laparoscopic rectal resection. This control group had the same exclusion criteria and patient demographics. Short-term outcomes were reassessed with a mean follow-up of 2 years. Statistical analysis included the Student t test and Fisher's exact test. Finally, we performed a differential cost analysis between the 2 procedures. RESULTS: Exclusion criteria, patient demographics, and indication for surgery were similar in both groups.
