5|$|<b>Tomato</b> plants over-expressing systemin also {{accumulated}} HypSys {{but did not}} if the systemin precursor was silenced, {{indicating that}} in <b>tomato,</b> HypSys is controlled by systemin. Each of the three HypSys peptides in <b>tomato</b> is able to activate the synthesis and accumulation of protease inhibitors. When HypSys is silenced the production of protease inhibitors induced by wounding is halved compared to wild type plants indicating that both systemin and HypSys are required for a strong defence response against herbivores in <b>tomato.</b>|$|E

50|$|Sun-dried <b>tomatoes</b> are ripe <b>tomatoes</b> that lose most {{of their}} water content after {{spending}} a majority of their drying time in the sun. These <b>tomatoes</b> are usually pre-treated with sulfur dioxide or salt before being placed in the sun {{in order to improve}} quality. Typically, <b>tomatoes</b> spend 4-10 days in the sun in order for the sun-drying process to be complete. Cherry types of <b>tomatoes</b> will lose 88% of their initial (fresh) weight, while larger <b>tomatoes</b> can lose up to 93% during the process. As a result, it takes anywhere from 8 to 14 kilograms of fresh <b>tomatoes</b> to make a single kilogram of sun-dried <b>tomatoes.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{receptor}} for <b>tomato</b> systemin {{was identified}} as a 160KDa leucine-rich repeat receptor like kinase (LRR-RLK), SR160. After being isolated it was found that was very similar in structure to BRI1 from A. thaliana, the receptor that brassinolides bind to on the cell membrane. This was the first receptor which was found to be able to bind both a steroid and a peptide ligand and also to be involved in both defensive and developmental responses. Recent studies have found that the initial conclusion that BRI1 is the receptor for <b>tomato</b> systemin may be incorrect. In cu3 mutants of <b>tomato,</b> a null allele with a stop codon present in the extracellular LRR domain of BRI1 prevents the receptor from being localised correctly and it also lacks the kinase domain, required for signalling. These mutants are insensitive to brassinolide yet still respond to <b>tomato</b> systemin by producing protease inhibitors and causing an alkalisation response. This led Holton et al. to suggest that there is another mechanism by which systemin is perceived. Further investigation showed that binding of systemin to BRI1 does not cause the receptor to become phosphorylated, as when brassinolides bind, suggesting that it does not transduce a signal. When BRI1 is silenced in <b>tomato,</b> the plants have a similar phenotype to cu3 mutants yet are still able to respond normally to systemin, strengthening the view that BRI1 is not the systemin receptor.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, {{there is little evidence}} of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, <b>tomato,</b> mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread.

40|$|AbstractBlack <b>tomatoes</b> have {{a unique}} color and higher {{lycopene}} content than typical red <b>tomatoes.</b> Here, black <b>tomatoes</b> were investigated how maturation stage and storage temperature affected carotenoid and chlorophyll accumulation. Immature fruits were firmer than mature fruits, but failed to develop their distinctive color and contained less lycopene when stored at 8 °C. Hunter a* values of black <b>tomatoes</b> increased with storage temperature and duration; storage of immature fruits at high temperature favored lycopene accumulation. Chlorophyll levels of black <b>tomatoes</b> declined during storage, but differences between mature and immature <b>tomatoes</b> stored at 12 °C were minimal. β-Carotene levels of black <b>tomatoes</b> increased during early storage, but rapidly declined beginning 13 d post-harvest.

5|$|In 1994, <b>tomato</b> systemin {{was found}} to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell {{membrane}} of <b>tomato.</b> The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like prohormone convertases.

Synthetic forms of <b>tomato</b> systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted dibasic cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form. Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified.

5|$|Silencing systemin did {{not affect}} the ability of black {{nightshade}} to resist herbivory and, when competing against normal plants, silenced plants produced more above-ground biomass and berries. Upon herbivory, systemin was down-regulated in black nightshade in contrast to the other peptides which are up-regulated after herbivory. By contrast HypSys were up-regulated and activated the synthesis of protease inhibitors. The down-regulation of systemin was associated with increased root mass but did not decrease shoot mass, demonstrating that systemin can cause developmental changes as a result of herbivory, allowing the plant to tolerate, rather than directly resist attack. <b>Tomato</b> roots were also affected by <b>tomato</b> systemin, with root growth increasing at high <b>tomato</b> systemin concentrations. By allocating more resources to the roots, plants under attack are thought to store carbon and then use it to re-grow when the attack ends. Overexpressing AtPEP1 also increased root and shoot biomass in A. thaliana.|$|E

In <b>tomato,</b> mRNA encoding the precursor for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the phloem in vascular bundles of mid veins.

The performance of the dryer was studied (drying time and product quality) in comparison with open sun drying method. The absolute geometry of cut for the products to be dried was also revealed. It was found that the solar tunnel greenhouse dryer took only 29 hours for reducing the moisture content of sliced cut <b>tomatoes</b> from 90 % (w. b.) to 9 % (w. b.) and 56 hours for reducing the moisture content of cube cut <b>tomatoes</b> from 90 % (w. b.) to 9 % (w. b.) whereas the open sun drying took 74 hours and 123 hours for the same.
