50|$|Jim Younkin of Springdale, Arkansas {{completed}} {{a frame of}} this aircraft in 1989 and a homebuilt model earlier in 1985 with the help from Bud Dake. Three Mullicoupes were flying by 1997. The idea of this design came to Younkin and Dake at the Ottumwa, Iowa Antique Airplane Association's Fly-In in 1982 after a discussion about Younkin's Mister Mulligan. Bud Dake suggested they design a 2-seat aircraft which would be {{as fast as the}} Mister Mulligan but powered by a smaller P&W R-985 engine. Younkin then designed a scale model which was somewhat of a cross between the Benny Howard-designed Mister Mulligan but with the fuselage shape of a Monocoupe. The Mullicoupes are a clean-sheet design utilizing a steel tube fuselage double-covered in fabric with built up wood wings skinned in aircraft plywood. The airfoil used on the Mullicoupe is the NACA 23012 having a chord of 63", but with an elliptical and <b>tapered</b> <b>planform.</b> The flaps are full Fowler flaps that travel on hidden hinges built into the wings, which is another Younkin original design.|$|E

50|$|It was a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with the}} wing meeting the fuselage {{at the same}} position as the lower wing of the H.P.43 but without the inboard anhedral. The wing had a similar <b>tapered</b> <b>planform</b> to that of the H.P.47, though much bigger with a span of 90 ft rather than 58 ft. The H.P.47's wing construction used a single central spar forming the rear of a stressed skin torsion box forward to the leading edge and the confirmation of its design assumptions by stress tests at the RAE allowed a similar approach for the new aircraft. The H.P.51 wings were of thick RAF 34 section, and like the H.P.47 were fabric-covered behind the spar. There were leading edge slats on the outer half of the wing with fabric-covered ailerons and inboard slotted flaps on the trailing edge. The undercarriage legs of the H.P.51 were longer than those of the H.P.43 because there was no anhedral wing section: the main legs went vertically to the spar just behind the engine mounting and were each braced to the fuselage with a pair of struts from top and bottom of the leg. The resulting landing gear had a wide track, with legs in streamlined fairings and the wheels in spats.|$|E
50|$|The Kite 2 was {{a fabric}} covered wooden aircraft.

There were no flaps, but spoilers were fitted to the upper wing surface. The wing was pylon mounted and, as on the earlier Kite, a single lift strut on each side linked wing and lower fuselage. The pilot sat immediately {{in front of the}} pylon under a canopy which blended into it. The canopy and surrounding fuselage fairing lifted off in one piece for access. The cockpit revision slightly increased the length of the nose, but most of the 1030 mm (40.6 in) fuselage extension was behind the wings. The tail unit of the Kite 2 was {{the same as that of}} its predecessors, with an aerodynamically balanced rudder with a deep and rounded trailing edge mounted on a fin that was little more than a rudder-post. The tailplane, braced from below and on the top of the fuselage was far enough forward that the elevator hinges were ahead of the rudder post. There was strong taper on the horizontal surfaces and a large cut out in the elevators to allow rudder movement. A monowheel was added aft of the nose skid.|$|E
40|$|A {{general theory}} of finite state {{modeling}} of aerodynamic loads on thin airfoils and lifting surfaces performing completely arbitrary, small, time-dependent motions in an airstream is developed and presented. The nature {{of the behavior of}} the unsteady airloads in the frequency domain is explained, using as raw materials any of the unsteady linearized theories that have been mechanized for simple harmonic oscillations. Each desired aerodynamic transfer function is approximated by means of an appropriate Pade approximant, that is, a rational function of finite degree polynomials in the Laplace transform variable. The modeling technique is applied to several two dimensional and three dimensional airfoils. Circular, elliptic, rectangular and <b>tapered</b> <b>planforms</b> are considered as examples.

5000|$|The {{test vehicle}} was a 3/10-scale {{model of the}} Miles E.24/43 design except for the {{omission}} of the distinctive annular air intake of the full-scale aircraft. To maintain {{the center of gravity}} (c.g.) it was necessary to include a large balance weight (a!most 1/10 of total all-up weight) in the foremost section of the nose. The layout was further restricted by the need to maintain a constant c.g. position during the consumption of the fuels. This was achieved by placing a small tank ahead of the wing holding one third of the total oxidant (as well as the fuel in the shaped nose tank) and locating the main oxidant tank aft of tile wing. Other large components were placed fore and aft of the wing. In the space below and above the wing centre section were located the air, fuel, oxidant and warm-air pipes, telemetering transmitter, instruments and batteries as well as the autopilot, timing clock, wiring terminal fuses and the connections by which the test vehicle was carried on the parent aircraft. The rear section housed the combustion chamber, radar transponder, smoke-producing fluid, instruments and oscillators for combustion chamber pressure and tailplane angle, servos and dive mechanism for the tailplane which together with the fixed directional fin were fitted to the lower body prior. The single-piece wing was of mahogany with Dural inserts at the leading and trailing edges; it was of biconvex section and of <b>tapered</b> <b>planform</b> with an unswept half-chord line. The Dural inserts formed a convenient dipole-aerial system for the telemetering unit. (A similar arrangement on the tailplane served the radar transponder.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Fokker V.1 {{principal}} innovation was its unbraced cantilever wings. These {{were built}} around a pair of wooden box-girders, {{the upper and lower}} members of which were built up from several thin strips of pine, with connecting webs of birch plywood. The entire wing was covered in plywood, an innovation probably suggested to Fokker by a Swedish aeronautical engineer, Villehad Forssman, who had previously designed one of Germany's earliest multi-engined military aircraft; the V.1 upper wing's smooth surface, thick airfoil and <b>tapered</b> <b>planform</b> gave it a remarkably modern appearance. The depth of spar needed for adequate strength necessitated a wing whose root thickness was around 20% of the chord, in contrast to a typical value of around 6% for aircraft of the period and 12 to 15% for modern aircraft of comparable performance. The spars of the upper wing were parallel but those of the lower wing converged to meet at the wingtips. The intention of this was to provide a well for the fitting of a retractable undercarriage at a later date. Ailerons were fitted to the upper wing only and these were unusual in that the entire wing-tip being a separate component, and was pivoted, much like the French BlÃ©riot VIII of 1908 had done, to provide a control surface. To further Platz's desire for an aerodynamically clean aircraft, all control actuators were buried within the wing, so that there were no drag-creating control horns. The upper wing was mounted on a system of cabane struts consisting of a pair of tubular steel tripods between the fuselage and mainspar and a pair of steel struts connected to the aft spar, all basically similar to the cabane strut design for the later, likewise Platz-designed Fokker D.VI and Fokker D.VII biplane descendents â each of which also used one [...] "N-pattern" [...] interplane strut set per side â and the Fokker D.VIII parasol-wing monoplane descendent of the V.1. Unlike the later D.VI and D.VII, there were no interplane struts on the outer areas of the V.1's wing panels. Since Platz was using a novel and thick aerofoil, much like the contemporary cantilever-winged Junkers J 1 all-metal monoplane pioneered nearly a year earlier, he was unsure about the correct incidence for the wing with respect to the fuselage. Lacking a wind tunnel, he therefore made it adjustable during flight.|$|E

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in micro aerial vehicles has brought attention {{to the need for}} an improved understanding of the aerodynamics of low-aspect-ratio wings at lowReynolds numbers. In this study, flat plate wings with rectangular and <b>tapered</b> <b>planforms</b> were fabricated with aspect ratios of 0. 75, 1, 1. 5, and 3, and the aerodynamic loading was measured at Reynolds numbers between 5 104 and 1 105. Surface tuft visualization was used to observe the interactions between the tip vortices and the leading-edge vortex. The tests were initially conducted at a sideslip angle of 0 and were then repeated for 10, 20, and 35 with and without winglets. Measurements made with a six-component force balance showed that a decrease in aspect ratio caused an increase in stall and CLmax due to the nonlinear lift induced by the interacting flow on the upper wing surface. In addition, the detachment of tip vortices after stall leads to a sudden decrease in drag coefficient as the magnitude of the induced drag drops significantly. At increasing sideslip angles, the effects of the crossflow still contribute to an increase in lift but significantly reduce the pitching moment about the quarter-chord, thus decreasing the wingâs ability to recover from angle-of-attack perturbations. These results show that, while the effects of tip vortices and the leading-edge vortex complicate the flowfield around a low-aspect-ratio wing, particularly at increased sideslip angles, their impact tends to improve the aerodynamic performance.
