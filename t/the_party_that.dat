Lyadov and Glazunov are also numbered among my opponents, yet I sincerely love and value their talent.|$|E

5|$|On the Palamecia, {{the other}} members of the party reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch, who is the Cocoon fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus in disguise. Barthandelus tells <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>that</b> their Focus is to {{transform}} into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal'Cie Orphan, who keeps Cocoon afloat above Pulse. Slaying Orphan will result in the destruction of Cocoon. The party flees and learns from Cid that the fal'Cie believe that Cocoon's destruction will summon the Maker, the creator of the worlds. The fal'Cie cannot harm Orphan themselves. Vanille and Fang reveal to <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>that</b> they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries earlier, and that their Focus then had been the same: to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy Orphan. The party flies away to Pulse and journeys to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's hometown, where they hope to learn how to remove their l'Cie marks. The town is deserted, and they find no living people on the surface. The party is unsuccessful in removing their marks, and Barthandelus confronts them again. The party learns that Barthandelus has made Cid the new Primarch to create chaos in Cocoon to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and Orphan in a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo Grove ambush was {{an ambush}} that {{occurred}} on May 19, 1832 {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. A six-man detail carrying dispatches from United States Colonel James M.

Durley's remains were initially interred by <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>that</b> would become victims of the St. Vrain massacre. Two other men had bullet holes in their clothing, but were uninjured. In 1910 the Polo Historical Society moved Durley's remains to a plot beneath a memorial they erected west of Polo, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Chancery could grant three {{possible}} remedies– specific performance, injunctions and damages. The remedy of specific performance is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the party in breach of contract to perform his obligations. The validity of the contract {{as a whole was}} not normally considered, only whether there was adequate consideration and if expecting <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>that</b> breached the contract to carry out his obligations was viable. Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which requires them to do something). Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the Court of Chancery was the only body qualified to grant injunctions and specific performance.|$|E

He joined the Radical Civic Union (UCR) in 1946, {{as a member of}} the Intransigent Renewal Movement, a faction of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>that</b> opposed the incorporation of the UCR into the Democratic Union coalition. He was appointed president of the party committee in Chascomús in 1951, and was elected to the city council in 1954. He was detained for a brief time, during the reaction of the government of Juan Perón to the bombing of Plaza de Mayo. The Revolución Libertadora ousted Perón from the national government; Alfonsín was again briefly detained and forced to leave his office in the city council. The UCR broke up into two parties: the Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI), led by Arturo Frondizi, and the People's Radical Civic Union (UCRP), led by Ricardo Balbín and Crisólogo Larralde. Alfonsín did not like the split, but opted to follow the UCRP.|$|E
5|$|Coming to {{the palace}} {{at the center of}} Nil, they {{encounter}} the Emperor himself, who is revealed to be Elgo. Elgo explains to <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>that</b> he wished to use the crystals to achieve immortality, and predicted that the crystals, sensing his purpose, would split the world hoping to halt his plans. Elgo then utilized the power of Nil to move between the worlds and ensured that the Warriors collect the crystals in effort to restore the world so that he could achieve his goals. The Warriors and Elgo battle, with Elgo using the power of Nil against them. When he is defeated, Elgo loses control of Nil and it mutates him into a dark monster. The Warriors, seeing that Nil will ravage their world unchecked, fight the transformed Elgo and win. As Nil reverses its flow and life is returned to the world, all the Warriors flee, apart from Dusk and Alba, who are presumed dead. Soon however, they are revealed to be alive, saved by the spirits of Vata and the Mask. The game ends with the Warriors reunited, and the world and its crystal restored.|$|E
5|$|In 1170, Gervase was {{involved}} with attempts to keep Thomas Becket, {{who had been in}} exile, from returning to England. Working with Gervase were Roger de Pont L'Évêque the Archbishop of York, Gilbert Foliot the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon the Bishop of Salisbury, Reginald de Warenne the Sheriff of Sussex, and Ranulf de Broc. Gervase was part of <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>that</b> met Becket at Sandwich on 1 December 1070 when the archbishop returned to England. The lay members of the group, led by Gervase, complained that the archbishop was sowing dissension in the land by his excommunication of the three ecclesiastics who were with the group, but Becket managed to calm the officials by stating he would consider the matter and reply to them the next day. The next day the group was accompanied by some clergy sent by the ecclesiastics who had been excommunicated by Becket. Nothing further was accomplished by this meeting except further offers from Becket to consider other options. Afterwards, Gervase and Ranulf de Broc tried to discover which of the citizens of London had welcomed Becket back into the kingdom, but were frustrated by refusal of the London clergy to appear and by the laymen refusing to answer to anything but royal writs.|$|E

5|$|On December 16, 1945, Arévalo was {{incapacitated}} for a {{while after}} a car accident. The leaders of the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR), which was <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>that</b> supported the government, were afraid that Arana would {{take the opportunity to}} launch a coup and so struck a deal with him, which later {{came to be known as}} the Pacto del Barranco (Pact of the Ravine). Under the terms of this pact, Arana agreed to refrain from seizing power with the military; in return, the PAR agreed to support Arana's candidacy in the next presidential election, scheduled for November 1950. Arévalo himself recovered swiftly, but was forced to support the agreement. However, by 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana due to his lack of support for labor rights. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana. In 1947 Arana had demanded that certain labor leaders be expelled from the country; Árbenz vocally disagreed with Arana, and the former's intervention limited the number of deportees.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the days}} of the Constituent Assembly in 1823, and with renewed vigor in 1826 {{with the opening of the}} General Assembly (the Brazilian parliament), there had been an ideological {{struggle}} over the balance of powers wielded by the emperor and legislature in governance. On one side were those who shared PedroI's views, politicians who believed that the monarch should be free to choose ministers, national policies and the direction of government. In opposition were those, then known as the Liberal Party, who believed that cabinets should have the power to set the government's course and should consist of deputies drawn from the majority party who were accountable to the parliament. Strictly speaking, both <b>the</b> <b>party</b> <b>that</b> supported PedroI's government and the Liberal Party advocated Liberalism, and thus constitutional monarchy.|$|E
