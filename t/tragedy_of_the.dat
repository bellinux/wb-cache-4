5|$|Although {{considered}} an original character, Simba {{was inspired by}} the character Bambi from Disney's Bambi (1942), as well as the stories of Moses and Joseph from the Bible. Additionally, several similarities have been drawn between Simba and Prince Hamlet from William Shakespeare's <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same name. In 1997, The Lion King was adapted into Broadway musical, with actors Scott Irby-Ranniar and Jason Raize originating the roles of the cub and adult Simbas, respectively.|$|E

Fesser portrays the Opus Dei in a negative way, depicting it as an extreme cult destroying families, suggesting that Opus Dei manipulated the <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young Camino's painful death for its own ends.|$|E

5|$|In {{between the}} Argo and the Trojan War, {{there was a}} {{generation}} known chiefly for its horrific crimes. This includes the doings of Atreus and Thyestes at Argos. Behind {{the myth of the}} house of Atreus (one of the two principal heroic dynasties with the house of Labdacus) lies the problem of the devolution of power and of the mode of accession to sovereignty. The twins Atreus and Thyestes with their descendants played the leading role in the <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> devolution of power in Mycenae.|$|E
5|$|Gibson {{starred in}} Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet in 1990, as the eponymous {{character}} of the Shakespearean <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same name. It was the first film produced by Icon Productions, a production company he co-founded with Bruce Davey. Gibson's directorial debut was The Man Without a Face (1993), an adaptation of Isabelle Holland's novel of the same name. Two years later he directed and produced Braveheart, a historical epic drama in which he also portrayed Sir William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish knight. The film earned him a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Director, and the film won an Academy Award for Best Picture.

5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commons.|$|E

50|$|Aurangzeb {{installed}} Shaista Khan as <b>the</b> new Nawab <b>of</b> Bengal replacing Shah Shuja. Shaista Khan {{was very}} strict with the Portuguese, thus emboldening their superiority on the sea, which {{eventually led to}} <b>the</b> <b>tragedies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child's War.|$|R
25|$|The idea of {{evolutionary}} suicide, where adaptation {{at the level}} of the individual causes the whole species or population to be driven extinct, can be seen as an extreme form of an evolutionary <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commons.

25|$|Fielding gives special {{emphasis}} to <b>the</b> printed version <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tragedies</b> by including notes {{and making it}} his only printed play that originally includes a frontispiece. The variorum, or notes, to <b>the</b> printed version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play pointed out many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parodies, allusions, and other references within <b>The</b> <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tragedies.</b> However, <b>the</b> notes themselves serve as a parody for serious uses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notes and mock <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> critically interpreting plays. By calling himself Scriblerus Secundus, Fielding connects <b>The</b> <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tragedies</b> with <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scriblerus Club. These works also contain parodies of critics and scholars who attempt to elucidate literature.|$|R
25|$|One {{solution}} for some resources is to convert common good into private property, giving {{the new owner}} an incentive to enforce its sustainability. Libertarians and classical liberals cite the <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commons {{as an example of}} what happens when Lockean property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government. They argue that the solution to the <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.|$|E

25|$|Articulating {{solutions}} to the <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commons {{is one of the}} main problems of political philosophy.
