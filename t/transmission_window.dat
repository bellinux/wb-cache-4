2500|$|WDM {{systems are}} divided into three {{different}} wavelength patterns, normal (WDM), coarse (CWDM) [...] and dense (DWDM). [...] Normal WDM (sometimes called BWDM) uses the two normal wavelengths 1310 and 1550 on one fiber. Coarse WDM provides up to 16 channels across multiple transmission windows of silica fibers. Dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) uses the C-Band (1530nm-1565nm) <b>transmission</b> <b>window</b> but with denser channel spacing. Channel plans vary, but a typical DWDM system would use 40 channels at 100GHz spacing or 80 channels with 50GHz spacing. Some technologies are capable of 12.5GHz spacing (sometimes called ultra dense WDM). New amplification options (Raman amplification) enable {{the extension of the}} usable wavelengths to the L-band (1565nm-1625nm), more or less doubling these numbers.|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} {{properties of}} a graphene multiquantum well system are investigated numerically using transfer-matrix method. There are transmission gaps for electrons and {{holes in the}} transmission spectra at tilted incidence. In the transmission gaps, a few resonant tunneling peaks appear, defined as <b>transmission</b> <b>windows,</b> which are related with the bound states in the quantum wells. Unlike conventional semiconductor nanostructures, the location and {{the width of the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>windows</b> are sensitive not only to the quantum well width but also the incident angle. The number of the quantum wells determines the fine structure of the <b>transmission</b> <b>windows.</b> The anisotropic property is affected in the following way: the increase in well width makes the nonzero-transmission incident angle range decrease, and the interference effect is enhanced as the well number increases. Tiny oscillation of the conductance and fine structures in the middle energy range are due to the resonant tunneling induced by the multiquantum well structure. These oscillating features may be helpful in explaining the oscillatory characteristics in experiment...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: One {{of the key}} {{components}} in all-optical communication networks using the whole low-loss bandwidth of the silica fibre is an ultra-wideband wavelength converter [1]. Use of all-optical ultrawideband wavelength converters enhances network flexibility, allowing an all-optical wavelength conversion between different <b>transmission</b> <b>windows,</b> and therefore avoiding the bottleneck of optical-electricaloptical conversion. This will become of particular importance at the network nodes interfacing metro-access systems employing the whole low-loss bandwidth of the silica fibre, and the core network traditionally centred in a 1550 nm window. A number of metro-access schemes utilising simultaneously 1310 and 1550 nm <b>transmission</b> <b>windows</b> have been proposed, e. g. [2, 3]. Ultra-wideband wavelength converters applied in metro-access systems have to deliver high performance while remaining cost-effective. A cost-effective alternative to 1310 to 1550 nm wavelength converters based on expensi...|$|R
40|$|In this reprot, we {{introduce}} a new technique for designing miniaturized-element frequency selective surfaces (MEFSSs) with bandpass responses and no spurious <b>transmission</b> <b>windows</b> over extremely large bandwidths. The proposed, harmonic-suppressed MEFSSs consist of multiple metallic and dielectric layers. Each metallic layer {{is in the form}} of a two-dimensional arrangement of capacitive patches or an inductive wire grid with extremely sub-wavelength periods. Harmonic-free operation in these structures is achieved by using multiple, closely-spaced capacitive layers with overlapping unit cells to synthesize a single, effective capacitive layer with a larger capacitance value. This allows for reducing the unit cell size of a conventional MEFSS considerably and moving the natural resonant frequencies of its constituting elements to considerably higher frequencies. Consequently, the spurious <b>transmission</b> <b>windows</b> of such MEFSSs, which are caused by these higher-order harmonics, can be shifted to very high frequencies and an extremely broad frequency band free of any spurious <b>transmission</b> <b>windows</b> can be obtained. Using this technique, an MEFSS with a second-order bandpass response is designed to operate at 3. 0 GHz with 20 % Fractional bandwidth and be free of spurious transmission bands up to 27. 0 GHz. A prototype of this harmonic-free MEFSS is fabricated and experimentally characterized in the lab. Measurement results confirm harmonic-free operation of the proposed FSS for incidence angles in the 60 range for both the TE and TM polarizations of incidence...|$|R
2500|$|Coarse {{wavelength}} division multiplexing (CWDM) {{in contrast}} to DWDM uses increased channel spacing to allow less sophisticated and thus cheaper transceiver designs. To provide 16 channels on a single fiber CWDM uses the entire frequency band spanning {{the second and third}} <b>transmission</b> <b>window</b> (1310/1550nm respectively) including both windows (minimum dispersion window and minimum attenuation window) but also the critical area where OH scattering may occur, recommending the use of OH-free silica fibers in case the wavelengths between second and third transmission windows are to be used. Avoiding this region, the channels 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61 remain and these are the most commonly used. [...] With OS2 fibers the water peak problem is overcome, and all possible 18 channels can be used.|$|E
