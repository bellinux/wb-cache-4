The goal was to ensure the future of <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> lines of Perl 5 code at thousands of companies around the world.|$|E

Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city.

The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> annual visitors to the city.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to {{establish}} the new nation's government and policies, and to aid <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> Muslim migrants who had emigrated from the new nation of India to Pakistan after independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, {{just over a year}} after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads and localities in the world are named after Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, he remains Pakistan's greatest leader.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} after the war, veterans, the {{bereaved}} {{and the rest of}} society focused, to the point of obsession, with the problem of death. There was tremendous interest in creating war memorials that celebrated the themes of glory, heroism and loss. In part, there was a rupture or dislocation with the pre-war norms of how memorials should look and feel; communities sought to find new, radical ways to mourn <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> dead, killed in an essentially modern conflict. In other ways, the building of memorials drew on traditional forms and ideas, drawing on existing religious and architectural themes to explore loss and grief.|$|E
5|$|Phil England {{writes in}} The Ecologist that the {{strength}} of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Ross Gelbspan’s The Heat is On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E
5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1895, the University of Montana {{has had a}} major impact on the {{development}} of Missoula's economy. In addition to the economic advantage from accommodating the student body, it gave the city an educated workforce not available in most of the state. The university has a close relationship with the city as Missoula's largest employer and with <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> dollars the school brings into the city through visitors of school-sponsored sporting and cultural events. The university also houses Missoula's only business incubator, the Montana Technology Enterprise Center (MonTEC), and several start-up businesses.|$|E

As of January 2012, the AirportLink track work was 100% complete, the substations have been electrified and load testing with two-car trains has commenced.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, not {{to mention}} <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E

Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> ants which eat the bait in the trap the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.|$|E

5|$|After Grant {{retired from}} the screen, he became more active in business. He {{accepted}} {{a position on the}} board of directors at Fabergé. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> his film career, a salary of a reported $15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about $50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.|$|E
5|$|As the war {{drew to a}} close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having {{believed}} {{the federal government had}} limited responsibility to <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.|$|E
