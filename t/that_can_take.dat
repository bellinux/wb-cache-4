5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> hold.|$|E
5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the area}} is now Green Belt, placing {{restrictions}} on the kinds of developments <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> place. There are areas of commercial peat extraction, but Salford City Council is seeking to return at least some back to wet mossland. Planning permission for peat extraction expired {{at the end of}} 2010. At a meeting held on 30 June 2011 Salford Council decided not to renew the permission, and on 1 August obtained a court order prohibiting any further extraction pending an appeal by the companies involved. A public inquiry concluded in 2012 supported the council's decision, and commercial peat extraction on Chat Moss ceased.|$|E

5|$|Silver has a {{brilliant}} white metallic luster <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> a high polish, {{and which is}} so characteristic that {{the name of the}} metal itself has become a colour name. Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough (around 385kJ/mol) that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the ultraviolet; hence silver is not a coloured metal. Protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450nm. At wavelengths shorter than 450nm, silver's reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310nm.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} of discovery depend {{very much on}} the level of aggressiveness of the civilization interacting with humanity, its ethics, and how much human and extraterrestrial biologies have in common. These factors will govern the quantity and type of dialogue <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> place. The question of whether contact is physical or through electromagnetic signals will also govern the magnitude of the long-term {{implications of}} contact. In the case of communication using electromagnetic signals, the long silence between the reception of one message and another would mean that the content of any message would particularly affect the consequences of contact, as would the extent of mutual comprehension.|$|E
5|$|The school {{operates}} the F.G. Walton Smith research vessel. Designed to met the school's specifications, the catamaran {{was put on}} water in 2000. It {{is equipped with a}} special sea water flow system <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater plumes of oil.|$|E

5|$|Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, {{like its}} {{predecessor}} , is a third-person shooter. Players can control each transformer in both its robot and vehicle forms. Instead {{of a traditional}} health system, the game features a system similar to the Halo series of video games. The player character has both a regenerating shield and health, the latter {{of which can be}} replenished by a health pack. The weapon selection in Fall of Cybertron is expanded, with new weapons <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> on very significant upgrades, including one that allows a weapon to fire up to 75% faster. These are purchased through Teletran 1 kiosks found throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|The JD {{program has}} both a {{traditional}} three-year, full-time curriculum or a part-time day program <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> {{a maximum of}} six years. Students' initial enrollment can only begin with the fall term each year. Through a partnership between the College of Law and Willamette's Atkinson Graduate School of Management, a joint degree program is offered to students interested in earning both a JD and an MBA concurrently. The program allows students to earn both degrees in four years instead of five years if completed separately. The business portion {{of the program is}} accredited through the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration, while the law portion, along with the entire law school, is accredited by the American Bar Association.|$|E

25|$|The Austrian Wine Marketing Board {{was created}} in 1986 as a {{response}} to the scandal, and Austria's membership of the European Union has prompted further revisions of her wine laws, notably the new DAC system of geographical appellations launched in 2002 (see Classification section below).

25|$|The {{branch of}} {{technology}} that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing {{to the field of}} bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.|$|E
25|$|In each {{reference}} frame, {{an observer}} {{can use a}} local coordinate system (most exclusively Cartesian coordinates in this context) to measure lengths, and a clock to measure time intervals. An observer is a real or imaginary entity <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> measurements, say humans, or any other living organism—or even robots and computers. An event is something that happens {{at a point in}} space at an instant of time, or more formally a point in spacetime. The transformations connect the space and time coordinates of an event as measured by an observer in each frame.|$|E
