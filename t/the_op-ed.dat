The product spin state-resolved reaction cross section and the total reaction cross section both show that the adiabatic channel is dominant in all cases, and the non-adiabatic channels have cross sections of several orders of magnitude smaller than the adiabatic channels at high collision energy. Although the cross sections caused by the intersystem crossing effects in <b>the</b> <b>O(P-</b> 3) + D- 2 reaction are larger than those in <b>the</b> <b>O(P-</b> 3) + H- 2 reaction, the differences in non-adiabaticity between these two reaction systems are quite modest.

In the present study, we {{examined the effects of}} co-transfection with a combination of <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 and <b>the</b> IGF-I gene on osteoblastic cell differentiation. The results first showed that fetal rat calvaria (FRC) cells transfected with <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 gene {{under the control of the}} cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter showed substantial production of <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 protein. Transfected FRC cells also showed a DNA concentration-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, an osteoblastic cell differentiation marker. Von Kossa-positive nodules, a hallmark of bone formation in long-term cultures of bone-derived cells, were also observed in the transfected cells after 26 days in culture, whereas none were observed in control cells. Co-transfection of FRC cells with the combination of <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 and <b>the</b> IGF-I gene resulted in a synergistic stimulation of AP activity. The increase was DNA dose-dependent. The current data show that transfection of OP- 1 gene into osteoblastic cells stimulates osteoblastic cell differentiation in vitro.

40|$|Copyright © 2004 Orthopaedic Research SocietyThe aim of {{this pilot}} {{study was to examine}} bone graft {{incorporation}} in femurs impacted with allograft bone alone (control group) or with allograft containing the bone morphogenetic protein OP- 1 (BMP- 7) (OP- 1 group) in a sheep model of cemented hemiarthroplasty. Two sheep in each group were sacrificed at 6, 18 and 26 weeks. Successful bone graft incorporation was evident in both groups by six weeks but in <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 group, there had been more extensive resorption of the graft. There was one case of excessive stem subsidence in <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 group at six weeks.

By 26 weeks, there was remodelling of bone in the graft bed. The results of this small study suggest that OP- 1 promotes initial graft resorption, thus hastening bone graft incorporation and remodelling in femoral impaction grafting.

Randomized {{efficacy}} trial comparing {{two types}} of noninstrumented posterolateral fusion between L 5 and S 1 in patients with L 5 spondylolysis and vertebral slip less than 50 %, as evaluated by radiosterometric analysis. Objective. To determine whether osteogenic protein- 1 (BMP- 7) in <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 Implant yields better stabilizing bony fusion than autograft bone. Summary of Background Data. Animal studies of osteoinductive proteins in noninstrumented posterolateral fusions have shown high fusion rates. No similar conclusive study on humans has been performed. Methods. For this study, 20 patients were randomized to fusion with either OP- 1 Implant or autograft bone from the iliac crest, 10 in each group. The patients were instructed to keep the trunk straight for 5 months after surgery {{with the aid of}} a soft lumbar brace. At surgery 0. 8 -mm metallic markers were positioned in L 5 and the sacrum, enabling radiostereometric follow-up analysis during 1 year. The three-dimensional vertebral movements, as measured by radiostereometric analysis induced by positional change from supine posture to standing and sitting, were calculated with an accuracy of 0. 5 to 0. 7 mm and 0. 5 degrees to 2. 0 degrees. Conventional radiography was added. Results. No significant difference was noted between the radiostereometric and radiographic results of fusion with <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 Implant and fusion with autograft bone. There was a significant relation between reduced vertebral movements and better bone formation. No adverse effects of <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 Implant occurred.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveAn age-related {{decline in}} {{chondrocyte}} production of osteogenic protein- 1 (OP- 1) (Bone Morphogenetic Protein- 7) {{may contribute to}} cartilage loss in osteoarthritis. This {{study was designed to}} determine if increased methylation of <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 promoter might serve as a mechanism for the age-related decline in OP- 1 expression. MethodsHuman articular chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage obtained after death from tissue donors (ages 19 – 86 years) without a known history of arthritis. DNA was obtained from isolated chondrocytes in primary culture and analyzed for OP- 1 promoter methylation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after bisulfite treatment. Cultured cells were treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5 -azacytidine and OP- 1 production was measured in the media by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RNA was isolated to measure expression of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), the IGF- 1 receptor (IGF- 1 R), aggrecan, and OP- 1 by real-time PCR. ResultsMethylation of <b>the</b> <b>OP-</b> 1 promoter was detected in chondrocytes isolated from tissue obtained from older adults and there was a positive correlation between age and OP- 1 methylation status (n= 22, R 2 = 0. 277, P= 0. 014). Inhibition of methylation in cultured cells with 5 -azacytidine increased chondrocyte production of OP- 1 protein and increased the expression of the IGF- 1, the IGF- 1 R, aggrecan, and OP- 1 genes but not GAPDH.

2500|$|In 1999, {{near the}} height of the dot com boom, The New York Times {{approached}} Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on [...] "the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity." [...] His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the 2000 US presidential campaign progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on George W. Bush's policy proposals. According to Krugman, this was partly due to [...] "the silence of the media – those 'liberal media' conservatives complain about..." [...] Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves. After Bush's election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut {{in the midst of the}} slump (which Krugman argued would do little to help the economy but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman's columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration. As Alan Blinder put it in 2002, [...] "There's been a kind of missionary quality to his writing since then ... He's trying to stop something now, using the power of the pen."
