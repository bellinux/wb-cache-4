40|$|The {{concept of}} cloud {{computing}} services is {{appealing to the}} small and medium enterprises (SMEs), {{with the opportunity to}} acquire modern information technology resources as a utility and avoid costly capital investments in technology resources. However, the adoption of the cloud computing services presents significant challenges to the SMEs. The SMEs need to determine a path <b>to</b> <b>adopting</b> the cloud computing services that would ensure their sustainable presence in the cloud computing environment. Information about approaches <b>to</b> <b>adopting</b> the cloud computing services by the SMEs is fragmented. Through an interpretive design, we suggest that the SMEs need to have a strategic and incremental intent, understand their organizational structure, understand the external factors, consider the human resource capacity, and understand the value expectations from the cloud computing services to forge a successful path <b>to</b> <b>adopting</b> the cloud computing services. These factors would contribute to a model of cloud services for SMEs...|$|R

5|$|Germanicus was a {{favorite}} of his great-uncle Augustus who for some time considered him heir to the Empire. In AD 4, persuaded by his wife Livia, Augustus decided in favor of Tiberius, his stepson from Livia's first marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero.
