5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> {{the capacity of}} individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E

25|$|Three {{kinds of}} forces operate on any bridge: the dead load, the live load, and the dynamic load. Dead load {{refers to the}} weight of the bridge itself. Like any other structure, a bridge has a {{tendency}} to collapse simply because of the gravitational forces acting on the materials of which the bridge is made. Live load refers to traffic that moves across the bridge as well as normal environmental factors such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds. Dynamic load refers to environmental factors <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> normal weather conditions, factors such as sudden gusts of wind and earthquakes. All three factors must be taken into consideration when building a bridge.|$|E

500|$|During the 20th century many politicians, such as Woodrow Wilson and Winston Churchill, {{used the}} term [...] "new world order" [...] {{to refer to a}} new period of history characterised by a {{dramatic}} change in world political thought and in the balance of power after World War I and World War II. They all saw the period as an opportunity to implement idealistic proposals for global governance in the sense of new collective efforts to address worldwide problems <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, while always respecting the right of nations to self-determination. These proposals {{led to the formation of}} international organizations (such as the UN in 1945 and NATO in 1949), and international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods system (1944-1971) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, 1947-1994)), which were calculated both to maintain a balance of power in favor of the United States and to regularize cooperation between nations, in order to achieve a peaceful phase of capitalism. These creations in particular and liberal internationalism in general, however, were regularly criticized and opposed by American [...] paleoconservative business nationalists from the 1930s on.|$|E
500|$|New Hampshire has [...] of the trail. The New Hampshire AT {{is nearly}} all within the White Mountain National Forest. For {{northbound}} thru-hikers, {{it is the}} beginning of the main challenges <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> enduring distance and time: in New Hampshire and Maine, rough or steep ground are more frequent and alpine conditions are found near summits and along ridges. The trail reaches 17 of the 48 four-thousand footers of New Hampshire, including [...] Mount Washington, the highest point of the AT north of Tennessee and most topographically prominent peak in eastern North America. The trail passes within half a mile of 7 additional 4000-footer peaks in the Whites. Entering the alpine zone on the summit of Mount Pierce, from the south, the trail continues in alpine or near-alpine scrub continuously along the high Presidential ridge until descending the southeast flank of Mount Madison into the Great Gulf Wilderness over 12 miles northward. This region is subject to extremes of weather with little natural shelter and only occasional man-made shelter from the elements. Though greatest from November to May, the threat of severe and cold conditions in the Presidentials and across the New Hampshire Section is present year-round and requires hikers' careful attention to weather forecasts and planning, provisions and gear. [...] The Dartmouth Outing Club maintains the AT from the Vermont border past Mount Moosilauke to Kinsman Notch, northwest of Woodstock, New Hampshire, Randolph Mountain Club maintains 2.2 miles from Osgood Trail near Madison Hut to Edmands Col, with the AMC maintaining the remaining miles through the state.|$|E
