50|$|<b>The</b> Native <b>Trust</b> <b>and</b> Land Act, 1936 (Act No. 18 of 1936; {{subsequently}} renamed <b>the</b> Bantu <b>Trust</b> <b>and</b> Land Act, 1936 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Development <b>Trust</b> <b>and</b> Land Act, 1936) in South Africa {{passed a}} law {{that served as the}} reorganization of its agricultural structures.

5|$|He {{also said}} that the {{situation}} had been looked at in the wrong way by police, members of parliament and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man does not need to have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{adopted a}} system of {{economic}} liberalism in Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to obtain}} <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> confidence of foreign investors, most notably the French. The advantages granted by the investment laws he established in 1959 allowed foreign business to repatriate up to 90% of their profits in their country of origin (the remaining 10% was reinvested in Côte d'Ivoire). He also developed an agenda for modernising the country's infrastructure, for example, building an American-style business district in Abidjan where five-star hotels and resorts welcomed tourists and businessmen. Côte d'Ivoire experienced economic growth of 11–12% from 1960 to 1965. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew twelvefold between 1960 and 1978, from 145 to 1,750billion CFA francs, while the trade balance continued to record a surplus.|$|E
5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co. Nominating somebody {{to receive benefits}} of a pension fund should the pensioner die is also not a valid disposition, as in Re Danish Bacon Co Ltd Staff Pension Fund, and neither is nominating a beneficiary under a life insurance policy, as in Gold v Hill. Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E

50|$|The {{ministries}} {{provided more}} detailed instructions concerning {{fulfillment of the}} assignments and passed them along to <b>the</b> <b>trusts</b> <b>and</b> enterprises. Upon receipt of their proposed tasks, individual enterprises drew up a draft plan {{with the assistance of}} their parent trust or ministry. After receiving feedback concerning the plan, the ministries consulted again with the Central Planning Commission and, assembling all the draft plans, formulated an operational plan that could achieve the central directives. The appropriate parts of the assignments were then dispatched once again to <b>the</b> <b>trusts</b> <b>and</b> enterprises. This time, their acceptance by <b>the</b> enterprises <b>and</b> <b>trusts</b> was mandatory.|$|R

5|$|A {{government}} {{white paper}} followed the Bowes Report in February 1959, recommending that an Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that {{were no longer}} able to collect enough fees from tolls to pay for their upkeep. Further reports followed, and in 1962 the Advisory Committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped, and allocated £20,000 for maintenance and £20,000 to begin restoration. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from Reading to Bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity. It was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the Kennet and Avon Canal Association. The Trust gained charitable status in April and was incorporated under the Companies Act on 6 June 1962. In 1963 the newly formed British Waterways, which was created by the Transport Act of the previous year, and replaced the British Transport Commission as the statutory body for inland waterways, took over the canal and, in partnership with <b>the</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>and</b> riparian local authorities, restoration work began.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Goldstone {{ruled that}} the government's mass sacking of 1,700 black staff at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto had been illegal. The {{following}} year, {{he was the first}} judge to free a political prisoner who had been detained under a recently imposed state of emergency under which the government had given itself draconian police powers. Another important ruling against the state in 1988 resulted in the release of a detainee who had not been advised by the police that he was entitled to a lawyer. In 1989, Goldstone became the first South African judge under apartheid to take on a black law clerk, an African-American Yale Law student named Vernon Grigg. Goldstone also used his judicial prerogatives to visit thousands of people who had been imprisoned without trial, including some who later became members of the post-apartheid South African government. Although he could do little to free them, his visits served to reassure the prisoners – and serve notice to the prison administration – that someone in a position of power was taking an active interest in their well-being. Few white judges at the time enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> respect of the black majority; Goldstone became a notable exception.|$|E
