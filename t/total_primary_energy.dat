5|$|The {{incentive}} to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, transport, or even <b>total</b> <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> supply globally, has been motivated by {{global warming and}} other ecological {{as well as economic}} concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050.

25|$|The {{primary energy}} {{consumption}} in India is the third biggest after China and USA with 5.5% global share in 2016. The <b>total</b> <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> consumption from crude oil (212.7 Mtoe; 29.38%), natural gas (45.1 Mtoe; 6.23%), coal (411.9 Mtoe; 56.90%), nuclear energy (8.6 Mtoe; 1.19%), hydro electricity (29.1 Mtoe; 4.01%) and renewable power (16.5 Mtoe; 2.28%) is 723.9 Mtoe (excluding traditional biomass use) in the calendar year 2016. In 2013, India's net imports are nearly 144.3 million tons of crude oil, 16 Mtoe of LNG and 95 Mtoe coal totalling to 255.3 Mtoe of primary energy which is equal to 42.9% of <b>total</b> <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> consumption. About 70% of India's electricity generation capacity is from fossil fuels. India is largely dependent on fossil fuel imports to meet its energy demands – by 2030, India's dependence on energy imports is expected to exceed 53% of the country's total energy consumption. In 2009-10, the country imported 159.26 million tonnes of crude oil which amounts to 80% of its domestic crude oil consumption and 31% of the country's total imports are oil imports. By the end of calendar year 2015, India has become a power surplus country with huge power generation capacity idling for want of electricity demand.

The possible nuclear power capacity beyond the year 2020 has been estimated by DAE {{is shown in the}} table. The 63 GW expected by 2032 will be achieved by setting up 16 indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR), of which ten is to be based on reprocessed uranium.

2500|$|Closely {{related to}} energy {{consumption}} {{is the concept}} of <b>total</b> <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> supply (TPES), which - on a global level - is the sum of energy production minus storage changes. Since changes of energy storage over the year are minor, TPES values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption. However, TPES ignores conversion efficiency, overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency (e.g. coal, gas and nuclear) and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms (e.g. photovoltaic or hydroelectricity). The IEA estimates that, in 2013, <b>total</b> <b>primary</b> <b>energy</b> supply (TPES) was 1.575 [...] 1017 Wh (= 157.5 PWh, 5.67 [...] 1020 joules, or 13,541 Mtoe). From 2000–2012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth. The use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth, followed by hydropower and renewable energy. Renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period. The demand for nuclear energy decreased, in part due to nuclear disasters (e.g. Three Mile Island 1979, Chernobyl 1986, and Fukushima 2011).|$|E
