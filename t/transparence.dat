The three assembly buildings adjoining it were designed by other architects; her building served as the entrance and what she called the [...] "nerve centre" [...] of the complex. As with the Phaeno Science Center, the building is hoisted above street level on leaning concrete pylons. The interior contains a series of levels and floors which seem to cascade, sheltered by tilting concrete beams and a roof supported by steel beams {{in the shape of}} an 'H'. The open interior inside was intended, she wrote, to avoid [...] "the traditional segregation of working groups" [...] and to show the [...] "global <b>transparence</b> of the internal organisation" [...] of the enterprise, and wrote that she had given particular attention to the parking lot in front of the building, with the intent, she wrote, of [...] "transforming it into a dynamic spectacle of its own." ...|$|E

International efforts, such as ratified international conventions, Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Lablling of Chemicals (GHS) and The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) are carried out to protect our environment and ourselves from chemical harm. Chemical issues are urgent and complex, which normally are related to other social-economic issues and vary in different countries. The big challenge in Asia-Pacific Region chemical management lies in (1) uneven chemical industry development demand, (2) diversification in basic realities and emphasizes in chemical managements, (3) limited time and money with massive work and heavy responsibility and (4) lack of <b>transparences</b> and information for stakeholders.

6000|$|... "What {{was your}} mother's name?" [...] Ciccio was asking her. She turned to him. He {{sat with the}} pen perched flourishingly {{at the end of}} his fingers, {{suspended}} in the serious and artistic business of filling in a form. And his face had a dark luminousness, like a dark <b>transparence</b> which was shut and has now expanded. She quivered, as if it was more than she could bear. For his face was open like a flower right to the depths of his soul, a dark, lovely translucency, vulnerable to the deep quick of his soul. The lovely, rich darkness of his southern nature, so different from her own, exposing itself now in its passional vulnerability, made her go white with a kind of fear. For an instant, her face seemed drawn and old as she looked down at him, answering his questions. Then her eyes became sightless with tears, she stooped as if to look at his writing, and quickly kissed his fingers that held the pen, there in the midst of the crowded, vulgar Consulate.|$|E
6000|$|That is {{all very}} well, except the [...] "clear" [...] part of the lake. It {{certainly}} is clearer than a great many lakes, but how dull its waters are compared with the wonderful <b>transparence</b> of Lake Tahoe! I speak of {{the north shore of}} Tahoe, where one can count the scales on a trout at a depth of a hundred and eighty feet. I have tried to get this statement off at par here, but with no success; so I have been obliged to negotiate it at fifty percent discount. At this rate I find some takers; perhaps the reader will receive it on the same terms--ninety feet instead of one hundred and eighty. But let it be remembered that those are forced terms--Sheriff's sale prices. As far as I am privately concerned, I abate not a jot of the original assertion that in those strangely magnifying waters one may count the scales on a trout (a trout of the large kind,) at a depth of a hundred and eighty feet--may see every pebble on the bottom--might even count a paper of dray-pins. People talk of the transparent waters of the Mexican Bay of Acapulco, but in my own experience I know they cannot compare with those I am speaking of. I have fished for trout, in Tahoe, and at a measured depth of eighty-four feet I have seen them put their noses to the bait and I could see their gills open and shut. I could hardly have seen the trout themselves at that distance in the open air.|$|E
6000|$|Besides [...] "Crainquebille" [...] {{this volume}} {{contains}} sixteen other stories and sketches. To define them {{it is enough}} to say that they are written in M. Anatole France's prose. One sketch entitled [...] "Riquet" [...] may be found incorporated in the volume of Monsieur Bergeret a Paris. [...] "Putois" [...] is a remarkable little tale, significant, humorous, amusing, and symbolic. It concerns the career of a man born in the utterance of a hasty and untruthful excuse made by a lady at a loss how to decline without offence a very pressing invitation to dinner from a very tyrannical aunt. This happens in a provincial town, and the lady says in effect: [...] "Impossible, my dear aunt. To-morrow I am expecting the gardener." [...] And the garden she glances at is a poor garden; it is a wild garden; its extent is insignificant and its neglect seems beyond remedy. [...] "A gardener! What for?" [...] asks the aunt. [...] "To work in the garden." [...] And the poor lady is abashed at the <b>transparence</b> of her evasion. But the lie is told, it is believed, and she sticks to it. When the masterful old aunt inquires, [...] "What is the man's name, my dear?" [...] she answers brazenly, [...] "His name is Putois." [...] "Where does he live?" [...] "Oh, I don't know; anywhere. He won't give his address. One leaves a message for him here and there." [...] "Oh! I see," [...] says the other; [...] "he is a sort of ne'er do well, an idler, a vagabond. I advise you, my dear, to be careful how you let such a creature into your grounds; but I have a large garden, and when you do not want his services I shall find him some work to do, and see he does it too. Tell your Putois to come and see me." [...] And thereupon Putois is born; he stalks abroad, invisible, upon his career of vagabondage and crime, stealing melons from gardens and tea-spoons from pantries, indulging his licentious proclivities; becoming {{the talk of the town}} and of the countryside; seen simultaneously in far-distant places; pursued by gendarmes, whose brigadier assures the uneasy householders that he [...] "knows that scamp very well, and won't be long in laying his hands upon him." [...] A detailed description of his person collected from the information furnished by various people appears in the columns of a local newspaper. Putois lives in his strength and malevolence. He lives after the manner of legendary heroes, of the gods of Olympus. He is the creation of the popular mind. There comes a time when even the innocent originator of that mysterious and potent evil-doer is induced to believe for a moment that he may have a real and tangible presence. All this is told with the wit and the art and the philosophy which is familiar to M. Anatole France's readers and admirers. For it is difficult to read M. Anatole France without admiring him. He has the princely gift of arousing a spontaneous loyalty, but with this difference, that the consent of our reason has its place by the side of our enthusiasm. He is an artist. As an artist he awakens emotion. The quality of his art remains, as an inspiration, fascinating and inscrutable; but the proceedings of his thought compel our intellectual admiration.|$|E

The analysls furnishes fout groups of coastal individuals: A Related to the structure, B. Formed by subaerial processes little changed by the sea, C. Formed under action of factors other than waves, andD. Formed by wave ation. As regional individuals were detected two types of associations: A. Connected with the structure and tectonics and B. Connected with the external geodynamics. The regional systematization gibs two tectonic styles between Mataquito River (35 °S) and Arauco (37 - 38 ° S.) : A. Oblique structure in the North, and B. Longitudinal structure in the South. The dynamic notion obtained from the images teaches: A. that the coast hasevolved with two different tectonic styles, B. that the river; sedimentation hasbeen important for rhe coastal regularization, C. that de marine sedimentation ismore important than the abrasion in these regularization, and D. that there is acombinate action berween the tectonics and the sea on the cliffs origin. Therefore, the comparative study of the multispectral camera irnaprs is agood method for regional studies. Some better bands may be sdected and complementarily used.
