40|$|Previous {{research}} has {{proposed that the}} ability to see others would benefit negotiations. We argue that this view is too narrow and that the impact of visual contact on negotiated agreements depends on the meaning individuals ascribe to either its presence or absence. Based on previous research showing that females are more likely to understand others in the presence of visual contact while males understand others better in the absence of visual contact, we explore how visual contact, eye contact, and sex affect the quality of negotiated agreements in a meta-analysis (Study 1) and a laboratory experiment (Study 2). The two studies combined show that because direct communication via the face facilitates a shared understanding for two unacquainted females, <b>their</b> <b>agreements</b> are of higher quality when they have visual contact compared to when they do not (Study 1), and if they have visual contact, <b>their</b> <b>agreements</b> are better when they have eye contact than when they do not (Study 2). Because communication via the face increases discomfort between two unacquainted males, <b>their</b> <b>agreements</b> are of higher quality when they do not have visual contact (Study 1), and if they do have visual contact, <b>their</b> <b>agreements</b> are better when they have no eye contact than when they do (Study 2).

5|$|Bergen Aviation was {{established}} in 1984. Fifty percent of Bergen Aviation was owned by the insurance company Vesta, twenty percent was owned by Vestlandreiser, and the rest was owned by various companies based in Bergen. The airline's first contract was with charter tour operator Vestlandsreiser, which was scheduled to begin on 1 May 1986. The contract was secured after Vestlandsreiser on 30 January 1986 had announced that they would terminate <b>their</b> <b>agreement</b> with Swedish airline Transwede, citing the latter's repeated delays and cancellations. The contract consisted of services from Stavanger Airport, Sola; Bergen Airport, Flesland; Haugesund Airport, Karmøy; and Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Palma de Mallorca Airport, Spain and Crete, Greece. To operate the charter routes, Bergen Aviation bought a 99-seat Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle from Hispania Líneas Aéreas in January 1986, financed with a loan from Nevi.|$|E

This would have required some changes to the classification, which was under copyright.

Dewey did not agree, however, to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification, considering that a violation of <b>their</b> <b>agreement,</b> as well as a violation of Dewey's copyright. Shortly after Dewey's death in 1931, however, an agreement was reached between the committee overseeing the development of the Decimal Classification and the developers of the French Classification Decimal.

Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage despite Kepler's nobility; though he had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on Mysterium, but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication.

Pinafore in London, but it was not as popular as the D'Oyly Carte production and soon closed. Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan. From 1 August 1879, the new company, later called the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, became the sole authorised producer of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan.|$|E
