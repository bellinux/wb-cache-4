50|$|Hundreds {{of protesters}} {{gathered}} in Harare on 3 August 2016, marching against {{the introduction of}} <b>bond</b> <b>notes,</b> {{with the aim of}} submitting a petition to the Ministry of Finance and Parliament. The protest was sanctioned by the courts, and the first petition rejecting <b>bond</b> <b>notes</b> was successfully delivered to the ministry. However, as protesters headed to Parliament to deliver a second petition, police chased and beat some of them using baton sticks and water canons, leading to dispersion of the crowd. One BBC journalist was also beaten up by police in the scuffle and had his video camera broken.

2500|$|The {{mutilation}} of Kelly's corpse {{was by far}} {{the most}} extensive of any of the Whitechapel murders, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Dr. Thomas Bond and Dr. George Bagster Phillips examined the body. Phillips and Bond timed her death to about 12 hours before the examination. Phillips suggested that the extensive mutilations would have taken two hours to perform, and <b>Bond</b> <b>noted</b> that rigor mortis set in as they were examining the body, indicating that death occurred between 2 and 8:00a.m. <b>Bond's</b> <b>notes</b> read: ...|$|R

The Cooperative Farm Credit System has become a major supplier of credit to agricul-ture. On January 1, 1980, the 37 banks of the System collectively extended in excess of $ 48 billion to agriculture. This entailed 36 per-cent of all farm real estate debt and 25 per-cent of all farm nonreal estate debt. The System obtains funds for loans from the na-tional money market by issuing system-wide consolidated <b>bonds</b> and discount <b>notes.</b> The interest cost on <b>bonds</b> and <b>notes</b> depends upon market interest rates which have been very volatile in recent years and are not controllable by the System [Bildersee]. In order to obtain sufficient funds, the System must be willing to offer investors competitive rates. Although cost control is imperative in all segments of the System's operations, it is especially important in the funds acquisition process since interest paid on System debt securities typically accounts for over 90 per...|$|R
