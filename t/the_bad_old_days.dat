Tutu stated that the Guantanamo camp was a stain on the character of the United States, while the legislation in Britain which gave a 28-day detention period for terror suspects was [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "untenable". Tutu claimed that arguments being made in Britain and the United States were similar to those the South African apartheid regime had used. [...] "It is disgraceful and one cannot find strong enough words to condemn what Britain and the United States and some of their allies have accepted," [...] said Tutu. Tutu also spoke against Tony Blair's failed attempt to hold terrorist suspects in Britain for up to 90 days without charge. [...] "Ninety days for a South African is an awful déjà-vu because we had in South Africa in <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> a 90-day detention law," [...] he said. Under apartheid, as at Guantanamo, people were held for [...] "unconscionably long periods" [...] and then released, he said.|$|E

Besides, old Soap-Suds was sick enough at not getting his peerage last year; he'd sack me by wire if I lost him it with such lunacy as this. And what about Duffey? He's doing us some rattling articles on [...] "The Heel of the Norman." [...] And how can he write about Normans if the man's only a solicitor? Do be reasonable.--Yours, E. NUTT.|$|E

But all that's over long ago, thank goodness. He's a Christian now, of course, like all the rest of them; a very respectable old fellow in his way, with a keen eye of his own to business, and a thorough comprehension of the state of the sugar market. He keeps a good house. You've fallen on your feet, I can tell you, for Hawaii, if you've got an invitation to stop for an indefinite time as a guest at Kalaua's." ...|$|E
