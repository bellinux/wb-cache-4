25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was one of}} four joint Australian-NEI squadrons formed {{during the}} war, and emerged from two separate transport flights formed in September 1944 by the ML-KNIL in Australia. These flights were NEI <b>Transport</b> <b>Section,</b> Brisbane (NEI-TSB), which was based at RAAF Archerfield, near Brisbane and equipped with three Lockheed Lodestars and five North American B-25 Mitchells, and NEI <b>Transport</b> <b>Section,</b> Melbourne (NEI-TSM), which operated nine Lodestars and several Mitchells, and was based at Melbourne. These units transported personnel and material to No. 18 (NEI) Squadron, a joint Australian-NEI bomber squadron based at RAAF Batchelor, Northern Territory, and No. 120 (NEI) Squadron, a fighter unit in Merauke (later in Biak), West Papua.|$|E

25|$|The {{operation}} {{began in}} April 1942, after the Japanese blocked the Burma Road, and continued daily to August 1945, when the effort began to scale down. It procured {{most of its}} officers, men, and equipment from the AAF, augmented by British, British-Indian Army, Commonwealth forces, Burmese labor gangs and an air <b>transport</b> <b>section</b> of the Chinese National Aviation Corporation (CNAC).

25|$|With an {{authorised}} {{strength of}} 17 officers and 256 other ranks, the 1st Independent Company {{was composed of}} a company headquarters consisting of 13 personnel, three 60-man platoons named A, B and C, each of three 19-man sections numbered in series from 1 to 9, plus an engineer section of 21 men, a 34-man signals section, a medical section of six men and a <b>transport</b> <b>section</b> with four men. The company was commanded by a major, with a captain as a second-in-command. Each platoon was also commanded by a captain, while all sections except the medical and transport sections were commanded by lieutenants. The medical section was commanded by a captain.|$|E
25|$|Thomson {{also said}} that while she was working at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney during World War II, she had owned {{a copy of the}} Rubaiyat. In 1945, at the Clifton Gardens Hotel in Sydney, she had given it to an army {{lieutenant}} named Alf Boxall, who was serving at the time in the Water <b>Transport</b> <b>Section</b> of the Royal Australian Engineers. Thomson told police that, after the war ended, she had moved to Melbourne and married. She said that she had received a letter from Boxall and had replied, telling him that she was now married. (Subsequent research suggests that her future husband, Prosper Thomson, {{was in the process of}} obtaining a divorce from his first wife in 1949, and that he did not marry Jessica Harkness until mid-1950.) There is no evidence that Boxall had any contact with Harkness after 1945.|$|E

25|$|Following Britain's {{entry into}} the First World War on 4 August 1914, Rippon was {{commissioned}} into the horse <b>transport</b> <b>section</b> of the Army Service Corps as a second lieutenant. He was badly wounded during the Gallipoli Campaign, which he had joined on 5 November 1915. As {{a result of his}} wounds he was discharged with the Silver War Badge and the honorary rank of lieutenant. On 10 October 1918 he managed to obtain a new commission as a second lieutenant in the Administrative Branch of the fledgling Royal Air Force and was based in Edmonton, London. Despite his wartime injuries, he appeared fairly regularly for Somerset again in 1919. Against Essex at Leyton, he and Sydney put on 144 for the first Somerset wicket, and Dudley went on to score 134, his highest first-class score. But after this season, he made just one further first-class appearance, in the 1920 season, his wounds finally taking their toll. His brother continued to play occasional matches for Somerset through to 1937. After his retirement from first-class cricket, Rippon became cricket correspondent for the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News and Daily Chronicle.|$|E

After the beginning of the bombardment, Nürnberg entered Tagga Bay with the II <b>Transport</b> <b>Section</b> and began landing troops, while Königsberg covered the landing of the I <b>Transport</b> <b>Section.</b> On 1819 October, the rest of the II Scouting Group covered minesweepers operating off the island of Dagö, but due to insufficient minesweepers and bad weather, the operation was postponed. On the 19th, Nürnberg, , and [...] were sent to intercept two Russian torpedo boats reported to be in the area. Reuter could not locate the vessels, and broke off the operation. By 20 October, the islands were under German control and the Russian naval forces had either been destroyed or forced to withdraw.

500|$|Born in Queensland to a farming family, Towner {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force in 1915.

He then {{transferred}} to the 2nd Machine Gun Battalion where he was commissioned as a lieutenant and twice mentioned in despatches for his leadership. During June 1918, Towner led a machine gun section in attack near Morlancourt and assisted the infantry in reaching its objectives under heavy fire, for which he was awarded the Military Cross. In September, again commanding a machine gun section, he was involved in the Allied counteroffensive that broke the German lines at Mont St. Quentin and Péronne. Fighting for thirty hours after being wounded, his [...] "conspicuous bravery, initiative and devotion to duty" [...] earned him the Victoria Cross, which was presented by King George V in April 1919.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{computing}} homogenized assembly neutron <b>transport</b> cross <b>sections</b> and diffusion coefficients {{that is both}} rigorous and computationally efficient is proposed in this paper.
