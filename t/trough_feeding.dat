40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses large-scale {{trends in}} composition, density, taxonomic and functional diversity in deep-sea benthic polychaete {{communities in the}} Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The study includes samples from two major sampling programs: the Deep Gulf of Mexico Benthos (DGoMB) program (2000 ? 2002) (51 stations, 200 - 3700 m) and the SIGSBEE program (Universidad Nacional Aut?noma de M?xico), 2008 - 2010 (27 stations on the Sigsbee Abyssal Plain). Polychaete density decreased exponentially with depth. Alpha diversity did not show a mid-depth maximum and reached its peak near the Mississippi <b>trough.</b> <b>Feeding</b> guild diversity was also highest in the Mississippi trough. The environmental parameters that determine diversity and density of polychaete assemblages and species distribution ranges were examined. Depth, export flux of particulate organic carbon (POC), percent sand and silt were the best predictors of heterogeneity of polychaetes in the GoM. We performed an ecological niche modeling analysis (ENM) based on ?presence-only? data of four cosmopolitan species belonging to the Cirratulidae and Spionidae in the GoM. The GoM, being a semi-enclosed ocean basin, offers complex topographic features and hydrographic processes. Comparisons of the overall polychaete diversity and richness patterns from this study for this region indicate a strong geographic variation with increasing depth and distance from the shore. Additionally, the environmental gradients observed {{play a major role}} in shaping the spatial distribution of polychaete communities in this region...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a cross-sectional study in buffaloes of district Toba Tek Singh from April, 2009 to March, 2010 which aimed to identify prevalent species of Eimeria (E) and risk {{factors associated with}} subclinical coccidiosis. Overall prevalence of Eimeria in buffaloes was 49. 6 %. Six species of Eimeria were identified in total infected buffaloes. E. bovis was the commonest one among the species identified during survey followed in order by E. zuernii, E. canadensis, E. ellipsoidalis, E. alabamensis and E. cylindrica. Peak prevalence was observed in August. Wet season was found favorable for Eimeria. Odds of finding oocysts were higher in young stock and females (P< 0. 05) as compared to those of adults and males respectively. Among management and husbandry practices, five variables were found significantly associated with status. These included housing system, feeding system, watering system, floor type and herd size. Open housing system, <b>trough</b> <b>feeding,</b> tap watering, partially cemented floor type and smaller herds showed protective effect against coccidiosis with Odds of detection being higher in closed housing system, ground feeding, pond watering, non-cemented floor type and larger herd size, respectively. Body condition and breed of buffaloes were not found associated with prevalence of Eimeria. Value of feeding in troughs, provision of clean tap water, cementing floor of farms in reducing the extent of infection should be communicated to farmers. Appropriate monitoring {{and control of the}} disease is advisable...|$|E
40|$|This study loolcs at {{demersal}} fish food web interactions {{present at the}} Rockall Trough. Rockall Trough lies within Ices division V. This area is highly exploited {{by a number of}} mixed deep-water fisheries. Despite this there has been a lag in management of the area and an overall lack of knowledge of food web interactions. From examining previous literature and carrying out stable isotope analysis on a number of species, it became clear that there is a strong link between the {{demersal fish}} population and surface production. Pervious studies have suggested there to be two main sources of food to the demersal fish fauna. The first is via the exploitation of pelagic species on the slops exploitation of mesopelagic and benthopelagic prey species that overlap in depth range, or/and that carry out vertical /horizontal migrations. Carcase falls also fall within this first source of food to the deep-sea as they are a direct link to the surface. The second source of food is that of endemic benthic prey species, which appears to be less prominent in the fishes diet. A large number of demersal fish are seen to feed on a combination of these sources of food. Stable isotope analysis, appear to confirm the strong link between surface production and demersal fish as many fish are found with low SN 15 levels normally associated with feeding on pelagic species. The removal of commercial mesopelagic species found to be important prey species to the demersal fish fauna, can have serious implications to the demersal food web and ultimately the management of deep-sea stocks. Issues relating to lack of a holistic approach in management and pollution concerns are mentioned. Keywords: U.

40|$|Post weaning {{diarrhoea}} {{is a common}} problem in pig production. The causes are multifactorial, but most often associated with infection of pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli in the small intestine. The aim of these studies was to investigate some of the physiological and managemental factors involved at weaning. The lectin phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) {{is known for its}} growth promoting properties from studies on suckling rats and pigs. The hypothesis was that enteral exposure would induce precocious maturation, leading to a gastrointestinal (GI) tract better prepared for weaning. PHA-treated pigs grew slower during the treatment week before weaning, and in one of the two studies presented here; the PHA-treated pigs had a higher body weight (BW) gain than the control pigs in the week immediately following weaning. PHA treatment resulted in lower diarrhoea scores, a more beneficial feeding pattern and a tendency to greater feed intake. Effects on physiological parameters were shown, with a lower uptake of marker molecules, and a more adult disaccharidase pattern in PHA-treated pigs. No differences were found regarding immunological status, weight and length of the intestinal organs, the pancreatic enzyme activities or feed conversion ratio. It was investigated how pigs of different relative size (small, medium and large) in a group of 10 pigs were affected by receiving feed from a feed dispenser with 2 feeding places per pen, or from a trough where all pigs could eat at the same time. Also, comparisons were made between keeping pigs as unmixed litters staying in their farrowing pen after weaning, or mixing and moving them to a new pen on the day of weaning. <b>Trough</b> <b>feeding</b> resulted in lower diarrhoea scores for the small and large pigs, and higher scores for the medium pigs. All size categories had longer feeding bouts when fed at a trough, and longer total feeding times on day 1 (small pigs) and 5 (large pigs) after weaning. The feed conversion ratio was lower during the second week after weaning for the pigs fed from feed dispensers. The mixing and moving procedure resulted in lower BW gain compared to that of pigs weaned as whole litters, which was most pronounced in small pigs. Mixed and moved pigs also had lower feed intakes and higher diarrhoea scores (small and large pigs) ...|$|E
40|$|In general, {{problems}} such as lameness, claw injuries and claw infections very commonly occur in sow housing, and are a primary cause of culling, especially among young animals. The culling of young animals is a large economic burden in pig production, and therefore it is of great importance to try to reduce problems related to claw health. In addition, claw injuries also lead to {{a significant amount of}} suffering for the animals, which is not in accordance with good animal welfare. Previous studies have shown an increased prevalence of claw health problems in housing systems where limited amounts of straw are given, and where there are slatted floors in the dung area of the pens. These conditions must be taken into consideration, since these pen types will soon be the most prevalent in modern Swedish pig production. In this study, the importance of straw for the occurrence of claw injuries, sow activity, pen hygiene, and animal well-being was studied in the pen system described above. All studies were carried out on gestating sows housed in dry sow pens of the type ‚Äù 2 rooms‚Äù (Figure 1), with liquid feed, <b>trough</b> <b>feeding</b> with trough dividers, and without being locked in during feeding times. A total of 24 pens were studied in three trials. In half of the studied dry sow pens (12 control pens, or 4 pens per trial), a small amount of straw was given (approx 200 g per sow per day), whereas {{the other half of the}} pens (12 study pens, or 4 pens per trial) received a larger amount of straw (approx 1000 g per sow per day). The straw was given after the morning feeding. The claw health of the animals was documented using claw studies carried out when they first entered the pen, and when they left the gestation unit. A total of 99 sows were examined in this study. For these studies, the sow was placed in a sow cradle (Figure 2) where the legs could be lifted individually, cleaned with a brush, water, and claw knife, and the claws examined. The observations were carried out using the same method and according to the same protocol as previously described. At the same time as the claw studies, observations were made of scratches/injuries and bites on the examined sows. In addition, the eating order of the sows was noted at three different times during their stay in the gestation unit. The sow that first left the trough at feeding times was given an eating order point of 1 (short time at the trough), while the sow that stayed the longest at the trough was given an eating order point of 3 (long time at the trough). The sows were also videotaped for 24 h to determine their activity and location in the pen. In addition, 2 h manual behaviour studies were carried out at times during their stay in these pens. In these studies, the presence of stereotypies in the group was especially noted (‚Äúchewing/biting the bars‚Äù, ‚Äúchewing saliva‚Äù, ‚Äúrolling the tongue‚Äù, and ‚Äúlicking the floor‚Äù). Hygiene level and cleanliness of the pens were evaluated using hygiene studies. Each pen was divided into 8 areas (Figure 3), and an evaluation of the amount of moisture and dirtiness were carried out using two parallel 3 -point scales. The results of the claw studies (combining all the claw injuries), bites and scratches, and the 24 -h studies of animal activity, were analysed statistically using the GLM procedure in SAS. The occurrence of claw injuries was analysed using a statistical model containing the following factors: amount of straw bedding, litter number, trial number, injuries, and eating order points at feeding. In the statistical model for the analysis of the sow activity/location during the entire day, the factors amount of straw and litter number were used. The amount of straw was the factor in the model for bites and scratches. For the other observations (occurrence of stereotypies, and the pen cleanliness studies, only the frequency and the mean were calculated. The claw studies showed the occurrence of 6 types of injuries: cracks in the claw wall, overgrown heel, white line injuries, injury to the border of the heel/toe, or toe injuries. Certain injury types occurred more often together with other types of injuries than others did. In Table 1, the significant correlations between the different injuries at entering the gestation unit are shown, and in Table 2 the significant correlations when leaving the unit. Cracks in the claw wall and white line injuries, and heel injuries and overgrown heels, respectively, appeared to occur at the same time. The statistical analyses were carried out on both the total material (that is, all sows) and on a portion of the material, consisting of those sows missing or which had minor wounds upon entering the gestation unit. The analyses of the total material (Table 3, Figure 5) showed that the older sows (litter number > 4) incurred significantly fewer claw injuries during gestation than the young animals did) In general, no other factor in the model was significant. However, it was noted that the sows having serious claw injuries already upon entering the unit did not tend to show an increase in these injuries as much as sows having no or light injuries upon entering did (Table 3, Figure 6). In pens with the larger straw ration, a nominally lower increase in the number of injuries on the sows was found in comparison to those occurring on sows housed in pens with the lower straw ration. This was true for all types of injuries (Figure 4). The results of the statistical analyses for sows with no or light injuries are presented in Table 4. When the animals with the more serious injuries were not included in the analyses, the effect of the amount of straw present was greatly increased, although not enough to reach significance, whereas the p-value for litter number increased somewhat. The incidence of bites and scratches generally decreased to some extent during the stay in the gestation unit (Table 5). This decrease was greatest on animals in the pens with the larger straw ration, but the difference in comparison with animals in the lower straw ration was not significant. The presence of a larger straw ration also appeared to have reduced the occurrence of stereotypies (Table 8) among the sows. The sows given the larger straw ration were observed to be lying down somewhat more in the dung area (Table 6), especially the older animals (Table 7). An interpretation of this result could be that the floor heated lying area with the larger amounts of straw at times was ‚Äútoo warm‚Äù for the sows. Generally, no differences in activity between the two groups of animals could be detected (Tables 6, 7). The effect of the amount of straw on pen moisture and cleanliness is given in Figures 7 and 8. The lying area was observed to be somewhat less damp and cleaner in pens given the larger straw ration. On the other hand, the larger amounts of straw were more difficult to press down through the slatted flooring, and as a result the pens were wetter and less clean in the dung area. In summary, the studies showed that the size of the straw bedding ration clearly had a positive effect on the prevalence of claw injuries, and that the use of plenty of straw bedding was also of importance for the welfare of the sows. The results of the studies are interpreted so that it should be possible to reduce the problem with claw injuries, which is often seen in pens with slatted floors and relatively small areas for the animal, by increasing the amount of the straw bedding. This method is also considered to be a better way of preventing problems with claw injuries than by replacing the slatted flooring in those types of pens (that is, in gestation pens for well-established sow groups) with solid flooring. In previous studies, changing the slatted floors to solid floors in gestation pens for dry sows did not show any large effect on claw health. The comparison and evaluation of housing systems is often difficult to carry out, because various factors must be considered at the same time to obtain an evaluation of the entire system. In this type of evaluation, it is common that the different parameters considered have different ‚Äúweights‚Äù or importance. For example, often building costs are more important for the producer‚Äôs choice of housing system than what the system can mean for animal health and welfare, for animal handling, the working environment, the effect on the environment, etc. Different producers also have different considerations depending upon economics, their interests, and their viewpoints with respect to production and the future. Irrespective of what weight is put on the parameter animal health and welfare, it can, however, be proven that in the long-term viewpoint these factors are of great importance for production economy. A low incidence of disease and durable animals are important ingredients for a strongly competitive and enduring production. This study has shown that an abundant straw ration, as a specific factor, appears to be of great importance in ameliorating some of the animal health and welfare problems which can occur in some types of intensive housing systems. In general, the study also showed that perhaps it is not sufficient to indicate that the animal should have access to straw as a bedding material. The amount of straw available is also important and must therefore be more precisely defined...|$|E
40|$|Under some {{circumstances}} {{it may be}} desirable to repel herbivorous pests (e. g. goats and wallabies) from plants (e. g. horticultural or forestry seedlings) rather than to kill them. These circumstances may include using these animals as a resource at a later time, and {{there may also be}} welfare, public perception or legislative issues where repelling animals from particular plants or area is preferable to killing them. The first experiment tested the efficacy of 5 different materials (tiger fecal extract, maggot brew-the liquid exudate from a flyblown goat, capsaicin, dog urine, and burnt goat hair, skin and carcass+fat) to repel groups of goats in a feedlot pen from 1 <b>trough</b> of <b>feed</b> when another <b>trough</b> of <b>feed</b> was available to them to eat. Each repellent was tested on 5 groups of mixed age female goats for periods of 3 days. All 5 groups were exposed to the 5 repellents. Both tiger fecal extract and maggot brew reduced intake of feed from the 2 ÃÜ 7 protected 2 ÃÜ 7 <b>feed</b> <b>trough</b> and significantly (P < 0. 05) delayed 2 ÃÜ 7 normal 2 ÃÜ 7 feeding behaviour by more than 5 h from that trough. The repellents became less effective with repeated use even with different groups of goats. The reduction in effectiveness was indicated by higher intakes of feed and earlier feeding from the protected trough. This habituation to the repellents, where the effectiveness is reduced with repeated exposure, is of concern. In the second experiment, we selected the most effective repellent (tiger fecal extract) and tested its efficacy under similar conditions, after the repellent had been mixed with a carrier (bentonite) in an endeavour to increase the duration of its effectiveness. This repellent was significantly more effective in repelling groups of 3 goats in a feedlot pen from 1 <b>trough</b> of <b>feed</b> for 3 days, when another <b>trough</b> of <b>feed</b> was available to them to eat...|$|R

40|$|Classical scrapie is an {{environmentally}} transmissible prion disease of sheep and goats. Prions can persist and remain potentially infectious {{in the environment}} {{for many years and}} thus pose a risk of infecting animals after re-stocking. In vitro studies using serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) have suggested that objects on a scrapie- affected sheep farm could contribute to disease transmission. This in vivo study aimed to determine the role of field furniture (water <b>troughs,</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>troughs,</b> fencing, and other objects that sheep may rub against) used by a scrapie-infected sheep flock as a vector for disease transmission to scrapie-free lambs with the prion protein genotype VRQ/VRQ, which is associated with high susceptibility to classical scrapie. When the field furniture was placed in clean accommodation, sheep became infected when exposed to either a water trough (four out of five) or to objects used for rubbing (four out of seven). This field furniture had been used by the scrapie-infected flock 8 weeks earlier and had previously been shown to harbor scrapie prions by sPMCA. Sheep also became infected (20 out of 23) through exposure to contaminated field furniture placed within pasture not used by scrapie-infected sheep for 40 months, even though swabs from this furniture tested negative by PMCA. This infection rate decreased (1 out of 12) on the same paddock after replacement with clean field furniture. Twelve grazing sheep exposed to field furniture not in contact with scrapie-infected sheep for 18 months remained scrapie free. The findings of this study highlight the role of field furniture used by scrapie-infected sheep to act as a reservoir for disease re-introduction although infectivity declines considerably if the field furniture has not been in contact with scrapie-infected sheep for several months. PMCA may not be as sensitive as VRQ/VRQ sheep to test for environmental contamination...|$|R

50|$|The present Church {{building}} was opened on 26 October 1821, the cost ¬£2,270! The spire of the Church {{was struck by}} lightning and completely destroyed on 23 July 1876. The only material link we have with the old church is the old sandstone baptismal font. It was lost {{for a number of}} years, found in a pigsty, where it was being used as a <b>feeding</b> <b>trough,</b> cleaned and rededicated. It is still used for baptisms today.|$|R

The staff may have included the unguent preparer Ramose known from two letters that place in Meritaten's household. To the south of the throne-room are further servant quarters. On one side of the open center is and area that was used to house animals. The mangers were decorated with images of cattle, ibexes and antelopes. The structure featured limestone <b>feeding</b> <b>troughs</b> and mangers combined with tethering stones.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse over time the evolution of E. coli O 157 :H 7 faecal shedding in a dairy herd producing raw milk for direct human consumption. The study was performed between October 2012 and September 2013 in an average size Italian dairy farm where animals are housed inside the barn all over the year. The farm housed about 140 animals during the study ‚Äì 70 cows and 70 calves and heifers. Twenty-six animals were randomly selected from both the cows and young animals group, and faecal sampling was performed rectally six times two months apart in each animal. Eleven animals were culled during the study and a total of 285 faecal samples were collected. At each faecal sampling, three trough water samples and two <b>trough</b> <b>feed</b> samples were also collected for a total of 36 water samples and 24 feed samples. Samples were analysed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and culture. Overall, 16 (5. 6 %) faecal samples were positive for E. coli O 157 by RT-PCR. Cultural examination found 9 (3. 1 %) samples positive for E. coli O 157; all the isolates were positive for stx 1, stx 2 and eae genes. One (4. 1 %) feed sample was positive for E. coli O 157 by RT-PCR; none of the water samples was positive for E. coli O 157. The model highlighted a general significant reduction of the number of positive samples observed during the study from the first to the sixth sampling (P= 0. 000) and a positive relation between the presence of positive samples and average environmental temperature (P= 0. 003). The results of the study showed that in an Italian dairy farm housing animals all year, faecal shedding of E. coli O 157 followed the same temporal trend reported for other types of farming. The enhanced faecal shedding during warmer months may have a significant impact on environmental contamination and the safety of raw milk and its byproducts...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} aims {{to highlight the}} main welfare problems of dairy cattle farms in Alto Adige (North Eastern Italy) by means of animal based indicators. The relationship between animal based and resource based (housing and management) indicators were investigated {{in order to obtain}} useful information for improving welfare levels in mountain husbandry systems. We highlighted some welfare problems, especially in tie-stalls, mainly related to stall and <b>feed</b> <b>trough</b> dimensions and design; however, in these situations good stockmenship seems to be able to compensate for structural lacks...|$|R
50|$|This barn was {{probably}} built around 1886. Originally, it had unpainted clapboard siding {{with a metal}} roof. In its early days, the barn housed mules used on the cotton farm. The top floors of the barns were used for storing hay. In the early 1940s, a new section was added for the farm's cattle. Some mule stalls were replaced with <b>feeding</b> <b>troughs.</b> In 1968, the siding was replaced with flush poplar boards, which were painted red. In the early 1990s, the roof was coated with tar.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} was to explore {{the possibility of using}} free choice feeding technique under different cage density for unselected native chicken. Eighty hens of laying Wareng chicken were divided into two feeding systems. Half of them were fed complete commercial diet of 17 % crude protein, with 2800 kcal ME/kg and the other half were subjected to free choice diet. The diets were in mash form and placed in sufficient <b>feed</b> <b>troughs</b> in front of each cage. Each cage was occupied by four or six hens. Free choice feeding hens were served with commercial concentrate (30 % crude protein), ground corn and oyster shell, placed separately in <b>feed</b> <b>troughs.</b> Observation was carried out during 24 weeks laying period, starting from 20 to 44 weeks of age. The results showed that egg production (9. 35 % hen day), and the intake of feed (42. 74 g/day), protein (7. 01 g/day), energy (116. 6 kcal ME/day), calcium (1. 99 g/day and phosphorus (0. 22 g/day) were not affected (P> 0. 05) by feeding system nor by cage density. The results however indicated that free choice feeding technique provided sufficient nutrients in supporting maximum egg production of unselected native chicken...|$|R
40|$|The junior {{livestock}} {{program is}} {{a unique opportunity to}} use live animals to help youth develop. Youth learn something about agriculture and livestock production and develop an appreciation for the livestock industry. However, the main objectives are to teach life skills and help youth become productive citizens. The experience of youth owning and working with animals, being responsible for their care, health, and growth, and exhibiting them in a competitive environment is a tremendous character building process. Junior livestock projects help develop life skills such as; leadership, communication, decision making and problem solving skills. Character building, record keeping and the development of personal responsibility are other skills youth can develop {{as a result of their}} involvement in the broad range of programs in junior livestock. <b>FEED</b> <b>TROUGH</b> OPTIONS There are several ways to feed a project lamb that can aid in the development of leg and loin muscle. Feeding off the ground will keep lambs from stepping in the <b>feed</b> and <b>feed</b> <b>troughs</b> can be easily cleaned and will be comfortable for the lamb to eat out of. Feeding on the ground may cause lambs to show a break behind the shoulders. Use the feeding method you feel will be the best for your program...|$|R
