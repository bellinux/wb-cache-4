500|$|... "Sun of a Gun" [...] is a synth-pop and Europop {{song that}} lasts three minutes and twenty-five seconds. It is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of E minor using common time with a tempo of 133 beats per minute. It was written by Jimmy Harry and Nanna Øland Fabricius, while Dave McCracken served as the song's executive producer. The song was written while Oh Land was in Los Angeles. Lyrically, the song depicts a relationship by comparing it to the earth's orbit. In an interview with MTV News, Oh Land described its lyrics: [...] "It's a love story about being {{in a relationship with}} a person who's kind of destructive, but you keep coming back because you can't let it go". She further confirmed [...] "that it was also a metaphor for how we orbit around the sun". The singer ended with: [...] "The sun is a really beautiful thing: a sunset, a sunrise is spectacular. But it's also something we need <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>ourselves</b> against, because it can burn you and it can be dangerous." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first issue}} was {{published}} October 10, 1835, {{days after the}} Texas Revolution began. [...] By this time, the owners had changed the name to Telegraph and Texas Register. [...] In an editorial, the owners explained that the paper's original name had been chosen when [...] "the engrossing object was the accumulating of wealth and consequent aggrandizement of the country. [...] Since that time affairs have assumed an entirely different aspect, and the all-absorbing question is how <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>ourselves,</b> and what we already possess." [...] The newspaper was therefore renamed to reflect their new goal of serving as [...] "a faithful register of passing events".|$|E

[...] At least {{four of the}} rescuers' emergency oxygen packs were not functioning. [...] "I shared my rescuer with Jerry Groves, while Toler, Jesse Jones and Tom Anderson sought help from others. There were not enough rescuers to go around." [...] Because of the bad air, they [...] "had to abandon our escape attempt {{and return to the}} coal rib, where we hung a curtain to try <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>ourselves.</b> The curtain created an enclosed area of about 35 feet." ...|$|E

40|$|In my thesis, I argue (1) that Kant’s pragmatical {{anthropology}} and empirical psychology can {{provide us with}} an explanation why people are susceptible to manipulation. I show that people’s susceptibility to manipulation {{can be explained by}} some defects in cognition and volition, namely prejudices, passions and affects. From a Kantian perspective, the manipulative techniques are efficient because they are essentially interwoven with the underlying principles of social order. I also argue (2) that Kant’s maxims of common understanding can help us <b>to</b> partially <b>protect</b> <b>ourselves</b> from the deteriorating effects of manipulation by establishing personal autonomy. I show that the adoption of the maxims of common understanding involves a very sophisticated thought experiment which helps us fight with prejudices and calm our affects and passions. My project can be summed up as the reconstruction of Kant’s theory of manipulation...|$|R
2500|$|On December 4, Lincoln {{met with}} Alexander Galt, the Canadian Minister of Finance. [...] Lincoln {{told him that}} he had no desire for {{troubles}} with England or any unfriendly designs toward Canada. When Galt asked specifically about the Trent incident, Lincoln replied, [...] "Oh, that'll be got along with." [...] Galt forwarded his account of the meeting to Lyons who forwarded it to Russell. [...] Galt wrote that, despite Lincoln's assurances, [...] "I cannot, however, divest my mind of the impression that the policy of the American Govt is so subject to popular impulses, that no assurance can be or ought to be relied on under present circumstances." [...] Lincoln's annual message to Congress did not touch directly on the Trent affair but, relying on estimates from Secretary of War Simon Cameron that the U.S. could field a 3,000,000 man army, stated that he could [...] "show the world, that while engaged in quelling disturbances at home we are able <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>ourselves</b> from abroad." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 272, Bu Chan, the {{military}} commander stationed at Xiling (西陵), started a rebellion against Wu {{and sent a}} messenger to the Jin dynasty to express his wish to defect to Jin. When Lu Kang received news of the revolt, he immediately gave orders to his subordinates Zuo Yi (左奕), Wu Yan (吾彥), Cai Gong (蔡貢) and others to lead separate forces and head towards Xiling via shortcuts. He instructed his men to construct defensive structures {{all the way from}} Chixi (赤谿) to Gushi (故市) so as to form an encirclement around Bu Chan's position, {{while at the same time}} defending the area from attacks by Jin forces. He ordered them to work day and night to complete the construction works as if the enemy had already arrived, and his soldiers were all tired and worn out. Lu Kang's subordinates said, [...] "With our current strength, we can attack Bu Chan and destroy him before Jin forces arrive. Why are we exhausting ourselves by constructing defensive structures instead?" [...] Lu Kang replied, [...] "Xiling's fortifications are very stable and it has sufficient supplies. Besides, I was the one who oversaw the construction of Xiling's defences. If we attack it now, I don't think we can conquer it easily. If Jin forces show up and we don't have adequate defensive structures, we'll be trapped in between Bu Chan and Jin and have nothing <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>ourselves</b> from the enemy." [...] The officers repeatedly urged Lu Kang to attack Xiling but Lu refused. Eventually, Lei Tan (雷譚), the Administrator (太守) of Yidu (宜都), came to see Lu Kang and used kind words to persuade him to attack Xiling. To prove that he was right, Lu Kang relented and ordered an assault on Xiling. As he expected, they did not succeed in capturing the city, so his officers gave up their idea of attacking and complied with Lu Kang's orders to construct the defensive structures.|$|E

6000|$|Our other chief trouble {{came from}} the lions, whereof there were great numbers in this veld. The {{prevalence}} of these hungry beasts forced us to watch our cattle very closely while they grazed, and at night, wherever it was possible, <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> them and <b>ourselves</b> in [...] "bombast," [...] or fences of thorns, within which we lit fires to scare away wild beasts. Notwithstanding these precautions, we lost several of the oxen, and ourselves had some narrow escapes.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Ligotti draws {{attention}} to the similarity between Zapffe's philosophy and terror management theory. Terror management theory argues that humans are equipped with unique cognitive abilities beyond what is necessary for survival, which includes symbolic thinking, extensive self-consciousness, and perception of themselves as temporal beings aware of the finitude of their existence. The desire to live alongside our awareness of the inevitability of death triggers terror in us. Opposition to this fear is among our primary motivations. To escape it, we build defensive structures around ourselves to ensure our symbolic or literal immortality, to feel like a valuable member of a meaningful universe, and <b>to</b> focus on <b>protecting</b> <b>ourselves</b> from immediate external threats.|$|R
40|$|People {{involved}} in chemotherapy need to offer certain safely standard treatment. On the other hand, {{we understand the}} risk of the anticancer agent enough, and it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> us <b>ourselves</b> from occupational exposure. It was intended to visualize the polluted situation by an anticancer agent. We made the inspection model to observe the exposure situation of anticancer agent. We set 3 scenes afterwards to observe the exposure situation. The scenes were changing the bottle to another bottle, removing the needle and connecting to the portable continuous infusion pump. Pollution was confirmed to a needle {{at the time of the}} substitution, the rubber stopper part of the bottle, an adhesive plaster of a pinprick site. As for us, there was the need to avoid the removing and inserting of the needle that pricked into the anticancer agent bottle to lower {{the risk of the}} exposure. Furthermore, we need to perform saline washing of the drip system before removing the needle. So we should replace the anticancer agent route into a saline solution. In addition, the ICG reagent is a clinical medicine used on the site widely and can expect wide application in future...|$|R

40|$|As {{most people}} have heard by now, the {{powerful}} and poorly regulated gas-drilling industry has placed the natural gas in the shale under New York State squarely in its crosshairs. The {{tens of thousands of}} unconventional gas wells planned for the Southern Tier will dramatically transform our landscape— bringing the greatest change since the original forests were cut. Gas drilling will touch every aspect of our lives—from our food, water, health, and safety, to our property values, taxes, and local economy, and to the relationships between neighbors. If we can better understand the risks involved, we can work to help mitigate or perhaps prevent the damage and <b>to</b> better <b>protect</b> <b>ourselves</b> and our communities. Although this article focuses on the Marcellus shale, most of the information also applies to other shale layers, such as the Utica. Drilling in the Marcellus Shale: The Finger Lakes Region sits above the Marcellus shale, a rock layer that underlies Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Eastern Ohio, and the Southern Tier and Catskill regions of New York 1; it lies 1, 500 to 3, 000 feet deep in Tompkins County. 2 It is thought to contain the third largest natural gas deposit in the world—the biggest in the US—worth around a trillion dollars. 3 Because gas in the Marcellus shale is dispersed throughout the rock, it is costly and difficult to extract. But new procedures have made it...|$|R
40|$|Often we see {{examples}} of what makes a great leader, yet overlook examples of dark leaders. This thesis explores how dark leaders don’t necessarily draw in blind followers, but rather abuse their power {{in order to build}} their vision. In my study of Jonestown I show that followers were genuine in their feelings about Jones as a person and the Peoples Temple’s mission. They should not be dismissed just because they “drank the Kool-Aid. ” This thesis explores and evaluates various religious studies theories and their interpretation of the events, popular perceptions, and personal statements from the deceased or surviving members. I conclude that Jones was a revolutionary leader during his time. He tried to achieve equality in the U. S. on multiple platforms, but was ultimately too attracted by power and control. In the end, this matters because given the state of the world today and the rise of dark leaders both through political offices, terrorist groups and other places, {{we need to have a}} way <b>to</b> not only <b>protect</b> <b>ourselves</b> from joining them, but also preventing them...|$|R

40|$|The {{possible}} use of biological weapons {{has become a}} reality. In {{the face of the}} character and the organizational transformation of the phenomenon of terrorism and the incidents related to terrorist attacks today, the interest of specialists, politicians, general public and of course also mass media in the threat of bioterrorism and the posibility of misuse of mass destruction weapons is getting stronger. A biological attack means an intentional use of vital microorganisms or their toxic products to cause a disease and death in people, animals and plants. This is a very broad issue, that is why this work is focused especially on a short summary of main aspects of the problem, with emphasis on readiness of the integrated rescue system for extraordinary incident, eventually on a crisis situation, that could come {{as a consequence of the}} use of biological weapons. The methods of a biological attack and its main characteristics. The general public must be better informed about the possibilities of ultraterrorist attacks and must be prepared for the possible reaction in case of these attacks. Growing awareness would probably significantly contribute to the elimination of losses in the case of use of these biological weapons by terrorists. It is necessary to focus on the citizens´ preparation regarding existing threats of terrorist attacks, inform them how to identify symptoms of attacks with weapons of mass destruction and how <b>to</b> adequately <b>protect</b> <b>ourselves</b> against them. A rank of proceedings exists for the protection of citizens, such as sufficient amount of protective masks, means for decontamination, a complete programme for mass vaccination, a broader and deeper planning of processes for extraordinary situations, as well as information about emmergency escape shelters etc. ...|$|R
