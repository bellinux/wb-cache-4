40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{is being}} increasingly adopted in various domains for providing on-demand infrastructure and Software {{as a service}} (SaaS) by leveraging the utility computing model and virtualization technologies. One of the domains, where cloud computing is expected to gain huge traction is Global Software Development (GSD) that {{has emerged as a}} popular software development model. Despite several promised benefits, GSD is characterized by not only technical issues but also the complexities associated with its processes. One of the key challenges of GSD is to provide appropriate tools more efficiently and cost-effectively. Moreover, variations in tools available/used by different GSD team members can also pose challenges. We assert that providing <b>Tools</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Service</b> (TaaS) to GSD teams through a cloud-based infrastructure can be a promising solution to address the tools related challenges in GSD projects. Through an extensive review of the relevant literature on GSD and Cloud Computing, we have identified a set of quality attributes and potential architectural solutions for a cloud-based infrastructure that can provide TaaS to GSD teams. This paper outlines the promised benefits of TaaS to GSD teams, describes the expected quality attributes of a cloud-based infrastructure and how these quality attributes can be achieved. We also present a reference architecture for a cloud-based infrastructure to provide TaaS in GSD projects and describe its use with a detailed scenario of GSD projects.

This often {{implies the}} flexible reaction to changing requirements, impacting the adaption effort for the IPS 2 provider. Additionally the modelling of individual business processes for the IPS 2 delivery imposes {{a challenge to}} the provider. A great variety of process types, ranging from production to maintenance process, has to be covered in order to ensure a smooth and economically feasible IPS 2 operation. Therefore, an approach for the modelling and automation of IPS 2 delivery processes is of specific interest. In this paper an IPS 2 automation approach will be presented that allows the modelling and deployment of the specific business processes and enables the integration of service shares into the automation solution of the product share. The presented approach allows for an easy adaption of the product share configuration. To achieve this goal, a workflow management system represents the backbone of all customer provider relationships that distributes the tasks and responsibilities to the IPS 2 network partners according to the IPS 2 business model. For machine-oriented service shares the workflow management system interacts with an implemented Java-based software agent system by means of web services. Lastly, an application example of a prototypical IPS 2 in the micro production domain will be given.

The presented framework emphasizes on keeping the conceptual meta-model of the domain under investigation at the core of SRA design strategy and use it as a guiding tool for design, evaluation, implementation and evolution of the SRA. The framework also emphasizes to consider the nature of the tools to be provisioned and underlying cloud platforms to be used while designing SRA. The framework recommends adoption of the multi-faceted approach for evaluation of SRA and quantifiable measurement scheme to evaluate quality of the SRA.

40|$|Despite the {{security}} community’s best effort, {{the number of}} serious vulnerabilities discovered in software is increasing rapidly. In theory, security audits should find and remove the vulnerabilities before the code ever gets deployed. How-ever, due to the enormous amount of code being produced, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> the lack of manpower and expertise, not all code is sufficiently audited. Thus, many vulnerabilities slip into production systems. A best-practice approach {{is to use a}} code metric analysis <b>tool,</b> such <b>as</b> Flawfinder, to flag poten-tially dangerous code so that it can receive special attention. However, because these tools have a very high false-positive rate, the manual effort needed to find vulnerabilities remains overwhelming. In this paper, we present a new method of finding poten-tially dangerous code in code repositories with a significantly lower false-positive rate than comparable systems. We com-bine code-metric analysis with metadata gathered from code repositories to help code review teams prioritize their work. The paper makes three contributions.

The concept of Safety Case has been evolving for over 20 years. World famous scientists such as Peter Bishop, Tim Kelly, J Górski and others made a great impact on the concept and its implementation.

However, future research is still needed to develop the approach further on and make it even more useful, accurate, efficient, and of course, automated. In this paper we introduce a concept of Safety Case Core, which can be considered one of the Safety Case methods. We also discuss an approach to assessing security characteristics of OTS components.

In this paper, we present SyLVaaS, a Web-based <b>tool</b> enabling Verification <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Service</b> (VaaS). SyLVaaS implements an assume-guarantee approach to the verification problem outlined above. SyLVaaS takes <b>as</b> input <b>a</b> high-level model defining the SUV operational environment and computes, using parallel algorithms deployed in a cluster infrastructure, a set of highly optimised simulation campaigns, which can be executed in an embarrassingly parallel fashion {{on a set of}} Simulink instances, using a platform independent Simulink driver downloadable from the SyLVaaS Web site. As the actual simulation is carried out at the user premises (e. g., in a private cluster), SyLVaaS allows full Intellectual Property protection on the SUV model and the user verification flow. The simulation campaigns computed by SyLVaaS randomise the verification order of operational scenarios and this enables, at anytime during the parallel simulation activity, the estimation of the completion time and the computation of an upper bound to the Omission Probability, i. e., the probability that there is a yet-to-be-simulated operational scenario which violates the property under verification. This information supports graceful degradation in the verification activity. We show effectiveness of the SyLVaaS algorithms and infras-tructure by evaluating the system on industry-scale input related to the verification of the Fuel Control System (FCS) model in the Simulink distribution.

40|$|Abstract Background Evolutionary processes, such as {{gene family}} {{evolution}} or parasite-host co-speciation, {{can often be}} viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tree evolving inside another tree. Relating two given trees under such a constraint is known as reconciling them. Adequate software tools for generating illustrations of tree reconciliations are instrumental for presenting and communicating results and ideas regarding these phenomena. Available visualization tools have been limited to illustrations of the most parsimonious reconciliation. However, there exists a plethora of biologically relevant non-parsimonious reconciliations. Illustrations of these general reconciliations may not be achieved without manual editing. Results We have developed a new reconciliation viewer, primetv. It is a simple and compact visualization program {{that is the first}} automatic tool for illustrating general tree reconciliations. It reads reconciled trees in an extended Newick format and outputs them as tree-within-tree illustrations in a range of graphic formats. Output attributes, such as colors and layout, can easily be adjusted by the user. To enhance the construction of input to primetv, two helper programs, readReconciliation and reconcile, accompany primetv. Detailed examples of all programs' usage are provided in the text. For the casual user a web-service provides a simple user interface to all programs. Conclusion With primetv, the first visualization tool for general reconciliations, illustrations of trees-within-trees are easy to produce. Because it clarifies and accentuates an underlying structure in a reconciled tree, e. g., the impact of a species tree on a gene-family phylogeny, it will enhance scientific presentations as well as pedagogic illustrations in an educational setting. primetv is available at [URL], both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> standalone command-line <b>tool</b> and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> web <b>service.</b> The software is distributed under the GNU General Public License. </p...|$|R
