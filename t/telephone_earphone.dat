50|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, several subtle prerequisites {{are necessary for}} operation. The strength of the magnetic field of the permanent magnets at the iron band must be of the same order of magnitude as {{the strength of the}} field generated by the radio frequency excitation coil, allowing the radio frequency signal to exceed the threshold hysteresis (coercivity) of the iron. Also, the impedance of the tuner that supplies the radio signal must be low to match the low impedance of the excitation coil, requiring special tuner design considerations. The impedance of the <b>telephone</b> <b>earphone</b> must roughly match the impedance of the audio pickup coil, which is a few hundred ohms. The iron band moves a few millimeters per second. The magnetic detector was much more sensitive than the coherers commonly in use at the time, although not as sensitive as the Fleming valve, which began to replace it around 1912.|$|E
40|$|Increasingly, a {{huge amount}} of {{statistics}} have been gathered which clearly indicates that income and wealth distributions in various countries or societies follow a robust pattern, close to the Gibbs distribution of energy in an ideal gas in equilibrium. However, it also deviates in the low income and more significantly for the high income ranges. Application of physics models provides illuminating ideas and understanding, complementing the observations. Copyright EDP Sciences/Societ√† Italiana di Fisica/Springer-Verlag 200789. 20.

5000|$|The {{radio signal}} from the antenna (A) is {{received}} by a tuner (not shown) and passed through the excitation coil C, {{the other end of}} which is connected to ground (E). [...] The rapidly reversing magnetic field from the coil exceeds the coercivity Hc and cancels the hysteresis of the iron, causing the magnetization change to suddenly move up the wire to the center, between the magnets, where the field reverses. [...] This had an effect similar to thrusting a magnet into the coil, causing the magnetic flux through the pickup coil D to change, inducing a current pulse in the pickup coil. The audio pickup coil is connected to a <b>telephone</b> receiver (<b>earphone)</b> (T) which converts the current pulse to sound.|$|R
50|$|The first moving iron transducer, the <b>telephone</b> {{receiver}} or <b>earphone,</b> evolved {{with the}} first telephone systems in the 1870s. Moving iron horn loudspeakers developed from earphones after the first amplifying device which could drive a speaker, the triode vacuum tube, was perfected around 1913. They were used in radio receivers and the first public address systems. Moving iron cone loudspeakers appeared around 1920. Around 1930 they were replaced by the moving coil cone loudspeaker developed in 1925 by Edward Kellogg and Chester Rice. Today the moving iron driver mechanism is still used in some earphones.|$|R
2500|$|Home {{installations}} normally {{consisted of}} two <b>earphone</b> <b>telephone</b> receivers, connected to long, flexible wires. A subscriber could listen using both earphones, or, alternately, two persons could listen by each using a single earphone. A loud buzzer, strong enough to be heard throughout a room even when the subscriber's receivers were not currently being listened to, was used {{to draw attention to}} important announcements. The American author Thomas Denison, who visited Budapest in 1901, found that transmission of spoken news was [...] "highly satisfactory", but the audio quality for musical programmes, whether vocal or instrumental, [...] "still leaves something to be desired".|$|R
2500|$|Unlike other {{microphone}} types, {{the carbon}} microphone {{can also be}} used as a type of amplifier, using a small amount of sound energy to control a larger amount of electrical energy. Carbon microphones found use as early telephone repeaters, making long distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tubes. These repeaters worked by mechanically coupling a magnetic telephone receiver to a carbon microphone: the faint signal from the receiver was transferred to the microphone, where it modulated a stronger electric current, producing a stronger electrical signal to send down the line. One illustration of this amplifier effect was the oscillation caused by feedback, resulting in an audible squeal from the old [...] "candlestick" [...] <b>telephone</b> if its <b>earphone</b> was placed near the carbon microphone.|$|R
