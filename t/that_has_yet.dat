5|$|Three star {{systems have}} been {{discovered}} to have exoplanets. HD 111232 is a yellow main sequence star around 78% as massive as the Sun around 95light-years distant. It has a planet (HD 111232 b) around 6.8times the mass of Jupiter that has an orbital period of around 1143 days. HD 112410 is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located around 439light-years distant. With around 1.54times the mass of our Sun, it is cooling and expanding along the red giant branch, having left the main sequence after exhausting its core supply of hydrogen fuel. It has a substellar companion calculated to have a mass 9.2times that of Jupiter and an orbital period of 124.6days {{at a distance of}} approximately 0.57 AU.
