50|$|The first {{generation}} Solaris Urbino 18 was produced {{from the second}} half of 1999.

The first Solaris Urbino 18 bus unit went to PKA Gdynia in 1999, it was also the only new low-floor articulated bus bought in 1999 by transport companies in Poland. Initially, the 18-metre buses did not sell well because the transportation companies preferred smaller and cheaper 15-metre vehicles. The bus market expanded between 1996-2002, which resulted in the later increase in demand for 18-metre buses. In <b>total,</b> cities in <b>Poland</b> bought 12 units of the Solaris Urbino 18 First Generation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Behaviour of larvae, juveniles {{and adults}} of Dreissena polymorpha in the {{presence}} of the conspecifics was investigated in field and laboratory experiments. Mussel recruitment was studied in plastic chambers con-taining living conspecifics, their empty shells or calcareous, mussel-sized stones. The objects were glued to the chamber bottom and covered by nylon mesh. The experiment was carried out in the channel connecting the Port Zimowy harbour with the Vistula River (Toruñ, <b>Poland).</b> <b>Total</b> mussel densities in the above treatments were the same as in the empty chambers. However, the distribution of the new settlers depended on the qual-ity of the glued objects, with the vicinity of living mussels and empty shells being preferred to stones. This sug-gests that mussels responded to conspecifics after settling on substrate. Migration of juvenile and adult mus-sels {{in the presence}} of the same stimuli was then studied in a laboratory experiment. Both groups preferred the vicinity of living conspecifics, but any kind of the firmly attached objects decreased the number of individ-uals leaving the substrate, compared to the flat surfaces...|$|R
