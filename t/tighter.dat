5|$|The {{different}} stages of core-collapse may be divided into three phases. During a globular cluster's adolescence, the process of core-collapse begins with stars near the core.

30|$|In this article, <b>tight</b> {{oil and gas}} {{accumulation}} {{refers to}} that occurring in low-permeability reservoirs that are not source rocks or shale, which primarily includes petroleum accumulations in <b>tight</b> sandstone and <b>tight</b> carbonate reservoirs. Accordingly, such reservoirs are known as <b>tight</b> reservoirs. Two models were proposed to interpret hydrocarbon accumulations in such <b>tight</b> reservoirs as <b>tight</b> sandstones, which are: (1) the deep-basin or basin-centered gas model, {{also known as the}} continuous accumulation model; and (2) the conventional trap-controlled accumulation model. Recently, Zhao et al. (2012 a, 2013, 2016 a) proposed a new model termed quasi-continuous accumulation and demonstrated that <b>tight</b> oil and gas are dominated by quasi-continuous accumulation, while discontinuous (conventional trap-controlled) accumulations are of subordinate importance. Zhao et al. (2016 a) also argued that the so-called continuous (basin-centered) accumulations actually do not exist in non-source-rock <b>tight</b> reservoirs such as <b>tight</b> sandstones. Hence, two types of hydrocarbon accumulations can be caused in <b>tight</b> petroleum systems, namely the quasi-continuous accumulation and discontinuous accumulation.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tight</b> geodesics were {{introduced}} by Masur-Minsky in [17]. They and their hierarchies {{have been a}} powerful tool {{in the study of}} the curve complex, mapping class groups, Teichmüller spaces, and hyperbolic 3 -manifolds. In the same paper, they showed that there are at least one and at most finitely many <b>tight</b> geodesics between any two vertices in the curve complex. Bowditch found a uniform finiteness property on <b>tight</b> geodesics [9], and this property has given further important applications in some of the above studies. In this paper, we introduce classes of geodesics which are not <b>tight</b> but still have the uniform finiteness property. These classes of geodesics will be obtained as examples of weak <b>tight</b> geodesics which {{were introduced}} and shown to have the property in [19]. The aim of this paper is to study about weak <b>tight</b> geodesics focusing on giving examples of them with canonical constructions and investigating gaps between two classes of them. Our main investigation will be on weak <b>tight</b> geodesics contained in the class of M-weakly <b>tight</b> geodesics where M is the bound given by the bounded geodesic image theorem. As M-weakly <b>tight</b> geodesics contain <b>tight</b> geodesics, the classes of weak <b>tight</b> geodesics to be introduced in this paper will live around <b>tight</b> geodesics. In appendices, we expand some of these studies to outside of the class of M-weakly <b>tight</b> geodesics...|$|R

5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to <b>tighter</b> tolerances.|$|E
