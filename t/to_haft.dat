[...] "I cannot but remember that I owed you my life last night, both for unclasping that accursed steel doublet, and helping me through the other scrape, which was worse, for yonder Boar and his brood look more like devils than men.

6000|$|In {{the days}} when Eudena and Ugh-lomi fled from the people of Uya towards the fir-clad {{mountains}} of the Weald, across the forests of sweet chestnut and the grass-clad chalkland, and hid themselves at last in the gorge of the river between the chalk cliffs, men were few and their squatting-places far between. The nearest men to them were those of the tribe, a full day's journey down the river, and up the mountains there were none. Man was indeed a newcomer {{to this part of}} the world in that ancient time, coming slowly along the rivers, generation after generation, from one squatting-place to another, from the south-westward. And the animals that held the land, the hippopotamus and rhinoceros of the river valleys, the horses of the grass plains, the deer and swine of the woods, the grey apes in the branches, the cattle of the uplands, feared him but little--let alone the mammoths in the mountains and the elephants that came through the land in the summer-time out of the south. For why should they fear him, with but the rough, chipped flints that he had not learnt <b>to</b> <b>haft</b> and which he threw but ill, and the poor spear of sharpened wood, as all the weapons he had against hoof and horn, tooth and claw? ...|$|E

5|$|Hafted {{tools are}} further {{representative}} of human innovation. The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex tools are better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent {{a new level of}} innovation in their increased efficacy and more complex manufacturing process. The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes <b>to</b> <b>hafts</b> demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used <b>to</b> construct <b>hafted</b> tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|R

50|$|Delbo greatly {{influenced}} {{the work of}} Cynthia Haft who is originally from Brooklyn, New York, but currently lives in Jerusalem. Haft met Delbo in New York while Haft was in her teens and their friendship, first one of mentor and student, grew and lasted throughout Delbo's life. In addition to translating some of Delbo's works, Haft introduced Lamont to Delbo while Haft was writing her Ph.D. dissertation at the City University of New York and Lamont was one of Haft's readers. Delbo's work has been very influential already {{for a number of}} other scholars in addition <b>to</b> <b>Haft</b> and Lamot, such as Lawrence L. Langer, Nicole Thatcher, Geoffrey Hartman, Marlene Heinemann, Robert Skloot, Kali Tal, Erin Mae Clark, Joan M. Ringelheim, Debarati Sanyal, and many others. Feminists are showing an increasing interest in her work, though Delbo did not identify herself as a feminist.|$|E
50|$|Garric and Tenoctris {{take the}} army <b>to</b> <b>Haft</b> {{where they have}} reports that an army of Rat men are advancing. Garric leaves control {{of the city in}} the hands of Sharina as his regent. Upon {{arriving}} in Haft Garric is met by his father Reise, who urges him to return to Barca's Hamlet and visit his mother. The Army moves to Barca's Hamlet and Garric visits his mother, assuring her that despite the lack of blood relationship she is still the only mother he has ever known. We next find Garric on the march, his troops run into a foraging party of the rat men, Garric rides out to meet them with a squadron of cavalry and a regiment of infantry. In the course of the brief battle Garric discovers that the scent of the Rat men causes horses to either run in fear, or attack in a fit of rage. Garric is almost killed {{in the course of the}} battle but is saved by a platoon of infantrymen. Garric orders the recovery of some of the bodies and brings one to Tenoctris, who upon examining the corpse discovers how they are made. She informs Garric that the rats are created by stealing the souls of the dead, and putting them in the bodies of rats. She also informs him that they must venture into a different plane of existence to find Lord Munn and ask him to close the Ivory Gate, through which the souls of the dead are being stolen. Guided by a boatman, they come to a temple and awaken Lord Munn, who then closes the Ivory Gate, halting the creation of further rat legions. Returning to their own world, Garric and Tenoctris battle the legions of the Emperor and defeat them.|$|E

50|$|The axe {{head was}} {{made out of}} either bronze or copper {{and it was then}} fitted on <b>to</b> the <b>haft</b> using tangs.

With the Bardiche the head of the axe is usually affixed <b>to</b> the <b>haft</b> near the middle or bottom, however in almost all versions of the epsilon axe the blade is attached at three different points: top, middle, bottom. These tangs would be wedged into the grooves of the heft. Then they would be lashed down to ensure a sturdy fit.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{attributes}} observed {{on a number}} of quartz tools from Pleistocene deposits in Sierra de Capivara (Piauí, Brazil) are described. These attributes or traces are mainly notches, retouching and fractures on non-active parts of the tools which were possibly made in order <b>to</b> <b>haft</b> those implements in some way. These morphological alterations and other probable microscopic traces are identified and described as hafting wear and are compared with the traces attributed {{to the use of the}} tools in other productive tasks.

40|$|Experimental flintknappers {{have shown}} that it was {{possible}} for prehistoric hunters to repair basally damaged dart points by retouching the base to a different shape. Because dart points were highly curated tools and often manufactured of non-local, high utility toolstones, the lack of evidence in the archaeological record for basal retouch of one type into another is perplexing. We develop and test a hypothesis for the resistance of retouched bases to typological change, using a set of projectile point assemblages from northeastern Nevada. It is possible that the necessity of refitting repaired points to a limited supply of pre-prepared dart foreshafts constrained the retouch of broken points. If repair of a broken point required a hunter to modify its hafting element beyond limits feasible for reattaching it onto the foreshafts in hand, it was more economical for the hunter to simply replace the broken point. If so, such constraints <b>to</b> <b>haft</b> repair have implications for understanding why dart point base styles are spatially and temporally patterned...|$|E
50|$|The {{points are}} bifacially worked {{and have a}} symmetrical, leaf-like shape with a concave base and wide, shallow grooves running almost {{the entire length of}} the point. The edges are finely worked. The {{characteristic}} groove, known as fluting, may have served <b>to</b> aid <b>hafting</b> <b>to</b> a wooden shaft or dart. Use-wear studies have shown that some examples were used as knives as well as projectile points. The fluting required great technical ability to effect, and it took archaeologists many years of experimentation to replicate it.|$|R

5000|$|Clovis {{points are}} {{characterized}} by concave longitudinal shallow grooves called [...] "flutes" [...] on both faces one third or more up from the base to the pointed tip; The grooves may have permitted the points <b>to</b> be fastened (<b>hafted)</b> <b>to</b> wooden spears, dart shafts or foreshafts (of wood, bone, etc.) {{that would have been}} socketed onto the tip end of a spear or dart. Clovis points could also have been hafted as knives whose handles also served as removable foreshafts of a spear or dart. (This hypothesis is partly based on analogy with aboriginal harpoons that had tethered foreshafts Cotter 1937). There are numerous examples of post-Clovis era points that were <b>hafted</b> <b>to</b> foreshafts, but there is no direct evidence that Clovis people used this type of technological system.|$|R
50|$|In the 13th century, {{variants}} on the Danish axe are seen.

50|$|Macrobotanical remains show us {{that the}} non-urban farmers {{cultivated}} domestic plants such as beans, maize, squash, sweet potatoes, peanuts, chili pepper, gourd, algorrobo and cotton. Storage facilities “revealed pollen spores from the fern and monocot families. These types of plants were likely used for medicinal purposes and/or as animal fodder”. The paleobotanical collection also has several wild species {{that could have been}} used for “fuel, building materials, animal fodder, medicine, and herbs”.Several types of lithic artifacts were discovered in and around Pampa Grande. The stone adzes, which were bifacially flaked with appendages in order <b>to</b> be <b>hafted</b> <b>to</b> wooden handles, were used for tilling and harvesting. Batáns, large grinding stones, and manos, which were smaller hand-held grinding stones, were found in most every household. (Johnson, 2010: 119-120) In addition, scarce amounts of copper were found.
