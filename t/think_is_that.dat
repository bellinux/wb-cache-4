500|$|Rodin's {{talent for}} surface {{modeling}} {{allowed him to}} let {{every part of the}} body speak for the whole. The male's passion in The Thinker is suggested by the grip of his toes on the rock, the rigidness of his back, and the differentiation of his hands. Speaking of The Thinker, Rodin illuminated his aesthetic: [...] "What makes my Thinker <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he thinks not only with his brain, with his knitted brow, his distended nostrils and compressed lips, but with every muscle of his arms, back, and legs, with his clenched fist and gripping toes." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift did {{not want}} any misconceptions of Beautiful Eyes as her second album and {{therefore}} partnered with the American retail company Wal-Mart to make the EP an exclusive release. The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. The last thing I want any of you to <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we are putting out too many releases." ...|$|E
500|$|Danny Boyle, the film's director, {{speaking}} on the creative liberties he took with portraying Steve Jobs said, [...] " [...] was what Shakespeare used to do. He would {{take some of the}} facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it. And that's what's wonderful about the writing I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt. But in the end, he brings it back to a very simple father-daughter relationship that he has to admit that he has made {{some of the most beautiful}} things in the world." ...|$|E

500|$|While Glee also {{features}} Chenoweth's former Wicked co-star Idina Menzel as recurring character Shelby Corcoran, the producers {{declined to give}} the two scenes together, explaining that the series is story-driven, and as re-uniting the two on-screen did not work for storytelling purposes, it was deemed unnecessary. Of Chenoweth's future with Glee beyond [...] "Home", Falchuk commented that the producers want to [...] "have her around as much as possible", and although no plans have been solidified, she may return in the second season. He expanded: [...] " [...] you have talents like that, it's very hard to not want them back. The one advantage we have, I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{we have so many}} incredibly talented people in our … cast that … we don't need [...] as much. But there are certain very special people that, of course, you'd always be interested in." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the first episode was not favourable; in The Independent, Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen. He wrote of the six main characters, [...] "Are we supposed to care about these people? The theory, I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we should relate to them, because their lives are as prosaic as our own, and because Cold Feet is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties. This {{is another way of}} saying the writer hasn't bothered with research or imagination." [...] He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes. On The Late Review, Germaine Greer and Tony Parsons singled out Nesbitt's acting; Greer called him [...] "especially awful" [...] and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the scissor lift Adam appears on {{at the beginning of the}} episode. General reaction improved as the first year went on. At the conclusion of the first series, Andrew Billen compared it with Vanity Fair in the Evening Standard and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the [...] "forgotten" [...] twentysomethings. Paul Hoggart for The Times wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing and looked forward to how Rachel's pregnancy plot would be resolved in the second series.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the storyline {{which saw}} Kyla's Alcoholics Anonymous {{companion}} Stuart McElroy (Conor Mullen) violently attack her colleague, Ward Sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), Ayola has stated: [...] "It makes her finally accept what Stuart was capable of. She sees this huge gash and feels that all her instincts {{about other people}} are wrong – so she ends up running off. [...] has no excuses – all she can <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she’s really messed up and needs to leave." [...] This plot strand saw Kyla once more resort to drinking while at work, and decide to quit her job, only to be talked out of doing so by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell). [...] Ayola explained: [...] "He suggests she takes a demotion, so she’ll have less to worry about and more {{time to deal with}} her problems. It's the lifeline she needs, because her work is all she has right now. I think if Kyla did leave, she’d end up simply going home and buying loads of cheap booze." [...] When asked if Kyla would be able to overcome her addiction and regain custody of her son, Ayola responded: [...] "I hope so. Kyla's had trouble being a good parent to Max, but she's had lots of time to reflect on why this is." ...|$|E

5000|$|Howard Schmidt, an American {{cybersecurity}} expert, {{argued in}} March 2010 <b>that</b> [...] "there <b>is</b> no cyberwar...

2500|$|On the January 2, 2007, {{broadcast}} of The 700 Club, Robertson said that God {{spoke to him}} and told him that [...] "mass killings" [...] were to come during 2007, due to a terrorist attack on the United States. He added, [...] "The Lord didn't say nuclear. But I do believe it will be something like that." [...] When a terrorist attack failed to happen in 2007, Robertson said, in January 2008, [...] "All I can <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> somehow the people of God prayed and God in his mercy spared us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senior Human Rights Watch adviser Alison Des Forges {{said the}} lack of legal {{representation}} was a serious concern. [...] "The authorities' view {{is that this is}} a quasi-customary kind of procedure, and there never used to be lawyers, so there's no need for lawyers now. The problem with that is that little is the same except for the name. In this system, there is considerable weight given to the official side. The office of the prosecutor provides considerable assistance to the bench [...] in terms of making its determination, so you no longer have a level playing field." [...] There may, however, be no alternative to the Gacaca trials, she added. [...] "Obviously the problem of delivering justice after the genocide is an overwhelming problem. Gacaca may not be ideal but there is at this point no alternative.... The official explanation I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people did not speak openly until the Gacaca process and now many more accusations are surfacing. Also, the concession program, which requires the naming of all those who participated along with the accused , has led to a multiplication of names. [...] "How many of these are well-founded, what is the credibility of the evidence, these are very serious concerns." ...|$|E

60|$|It must, I <b>think,</b> <b>be</b> {{acknowledged}} <b>that</b> Mr Maguire <b>was</b> true to himself, and <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> conducting {{his case}} {{at any rate}} with courage.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is easily}} asserted, Violet; but it would, I <b>think,</b> <b>be</b> better <b>that</b> {{you should take}} my part than my father's, if it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> you intend to be my wife." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose he}} has done {{anything}} very much," [...] Arnold replied, cheerfully. [...] "What I really <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he has got mixed up {{with some of these}} anarchists, writing for this wretched paper, and they have probably let him in for some of their troubles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, now, Miss Jessie, that's not a fair {{way to put}} it. I have {{no doubt}} that I shall be able enough--thanks to the good Lord who has spared me--but what I <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Yarmouth, {{pleasant}} though it be, is not exactly what I want just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "I didn't <b>think.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> better?" [...] He {{turned the}} light from her face. Something in his voice and the apologetic haste with which he moved the torch seemed to relax the strain of the situation. The feeling of stunned {{surprise}} began to leave her. She found herself thinking coherently again.|$|E
5000|$|... "Look, you {{definitely}} {{have the talent}} to do something. I think you {{got to figure out}} exactly what <b>that</b> something <b>is</b> gonna be. It's not gonna be what you were before with New Boyz, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>is</b> gonna <b>be</b> <b>that</b> busking with a guitar." [...] - Paul Moss ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shhh!" [...] said Carol, quite automatically. She tiptoed in to pat the pillow. As she {{returned}} to Erik she had a friendly sense of his waiting for her. They smiled at each other. She {{did not think of}} Kennicott, the baby's father. What she did <b>think</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> some one rather like Erik, an older and surer Erik, ought to be Hugh's father. The three of them would play--incredible imaginative games.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, it does. Some {{things are}} wrong anywhere; {{but there are}} other things which people <b>think</b> <b>are</b> wrong <b>that</b> <b>are</b> only unusual," [...] she answered, and he knew she knew what he meant.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Nuttie,' she said, rousing herself, 'what I do <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{will all}} {{probably}} turn out exactly contrariwise to our imaginations, so I believe it would be wisest to build up as few fancies as possible, but only to pray {{that you may have}} a right judgment in all things, and have strength to do what is right, whatever you may see that to be.' ...|$|E
60|$|We cannot help {{remarking}} {{here that}} Cook {{was to be}} blamed for permitting the natives to treat him {{with a degree of}} ceremonious solemnity which was obviously meant as an act of worship. The only thing that can be said in his defence, we <b>think,</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> in a region where many remarkable, and to him incomprehensible, customs prevailed, he could not certainly assure himself that the people were not paying to him the ordinary homage which they were accustomed to pay to every great chief who visited their island.|$|E
6000|$|They {{agreed not}} to talk of her father with Adeline, but she began it herself. She looked very old and frail, as she sat nervously rocking herself {{in a corner of}} the cottage parlor, and her voice had a sharp, anxious note. [...] "What I <b>think</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> now we know father is alive, we oughtn't to do {{anything}} about the property without hearing from him. It stands to reason, don't you think it does, Mr. Hilary, that he would know better than anybody else, what we ought to do. Any rate, I think we ought to wait and consult with him about it, and see what he says. The property belonged to mother in the first place, and he mightn't like to have us part with it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness: [...] "We're {{proud of}} our achievement, I <b>think</b> it <b>is</b> {{remarkable}} <b>that</b> we managed against all odds, when people told us it couldn't be done to achieve this {{in the interests of}} those vulnerable people. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> something to be proud of." ...|$|R

30|$|Um…kind {{of keeping}} that {{excitement}} going, I <b>think.</b> They <b>were</b> really {{into it and}} I think the Survivor theme helped, but keeping that in their brains.

60|$|DEAR SIR:--Complaint {{is made to}} me {{that you}} are using your {{official}} power to defeat Mr. Arnold's nomination to Congress. I am well satisfied with Mr. Arnold as a member of Congress, and I do not know that the man who might supplant him would be as satisfactory; but the correct principle, I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all our friends should have absolute freedom of choice among our friends. My wish, therefore, is that you will do just as you think fit with your own suffrage in the case, and not constrain any of your subordinates to [do] other than [as] he thinks fit with his. This is precisely the rule I inculcated and adhered to on my part, when a certain other nomination, now recently made, was being canvassed for.|$|E
6000|$|The girl's justification, clearly, {{was very}} present to her, and not less {{obviously}} {{the truth that}} to make it strong she must, avoiding every side-issue, keep it very simple, [...] "The only account I can give you, I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I could but speak at such a moment as I felt, and that I felt--well, how can I say how deeply? If you can really bear to know, I feel so still I care in fact more than ever that we shouldn't do such things. I care, if you like, to indiscretion--I care, if you like, to offence, to arrogance, to folly. But even as my last word to you before you leave England on the conclusion of such a step, I'm ready to cry out {{to you that you}} oughtn't, you oughtn't, you oughtn't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The noble lord the Member for South Birmingham {{spoke of}} the {{principle}} of [...] "one vote, one value," [...] which was embodied in the Lyttelton Constitution. The principle of [...] "one vote, one value" [...] is in itself an orthodox and unimpeachable principle of democracy. It is a logical, numerical principle. If the attempt be made to discriminate between man and man because one has more children and lives in the country, it would be arguable that we should discriminate because another man has more brains or more money, or lives in the town, or for any other of the many reasons that differentiate one human being from another. The only safe principle, I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for electoral purposes all men are equal, and that voting power, as far as possible, should be evenly distributed among them.|$|E
