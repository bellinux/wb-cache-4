The ceiling of this hall is formed from a single stone. The garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) has a central image of Ganesha as Mayureshwar or Moreshwar, facing the North. The Ganesha image is depicted in a seated posture with its trunk turning to the left, four arms and three eyes. He holds a noose (pasha) and elephant goad (ankusha) in his upper hands, while his lower right rests on his knee {{and the other one}} holds a modaka (a sweet). The navel and the eyes are embedded with diamonds. A cobra hood raised over Ganesha's head, shelters the Lord. The image is actually smaller <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as it is smeared with a thick level of saffron-coloured Sindoor (vermillion), which peels off once every century. It last fell off in 1882, and prior to that in 1788. Ganesha is flanked by idols of his consorts Riddhi and Siddhi sometimes called Siddhi and Buddhi. These idols are made of an alloy of five metals or of brass. The deities are covered with crafted silver and gold. Like all Ashtavinayaka shrines, the central Ganesha image is believed to be svayambhu (self-existent), naturally occurring {{in the form of an}} elephant-faced stone. In front of the central image, the vahanas of Ganesha – the mouse and the peacock are placed. To the left outside the garbhagriha is an image of Nagna-Bhairava.|$|E
500|$|According {{to court}} {{documents}} filed on November 5, 2014, there were images posted to 4chan {{that appeared to be}} of a murder victim. The body was discovered in Port Orchard, Washington, after the images were posted. The posts were accompanied by the text: [...] "Turns out it's way harder to strangle someone to death <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> on the movies." [...] A later post said: [...] "Check the news for Port Orchard, Washington, in a few hours. Her son will be home from school soon. He'll find her, then call the cops. I just wanted to share the pics before they find me." [...] The victim was Amber Lynn Coplin, aged 30. The suspect, 33-year-old David Michael Kalac, surrendered to police in Oregon later the same day; he was charged with second-degree murder involving domestic violence. Kalac was convicted in April 2017 and was sentenced to 82 years in prison the following month.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening scene}} {{featuring}} the alien rebels incinerating {{a group of}} Russian alien abductees was filmed without actual Russian cars. Picture car coordination Nigel Habgood noted, [...] "I couldn't get real Russian cars, so I decided to get creative and go seriously European. We burned a couple Saabs, and a BMW 2002. I'm sorry we couldn't get any Yugos." [...] For the scene after the intro wherein Mulder discovers the charred remains of abductees, the prop and the production design departments had to create specialized fake bodies. Carter later noted that it's [...] "harder <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> to create a charred, dead body." [...] The stage for the alien abduction scene was built from scratch: construction supervisor Rob Maier was tasked with creating a full-scale replica of the Ruskin Dam bridge in order to ease up the shots. The tagline for this episode is [...] "Resist or Serve". The tagline was later used for The X-Files game, [...] {{as well as the}} official book covering the fifth season of the show. The list of victims viewed by Scully in her hospital room was made up of X-Files staffers.|$|E

60|$|For, after all, it is {{a glorious}} pastime to find oneself {{in a real}} gale of wind, in a big ship, with not a rock to run against within a {{thousand}} miles.

And when a man--not being sea-sick--has once discovered that the apparent heel of the ship in rolling is at least four times less <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks,</b> and that she will jump upright again in a quarter of a minute like a fisher's float; has learnt to get his trunk out from under his berth, and put it back again, by jamming his forehead against the berth-side and his heels against the ship's wall; has learnt--if he sleep aft--to sleep through the firing of the screw, though it does shake all the marrow in his backbone; and has, above all, made a solemn vow to shave and bathe every morning, let the ship be as lively as she will: then he will find a full gale a finer tonic, and a finer stirrer of wholesome appetite, than all the drugs of Apothecaries' Hall.|$|E
