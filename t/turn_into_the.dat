5|$|Donal {{meanwhile}} {{turns to}} alcohol, devastated {{at the fact}} that he has brought about a god who, according to Donal's religion, should not even exist. However, Reed's analysis leads him to believe that the final component needed to deal with the rift is lightning, and Donal is convinced to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Viking god once more.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} to swing Vindictive broadside {{on into the}} channel mouth, but as he ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> channel. The damaged propeller made this maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of the channel and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entranceway.|$|E
5|$|Downburst winds {{can produce}} {{numerous}} hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst winds are generally very powerful, {{and are often}} mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash. Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds. Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> destructive straight-horizontal winds.|$|E

5|$|Secretariat's winning time of 1: {{and last}} quarter mile in 23 seconds were both {{records for the}} Derby. In addition, he had run each quarter-mile faster than before, with times of , 24, , , and 23 seconds. Sham {{maintained}} his stride and crossed the line in second place, eight lengths ahead of third-place finisher Our Native, who had lost ground on the final <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> homestretch. Sham also broke the previous course record {{with a time of}} 1:. Shecky Greene, who led for most of the race, finished in sixth position.|$|E
5|$|In mid-March 1890 Kruger met the new British High Commissioner and Governor Sir Henry Brougham Loch, Loch's {{legal adviser}} William Philip Schreiner, and Rhodes, who had by now {{attained}} a dominant {{position in the}} Transvaal's mining industry and a royal charter for his British South Africa Company to occupy and administer Matabeleland and Mashonaland. A group of Transvaalers planned to emigrate to Mashonaland—the so-called Bowler Trek—and Rhodes was keen to stop this lest it interfere with his own plans. He and Loch offered to support Kruger in his plan to acquire a port at Kosi Bay and link it to the Transvaal through Swaziland if in return the Transvaal would enter a South African customs union and pledge not to expand northwards. Kruger made no commitments, thinking this union might easily <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> federation Britain had pursued years before, but on his return to Pretoria forbade any Boer trek to Mashonaland.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September La Fleche {{ran in the}} St Leger on a wet day at Doncaster. Orme, who had {{returned}} from his problems to win the Eclipse Stakes started favourite, with La Fleche, ridden on this occasion by John Watts, strongly supported at 7/2. Watts settled the filly {{in the early stages}} as Orme set off in front. Just after the <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> straight, La Fleche, travelling strongly, moved alongside her stable companion and then pulled clear. She won easily by two lengths from the fast-finishing Sir Hugo, with Orme fading into fifth. On 24 September, La Fleche ran against older and younger horses in the £10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse. Ridden by Barrett, she tracked the leaders until the straight, where she accelerated impressively to win by three lengths from Orvieto, with Sir Hugo unplaced.|$|E

5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E

25|$|The {{village of}} Walden has noted, in its 2005 Comprehensive Plan, the {{difficulties}} {{created by the}} oblique intersection at {{the eastern end of}} the Route208 concurrency. Traffic on northbound 208 comes to a stop sign at the intersection, where 52 comes in from the right at a slightly lower grade and a sharp angle, with the view mostly blocked by a building. It is also just opposite one of two curb cuts for a busy ]. At rush hour, the traffic light at the nearby northern end often backs cars up along 52 for some distance, making the <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gas station difficult, especially when vehicles on 52 make the left <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> curb cut.|$|E

25|$|A turn on red is a {{principle}} of law permitting vehicles at a traffic light showing a red signal to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> direction of traffic nearer to them (almost always after a complete stop) when the way is clear, without having {{to wait for a}} green signal. It is intended to allow traffic to resume moving, with minimal risk provided that proper caution is observed.|$|E
25|$|After a brief pause, {{the train}} ascends the second lift hill {{known as a}} {{vertical}} lift hill. The train then enters another drop, 180-degrees to the left, banking into a downward corkscrew. Riders next encounter a Rollover/sea serpent roll, followed by a second airtime hill. Riders here experience {{a large amount of}} ejector airtime before the train reaches a cobra roll element. Upon exiting the cobra roll, the train hits two consecutive corkscrews before a 180-degree left <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> final brake run.|$|E

25|$|In 1932 Chicharro {{got engaged}} in {{conspiracy}} of José Sanjurjo, though no details are known. Following the disastrously failed coup he {{was identified as}} one of the culprits and became subject of the expropriation, designed to boost the floundering Agrarian Reform. Later that year two of his sons were detained and administrated exile in the Spanish Sahara outpost of Villa Cisneros, which would soon <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Carlist hotbed. Continuing with his tours across the country later in 1933 he defended some of the Sanjuriada conspirators in court, though he was himself closely watched by the security and in May he faced trial for inflammatory speak.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, {{during the}} Ottoman era, the Great Mosque of Beersheba was built with {{donations}} {{collected from the}} Bedouin residents in the Negev. It was used actively as a mosque until the city fell to Israeli forces in 1948. The mosque was used until 1953 as the city's courthouse. From then until the 1990s, when it was closed for renovations, the building housed an archeological museum, which the city intended to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> archeological branch of the Negev Museum. In 2011, however, the Supreme Court of Israel, sitting as the High Court of Justice, ordered the property to {{be turned into a}} museum of Islam without reverting to a place of worship.|$|E
25|$|The first canal {{ran from}} Port Dalhousie, Ontario on Lake Ontario south along Twelve Mile Creek to St. Catharines. From there {{it took a}} winding route up the Niagara Escarpment through Merritton, Ontario to Thorold, where it {{continued}} south via Allanburg to Port Robinson, Ontario on the Welland River. Ships went east (downstream) on the Welland River to Chippawa, at the south (upper) end of the old portage road, where they made a sharp right <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Niagara River, upstream towards Lake Erie. Originally, the section between Allanburg and Port Robinson was planned to be carried in a subterranean tunnel. However, the sandy soil {{in this part of}} Ontario made a tunnel infeasible, and a deep open-cut canal was dug instead.|$|E

25|$|Since {{a frontal}} attack was impractical, {{it was decided}} to attempt a {{flanking}} attack while waiting for the artillery to arrive. A small force of tanks from the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment was sent to {{the western part of the}} Hafid Ridge with orders to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first valley. The attack went well at first, as the tanks caught the Axis forces unaware and were able to strafe along their trenches with their machine guns, losing only one tank in the process. As they approached point 208 on their way eastward though, the commander became aware of its fortifications and ordered his units to disengage; due to an equipment shortage, only one tank per troop was equipped with a radio and five of his tanks, not receiving the order, continued towards Point 208 and were destroyed by its 88mm guns.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Star of Bengals crew {{also became}} concerned, but could neither see the tugboats, nor {{communicate}} with them. At 1:45a.m. the Hattie Gage blew {{a series of}} whistles, signaling the maneuver which was heard on the Star of Bengal. However, as the tugs started the turn, the Kayaks rudder proved ineffective in the rough weather, and she failed to <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wind. For some time, the tugs worked against each other, their combined effort overpowering the Star of Bengals rudder and preventing her from making the turn to safety. Aware of the looming danger, the Star of Bengals first mate begged captain Wagner to sever the Kayaks hawser which was dragging the ship in the wrong direction, but the captain refused, as the maritime law prohibited such action {{on the part of}} the vessel in tow.|$|E
25|$|After {{thrashing}} Wonga Park in the semi, {{they met}} Ainslie Park in the 1993/94 Chandler Shield Grand Final, which would twist and <b>turn</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> greatest RDCA final of all time. Scheduled for 3 days and 240 overs, Warrandyte batted first, as John Sharman's 64 runs pushed the score to a meagre total of 175 from 90 overs. With {{a day and}} a half day remaining, there was plenty of time, and when Ainslie Park got within 35 runs with 7 wickets in hand, they had one hand their first Chandler Shield. Then Hogg produced a tremendous spell of bowling, and sparked a collapse of 6/31 to end day 2 with the game well and truly in the balance. The final day began with Warrandyte needing 1 wicket, and Ainslie 5 runs for victory. The first over was a maiden bowled by Sturesteps, then Hogg sent a yorker into the stumps, and Warrandyte into delirium.|$|E
