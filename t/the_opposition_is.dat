The current Leader of <b>the</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>is</b> Bill Shorten of the Australian Labor Party, {{following}} an election of the new Parliamentary Labor Leader by caucus and ALP members on 13 October 2013. The current Deputy Leader of <b>the</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>is</b> Tanya Plibersek of the Australian Labor Party, following her election on 14 October 2013 by the Labor Caucus. Tanya Plibersek is the fourth woman to hold the position of Deputy Opposition Leader.|$|E
5|$|This is a List of Canadian Leaders of the Opposition. The Leader of <b>the</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>is</b> {{usually the}} leader of the party with the second-most seats in the Canadian House of Commons, known as Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. He or she is {{entitled}} to the same levels of pay and protection as a Cabinet Minister, and is often made a member of the Canadian Privy Council, generally the only non-government member of the House of Commons afforded that privilege.|$|E
5|$|The GRC scheme {{has also}} been criticized for raising the bar for the {{opposition}} in elections. First, opposition parties may find it harder to find competent candidates, including minority candidates, to form teams to contest GRCs. Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme benefits the PAP as they can put together stronger teams. With the GRC system the threshold for votes for <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> also increased, and opposition parties {{have to take a}} gamble and commit huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs. Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election, rounded to the nearest S$500. At the 2011 general election, the deposit was $16,000. Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled in the GRC. Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs. To date, only one opposition party, the Workers' Party, has won a GRC: Aljunied, in the 2011 general election.|$|E
5000|$|In rugby union <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>are</b> {{awarded a}} scrum if the player in {{possession}} drops the ball forwards or makes the ball go forwards with {{any part of}} his body other than his feet and <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>are</b> unable to gain an advantage from the lost possession.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{remember}} how to play situations like in the adjacent diagram - each time the pawn is moved forward, it must be without giving check. If the pawn checks the opponent's king, <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> lost and the game is drawn.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>{{opposition}}</b> <b>is</b> admissible, {{the grounds}} for opposition are examined as to their merits. The patent proprietor has also the opportunity to reply to the grounds of opposition developed by the opponent. Arguments and, to a certain extent, amendments may be filed in reply by the patent proprietor.|$|E
25|$|Before {{starting}} the substantive {{examination of the}} opposition, the Opposition Division examines whether the opposition must be considered as filed ("Is there an opposition?") and whether it is admissible ("Is the opposition admissible?"). The Opposition Division may find that <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> not deemed to have been filed, for instance because the opposition fee has not been paid within the nine-month opposition period, because the notice of opposition is not signed or because the notice is not in an accepted language.|$|E

25|$|Inadmissible oppositions and oppositions {{which are}} deemed {{not to have}} been filed are not substantively {{examined}} (no examination on the merits). An opposition can only be rejected as inadmissible if the opposition has been first deemed to have been filed, and, if it is deemed to have been filed, the opposition exists, even if later <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> rejected as inadmissible. If an opposition is deemed {{not to have been}} filed, an already paid opposition fee is refunded. In contrast, if an opposition is rejected as inadmissible, an already paid opposition fee is not refunded.|$|E
25|$|In {{parliamentary}} {{systems of}} {{government on the}} Westminster model, the Leader of <b>the</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>is</b> the MP who {{is the leader of}} the largest opposition party able and prepared to assume office if the Government resigns. This political party often forms a Shadow Cabinet, the members of which serve as opposition spokespersons on key areas of government. Singapore law does not provide for an official Leader of the Opposition, though the leader of the largest opposition party in Parliament is usually given the title of unofficial Leader of the Opposition. This is taken into consideration by the Speaker when seats in Parliament are allocated, and during a debate the MP so designated is often given the privilege of being one of the first non-Government MPs to speak.|$|E
25|$|Kerala Legislative Assembly passed {{resolution}} {{for setting}} up a high court bench at Thiruvananthapuram, capital city of kerala. The Union Government and the Supreme Court are favourable in sanctioning more high court benches in country, and had already sanctioned many in other states. However, a new high court bench at Thiruvananthapuram is still pending, due to opposition by some in the high court at Ernakulam. <b>The</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> based on the rationale that when the United State of Travancore-Cochin (the forerunner to the State of Kerala) was created, {{it was agreed that}} the United State's capital would be Travancore's capital Thiruvananthapuram, where the legislature and the executive would be based, but that the judiciary would be based in Kochi, Cochin's capital.|$|E

5000|$|Javier Corrales {{writes in}} the Foreign Policy Magazine that <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> [...] "shocked {{not so much by}} the results as by the ease with which {{international}} observers condoned the Electoral Council's flimsy audit of the results." [...] The sample for the audit was selected by the Chávez-controlled National Electoral Council, and according to <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>was</b> not of sufficient size to be statistically reliable.|$|R
25|$|In the Bundahishn, a cosmological fable {{completed}} in the 12th century, <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> established during the creation: {{the second phase of}} the war between creation (with its guardians) and Angra Mainyu (MP→ Ahriman) is over control of the waters and of the rains. In this war (Bundahishn 7.8-10, and Zadspram 6.9-11), Apaosha is assisted by Spenjagr, who is however defeated by a bolt of lightning. On the opposing front, Tishtrya is supported by Verethragna (→ Vahman), Haoma (→ Hom), Apam Napat (→ Burz), the hordes of the fravashis and by the Vayu (→ Weh). In the Bundahishn, Apaosha is identified with the planet Mercury, the astrological opposition to Sirius being a product of the contact with Chaldea, and which may be a lingering trace of the Zurvanite doctrine that places stars in opposition to planets.|$|E
25|$|Props {{have to take}} in {{pressure}} from the locks and loose forwards pushing from behind and the opposition pushing against them, so they are often among the strongest players in a team. Some of the more successful props have short necks and broad shoulders to absorb this force as well as powerful legs to drive the scrum forward. Since the game has become professional, non-specialist props or hookers cannot play in the front row. If, through sendings-off or injuries, a team {{does not have enough}} specialist front row players, the scrums become 'uncontested' (i.e. no pushing is allowed and the team putting the ball into the scrum wins it). On their own scrum, the loosehead's role is to provide the hooker with a clear view to strike the ball, while the tighthead tries to keep the scrum stable. When <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> putting the ball in, the tighthead attempts to disrupt the opposing hooker or loosehead, making {{it difficult for them to}} win the ball.|$|E
25|$|The Speaker of Parliament has overall {{charge of}} the {{administration}} of Parliament and its secretariat, and presides over parliamentary sittings. The Leader of the House is an MP appointed by the Prime Minister to arrange government business and the legislative programme of Parliament, while the unofficial Leader of <b>the</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>is</b> the MP who leads the largest opposition party able and prepared to assume office if the Government resigns. However, in September 2011, Low Thia Khiang, the Secretary-General of the Workers' Party of Singapore, which holds the most opposition seats in Parliament, {{said that he would}} not be accepting the title. Some of Parliament's work is carried out by select committees made up of small numbers of MPs. Standing Select Committees are permanently constituted to fulfil certain duties, and ad hoc Select Committees are established from time to time to deal with matters such studying the details of bills. In addition, selected PAP backbenchers sit on Government Parliamentary Committees that examine the policies, programmes and proposed legislation of government ministries.|$|E

25|$|On May 20, 2004, Chen {{was sworn}} in for his second term as President amid {{continued}} mass protests by the pan-blue alliance over the validity of his re-election. Having heard protests from pro-independence figures in Taiwan, he did not explicitly re-state the Four Noes and One Without but did state that he reaffirmed the commitments made in his first inaugural. He defended his proposals to change the constitution, but asked for constitutional reform to be undertaken through existing procedures instead of calling for a referendum for an entirely new constitution which was proposed by former president Lee Teng-hui. This would require approval by a three-fourths majority of the National Assembly which could authorize a referendum. This has two major implications. First, by going through existing constitutional amendment procedures, this has the symbolic effect of maintaining continuity with the existing constitution which was originally written in China. Second, this has the practical effect of requiring the Chen administration to get {{the consent of the}} opposition Pan-Blue coalition to pass any amendments, and while <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> willing to consider constitutional reforms that would increase governmental efficiency, they are unlikely to support anything that would imply a de jure declaration of independence.|$|E
500|$|The Commonwealth of Australia is a {{constitutional}} monarchy with a parliamentary system {{and is based}} on the Westminster model. The term Opposition has a specific meaning in the parliamentary sense. It is {{an important component of the}} Westminster system, with the Opposition directing criticism at the Government and attempts to defeat and replace the Government. <b>The</b> <b>Opposition</b> <b>is</b> therefore known as the [...] "Government in waiting" [...] and it is a formal part of the parliamentary system. It is in opposition to the Government, but not to the Crown; hence the term [...] "Loyal Opposition".|$|E
500|$|Defenders of {{the current}} usage often state their {{intention}} to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals. Defenders {{of the status quo}} also state that the issue is not important, being only about sports, and that <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> nothing more than [...] "political correctness", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. Although there has been a steady {{decline in the number of}} teams doing so, Native American images and nicknames nevertheless remain fairly common in American and Canadian sports, and may be found in use at all levels, from youth teams to professional sports franchises.|$|E

500|$|Passport to Pimlico {{contains}} numerous {{references to}} the Second World War to accentuate the spirit within the small Burgundian enclave. The film studies scholar Charles Barr, in his examination of the Ealing films, observes that in opposing the British government, the Burgundians [...] "recover the spirit, the resilience and local autonomy and unity of wartime London". Barr suggests the actions [...] "re-enact,... in miniature, the war experience of Britain itself". The film historian Mark Duguid, writing for the British Film Institute, considers that <b>the</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "yearning nostalgia for the social unity of the war years". The film historians Anthony Aldgate and Jeffrey Richards describe Passport to Pimlico as a progressive comedy because it upsets the established social order to promote the well-being of a community. The view of the community put forward in the film has been criticised as being anachronistic, as the wartime unity had already passed by 1949. According to Aldgate and Richards, the welcome return to the ration books {{at the end of}} the film signifies an acceptance that the measures of the British government are in the best interests of the people.|$|E
