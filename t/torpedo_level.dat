50|$|The JASON sub is {{much smaller}} than the main sub and can be used to explore gaps too small for the main sub to enter and {{it can be used to}} {{completely}} evade the deadly octopus tentacles. The JASON sub has a power level indicating the limited time the JASON sub can part from the main sub. The JASON sub must reunite with main sub to recharge its power. The JASON can only reach the second <b>torpedo</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
50|$|The depth meter {{is placed}} at the inner bottom of the section to detect the water depth level. It detects the {{displacement}} level of the water depth and controls the tail horizontal rudders (or elevators) proportionally, so that the <b>torpedo</b> keeps <b>level</b> running under the water.|$|R
5000|$|Lightning and Laforey left Greenock for {{the first}} major Malta convoy {{of the war on}} 17 September 1941, {{crossing}} the Clyde Boom at 0530. Lightning joined the convoy with many of the capital ships from the Home Fleet. These included , , , , , , Cossack, Fury, [...] and [...] She then passed through the Straits of Gibraltar and met up with Force H. Throughout the operation Lightning would see some of her heaviest fighting. She {{and the rest of the}} convoy were attacked by German bombers who used a mixture of high altitude bombing, dive bombing and low <b>level</b> <b>torpedo</b> bombing. At 1340 on 27 September 1941 Lightning was very nearly hit. A torpedo from an aircraft missed the ship by 20 yd.|$|R
40|$|Undersea weapons, {{including}} torpedoes, need to {{be designed}} to survive extreme loading conditions such as underwater explosions (UNDEX). The response of a lightweight torpedo when subjected to an underwater explosion is an important criterion for multidisciplinary design. This research obtains the UNDEX response of torpedo structure using both metallic and composite material models. The pressure wave resulting from an underwater explosion was modeled using similitude relations, and it {{was assumed to be}} a spherical wave. A surface based interaction procedure was used to model the fluid-structure interaction involved during the UNDEX event. The finite element package ABAQUS was used to model the UNDEX and the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) phenomena, which are critical for accurate evaluation of <b>torpedo</b> stress <b>levels.</b> This research also investigates the effect of structural stiffeners on the performance of a lightweight torpedo. A final configuration was obtained for the torpedo that had minimum weight and was least sensitive to small manufacturing variations in the dimensions of the stiffeners. For a stiffened metallic torpedo, an optimal configuration with least possible weight for a given level of safety from an explosion at a critica...|$|R
2500|$|The Royal Navy {{had used}} Swordfish torpedo planes, and their low speed {{was part of}} the reason the Taranto attack succeeded. The Imperial Japanese Navy no longer had any similar planes, so they had to develop other methods, both {{hardware}} and delivery technique. They independently developed shallow water torpedo modifications (called [...] "Thunder Fish") during the planning and training for the attack in 1941. Wooden fins were added to the tail and anti-roll [...] "flippers" [...] kept the torpedo upright once in the water. The fins kept the <b>torpedo's</b> nose <b>level</b> in the air and broke off on entering the water. The flatter [...] "flight" [...] trajectory helped keep them from diving so deeply as to encounter bottom mud. (Despite these modifications, some Japanese torpedoes did indeed reach the bottom and several remain unaccounted for.) These simple modifications were not anticipated by the USN, and Admiral Bloch (commander of the Pearl Harbor Naval District) did not push to install torpedo nets or baffles at Pearl. Nor, it seems, did anyone else. Practical considerations also were an influence. Due to the shallow anchorage (which continues to require regular dredging), installation of torpedo nets would have severely restricted the mobility of vessels in the harbor.|$|R
5000|$|The XF8B-1 was, at the time, {{the largest}} and {{heaviest}} single-seat, single-engine fighter developed in the United States. Boeing called the XF8B-1 optimistically, the [...] "five-in-one fighter" [...] (fighter, interceptor, dive bomber, <b>torpedo</b> bomber, or <b>level</b> bomber). It was powered by a single 3,000 hp (2,200 kW) Pratt & Whitney XR-4360-10 four-row 28-cylinder radial engine, driving two three-bladed contra-rotating propellers. It would be the largest single-seat piston fighter to fly in the U.S. to date. The large wings featured outer sections which could fold vertically, while the fuselage incorporated an internal bomb bay and large fuel tanks; more fuel could be carried externally. The proposed armament included six 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns or six 20 mm wing-mounted cannons, and a 6,400 lb (2,900 kg) bomb load or two 2,000 lb (900 kg) torpedoes. The final configuration was a large but streamlined design, featuring a bubble canopy, sturdy main undercarriage that folded into the wings, and topped by {{a variation on the}} B-29 vertical tail.|$|R
500|$|The Americans {{had managed}} to {{extinguish}} her fires by 14:00 and Yorktown was making [...] by 14:30 when the second group of Japanese aircraft launched from the Hiryū was approaching, low <b>level</b> <b>torpedo</b> bombers this time. They had been detected by the ship's radar at 13:55, but the CAP was held back until they got closer. Six Wildcats were on CAP duty and four were vectored toward the attacking aircraft while {{the other two were}} retained to cover the takeoff of the 10 Wildcats fueling on deck. The Japanese were jumped at 14:38 by two Wildcats which shot down one torpedo bomber before they were both shot down by the escorting Zeros. Two Zeros were shot down later for the loss of one Wildcat. Two more B5Ns were shot down before they could drop their torpedoes and three afterwards, but none of these aircraft hit the carrier. The last four torpedo bombers scored two hits (one B5N had its torpedo-release gear fail) on Yorktown that damaged three boilers and knocked out all electrical power so that she could not pump fuel oil to starboard to counteract her six degree list to port. Seventeen minutes later, after the list increased to 23 degrees, the crew was ordered to abandon ship. Of the four Zeros and five B5Ns that returned to Hiryū, only one Zero and three dive bombers were still flight-worthy.|$|R
40|$|Endogenous {{levels of}} IAA, ABA and {{four types of}} CKs were {{analyzed}} in zygotic and indirect (ISE) and direct somatic embryogenesis of Acca sellowiana. Zygotic and somatic embryos at different developmental stages were sampled for morphological and hormonal analysis. Both embryo types showed substantial asymmetry in hormone levels. Zygotic embryos displayed a conspicuous peak of IAA in early developmental stages. The results outlined the hormonal variations occurring during zygotic and somatic embryogenesis regarding the timing, nature and hormonal status involved in both processes. The short transient pulse of IAA observed on the 3 rd day in culture was suggested {{to be involved with}} the signaling for the induction of somatic embryogenesis. Fertilized ovule development was associated with increased IAA levels 21 - 24 days after pollination, followed by a sharp decrease in the cotyledonary stage, both in zygotic and somatic embryos. There was a prominent increase in ABA levels in cultures which generated ISE 24 - 30 days after pollination, a period that corresponds to the heart and <b>torpedo</b> stages. The <b>levels</b> of total CKs (Z, [9 R]Z, iP and [9 R]iP) were also always higher in zygotic than in somatic embryogenesis. While zygotic embryogenesis was dominated by the presence of zeatin, the somatic process, contrarily, was characterized by a large variation of the other cytokinin forms and amounts studied. The above results, when taken together, could be related to the previously observed high frequency formation of anomalous somatic embryos formed in A. sellowiana, as well as to their low germination ability...|$|R
5000|$|At the Battle off Samar, a Japanese {{battleship}} group {{moving towards}} the invasion fleet off Leyte engaged a minuscule American force known as [...] "Taffy 3" [...] (formally Task Unit 77.4.3), composed of six escort carriers with about 28 aircraft each, three destroyers, and four destroyer escorts. The biggest {{guns in the}} American force were 5 in/38 caliber guns, while the Japanese had 14 in, 16 in, and 18.1 in guns. Aircraft from six additional escort carriers also participated {{for a total of}} around 330 US aircraft, a mix of F6F Hellcat fighters and TBF Avenger torpedo bombers. The Japanese had four battleships including the massive Yamato, six heavy cruisers, two small light cruisers, and 11 destroyers. The Japanese force had earlier been driven off by air attack, losing Yamatos sister Musashi. Admiral Halsey then decided to use his Third Fleet carrier force to attack the Japanese carrier group, located well to the north of Samar, which was actually a decoy group with few aircraft. The Japanese were desperately short of aircraft and pilots {{at this point in the}} war, and Leyte Gulf was the first battle in which kamikaze suicide attacks were used. Due to a tragedy of errors, Halsey took the American battleship force with him, leaving San Bernardino Strait guarded only by the small Seventh Fleet escort carrier force. The battle commenced at dawn on 25 October 1944, shortly after the Battle of Surigao Strait. In the engagement that followed, the Americans exhibited uncanny torpedo accuracy, blowing the bows off several Japanese heavy cruisers. The escort carriers' aircraft also performed very well, attacking with machine guns after their carriers ran out of bombs and <b>torpedoes.</b> The unexpected <b>level</b> of damage, and maneuvering to avoid the torpedoes and air attacks, disorganized the Japanese and caused them to think they faced at least part of the Third Fleet's main force. They had also learned of the defeat a few hours before at Surigao Strait, and did not hear that Halsey's force was busy destroying the decoy fleet. Convinced that the rest of the Third Fleet would arrive soon if it hadn't already, the Japanese withdrew, eventually losing three heavy cruisers sunk with three damaged to air and torpedo attacks. The Americans lost two escort carriers, two destroyers, and one destroyer escort sunk, with three escort carriers, one destroyer, and two destroyer escorts damaged, thus losing over one-third of their engaged force sunk with nearly all the remainder damaged.|$|R
