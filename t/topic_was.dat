5|$|During the Cold War era, {{research}} on the Underground State was curtailed by Polish communist officials, who instead emphasized the role that communist partisans played in the anti-Nazi resistance. Hence, until recently, the bulk of research done on this <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> carried out by Polish scholars living in exile.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to contextual animal ethics and her exploration {{of animals in}} environmental ethics, Palmer has written on disenhanced animals (i.e., animals that have been engineered to lose certain capacities) and companion animals. The latter <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> the focus of her co-authored text Companion Animal Ethics, which explores ethical issues concerning companion animals, including feeding, medical care, euthanasia and others.|$|E
5|$|The third project <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> disk mass potential. This <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} to make measurements of the distances to disk stars {{as well as their}} proper motions. The results of the third topic of study were to be combined with the results of the fundamental galactic parameters portion of the study to determine the Solar System's position and velocity in the galaxy. The final topic dealt with dark matter distribution in the Milky Way. SIM data was to be used to create a three-dimensional model of mass distribution in the Galaxy, out to a radius of 270 kiloparsecs (kps). They were to then use two different tests to determine the galactic potential at large radii.|$|E

5|$|Homosexuals were {{portrayed in}} such pre-Code films as Our Betters (1933), Footlight Parade (1933), Only Yesterday (1933), Sailor's Luck (1933), and Cavalcade (1933). Although the <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> dealt {{with much more}} openly than in the decades that followed, the {{characterizations}} {{of gay and lesbian}} characters were usually derogatory. Gay male characters were portrayed as flighty with high voices, existing merely as buffoonish supporting characters.|$|E
5|$|The FVdG's {{disillusionment with}} the social {{democratic}} movement deepened during the mass strike debate. The role of the general strike for the socialist movement was first discussed within the FVdG in 1901. At the SPD's 1903 congress in Dresden, Raphael Friedeberg proposed discussing the topic, but his proposal {{was rejected by the}} congress. The following year, a proposal by Wilhelm Liebknecht and Eduard Bernstein to initiate debate on the <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> accepted, since they had distanced themselves from Friedeberg's positions.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick also edited Oxford Early Christian Studies (from 1990). With {{his brother}} Owen, he edited The Oxford History of the Christian Church (12 vols., 1981–2010).

5|$|Liebknecht and Bernstein, {{like the}} left wing of the party, felt the general strike {{should not be used}} to provoke the state but rather to defend {{political}} rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon {{in the hands of the}} proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> even more radical. He claimed that historical materialism, a pillar of Marxism, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin's writings rather than Marx's works, which were most influential in the SPD.|$|E
5|$|Resource Guides {{are offered}} for the art, economics, {{language}} and literature, music, science/social science, and Super Quiz events. The Super Quiz Resource Guide is {{a compendium of}} previously published articles, whereas the other Resource Guides are composed by individual writers under contract with USAD. The aim of the Resource Guide is to assist students {{in their study of}} the topics listed in the subject area outlines. As an example, in 2003 the music <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> Romantic music. Subsequently the Music Resource Guide focused on the development of Romantic music, its characteristics and the influence of the Classical era on the Romantic era. A large part of the guide focused on information about that year's composers: Beethoven, Berlioz, Rossini, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Verdi, Mussorgsky, Wagner, Bizet, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mahler and Strauss. Similarly, the art topic assigned was Romantic art in the European tradition. The Art Resource Guide included sections detailing the lives and works of relevant artists such as Joseph Mallord William Turner, Claude Monet, Albert Bierstadt, and Camille Pissarro.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} that arose after the incapacity of President Wilson, for which Marshall's vice-presidency is most remembered, revived {{the national debate}} {{on the process of}} presidential succession. The <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson's incapacity during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue. The constitutional flaws in the process of presidential succession had been known since the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem. Nearly fifty years later, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers and duties any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers and duties of the office.|$|E
40|$|Three <b>topics</b> <b>are</b> {{discussed}} {{that relate}} to the teaching of linear algebra using computers (here the term computers includes calculators).

5|$|Traditionally it is Jean-Baptiste Say who is {{credited}} for coining {{the word and}} advancing {{the concept of the}} entrepreneur, but in fact it was Cantillon who first introduced the term in Essai. Cantillon divided society into two principal classes—fixed income wage-earners and non-fixed income earners. Entrepreneurs, according to Cantillon, are non-fixed income earners who pay known costs of production but earn uncertain incomes, due to the speculative nature of pandering to an unknown demand for their product. Cantillon, while providing the foundations, did not develop a dedicated theory of uncertainty—the <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> not revisited until the 20th century, by Ludwig von Mises, Frank Knight, and John Maynard Keynes, among others. Furthermore, unlike later theories of entrepreneurship which saw the entrepreneur as a disruptive force, Cantillon anticipated the belief that the entrepreneur brought equilibrium to a market by correctly predicting consumer preferences.|$|E
5|$|After the January 11 congressional hearing, Ross delayed {{enforcement}} of the FEPC directive to await {{the outcome of the}} upcoming union elections. The PRTEU contract with the PTC was expiring on February 11, 1944 and a union election was called for March 14, 1944. Apart from PRTEU, which was still staunchly opposed to promotions of black employees, there were two other unions competing for the right to represent PTC workers: the Transport Workers Union (TWU), which was a Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) affiliate, and the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, an American Federation of Labor (AFL) affiliate. The TWU said that it would allow promotions of black employees while the Amalgamated Association stayed silent on the matter. The PRTEU leadership tried to campaign on the race issue during the union elections, but the <b>topic</b> <b>was</b> overshadowed by other issues, such as the details of a new contract with the PTC. After a bitter campaign, the TWU won the union elections, receiving more votes than both of the other unions combined. At the time of the elections many white workers perceived the contract issue to be more important, where the TWU was promising more attractive terms, and they did not consider promotions of black employees a realistic possibility. Despite the TWU victory, animosities from white workers towards the black employees remained and were largely unabated. The negotiations between the TWU and the PTC on a new contract dragged on, {{and in the absence of}} a contract the company continued to resist implementing the FEPC directives.|$|E
