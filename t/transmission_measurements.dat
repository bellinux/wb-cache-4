For reflectance measurements, the spectrophotometer quantitatively compares {{the fraction of}} light that reflects from the reference and test samples. Light from the source lamp is passed through a monochromator, which diffracts the light into a [...] "rainbow" [...] of wavelengths through a rotating prism and outputs narrow bandwidths of this diffracted spectrum through a mechanical slit on the output side of the monochromator. These bandwidths are transmitted through the test sample. Then the photon flux density (watts per metre squared usually) of the transmitted or reflected light is measured with a photodiode, charge coupled device or other light sensor. The transmittance or reflectance value for each wavelength of the test sample is then compared with the transmission or reflectance values from the reference sample. Most instruments will apply a logarithmic function to the linear transmittance ratio to calculate the 'absorbency' of the sample, a value which {{is proportional to the}} 'concentration' of the chemical being measured.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: There {{are three}} goals for this study: (a) to perform {{detailed}} megavoltage <b>transmission</b> <b>measurements</b> {{in order to}} identify the factors that affect the measurement accuracy, (b) to use the measured data as a benchmark for the EGSnrc system {{in order to identify}} the computational limiting factors, and (c) to provide data for others to benchmark Monte Carlo codes. Methods: <b>Transmission</b> <b>measurements</b> are performed at the National Research Council Canada on a research linac whose incident electron parameters are independently known. Automated <b>transmission</b> <b>measurements</b> are made on-axis, down to a transmission value of 2 ̆ 23 c 1. 7, for eight beams between 10 MV (the lowest stable MV beam on the linac) and 30 MV, using fully stopping Be, Al, and Pb bremsstrahlung targets and no fattening filters. To diversify energy differentiation, data are acquired for each beam using low-Z and high-Z attenuators (C and Pb) and Farmer chambers with low-Z and high-Z buildup caps. Experimental corrections are applied for beam drifts (2), polarity (2. 5 typical maximum, 6 extreme), ion recombination (0. 2), leakage (0. 3), and room scatter (0. 8) -the values in parentheses are the largest corrections applied. The experimental setup and the detectors are modeled using EGSnrc, with the newly added photonuclear attenuation included (up to a 5. 6 effect). A detailed sensitivity analysis is carried out for the measured and calculated transmission data. Results: The developed experimental protocol allows for <b>transmission</b> <b>measurements</b> with 0. 4 uncertainty on the smallest signals. Suggestions for accurate <b>transmission</b> <b>measurements</b> are provided. Measurements and EGSnrc calculations agree typically within 0. 2 for the sensitivity of the transmission values to the detector details, to the bremsstrahlung target material, and to the incident electron energy. Direct comparison of the measured and calculated transmission data shows agreement better than 2 for C (3. 4 for the 10 MV beam) and typically better than 1 for Pb. The differences can be explained by acceptable photon cross section changes of 0. 4. Conclusions: Accurate <b>transmission</b> <b>measurements</b> require accounting for a number of influence quantities which, if ignored, can collectively introduce errors larger than 10. Accurate transmission calculations require the use of the most accurate data and physics options available in EGSnrc, particularly the more accurate bremsstrahlung angular sampling option and the newly added modeling of photonuclear attenuation. Comparison between measurements and calculations implies that EGSnrc is accurate within 0. 2 for relative ion chamber response calculations. Photon cross section uncertainties are the ultimate limiting factor for the accuracy of the calculated transmission data (Monte Carlo or analytical). 9 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

30|$|The {{sound field}} {{simulations}} can also demonstrate {{the relationship between}} the <b>transmission</b> <b>measurement</b> for the evaluation of the seam loop c and the degree of adhesive filling in seam areas a or b. The simulation results show that under identical excitation, detection and evaluation range the integral energy method within a gate G of a seam completely filled with air is 2.1 times greater than {{in the case of a}} seam bond completely filled with adhesive. This deviation between OK and not okay bonding is already reduced to 1.4 times if the defect area only extends to seam loop C. Subsequently, the selective evaluation of seam loop C by <b>transmission</b> <b>measurement</b> is only possible if this result is used in connection with the results of the pulse echo measurement of seam areas a or b. Consequently there are two conditions for the test of the adhesive filling of the seam loop C. First the position in x and y direction of the seam in the sensor must be within a certain range (±  1  mm). This is ensured by three impulse echo measurements of the arrays A, B and C. The second condition assumes a complete filling of the seam areas a and b. This is checked by the ultrasonic system. Only if both conditions for a test position are fulfilled, the validation of the seam area c is possible. In the present case, a negative adhesive evaluation for areas a and b has been established by the pulse echo measurement of arrays A and B. Subsequently, because of {{the relationship between the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>measurement</b> and the degree of adhesive filling of areas a and b, no result of the <b>transmission</b> <b>measurement</b> for the evaluation of seam loop c can be indicated for this test position.|$|R
