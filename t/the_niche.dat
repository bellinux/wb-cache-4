5|$|The panel {{seems to}} be the {{left-hand}} wing of a dismantled diptych, perhaps with the Saint George and the Dragon panel now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. As an early van der Weyden, it takes influence from Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck. Van der Weyden served his apprenticeship under Campin, and the older master's style is noticeable in the architecture of <b>the</b> <b>niche,</b> the Virgin's facial type, her exposed breast and the treatment of her hair.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{space is}} bathed in soft light, probably an influence from Jan van Eyck. The light {{falls from the}} right, throwing shadows of both Mary and the Child's heads on the left wall of <b>the</b> <b>niche.</b> The Virgin and Child are shown seated in a small Gothic chapel or oratory projecting from a wall and opening onto a lawn. The painting pays very close attention to small realistic detail; for example, there are four small holes above each arch, likely to hold scaffolding.|$|E

30|$|OSCs can {{differentiate}} into oocytes and granulosa cells, {{and they}} originate from the bipotential stem cells of the ovarian cortex (Li et al. 2015). This process is facilitated by features of <b>the</b> OSC <b>niche.</b> Specifically, Bukovsky (2011) postulated that factors within <b>the</b> OSC <b>niche</b> control OSC functions. Moreover, <b>the</b> OSC <b>niche</b> contains immune cells and their secreted molecules. <b>The</b> OSC <b>niche</b> is established during early stages of foetal development and consists of committed ovarian MDCs, T cells and vascular endothelial cells. By contrast, <b>the</b> adult OSC <b>niche</b> contains primary MDCs (CD 14 + MDC), activated MDCs ([HLA-DR]+ MDC) and T cells. Therefore, immunity {{plays an important role}} in proliferation and differentiation of germline stem cells.|$|R

Scleractinian skeletons are composed of a form of calcium carbonate known as aragonite. Although they are geologically younger than the tabulate and rugose corals, the aragonite of their skeletons is less readily preserved, and their fossil record is accordingly less complete.|$|E
5|$|Ependymal cells {{actively}} regulate neuronal fate {{specification of}} adult neural precursors through release of Noggin. Beating of the cilia of ependymal cells appears {{to set up}} concentration gradients of guidance molecules, such as cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), to direct migration of neuroblasts, {{such as in the}} RMS. Microglia also actively regulate adult neurogenesis. Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from <b>the</b> <b>niche</b> by unactivated microglia in the adult SGZ. Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult neurogenesis, depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action. In one study, the activation of microglia and recruitment of T cells were suggested to be required for enriched environment-induced SGZ neurogenesis, suggesting a possible role in the RMS.|$|E

He would later substitute Villar in the works of the Sagrada Família. With Leandre Serrallach, he worked on a tram line project to Villa Arcadia in Montjuïc. Eventually, he collaborated with Joan Martorell on the Jesuit church on Carrer Casp and the Salesian convent in Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as the Villaricos church (Almería). He also carried out a project for Martorell for the competition for a new facade for Barcelona cathedral, which was never accepted. His relationship with Martorell, whom he always considered one of his main and most influential masters, brought him unexpected luck; he later recommended Gaudí for the Sagrada Família.|$|E

Age-related resistance is important for both of these pathogens. The facultative saprophyte Pyrenophora was generally a stronger competitor than the biotrophic Puccinia, even experiencing facilitation from the presence of Puccinia when Pyrenophora had the advantage of earlier inoculation. Both pathogen species produced the most spores when they were introduced before the competing species and more spores when introduced simultaneously compared to after the competitor. <b>The</b> pre-interactive <b>niche</b> of Puccinia was larger than <b>the</b> post-interactive <b>niche</b> and sporulation by Puccinia was substantially reduced in environments in which Pyrenophora had high sporulation rates. <b>The</b> pre-interactive <b>niche</b> of Pyrenophora was similar to <b>the</b> post-interactive <b>niche</b> and Pyrenophora had proportionally lower reductions in sporulation due to interspecific competition in <b>the</b> pre-interactive <b>niche...</b>|$|R

This type of stela features the newly installed king in a small hollow and seated on an intricately decorated scaffold, being symbolically lifted into the air. On Stela 25, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk I is seated on a jaguar cushion, reached by a ladder covered in bloody footprints, symbolizing sacrifice. The cushion itself is raised on a reed effigy. The king is covered by a canopy that is symbolic of the sky; crowning the sky is a great celestial bird, an avian version of the Maya god Itzamna.|$|E

5|$|The chapel is unrealistically small {{compared}} to the Virgin; van der Weyden's intention was to emphasise the Virgin's presence while also symbolically representing the Church and the entire doctrine of the Redemption. The panel {{is one of three}} surviving of van der Weyden's in which both Madonna and Child are enclosed in this way. However it is unusual in that <b>the</b> <b>niche</b> exists as a separate feature within the picture, compared to the two other works where the enclosure is coterminous with the edge of the painting, almost as part of the frame, a reason why it is thought to predate The Madonna Standing.|$|E
5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In <b>the</b> <b>niche</b> behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim <b>the</b> <b>niche,</b> typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) {{are the most}} widely studied adult stem cells in vertebrates. Despite this, {{little is known about}} the {{regulation}} of HSC maintenance in their specialized microenvironment. The aim of this thesis was to study the influence of osteogenic hormones on the regulation of HSCs. Thereby we could prove that, although estradiol increases osteoblastic cell numbers and bone mass, it does not have any advantageous effects on <b>the</b> endosteal HSC <b>niche.</b> Surprisingly, estradiol displayed alterations in the microenvironment of <b>the</b> vascular <b>niche,</b> by upregulating distinct adhesion molecules and thereby correlating with an increase of HSCs in <b>the</b> vascular <b>niche.</b> Therefore, we suggest an enhanced retention of HSCs in <b>the</b> vascular <b>niche</b> under <b>the</b> influence of estradiol, also proven by a decrease of HSCs in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of long-term growth hormone (GH) administration, which is known to increase bone mineral density and thereby influence the endosteal HSC microenvironment. We clearly showed increased HSC numbers in the vascular and <b>the</b> endosteal <b>niche</b> of wildtype mice after GH administration. Additionally, we proposed a Janus kinases/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (Jak/STAT) -signaling-dependent mechanism of GH in <b>the</b> endosteal <b>niche.</b> To test this hypothesis, we investigated the influences of GH in a conditionally-mutated mouse model (STAT 5 OB), where Jak/STAT signaling is disrupted in osteoblasts by the loss of STAT 5. Unexpectedly, these mice showed increased numbers of HSCs in <b>the</b> endosteal <b>niche</b> and displayed strikingly enhanced endosteal HSC numbers after GH treatment compared to wildtype controls. Loss of STAT 5 in osteoblasts led to strong activation of STAT 3 and, in particular, STAT 1, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. We proved that Jak/STAT signaling has an important role in <b>the</b> endosteal HSC <b>niche,</b> particularly for <b>the</b> mediation of GH effects. The strong activation of STAT 3 and STAT 1 correlated with the increased numbers of HSCs in <b>the</b> endosteal <b>niche...</b>|$|R

5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus <b>the</b> <b>niche</b> is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E

The expanse in front of the stone slab is designated as a space for offerings, denoted by the depiction of a sacrificed human near the bottom of the monument. The monument was discovered by Teoberto Maler in two pieces on the ground; the front was in good condition, and some pigment was still visible. The glyphs on the upper right have been weathered, but the sides are largely intact. In the 1960s, looters cut the fallen monument into two halves for easier removal. The top portion is currently housed in the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas, whereas the bottom half is in a private collection in Switzerland.|$|E

Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by <b>the</b> <b>niche</b> an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E
