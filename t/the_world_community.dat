5|$|Although the {{government}} of Bhutan goes {{to great lengths to}} prevent outside influences from intruding on Bhutanese culture, Drukair is not immune to problems which affect the airline industry and <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>community</b> at large. In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of oil and the need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E

It was established through a partnership between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) acting through Bioversity International. The CGIAR is a consortium of International Agriculture Research Centers (IARC) and others that each conduct research on and preserve germplasm from a particular crop or animal species. The CGIAR holds one of the world's largest off site collections of plant genetic resources in trust for <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>community.</b> It contains over 500,000 accessions of more than 3,000 crop, forage, and agroforestry species. The collection includes farmers' varieties and improved varieties and, in substantial measure, the wild species from which those varieties were created. National germplasm storage centers include the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, India's National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources, the Taiwan Livestock Research Institute, and the proposed Australian Network of Plant Genetic Resource Centers.|$|E

25|$|Although {{prepared}} to grant formal independence to Southern Rhodesia (now Rhodesia), the British government had adopted {{a policy of}} no independence before majority rule, dictating that colonies with a substantial population of European settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule.

25|$|Canada's Brian Mulroney {{not only}} ran {{on a similar}} {{platform}} but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in January 1989. Mexican presidents Miguel de la Madrid, in the early 1980s and Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president Ronald Reagan attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw {{as an attempt to}} assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>community.</b> Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of privatization and regulation to stimulate the economy.|$|E
25|$|Also {{at about}} this time, the {{attention}} of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>community</b> (as manifested in the UN) {{began to focus on}} the same theme, similarly re-calibrating its concern for minorities into concern for the rights of indigenous peoples. In 1982 the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (then called Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities) was established by a decision of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and in 1985 work began on drafting a declaration of rights (a process which lasted 22 years). In due course, 1993 was proclaimed the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. The following year, the United Nations General Assembly launched the International Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples (1995–2004) and then, on September 13, 2007, it adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.|$|E
25|$|The {{religion}} {{entered a}} new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released addressing <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>community</b> {{on the importance of}} such activities.

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio–economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Aside from continuing the various schools Bahá'í musicians from 14 countries met for an international conference including Charles Wolcott, which served as an exhibition of indigenous dance and music, a memorial to Bahá'ís suffering Persecution and an opportunity to toured a local children's hospital, an orphanage, a school and a local theatre to play for children and staff – two traveling musicians joined the religion during the events.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, the {{reconstruction}} process of Afghanistan began in 2002. There {{are more than}} 14,000 reconstruction projects under way in Afghanistan, such as the Kajaki and the Salma Dam. Many of these projects are being supervised by the Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The World Bank contribution is the multilateral Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), which {{was set up in}} 2002. It is financed by 24 international donor countries and has spent more than $1.37 billion as of 2007. Approximately 30 billion dollars have been provided by the international community for {{the reconstruction}} of Afghanistan, most of it from the United States. In 2002, <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>community</b> allocated $4 billion at the Tokyo conference followed by another $4 billion in 2004. In February 2006, $10.5 billion were committed for Afghanistan at the London Conference and $11 billion from the United States in early 2007. Despite these vast investments by the international community, the reconstruction effort's results have been mixed. Implementation of development projects at the district and sub-district level has been frequently marred by lack of coordination, knowledge of local conditions, and sound planning on the side of international donors as well as by corruption and inefficiency on the side of Afghan government officials. On the provincial and national level, projects such as the National Solidarity Programme, inter-provincial road construction, and the US-led revamping of rural health services have met with more success. As NATO prepares to withdraw the majority of remaining ISAF troops by the end of 2014, whether the Afghan government will be able to sustain the developmental gains made over the past 12 years, and to what extent international civilian aid organizations will be able to continue operations or refocus their efforts based on lessons learned, remains to be seen.|$|E
