The Battle of Brunanburh: A Casebook, edited by Michael Livingston, was published by the University of Exeter Press in 2011; it includes two alternative translations of the poem and essays on the battle and the poem.|$|E

5|$|Part of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> {{quoted in}} {{an episode of}} Penny Dreadful, when Lucifer appears to Vanessa Ives to tempt her, and quotes the poem in his conversation.|$|E
50|$|A short {{animated}} film based on <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> released by Soyuztelefilm studio in Russia in 1992, directed by Yulian Kalisher. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> translated into Russian by Oleg Yegorov.|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the best-known}} lines in <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>were</b> {{revisions}} of Lawson's originals by David McKee Wright when <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> being prepared for publication in Lawson's Selected Poems in 1918.|$|R
5000|$|A {{performed}} {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> included on <b>the</b> 1997 album Closed on Account of Rabies, though {{the name of}} <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> given as [...] "The City and the Sea".|$|R
5|$|Tennyson {{originally}} {{blocked out}} the poem in four paragraphs, broken before lines 6, 33 and 44. In this structure, {{the first and}} third paragraphs are thematically parallel, but may be read as interior and exterior monologues, respectively. However, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> often printed with the first paragraph break omitted.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> a lyrical {{description}} {{of the life of}} a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of Tennyson in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between {{the lives of the people}} living here and those in England. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> {{written from}} a first person point of view, and {{contains}} five quatrains. Below is {{the text in}} both its original Middle English, with spelling intact, and a modern translation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> {{preserved}} on a sixth-century {{piece of}} parchment discovered in Egypt, along with four other fragments of Sappho. This papyrus, Papyrus Berol. 9722, {{is part of the}} collection of the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. Parts of ten strophes of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>are</b> preserved. Only two lines of the first stanza of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>are</b> preserved, showing that at least one line is missing.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> {{carved in}} <b>the</b> 1840s. A stone, {{including}} a transcription and rubbing of <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> <b>was</b> erected {{close to the}} tree in 1994 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the carving.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> sung in Disney's 1951 Alice in Wonderland film. In it, the Dormouse drowsily recited {{it at the}} tea party. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> later sung {{again at}} Alice's trial, and taken down as [...] "important" [...] evidence.|$|R
5|$|Tolkien {{argues that}} the {{original}} poem has almost been lost {{under the weight of}} the scholarship on it; that Beowulf must be seen as a poem, not just as a historical document; and that the quality of its verse and its structure give it a powerful effect. He rebuts suggestions that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> an epic or exciting narrative, likening it instead to a strong masonry structure built of blocks that fit together. He points out that the poem's theme is a serious one, mortality, and that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> in two parts: the first on Beowulf as a young man, defeating Grendel and his mother; the second on Beowulf in old age, going to his death fighting the dragon.|$|E
5|$|Burnt Norton is {{the first}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets. He created it while working on his play Murder in the Cathedral and it was first {{published}} in his Collected Poems 1909â€“1935 (1936). The poem's title refers to a Cotswolds manor house Eliot visited. The manor's garden served as an important image within the poem. Structurally, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> based on Eliot's The Waste Land with passages of the poem related to those excised from Murder in the Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Coleridge {{began work}} on The Eolian Harp in August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. It details their future union and was inspired by {{his visit to the}} house in Clevedon that would serve as their home after their wedding. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> infused by the fact that Coleridge took an idealised view of his life with Fricker.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> later {{expanded}} into <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>The</b> Day-Dream, which <b>was</b> published in 1842. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> altered in 1848 for a dramatic performance {{for a private}} gathering. In that version, Tennyson played {{the part of the}} Prince who was to wake up the sleeping woman.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> {{praised by}} Vissarion Belinsky who admired the {{character}} of Arseny, a rebel, defying both his master and the church. The critic admitted <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> far from perfect but considered it [...] "more precious than many mature, artfully executed works." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in Marshall's book, Ulster Sails West, which was {{published in}} 1911. A mural in Newtownards displays a verse of <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> also put to music and recorded by the Ulster Scots Folk Orchestra and verse was used by the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland in their Emigration Series publication.|$|R
5|$|In Belgium, the In Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres, {{named after}} the poem and devoted to the First World War, is {{situated}} in one of Flanders' largest tourist areas. A monument commemorating the writing of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> located at Essex Farm Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, which {{is thought to have}} been the location of Helmer's burial and lies within the John McCrae Memorial Site.|$|E
5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|In the manuscript, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> called Romans de la Rose (l. 11), {{and hence}} Le Roman de la Rose, {{but it is}} often {{referred}} to as Roman de la Rose, or Guillaume de Dole in order to avoid confusion with Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun's Roman de la Rose; Guillaume de Dole is a subtitle added by Fauchet.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> rewritten many times, {{and other}} titles {{of the later}} {{versions}} include [...] "Effusion", Written in Early Youth, The Time, An Autumnal Evening, and An Effusion on an Autumnal Evening. Written in Early Youth. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> included in Coleridge's 1796 collection with publications following in 1797, 1803, 1828, 1829, and 1834. It is documented that, on 7 November 1793, Coleridge read <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> to his friends from college. Of those hearing <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> Christopher Wordsworth, William Wordsworth's younger brother, that later described Coleridge's poem [...] "sickly diction".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Poems</b> <b>were</b> {{published}} in 1656.|$|R
5000|$|The late Liam Buckley who {{was born}} in the cottage {{immediately}} adjacent to the Cliffs of Dooneen has stated <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> penned by Jack McAuliffe who had travelled from Lixnaw to Beale to visit his sister. Jack had spent time with locals in the fields above and shore below the cliffs. He then visited Bill and Nell Buckley's cottage, known as [...] "99" [...] a few hundred metres away - for tea and scones. Liam was told by his mother (Jack's host) that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> written at <b>the</b> kitchen window of the cottage. Liam says <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> put to music years later by a local musician. Liam did not know <b>the</b> date <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> written but he remembers it from the 1930s.|$|R
5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{contend that}} the seemingly Christian nature of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> due to Virgil referencing Eastern oracles, {{which may have been}} influenced by Jewish texts and prophecies. For instance, Robin Nisbet, after carefully analyzing the work, ultimately concluded that Virgil probably appropriated some elements used in the poem from Jewish mythology by means of Eastern oracles, and later adapted them towards Western (which is to say, Roman) modes of thought.|$|E
5|$|Other images, such as Thalaba {{reclaiming}} his father's magic sword, are {{symbols that}} effectively reinforce Southey's moral themes. However, these events represent the {{minority of the}} plot and are rarely relied on early in the story. To the contrary, the heavily represented magic ring is used to protect Thalaba with little explanation as to how it works {{and there is no}} moral statements tied to its use. As a whole, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> able to portray scenery and events in strongly descriptive manners, but the manner in doing this takes away from their meaning and effect. In terms of religious imagery, Islam within <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> more similar to Zoroastrian thought and morality. Other religious images lose their power as Southey removes any mystical aspects of them, including Simorgh being stripped of it being a symbol of harmony with life. In terms of the divine, there is a dual entity: Allah representing preservation and Eblis representing destruction. However, evil, though an opposite to good, is never explained but merely used to further the plot.|$|E
5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E
50|$|In August 1971, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in Success Unlimited magazine, without permission from Robert L. Bell. In a 1976 {{lawsuit against the}} magazine's publisher, Combined Registry Company, the court ruled (and subsequently the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld) that copyright had <b>been</b> forfeited because <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> had <b>been</b> authorized for publication without a copyright notice in the 1940s - and that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> therefore in <b>the</b> public domain.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> first {{published}} in the Irish Monthly in December 1886. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> then published in a compilation of work by several Irish poets Poems and Ballads of Young Ireland in 1888 with several critics praising <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> It <b>was</b> later published in his first book of poetry The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems as well as Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> {{abandoned}} before Keats's death.|$|R
5|$|The oldest known {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> the Northumbrian aelda recension. The {{surviving}} witnesses to this text, Cambridge, University Library, Kk. 5. 16 (M) and St. Petersburg, National Library of Russia, lat. Q. v. I. 18 (P), date {{to at least}} the mid-8th century. M in particular is traditionally ascribed to Bede's own monastery and lifetime, though {{there is little evidence}} to suggest it was copied much before the mid-8th century.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> a {{detailed}} description of several objects, including a photo album and the camera that took the pictures in it, and is essentially about the nostalgia that the speaker, presumably Gibson himself, feels towards the details of his family's history: the painstaking descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars they drove, and even their pets.|$|E
5|$|The {{thought as}} enounced {{in the first}} stanza is the {{supremacy}} of ideal art over Nature, because of its unchanging expression of perfect; and this is true and beautiful; but its amplification in <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>is</b> unprogressive, monotonous, and scattered... which gives an effect of poverty {{in spite of the}} beauty. The last stanza enters stumbling upon a pun, but its concluding lines are very fine, and make a sort of recovery with their forcible directness.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> widely banned {{upon its}} 1928 publication, first in Boston, for having content viewed as wild as the titular party. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> a success despite, {{and perhaps in}} part due to, the {{controversy}} surrounding the work, although March's subsequent projects were more mainstream.|$|R
5000|$|Birchenbaum and [...] "En annan ny visa" [...] were {{forgotten}} {{until the}} mid-nineteenth century, when <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> rediscovered by <b>the</b> antiquarian Per Hanselli. It {{was first published}} in 1896. Before the authorship <b>was</b> established, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> <b>was</b> attributed to a seventeenth-century Swedish poet, Lars Wivallius.|$|R
