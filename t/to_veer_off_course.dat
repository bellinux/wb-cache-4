The aircrew of the 51st Troop Carrier Wing had {{difficulty}} with navigation and formation flying at night. The aircraft were buffeted by high winds, subjected to flak which caused some aircraft <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> <b>off</b> <b>course,</b> and encountered poor visibility. No aircraft were lost but only 12 of the 133 gliders reached the landing zone, while 47 came down in the sea. The simultaneous American operation, which involved 226 C-47s [...] of the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing carrying 2,781 paratroops, encountered similar problems, resulting in the drop being widely scattered. Less than one-sixth of the paratroops landing on or near the intended drop zone.

50|$|The extreme {{variations}} in rainfall are {{linked with the}} monsoons. Generally speaking, there is a dry season (June to October), influenced by the Australian continental air masses, and a rainy season (November to March) that is caused by Asia and Pacific Ocean air masses. Local wind patterns, however, can greatly modify these general wind patterns, especially in the islands of central Maluku—Seram, Ambon, and Buru. This oscillating annual pattern of wind and rain is related to Indonesia's geographical location as an isthmus between two large continents. In September and May, high pressure over the Gobi desert moves winds from that continent toward the northwest. As the winds reach the equator, the Earth's rotation causes them <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> <b>off</b> their original <b>course</b> in a northeasterly direction toward the Southeast Asian mainland. During January and February, a corresponding low pressure system over Asia causes the pattern to reverse. The result is a monsoon which is augmented by humid breezes from the Indian Ocean, producing significant amounts of rain throughout {{many parts of the}} Malay Archipelago. See also monsoon trough.|$|R

5000|$|The Agni-II {{is always}} in a ready-to-fire mode and can be {{launched}} within 15 minutes {{as compared to the}} almost half-of-a-day preparation time for the previous generation Agni-TD. In May 2001, and again in July 2001, the then-incumbent Defence Minister Jaswant Singh informed the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) that the Agni-II missile is operational, limited production had begun and induction being planned during 2001-2002. On 14 March 2002, Defence Minister George Fernandes informed Indian Parliament that the Agni-II has entered the production phase and is under induction. Agni-II is made by BDL in Hyderabad, with a production capacity of 18 missiles/year and costs about [...] 35 crore for each missile. On 19 May 2009, user trial of Agni-II was undertaken by Indian Army, while DRDO scientists provided required logistical support. The Agni-II missile was tested at 1006 hrs IST from a defence base in Orissa. The missile was test fired from launch pad-4 from Integrated Test Range. Integrated Test Range is the missile testing facility on the Wheeler Island, near Dhamara in the district of Bhadrak. Initially it was announced by Indian media that India has successfully tested the nuclear capable Agni-II missile from a defence base in Orissa. According to official sources, the aim of the test was to give the Indian Army confidence to fire the missile on its own. The May 2009 test however ended in failure of the Agni II when the second stage failed to operate correctly and the missile started <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> wildly <b>off</b> <b>course.</b> In a subsequent re-test at night time on Nov 2009, the missile once again failed completely at the second stage, this time dropping directly into the sea. On 17 May 2010, the missile was flight-tested successfully from Wheeler Island off the Orissa coast. The flight lasted 660 seconds, with the missile achieving its full range, after which it splashed into the sea at the predesignated target. A new navigation system which provides better accuracy as well as the capability, to manoeuvre and defeat anti-ballistic missiles was tested during the trial. This was a training trial by the Indian Army. On 30 September 2011 another successful launch of Agni-II was conducted from Balasore, Orissa. The missile was fired from a rail mobile launcher and struck target 2000 km away within 10 minutes of launch, meeting all the performance parameters of the mission such as velocity, terminal phase, trajectory and destruction of the warhead. Another test was done on 9 August 2012, when the missile was successfully launched from Orissa by the Strategic Forces Command {{as a part of a}} training exercise.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} classical Greek heroes {{were believed to}} suffer from a physical, mental, and spiritual illness shown negatively to alter their general state of being. Attributed to an excess of black bile in the body, the earliest documented form of this ailment {{came to be known}} as "melancholy;" paramount among its effects was the emergence of a severely split being sincerely pursuing Virtue, yet markedly susceptible to the Passions that threatened <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> him <b>off</b> his <b>course.</b> In the Middle Ages, traces of melancholy are found in the sin of acedia still today considered a rather "medieval" vice. Globally defined as a state of "general apathy," acedia was believed more egregiously to affect solitary religious figures devoted to prayer. The dawn of Humanism in Western Europe, however, saw this notion extended to the more general scholar, and featured as (arguably) its first protagonist, 14 th-century humanist Francesco Petrarca. The manifestations of this malady pervade his oeuvre as a whole: repeatedly in his immense repertoire, Petrarch - at least in his proliferation of an artistic or lyrical "io" or self [...] surfaces as a fragmented if not strictly binary figure both tormented by his incumbent passions and resolutely determined to overcome them. Petrarch's often autobiographical figures are ruled by conflicting inner forces which leave them paralysed, indecisive, and helpless before Fortune, in a new position foreshadowing the anthropocentric and, to a degree, "bipartite" "modernity" soon to flood the continent. Through a close reading of three of his most celebrated texts - the Secretum, De Remediis Utriusque Fortunae, and the Canzoniere, this study will seek to posit Petrarch as a fundamentally melancholic and "accidioso" writer whose condition of internal and social rupture more generally speaks to the emerging "crisis of modernity" which he perhaps first sets to the center stage of his period...|$|R

Glenn later appears at Rick's meeting where they discuss how {{to get rid of the}} walker herd in the quarry. Glenn tells Maggie that she should stay in Alexandria and watch over Deanna who is still devastated over the deaths of Aiden and Reg. Maggie tells Glenn that's not the only reason he wants her to stay and Glenn acknowledges this. Glenn notices Nicholas and looks at him in disapproval. Nicholas raises his hand and says he wants to help Rick with the plan as they are going to need all help he can get. After Glenn sees this he offers to go too likely to watch Nicholas. Glenn later appears with he and Nicholas helping to build the wall to lure the walkers away. Glenn notices Maggie and Tara hugging which he smiles at. Glenn and Nicholas are later seen at the hardware store they are assigned at to clear out. Glenn tells Nicholas that he will be keeping a close eye on him from now on. Nicholas tells him he just wants to help which Glenn says he can. At a shop between Alexandria and the quarry, Glenn, Heath, and Nicholas are tasked with killing a group of walkers trapped inside, so the noise made by the trapped walkers won't distract the approaching herd <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> <b>off</b> <b>course.</b> Glenn initially refuses to let Nicholas help, but Nicholas insists, and he saves Heath from being bitten by a walker. Later in the episode [...] "Thank You" [...] Glenn volunteers to start a distraction fire. Going with Nicholas, they run from the herd into a dead end alleyway, where they kill as many walkers as they can, but get trapped on top of a dumpster. Nicholas has a panic attack, says [...] "Thank you" [...] to Glenn, and shoots himself in the head. His body falls against Glenn, knocking him off the dumpster and into the herd of walkers. He is last seen lying on the ground underneath Nicholas' body, as the walkers begin to eat it. In the episode [...] "Now," [...] Maggie reveals that she is pregnant with Glenn's child. In the episode [...] "Heads Up," [...] Glenn is seen escaping from underneath the dumpster. He is then found by Enid, whom he talks into returning with him to Alexandria.

40|$|Passion of the Mao is {{the quirky}} {{documentary}} produced by Lee Feigon {{based on his}} book Mao: A Reinterpretation. There’s some things to like about the film. I appreciated the irreverence, {{and there were a}} number of chuckle-worthy jokes and sly references as well as several precipitous descents into banal toilet and body humor. (Some of which, for awhile, are also pretty chuckle-worthy.) Mao’s writings are referenced throughout the film, though Mr. Feigon’s choice to have them read using a voiceover that recalled the worst of the Fu Manchu films from early Hollywood is odd. Mr. Feigon also gives prominence to Mao’s fondness for scatological references and bawdy language. It’s funny and raunchy and, for the most part, unnecessary. Mao was the kind of guy who liked young girls, disliked bathing, and enjoyed the occasional fart joke. Okay, I got it. Next. In terms of history, the first half of the film is quite good. The occasional surrealist cartoon or madcap aside doesn’t distract from a pretty solid narrative that hits the high points of Mao’s early career, a narrative which is interwoven nicely with the larger story of the Communist Revolution. But like that revolution, the movie starts <b>to</b> <b>veer</b> <b>off</b> <b>course</b> after we get to 1949. Mr. Feigon does well to reminds us that the early years of the 1950 s were ones of economic growth and relative peace (though not so much if you were declared a landlord or a rightist). His treatment of elite politics in this era centers on a portrayal of Peng Dehuai as a “Judas” figure whose long-standing grudge against Mao led to an ill-fated showdown at Lushan. It’s an intriguing re-telling of the Mao-Peng dynamic, but to cast Peng as having sold out Mao for 30 pieces of Soviet silver in this CCP passion play comes off a bit disingenuous given that there is little (if any) mention of the downfall of Lin Biao...|$|E
