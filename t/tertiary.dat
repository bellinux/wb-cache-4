40|$|Cosmic-ray {{secondaries}} and <b>tertiaries</b> {{have been}} studied {{in a series of}} experiments. It has been shown that the secondaries from lead have little power to produce detectable <b>tertiaries</b> or showers from lead or aluminum. The secondaries from aluminum have been found to produce more showers in lead than the secondaries from air. The absorption coefficient of the secondaries from aluminum {{has been found to be}} 0. 7 cm- 1 Pb and the absorption coefficient of their lead <b>tertiaries</b> 2. 0 cm- 1 Pb. The values for secondaries from air and a heavy roof, and their lead <b>tertiaries</b> were previously found to be 0. 5 cm- 1 Pb and 2. 58 cm - 1 Pb. The values obtained from Rossi's and Funfer's data are 0. 32 cm- 1 Pb for the air secondaries and 1. 18 cm - 1 Pb for their lead <b>tertiaries.</b> It follows that the air secondaries and their lead <b>tertiaries</b> have greater energies than the aluminum secondaries and their lead <b>tertiaries.</b> It has been found that a component of the cosmic rays even softer than the corpuscular component is probably the chief source of the secondaries producing the showers. There is some evidence that non-ionizing particles produce a portion of the showers and that possibly non-ionizing secondaries are produced in lead and that these particles can produce ionizing particles in aluminum...|$|R

50|$|In time a {{tendency}} set in {{for members of}} the Third Order to live together in community, and in this way congregations were formed who took the usual religious vows and lived a fully organized religious life based on the Rule of the Third Order with supplementary regulations. These congregations are the Regular <b>Tertiaries</b> as distinguished from the Secular <b>Tertiaries,</b> who lived in the world, according to the original idea. The Regular <b>Tertiaries</b> are in the full technical sense religious, and there have been, and are, many congregations of them, both of men and of women.|$|R

50|$|The Third Order {{was active}} in Dublin during the medieval period. There were <b>tertiaries</b> {{assisting}} the Conventual Franciscans at Drogheda in 1855. Although the friary closed in 2000, the Secular Franciscans continue to meet in Drogheda. A renewal of the Third Order in Dublin began around 1860. Merchants Quay was later turned into a Third Order Centre with rooms where <b>tertiaries</b> could meet and relax. A fraternity was established by the Capuchins in Cork in 1866, another in Kilkenny.|$|R

5|$|Tiruvannamali is {{a temple}} town {{and a major}} pilgrimage centre in Tamil Nadu. The town is the {{marketing}} and service town for the surrounding places. Being the administrative headquarters of the Tiruvannamalai district, Tiruvannamalai {{has a lot of}} <b>tertiary</b> sector activities. Trade and commerce and service activities are the major contributors to the economy of the town. In 1991, 7.93% of the population was involved in primary sector, 21.34% in secondary sector and 70.73% in <b>tertiary</b> sector activities. The town had a female work participation of 11%. Due to the urbanisation from 1971, there has been dip in primary sector activities and a proportional increase in the <b>tertiary</b> sector activities. There is limited agricultural activity within the town limits. The secondary sector involves manufacturing and construction, whose growth has remained stable over the decades. There are a number of oil mills, rice mills and agro based industries within the Tiruvannamalai town limits. The <b>tertiary</b> sector activities of trade, commerce, transport, storage, communication and other services has been increasing due to the increasing number of tourists to the town. The patronage to Girivalam has increased informal economic activities around the town. The major commercial activities are concentrated around Car Street, Thiruvoodal Street, Kadambarayan Street, Asaliamman Koil Street, Sivanpada Street and Polur Road.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{serviceable}} authorities on the Franciscan <b>Tertiaries</b> is probably Max Heimbucher, Orden und Kongregationen (1933), ii. f 103, 104, f 105, where an ample bibliography is supplied. The same work gives information on the other <b>Tertiaries</b> {{at the end of}} the sections on the various Orders. Similarly information will be found in Pierre Helyot, Histoire des Ordres religieux (1714), after the chapters on the different Orders. Heimbucher names Tachy, Les Tiers Ordres (1897), and Adderley and Marson, Third Orders (1902).|$|R
50|$|It is {{practically}} impossible to obtain, {{even in a}} vague way, {{the number of the}} secular Dominican <b>Tertiaries.</b> No general register is kept, and the records of each priory would have to be searched. From the time of St. Louis — who wished to join the Dominican and Franciscan Orders (Acta Sanctorum, August, V, 545), and is represented in old illuminations, sometimes in the habit of one, sometimes in the habit of the other (Chapotin, Histoire de dominicains de la province de France, Rouen, 1898, p. 497), but probably never joined either— to our own time, it can be stated only that with {{the rise and fall of}} the First Order's greatness rose and fell the number of the <b>Tertiaries.</b> In England during the 13th century very many are said to have become <b>Tertiaries.</b> But of this nothing for certain can be specified.|$|R
50|$|There can {{be little}} doubt, {{whatever}} counter claims may be set up, that the Third Order was one of St. Francis' creations, and that his Third Order was the exemplar after which the others were fashioned; but at an early date the other Mendicant Orders formed Third Orders on the same lines, and so there came into being Dominican <b>Tertiaries,</b> and Carmelite, and Augustinian, and Servite, and also Premonstratensian and many others. These followed the same lines of development as the Franciscan <b>Tertiaries,</b> {{and for the most}} part divided into the two branches of regular and secular <b>Tertiaries.</b> The Rules of the various Third Orders have proved very adaptable to the needs of modern congregations devoted to active works of charity; and so a great number of teaching and nursing congregations of women belong to one or other of the Third Orders.|$|R

5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early <b>Tertiary,</b> there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the <b>tertiary,</b> the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E
