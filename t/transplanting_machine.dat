40|$|Background: Owing to the {{shortage}} of donors, organs with an increased risk potential such as grafts recovered from expanded criteria donors are increasingly being used in <b>transplants.</b> <b>Machine</b> perfusion (MP) technology offers the possibility of determining the biomarkers in the perfusion solution so that conclusions might be drawn regarding the effectiveness of organ preservation and organ viability. Methods: All kidneys from the MP arm of our multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of MP whose donors were aged 55 years or older {{were included in the}} present study. The biomarkers, total glutathione-S-transferase (GST), alpha-GST, and pi-GST and markers for lipid peroxidation and cell decay were determined in the MP perfusate and correlated with the outcomes after kidney transplantation. Results: A total of 111 machine perfused kidneys were included in the present study. The mean donor age was 64. 1 +/- 6. 6 y. The average cold ischemic time was 13. 8 +/- 5. 3 h. Total GST, alpha-GST, and lipid peroxidation markers were significantly elevated at the end of MP. However, according to the multivariate analysis, only the lipid peroxidation markers were independent predictors of delayed graft function after transplantation. Conclusions: Our data suggest that routine determination of lipid peroxidation markers in the perfusate of expanded criteria donor kidneys can provide the opportunity to identify the kidneys that have sustained severe oxidative damage and should be excluded from transplantation. Additional analysis of a larger cohort with more primary nonfunction cases is needed to confirm these findings. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{describe}} a comprehensive framework for knowledge discovery from medical records called SDM-Miner. The records are created before, {{during and after}} pancreatic islet cell transplantation 1 {{on a group of}} diabetic patients. The knowledge discovery focuses on selecting the most relevant variables for predicting the outcome of islet cell transplants temporally, and supporting the medical understanding of the variable relationships that would lead to insulin-free outcome of a <b>transplant</b> with <b>machine</b> learning models. The challenges of knowledge discovery lie in the temporally sparse nature of medical records and the large number of variables which make the traditional statistical analyses ineffective. Our approach to overcome the challenges is to combine data-driven computationally intensive modeling with statistical modeling. The framework incorporates this approach during three phases of knowledge discovery including (1) statistical data-preprocessing, (2) pattern search based dimensionality reduction, and (3) association rule based and conditional probability based data-driven modeling. We evaluate the framework by cross validating the models (of machine learning) using prediction errors and uncertainty of rule discovery. In order to demonstrate the novelty of the framework and the improved performance in knowledge discovery, we report results using real and synthetic datasets. Experimental results on synthetic data act as a sanity check in order to verify the effectiveness of our models in the absence of standard test results. The evaluation results show that our framework led to smaller mean error with the decreasing number of variable samples, higher robustness to Gaussian noise, and higher confidence and support of association rules than the previous methods. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed technique using existing machine learning algorithms such using the Weka toolkit and show the improved performance of our work as compared to previous approaches...|$|R

We therefore studied the pharmacologic protection of <b>transplant</b> kidneys during <b>machine</b> cold perfusion. Human kidney perfusates were analyzed for the presence of injury markers such as cytochrome c oxidase, lactate dehydrogenase, and neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), and MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 were measured. The effects of MMP inhibitors MMP- 2 siRNA and doxycycline were studied in an animal model of donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD). Markers of injury were present in all analyzed perfusates, with higher levels seen in perfusates from human kidneys donated after controlled DCDD compared to brain death and in perfusate from kidneys with delayed graft function. When rat kidneys were perfused at 4 °C for 22 hours with the addition of MMP inhibitors, this resulted in markedly reduced levels of MMP- 2, MMP- 9 and analyzed injury markers. Based on our study, MMPs are involved in preservation injury and the supplementation of preservation solution with MMP inhibitors is a potential novel strategy in protecting the transplant kidney from preservation injury...|$|R

Transplanting is a possible method to convert a cool-season to a warmseason turfgrass in untilled soil. It generally requires the chemical desiccation of the cool-season turfgrass. However, alternative physical methods, like flaming and steaming, are also available. This paper compares flaming, steaming, and herbicide application to desiccate cool-season turfgrass, for conversion to hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x C. transvaalensis) in untilled soil, using <b>transplanting.</b> Two prototype <b>machines</b> were used, a self-propelled steaming machine and a tractor-mounted liquefied petroleum gas flaming machine. Treatments compared in this work were two flaming treatments and two steaming treatments performed at four different doses together with two chemical treatments with glufosinateammonium herbicide applications.

The desiccation effect of the various treatments on cool-season turf was assessed by photographic survey 15 days after treatment. The percentage cover of hybrid bermudagrass was visually assessed at 43 weeks after planting. Steaming and flaming effects on both parameters were described by logistic curves.

40|$|Introduction In {{recent years}} {{due to lack}} of water {{resources}} in our country, planting of bare root seedlings of onion has been welcomed by farmers. Considering the desired high dense planting of Iranian farmers, lack of proper <b>transplanting</b> <b>machine</b> has appeared as the main problem. To overcome this problem, some researchers tested a few methods, but none of them reached to complete successfully. As the one of last efforts, Taki and Asadi (2012) developed a semi-automatic <b>transplanting</b> <b>machine</b> with 9 planting units. This machine requires to 9 men to separate and single out a bunch of seedlings. Usage of this machine is very time-consuming and labor intensive. In Iran, transplanting of bare root seedlings is practically performed by hand with a density of 700 - 800 thousand plants at hectare. The main {{purpose of this study was}} designed, manufacture, and evaluation of an automatic metering device that with the separation and singulars of bare root seedlings of onion could get a high density planting. Materials and Methods Fig. 1 shows the main employed idea of this research for separation and single out a bunch of seedlings. As shown in Fig. 1, the metering device consisted of two carrying and separating belts with different teeth forms. Placing seedling bunches between the two belts, the belts move at different speeds in opposite directions and separate seedlings from their bunch. For proper design of metering device system, measurement of some physical properties were necessary. The obtained information was used to select two belts form. A belt with flexible plastic teethes with a height of 6 mm and the distance of 4 mm was selected as separator while for carrier, two types of belts were selected: the first was the same as a separator and the second was made of metal teethes. Based on the average thickness of seedling bunch and some pre-tests, the horizontal angle of separator belt determined as α= 20 degrees. Theoretical calculations were done to computatingof the needed force of the system. In this section, seedlings were modeled as some solid cylinders with a length of 200 and a diameter of 10 mm. In the mentioned system, it was necessary that the speed of separator belt is more than the speed of carrier belt. Thus, ratio of two linear velocities () of 1. 67 and 2. 32 were considered for evaluation of the system. For evaluation of manufactured metering device, the effects of three factors, i. e., carrier belt type, ratio of linear velocities of the belts, and number of seedlings in a bunch (n = 30 and n = 60), on qualitative planting parameters were studied in a factorial experiment based on completely randomized design with three replications. The studied qualitative planting parameters were miss index, consumed seedlings, miss length, quality of feed index, multiple index, mean, and damaged seedlings. Results and Discussion The results of analysis of variance showed that, except of belt type, effects of the two studied factors and all interactions are statistically non-significant on consumed seedlings and miss length indexes. The results indicated significant differences between miss index (P< 0. 01), multiple index (P< 0. 05), and mean (P< 0. 05) as affected by belt type. None of the studied variable had a significant effect on damaged seedlings. Interactions of belt type and ratio of linear velocities significantly affected the quality of feed index (P < 0. 01). An increase in ratio of linear velocities in plastic toothed belt lead to decrease of mean and miss indexes, whereas in case of metal toothed belt there is no significant effect on this two indexes. The results also showed that increase of linear velocities for the two types of carrier belt lead to increase of consumed seedlings and decrease of miss length. At the two ratios of linear velocities, miss length in metal toothed is less than plastic toothed belt. Conclusions Commercial transplanting machines are not suitable for dense planting of onion. In this research an automatic metering device for separation and singularize of bare root seedlings of onion was manufactured and evaluated. The results indicated that the carrier belt with long and rigid teeth, having an angle of attack, could separate seedlings more efficiently. The results also showed a 80 percent increased in uniformity of plant seedlings distances is reachable using the metering system...|$|E
