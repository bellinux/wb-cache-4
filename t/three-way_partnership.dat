5000|$|In the 1920s, {{the best}} boxing {{promoters}} and managers {{were instrumental in}} bringing boxing to new audiences and provoking media and public interest. Arguably {{the most famous of}} all <b>three-way</b> <b>partnerships</b> (fighter-manager-promoter) was that of Jack Dempsey (Heavyweight Champion, 1919-1926), his manager Jack Kearns, and Rickard as promoter. Together they grossed US$8.4 million in only five fights between 1921 and 1927 and ushered in a [...] "golden age" [...] of popularity for professional boxing in the 1920s. They were also responsible for the first live radio broadcast of a title-fight and the first million-dollar fight (Dempsey v. Georges Carpentier in 1921).|$|R
40|$|In the 1970 s, {{research}} libraries developed {{data systems}} and expertise that, in the 1990 s, led to new {{services such as}} institutional repositories and journal hosting and, in the 2000 s, led to forays into monograph publishing. In contrast, also beginning in the 1970 s, university presses found themselves being cast out of their traditional role as providers of research publishing services that created the public record of knowledge and into the marketplace. Continued development of information and communication technology (ICT) in library operations and in research activity stimulated entrepreneurship and scholar/library partnerships with scholar-controlled digital journal publishing. Again in contrast, the market orientation of university presses, combined {{with a lack of}} appreciation in the library community for the value added by professional publishers, hampered the extension of collaboration into <b>three-way</b> <b>partnerships</b> among scholars, libraries, and publishing professionals. Recognition of the roles of all parties holds the greatest promise for the evolution of digital scholarly publishing...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{development}} of the United States’ non-profit sector in its service and civil society capacities could not have taken the course it did by relying solely on private voluntary contributions. Within the US non-profit sector, there few large “pure” non-profit service providers that rely solely on private donations. However, public-private partnerships are the modus vivendi of America’s contemporary non-profit sector largely because public-private partnerships are a basic characteristic of American politics and social welfare system—not by design but by happenstance. At the turn of the century, however, we are witnessing an emerging trend that could lead to major changes in publicprivate partnerships. As we discuss in this paper, blurring sectoral boundaries have become more frequent, and the role of for-profit firms has become more pronounced. While it is difficult to gauge what the end result of these developments might be, it is safe to assume that more complex forms of partnerships will evolve. Future policy scenarios will increasingly include various combinations among government, business and non-profit providers. What is more, the <b>three-way</b> <b>partnerships</b> of the future will involve organisations no longer strictly bound by their legal form or sector membership. Organisational form may become more project-specific rather than a constant {{as was the case in}} the past...|$|R

Although Eon had wanted to adapt the book in 1962, it had not been possible until the legal obstacles had been cleared. As a result of the settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Kevin McClory, Eon negotiated with McClory to make Thunderball. McClory received the sole producer credit on the film, while Broccoli and Saltzman took the title Executive Producer, although [...] "in reality all three men would essentially act as producers".

50|$|Following the 2006-07 season, Marseille {{sporting}} director José Anigo sought Cheyrou's services after stating he {{was impressed}} with the player's performances during the season. On 21 June 2007, after weeks of discussion, Marseille reached an agreement with Auxerre for the transfer of Cheyrou with the player agreeing to a four-year deal and the southern coast club playing Auxerre €5 million for his services. Cheyrou was presented along with new recruits Gaël Givet and Laurent Bonnart and was assigned the number 7 shirt. Cheyrou made his club debut for the team on 4 August 2007 in a 0-0 draw with Strasbourg. Cheyrou formed an amazing <b>three-way</b> midfield <b>partnership</b> with fellow Frenchman Samir Nasri and the rugged Albanian Lorik Cana. Cheyrou scored two league goals with both coming in draws against Bordeaux and Lens. Marseille finished in 3rd position after falling behind Lyon and Bordeaux during {{the latter part of the}} season. Cheyrou was named to the league's Team of the Year for his performances. He also featured in his first-ever UEFA Champions League and impressed playing the entire match in Marseille's upset victory over English club Liverpool at Anfield. Unfortunately, the club finished third in the group, which meant a return to the UEFA Cup for Cheyrou. In the competition, Marseille reached the Round of 16 before shockingly suffering elimination to Russian club Zenit Saint Petersburg despite being up 3-1 heading into the match at Petrovsky Stadium. Cheyrou scored his only goal in the competition in the team's previous round 3-0 first leg win over Spartak Moscow.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a trend towards music {{curriculum}} documents giving emphasis to composition in upper primary school levels. This emphasis is consistent across current national documents of Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand and the United States. However, while this trend is prevalent, there are counter trends that pose barriers for classroom implementation of composition opportunities for students. These include low primary teacher music confidence and competence, a rarity of specialist music teachers in primary schools, and a lack of time allocated for music education in the primary school programme. The focus of this presentation is an investigation into a proposed approach to resolve these counter trends through a web-based system. The approach involves a New Zealand project called ‘Compose’. The project is a <b>three-way</b> web-based <b>partnership</b> of composition learning and teaching between a music specialist/composer, a generalist teacher and participating students. An initial study has been undertaken to evaluate ‘Compose’ as a way to increase composition opportunities for year 8 (twelve-year-old) students. Pre- and post-data were gathered that estimated the effects of the ‘Compose’ project, using quantitative and qualitative measurements. Data analyses showed increases occurred in student composing opportunities. A specialist’s provision of resources and support strategies enabled the involvement of the generalist teacher in appropriate ways, and acquisition of composition skills and knowledge led to improved student attitudes and confidence about capacity for composition. The flexible delivery afforded by the web-based system contributed to increasing composition outcomes. The initial data indicate that the ‘Compose’ project offers a potentially viable way to increase composition opportunities. Further testing of the project’s viability and wider application is planned. Additional aspects to be examined are the infusion of the project into teacher education by having student teachers work alongside the specialist as comentors to the school students, {{and the role of the}} specialist/composer as perceived by the school student...|$|R

40|$|Urunana (‘Hand in Hand’) is Rwanda’s first radio soap opera. The {{production}} {{emerged during}} the late 1990 s from a <b>three-way</b> transnational production <b>partnership</b> between: The Great Lakes section of the BBC World Service; the Well Woman Media Project of the London-based NGO, Health Unlimited; {{and a group of}} dramatists and broadcasters working in Rwanda. Broadcast by the BBC World Service, the production was initially produced and edited by Health Unlimite. It is now produced by the Urunana Development Communication (see www. urunanadc. org/), which estimated that the program is regularly listened to by almost 70 per cent of Rwandans. 2 Urunana is explicitly adapted for the Rwandan context from the format of a long-running BBC Radio 4 soap opera, The Archers, which dramatises {{the ups and downs of}} rural characters in England (see Bielby and Harrington, 2002; Jordan, 2007 : 7; Soares, 2008). Since 2008, when Urunana won a prestigious media development award for encouraging audiences to discuss safe sex, family planning, and other issues that are generally considered taboo in Rwanda, the program has started to be of interest to researchers in gender, health and media outside the field of ‘edutainment’. 3 Our interest in this article is in exploring how the soap opera is produced, but first of all how it has helped to promote women’s sexual health and mend relationships in post-genocide Rwanda...|$|R
40|$|<b>Three-way</b> or tri-sector <b>partnerships</b> were {{proposed}} in the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg (2002) {{as a way to}} reduce poverty and achieve development targets by 2015 (Warner & Sullivan, 2006). These partnerships are between government, civil society and the private sector, and there is not much research on how such partnerships work in the development world. The purpose of this research is to explore the effectiveness of partnerships between Cambodia’s government, NGOs, and the private sector in Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET), particularly from the NGOs’ perspective. The research methodology used in this study was a qualitative case study. Data was collected from in-depth interviews as well as document analysis, such as NGO’s annual reports, project agreements with Cambodia’s government, and other related documents from three NGOs working in the TVET sector in Phnom Penh. This research used Creswell’s framework (2014) for qualitative data analysis and interpretation. The findings conclude that the tri-sector partnerships within one NGO to that of another NGO are quite different depending on the level of trust and interdependence of the parties. These partnerships between government, the business sector and NGOs are based upon the belief that collaboration brings benefits to each actor. From the business’s side, the benefits include the improvement of industrial production processes and productivity due to an increased supply of well-skilled staff. From the NGOs’ perspective, the benefits include accessing enterprises’ equipment and expertise. The government provides decentralised powers to local government to facilitate the working process of the NGOs and the private sector. These findings provide insight into Cambodia’s tri-sector TVET partnerships, making a contribution to understandings and knowledge of NGOs in TVET and their partners...|$|R
