50|$|Human <b>trafficking</b> <b>is</b> not smuggling. There {{is a legal}} {{distinction}} between these two acts. Smuggling is a consenting business transaction, in which migrants agree to be moved illegally across borders. Smuggling is considered a violation of a state’s immigration laws. Human <b>Trafficking</b> <b>is</b> a crime against a person, and a violation of their human rights. A <b>trafficking</b> victim <b>is</b> not necessarily moved across borders—or moved at all. <b>Trafficking</b> <b>is</b> the subsequent exploitation of a person for forced labor or forced prostitution.|$|R

40|$|Human <b>trafficking</b> <b>is</b> a {{crime that}} has seen {{increased}} media awareness {{over the past few}} decades. However, the media 2 ̆ 7 s representations of human <b>trafficking</b> <b>are</b> very one-dimensional and sensationalized. This is problematic, because media representations have an influence on the perceptions of those who consume the media imagery. This study explores the way that media representations of human trafficking have influenced the perceptions criminal justice students have about human <b>trafficking.</b> Grounded theory <b>was</b> used to uncover that criminal justice student 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions are based on four narratives that create images that influence criminal justice student 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions. These narratives are: human <b>trafficking</b> <b>is</b> synonymous with sex trafficking, human <b>trafficking</b> victims <b>are</b> exclusively women and children, human <b>trafficking</b> <b>is</b> experienced by specific racial and ethnic groups and human <b>trafficking</b> victims <b>are</b> to blame for their victimization. These narratives are then investigated {{within the context of the}} 2008 film Taken, which was mentioned by 17 of the 20 participants interviewed, and was found to be important in shaping the perceptions of the participants about human trafficking...|$|R
5|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>is</b> {{regularly}} {{counted and}} reported by Hrvatske autoceste, the operator of the motorway, and {{is published by}} Hrvatske ceste. Variations between AADT and average summer daily traffic (ASDT) traffic volumes are attributed {{to the fact that}} the motorway carries substantial tourist traffic to the Adriatic Sea resorts during the summer. On average, the A5 motorway carries 14% more ASDT than AADT. The largest increase, 15%, of ASDT relative to AADT is observed on the Đakovo–Sredanci section.|$|E
5|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>is</b> {{regularly}} counted {{by means}} of a traffic census at toll stations and reported by Hrvatske autoceste. The reported traffic volume gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of <b>traffic</b> <b>is</b> registered along Zagreb bypass, especially the JankomirLučko section, with 41,549vehicle annual average daily traffic (AADT). The busiest tolled section of the motorway is Ivanja RekaRugvica with 27,049AADT and 34,543vehicle average summer daily traffic (ASDT) figures. The traffic volume gradually decreases from that section eastward to the eastern terminus of the motorway, where the lowest AADT and ASDT figures are recorded. The traffic volume decrease is somewhat more pronounced at interchanges serving Slavonski Brod and the A5 motorway (Sredanci). The seasonal traffic volume variation ranges from a 28% increase on the busiest, Ivanja RekaRugvica, section to a 75% volume increase, as measured on the ŽupanjaSpačva section. Average summer season traffic volume increase on the motorway is 55%. The AADT/ASDT ratio analysis does not include Zagreb bypass, as there are no ASDT data available for the bypass.|$|E
5|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>is</b> {{regularly}} counted {{by means}} of traffic census at toll stations and reported by Autocesta Rijeka–Zagreb and Hrvatske autoceste—the operators of the northern and the southern portions of the motorway respectively. The reported traffic volume gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of <b>traffic</b> <b>is</b> registered between Jastrebarsko and Lučko interchanges – with 31,432 vehicle annual average daily traffic (AADT), and 53,216 vehicle average summer daily traffic (ASDT) figures as that is the section closest to Zagreb. South of the Bosiljevo2 interchange the first major drop of traffic volume is recorded on the A1 motorway, due to traffic transferring to the A6 motorway towards Rijeka. Other similar changes of the traffic volume are registered near Zadar (served by Zadar1 and Zadar2 interchanges) and Split served by Dugopolje interchange. Substantial variations observed between AADT and ASDT are normally attributed {{to the fact that}} the motorway carries significant tourist traffic. The seasonal increase traffic volume variations ranges 69% on the busiest, Lučko–Jastrebarsko section to 160% as measured on Sveti Rok–Maslenica section. The summer season traffic volume increase on the motorway is 120%.|$|E
