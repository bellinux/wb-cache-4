40|$|Successful {{new product}} and service {{development}} increasingly {{relies on the}} ability to adopt an international perspective, throughout the development process itself, and by targeting international or global markets, rather than simply serving domestic customers. Yet, although there exists an impressive body of research concerning the management of new product development, the evidence base with respect to international (or global) new product development practices and management is largely in its infancy, and is, at best, fragmented This guest editorial provides a synopsis of the main research streams in the broad field of international new product development, highlighting major gaps in current knowledge and understanding. The special issue is a modest attempt at <b>tapping</b> <b>current</b> thoughts and research investigations in this critical area, seeking, also, to stimulate much-needed debate and further research. One article examines whether international diversity is positively associated with new product development performance. Two articles tackle the role that national culture plays in influencing consumer acceptance of new products (technology) on the one hand, and firms' global new product development approach on the other.

40|$|In his {{dialogue}} - Near Term Computer Management Strategy For Hospitality Managers and Computer System Vendors - by William O 2 ̆ 7 Brien, Associate Professor, School of Hospitality Management at Florida International University, Associate Professor O’Brien initially states: “The computer {{revolution has}} only just begun. Rapid improvement in hardware will continue into the foreseeable future; {{over the last}} five years it has set the stage for more significant improvements in software technology still to come. John Naisbitt 2 ̆ 7 s information electronics economy¹ based on the creation and distribution of information has already arrived and as computer devices improve, hospitality managers will increasingly do at least a portion of their work with software tools. ” At the time of this writing Assistant Professor O’Brien will have you know, contrary to what some people might think, the computer revolution is not over, it’s just beginning; it’s just an embryo. Computer technology will only continue to develop and expand, says O’Brien with citation. “A complacent few of us who feel “we have survived the computer revolution” will miss opportunities as a new wave of technology moves through the hospitality industry,” says ‘Professor O’Brien. “Both managers who buy technology and vendors who sell it can profit from strategy based on understanding the wave of technological innovation,” is his informed opinion. Property managers who embrace rather than eschew innovation, in this case computer technology, will benefit greatly from this new science in hospitality management, O’Brien says. “The manager who is not alert to or misunderstands the nature of this wave of innovation will be the constant victim of technology,” he advises. On the vendor side of the equation, O’Brien observes, “Computer-wise hospitality managers want systems which are easier and more profitable to operate. Some view their own industry as being somewhat behind the times… They plan to pay significantly less for better computer devices. Their high expectations are fed by vendor marketing efforts…” he says. O’Brien warns against taking a gamble on a risky computer system by falling victim to un-substantiated claims and pie-in-the-sky promises. He recommends affiliating with turn-key vendors who provide hardware, software, and training, or soliciting the help of large mainstream vendors such as IBM, NCR, or Apple. Many experts agree that the computer revolution has merely and genuinely morphed into the software revolution, informs O’Brien; “…recognizing that a computer is nothing but a box in which programs run. ” Yes, some of the empirical data in this article is dated by now, but the core philosophy of advancing technology, and properties continually <b>tapping</b> <b>current</b> knowledge is sound...|$|E

The above stipulated requirement can be easily met for substations/exposed areas with online PQ measurements, which capture voltage magnitude and duration that could be corroborated with tripping events.

40|$|A new three-phase, three-level dc to dc phase shifted pulsewidth {{modulation}} (PWM) converter {{is proposed}} for high power and high input voltage applications. Output voltage {{is controlled by}} incorporating phase shift PWM. Clocked gate signals of each leg are phase shifted by 2 pi/ 3 from each other. Major features of the converter include: (1) outer two switches of each leg are turned on and off as zero voltage switching, (2) inner two switches of each leg are turned on and off as zero current switching, and (3) this is achieved without involving any extra passive or active components. The secondary side of the converter is of center <b>tapped</b> full-wave <b>current</b> tripler type.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} relating to the ways that people tap in time with sounds, and perform error correction in order to do this. However, off-beat tapping is less well investigated than on-beat <b>tapping.</b> The <b>current</b> study involves coordinating with a stimulus sequence with underlying isochrony and systematic deviations from this isochrony that increase or decrease in magnitude to look at people's capacity to error-correct when performing off-beat synchronisation with a set of sounds. Participants were instructed to 'tap between the tones' but 'try to maintain regularity'. While analysis using typical methods suggested a form of error correction was occurring, a series of more complex analyses demonstrated that participants' performance during each trial can be classified according to one of four different strategies: maintaining a regular pulse, error correction, phase resetting, and negative error correction. While maintaining a regular pulse was the preferred strategy in conditions with increasingly isochronous stimuli, the majority of trials are best explained by other strategies, suggesting that participants were generally influenced by variability in the stimuli. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

Additionally, students will proffer suggestions on what might work best for them and will equally answer questions from instructors and other conference attendees...|$|R
