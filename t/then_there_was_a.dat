It is believed that he was son of Duke of Samogitia, either Vykintas or Erdvilas. If it really was Vykintas, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> double marriage: Vykintas' sister married Dausprungas and Dausprungas' (and Mindaugas') sister married Vykintas. Erdvilas is mentioned only once in the 1219 treaty. The other nephew, Lengvenis, played a role in Lithuanian state in 1242–1260.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{some other}} areas of Edinburgh, Corstorphine escaped {{widespread}} industrialisation in the nineteenth century. It only really started to become absorbed into the Edinburgh urban area within the mid-twentieth century. But even before <b>then,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> changeover into a middle-class dormitory area for Edinburgh workers. By the late twentieth century, Corstorphine had an ageing demographic. In 1961, Queen Margaret College (now QMU) obtained land up {{on the edge of}} Corstorphine next to Clermiston, and set up a campus there. This was closed in 2007, when they moved all their facilities out to Musselburgh.|$|E
25|$|A tournament between Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad {{took place}} in 1891.

25|$|During those years, Pântea {{also became}} {{an active member}} of the Bucharest Bessarabian Circle of Nicolae Bosie-Codreanu, which {{monitored}} the evolution of Soviet attitudes on Romania. By <b>then,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> visible rapprochement between the Romania and the Soviet Union, effected by Romania's Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu and his PNL faction. The two governments had signed the London Convention for the Definition of Aggression and resumed diplomatic contacts. Renewing his attempts to obtain a definitive Romanian–Soviet agreement on Bessarabia, Pântea had informal talks with Mikhail Ostrovsky, the Soviet Envoy to Bucharest. Pântea preserved the image of a philo-Romanian Ostrovsky, who believed that Stalin would in time accept the union; the initiative, however, came to nothing, as both Ostrovsky and Titulescu were sidelined by their respective governments.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a variety of}} inner models exhibiting features usually obtained by forcing over universes with large cardinals. For example, if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> supercompact cardinal, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model with a Laver indestructible supercompact cardinal. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> supercompact cardinal, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model with a supercompact cardinal κ for which 2 ^κ=κ^+, another for which 2 ^κ=κ^++ and another in which the least strongly compact cardinal <b>is</b> supercompact. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strongly compact cardinal, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model with a strongly compact cardinal, for which the measurable cardinals are bounded below it and another inner model W with a strongly compact cardinal κ, such that H_κ^+^V⊆ HOD^W. Similar facts hold for supercompact, measurable and strongly Ramsey cardinals. If <b>a</b> cardinal <b>is</b> supercompact up to a weakly iterable cardinal, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model of the Proper Forcing Axiom and another inner model with a supercompact cardinal in which GCH+V=HOD holds. Under the same hypothesis, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model with level by level equivalence between strong compactness and supercompactness, and indeed, another in which <b>there</b> <b>is</b> level by level inequivalence between strong compactness and supercompactness. If <b>a</b> cardinal <b>is</b> strongly compact up to a weakly iterable cardinal, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model in which the least measurable cardinal is strongly compact. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> weakly iterable limit δ of <δ-supercompact cardinals, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inner model with a proper class of Laver-indestructible supercompact cardinals.

25|$|The fixture's {{popularity}} waned {{as international}} cricket expanded {{and it was}} played less frequently in the 20th century. Following the two games in September 1900, there were only eight instances between then and September 1920, {{all of them in}} the 1904 to 1908 period. Between the two world wars, there were eleven matches. The fixture was resurrected in 1946 {{after the end of the}} Second World War and, except for 1953, was played annually, sometimes more than once a season, through to 1958. <b>Then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> three-year hiatus until the final first-class match took place 6 to 8 September 1961 at Stanley Park, Blackpool, the South winning by two wickets. The fixture was finally ended by the advent of limited overs cricket, which left no space for it in an already crowded calendar. The last North v South contest in all cricket was a one-day 50 over match at Trent Bridge in the 1971 season, which the South won by 9 runs.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding these {{technical}} and commercial successes on the Macintosh platform, their systems remained fairly expensive, making them less competitive {{in light of}} the falling costs of components that made IBM PC compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption. In 1989, Jean-Louis Gassée had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry that year, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple's margins. Microsoft Windows 3.0 was released in May 1990, the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the significantly costlier Macintosh. Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers; at one point the product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, Performa, and Centris models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies toured England in 1939. England won {{the first}} Test at Lord's easily by 8 wickets, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> rain-affected draw in Manchester, and finally a high-scoring draw at the Oval in mid-August. The {{highlight}} of the series for the West Indies was George Headley scoring hundreds in both innings in the Lord's Test. With the clouds of World War II seemingly about to envelope Europe, {{the rest of the}} tour was cancelled and the Windies returned home. They would play no more Tests until 21 January 1948 saw the start of the first Test the West Indies played since the War, which resulted in a draw against the MCC side from England. The second Test was also drawn, with George Carew and Andy Ganteaume both making centuries. Ganteaume was then dropped, ending with a Test average of 112 – the highest in Test history. The West Indies won the final two Tests chasing sub-100 totals, and wrapped up the series 2–0, their first away-series victory.|$|E

25|$|Klitschko was {{scheduled}} to take on undefeated heavyweight contender Tyson Fury, the WBO mandatory challenger, on 24 October 2015 in an unprecedented 28th heavyweight world title appearance. On 25 September 2015, Klitschko postponed the fight, citing a calf injury. It was rescheduled for Saturday, 28 November 2015. Prior to the fight taking place on the night, there was much controversy, first starting with the gloves, <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> complaint about the ring canvas. Klitchsko reportedly had his hands wrapped without a representative of Fury, so had to do them again. Klitschko lost the fight by unanimous decision, with scores of 116–111, 115–112, and 115–112 all in favor of Fury. It was the first defeat Klitschko had suffered in over ten years and {{marked the end of}} the so-called 'Klitschko Era' referring to the time period where both Klitschko brothers (particularly Wladimir) dominated the division. Klitschko and Fury showed little offence during the 12 rounds, but Fury did enough to take the decision. Klitschko landed 52 of 231 punches thrown (23%) and Fury landed 86 of 371 thrown (23%).|$|E

The show featured traditional carpet patterns and designs, embracing a dance group replaying the game of chaturanga. The next part of the ceremony was the parade of nations with the presentation of flags.
