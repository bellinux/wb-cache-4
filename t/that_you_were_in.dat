500|$|In 1921, Coward {{made his}} first trip to America, hoping to {{interest}} producers there in his plays. Although he had little luck, he found the Broadway theatre stimulating. He absorbed its smartness and pace into his own work, which brought him his first real success as a playwright with The Young Idea. The play opened in London in 1923, after a provincial tour, with Coward in one of the leading roles. The reviews were good: [...] "Mr Noël Coward calls his brilliant little farce a 'comedy of youth', and so it is. And youth pervaded the Savoy last night, applauding everything so boisterously that you felt, not without exhilaration, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the midst of a 'rag'." [...] One critic, who noted the influence of Bernard Shaw on Coward's writing, thought more highly of the play than of Coward's newly found fans: [...] "I was unfortunately wedged in the centre of a group of his more exuberant friends who greeted each of his sallies with 'That's a Noëlism!'" [...] The play ran in London from 1 February to 24 March 1923, after which Coward turned to revue, co-writing and performing in André Charlot's London Calling! ...|$|E

[...] This ultimately led to her dropping out of the project. [...] "People automatically assume I wanted some crazy amount of money, or something," [...] Harris commented in 2014, [...] " [...] it's not like I [...] demanding of anything, really... When you've been asked to do something and then they insult you by saying, [...] "You're a piece of shit, you die in the first act—I don't give a fuck <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> two other Halloween movies, who cares?"... I was in shock." [...] Actress J. C. Brandy was cast as Harris's replacement.|$|E

The letter may never reach you, for I {{do not know how to}} address it, tho’ I feel sure your name upon the envelope will be sufficient. It is nearly two years ago, that my dear eldest son went out to the War for the last time and the day he said goodbye to me ~ we were looking together across the sun-glorified sea ~ looking towards France, with breaking hearts ~ when he, my poet son, said those wonderful words of yours ~ beginning at ‘When I go from hence, let this be my parting word’ ~ and when his pocket book came back to me ~ I found these words written in his dear writing ~ with your name beneath." ...|$|E
