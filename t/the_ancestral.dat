5|$|A 2008 {{mitochondrial}} {{and nuclear}} DNA phylogenetic {{study of the}} parrots, cockatoos and related taxa by utilizing among others the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, provides confirmatory evidence for a Gondwanaland origin of <b>the</b> <b>ancestral</b> parrots in the Cretaceous period, and an Australasia divergence of <b>the</b> <b>ancestral</b> cockatoos from the parrots in either late Cretaceous (66 mya) or Paleogene (45 mya) periods depending on baseline assumptions.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} {{to all of}} these alternative scenarios came when Turner and colleagues in 2007 described a new dromaeosaurid, Mahakala, which they found to be the most basal and most primitive member of the Dromaeosauridae, more primitive than Microraptor. Mahakala had short arms and no ability to glide. Turner et al. also inferred that flight evolved only in the Avialae, and these two points suggested that <b>the</b> <b>ancestral</b> dromaeosaurid could not glide or fly. Based on this cladistic analysis, Mahakala suggests that <b>the</b> <b>ancestral</b> condition for dromaeosaurids is non-volant. However, in 2012, an expanded and revised study incorporating the most recent Dromaeosaurid finds recovered the Archaeopteryx-like Xiaotingia as the most primitive member of the clade Dromaeosauridae, which appears to suggest the earliest members of the clade may have been capable of flight.|$|E

5|$|Mitochondria contain {{their own}} genome, an {{indication}} that they are derived from bacteria through endosymbiosis.

5|$|Protease-inhibition {{is thought}} to be <b>the</b> <b>ancestral</b> function, with non-inhibitory members the results of {{evolutionary}} neofunctionalisation of the structure.

50|$|Mercado Ancestral House & {{other stone}} houses - {{famous for its}} {{intricate}} stone carving created {{way back in the}} Spanish colonization period. Ancestral houses, mostly located at Brgy. Bonga Menor, have the distinctive Bustos look: stone pilasters and columns extending up to the ceiling with wood kept to a minimum in the second storey. Located near one another on the road leading to Angat, they include <b>the</b> Cunanan <b>Ancestral</b> Home, <b>the</b> Lopez <b>Ancestral</b> Home, <b>the</b> Perez <b>Ancestral</b> Home and <b>the</b> Mercado <b>Ancestral</b> Home. <b>The</b> last mentioned, the most impressive and best preserved, was built in the mid-1800s and has Baroque-style carved stone corner pilasters, carved stone garland and crucifix motifs in the entrance, chrysanthemum designs, decorative reliefs, molave planks with narra sidings, capiz windows, moveable panels, graceful grilles. peep holes for rifles to aim at tulisanes and a period oil lamp.

5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing mouths and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at {{the bases of}} their legs; both of these features are part of <b>the</b> <b>ancestral</b> arthropod feeding system. Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means of breathing air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E
5|$|Bohemian {{waxwings}} are not brood parasitised by {{the common}} cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing's breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed cowbird, another parasitic species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds {{placed in a}} Bohemian waxwing's nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3million years ago, <b>the</b> <b>ancestral</b> waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species, and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then.|$|E

40|$|We review recent {{progress}} on ancestral processes related to mutation-selection models, {{both in the}} deterministic and the stochastic setting. We mainly rely on two concepts, namely, <b>the</b> killed <b>ancestral</b> selection graph and <b>the</b> pruned lookdown <b>ancestral</b> selection graph. <b>The</b> killed <b>ancestral</b> selection graph gives {{a representation of the}} type of a random individual from a stationary population, based upon the individual's potential ancestry back until the mutations that define the individual's type. <b>The</b> pruned lookdown <b>ancestral</b> selection graph allows one to trace the ancestry of individuals from a stationary distribution back into the distant past, thus leading to the stationary distribution of ancestral types. We illustrate the results by applying them to a prototype model for the error threshold phenomenon. Comment: 22 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
