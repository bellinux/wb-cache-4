5|$|A PAT is most {{commonly}} attempted from the two- or three-yard line, {{depending on the}} level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point. Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the <b>two-point</b> conversion and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must be kicked at the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a <b>two-point</b> conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or <b>two-point</b> conversion attempt. In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the <b>two-point</b> conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than <b>two-point</b> conversion attempts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the game {{turned into a}} {{defensive}} battle. Neither side scored {{until late in the}} third quarter, when Tech took advantage of a State fumble to score the first touchdown of the second half. Tech failed to convert a <b>two-point</b> conversion, but NC State fumbled again on the ensuing possession, and Tech was able to drive for another touchdown. Leading 22–21, Tech attempted another <b>two-point</b> conversion, which also failed.|$|E
5|$|For a {{suspected}} first leg DVT in a moderate-probability scenario, a high-sensitivity D-dimer is suggested as a recommended option over ultrasound imaging, with both whole-leg and compression ultrasound possible. The NICE guideline uses a <b>two-point</b> Wells score {{and does not}} refer to a moderate probability group.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Fischer {{tied for}} first place with Soviet star Boris Spassky at the strong Mar del Plata Tournament in Argentina, winning by a <b>two-point</b> margin, scoring 13½/15 (+13−1=1), ahead of David Bronstein. Fischer lost only to Spassky; this {{was the start of}} their lifelong friendship.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Florida State's offense {{started a}} drive at its 20-yard line. Weinke {{completed}} one pass, but two others fell incomplete, and Florida State punted after again going three and out. The Hokies returned the State kick to the Seminoles' 36-yard {{line with a}} 45-yard return. Vick threw an incomplete pass, ran for seven yards, then handed it off to Kendrick, who broke through the Florida State defense and ran ahead 29yards for a touchdown. Rather than attempt an extra point, Beamer ordered a <b>two-point</b> conversion {{in an attempt to}} cut Florida State's lead to just three points. The play, which was Tech's first <b>two-point</b> attempt that season, failed. Even without an extra point, the touchdown still cut Florida State's lead to 2823.|$|E
5|$|A six-per-side {{version of}} the sport is also played in New Zealand. Two Centres per team can play in the whole court except the {{shooting}} circles; the remaining attacking and defending players are each restricted to {{one half of the}} court, including the shooting circles. The attacking and Centre players may shoot from outside the shooting circle for a <b>two-point</b> goal.|$|E
5|$|However, the Jets {{cut into}} Oakland's lead when Namath drove the offense 73 yards down field {{and ran the}} ball in for a 1-yard {{touchdown}} with five seconds remaining in the first half. The Jets lined up as if to kick the extra point, but holder and backup quarterback Babe Parilli tried to complete a <b>two-point</b> conversion pass, which fell incomplete. The Raiders led the Jets 14–12 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick was named the game's most valuable player. Warrick caught six passes for 163yards and two touchdowns, leading all receivers in yardage and scores. Warrick also had a 59-yard punt return for a touchdown and a <b>two-point</b> conversion, accounting for 20 of the Seminoles' 46points. The 20points scored by Warrick were a Sugar Bowl record for most points scored by an individual player.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter Shelley {{connected}} on an 18-yard field goal and Richardson scored his second rushing touchdown of the game midway through the fourth on a 13-yard run to give Alabama a 27–3 lead. The final points of the game came late in the fourth when Silas Redd scored on a one-yard touchdown for the Nittany Lions, and Rob Bolden converted the <b>two-point</b> conversion to bring the final score to 27–11.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{compiled}} 456yards {{of total}} offense: 198in {{the air and}} 258yards on the ground. Quarterback Chris Turner completed passes to five receivers during the game: Ronnie Tyler (five), Darrius Heyward-Bey (four), Torrey Smith (two), Adrian Cannon (one), and Emani Lee-Odai (one). Cannon and Tyler each caught a pass for a touchdown. Running back Davin Meggett caught a pass for a <b>two-point</b> conversion. Turner also threw one interception.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely {{as they did}} in <b>two-point</b> mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at its own}} 10-yard line, Virginia Tech ran three {{straight}} running plays {{in an effort to}} run the clock down and prevent Boston College from having enough time to conduct another offensive drive. After the third run was stopped for no gain, however, the Hokies were forced to punt the ball. Boston College now had 28seconds to score a touchdown and either tie the game with an extra point or win it with a <b>two-point</b> conversion.|$|E
5|$|Team North America {{closed the}} <b>two-point</b> gap by {{one point in}} men's team play, where they won {{two of the three}} games. Both Niklas Edin of Team World and Kevin Martin of Team North America won close games against Heath McCormick and Tom Brewster, respectively, while Glenn Howard made a double-takeout in the last end to hold his lead and win the game over Thomas Ulsrud. At the end of the day, Team World led Team North America 5–4.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 Peach Bowl {{kicked off}} fiveyears minus one day since Virginia Tech had last played in Atlanta—during the 1981 Peach Bowl. Virginia Tech scored {{first in the}} game, but NC State's Bulluck blocked a Tech punt in the Tech end zone and {{recovered}} it for a tying touchdown. Virginia Tech kicked a field goal {{at the end of}} the quarter to take a 107 lead, but NC State fought back, scoring 14unanswered points in the second quarter to take a 2110 lead by halftime. In the third quarter, the game turned into a defensive battle. Neither side scored until late in the third quarter, when Tech took advantage of a State fumble to score the first touchdown of the second half. Tech failed to convert a <b>two-point</b> conversion, but NC State fumbled again on the ensuing possession, and Tech was able to drive for another touchdown. Leading 2221, Tech attempted another <b>two-point</b> conversion, which also failed.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 {{game was}} played at the M Bank Stadium in Baltimore and {{attended}} by 67,809 fans. The game was a close contest marked by costly Maryland turnovers and Navy penalties. A Sam Hollenbach interception helped Navy to end the first quarter with a 14–3 lead. Immediately before halftime, Maryland kicked a field goal and another third-quarter field goal narrowed the deficit to 14–9. Both Maryland and Navy rushed for touchdowns and failed to make <b>two-point</b> conversions in the final quarter. Maryland took over on their own 18-yard line after the Navy kick, trailing 20–15 with 4:37 left on the clock. Hollenbach then engineered a 12-play, 82-yard drive capped by an 11-yard touchdown pass and a <b>two-point</b> conversion. Navy took over with one minute left, and completed a first down on their 33-yard line before an interception sealed the game for the Terps 23–20.|$|E
5|$|The game {{kicked off}} at 8p.m. EST, and Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game. Though Tech advanced down the field, Florida State scored first and took advantage of a blocked punt for a touchdown, giving the Seminoles a 140 lead in the first quarter. Tech answered with a touchdown drive of its own {{before the end of}} the quarter, but Florida State scored two quick touchdowns to begin the second quarter. Virginia Tech scored a touchdown before halftime, but halfway through the game, Florida State held a 2814 lead. In the third quarter, Virginia Tech's offense gave the Hokies a lead with a field goal and two touchdowns. Tech failed to convert two <b>two-point</b> conversions, but held a 2928 lead at the end of the third quarter. Florida State answered in the fourth quarter, however, taking a 3629 lead with a touchdown and successful <b>two-point</b> conversion early in the quarter. From this point, the Seminoles did not relinquish the lead, extending it to 4629 with another touchdown and a field goal.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{outcome was}} in doubt {{until the final}} minute of play. With 19seconds left on the game clock, Vince Young ran for a {{touchdown}} and regained the lead for the Longhorns. He followed up by running {{the ball into the}} end zone for a <b>two-point</b> conversion. Leinart had time to attempt one pass but his pass fell out of bounds as time expired; UT beat USC by the score of 41–38.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's offense came on to {{the field}} desperately needing to score quickly. Though the deficit was only 16points, and could be made up with two touchdowns and two <b>two-point</b> conversions, the limited time {{remaining}} meant the task would be difficult, even if Virginia Tech scored quickly. The Hokies began the drive with a 17-yard pass by quarterback Bryan Randall. Justin Hamilton rushed for five yards, and Randall completed a six-yard pass for another first down. The Tigers helped matters by committing a 15-yard penalty, which put the Hokies inside Auburn territory. Three plays later, Randall capitalized on the opportunity by completing a 29-yard pass to Josh Morgan for a touchdown and the Hokies' first points of the game. Tech attempted a <b>two-point</b> conversion, but the pass attempt fell incomplete. With 6:57 remaining, Virginia Tech now trailed 16–6.|$|E
5|$|After the post-score kickoff and return, Florida State {{began at}} its 22-yard line. Weinke {{completed}} a first-down pass to Warrick, but Warrick committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty in the process. On the next play, Weinke attempted a long pass downfield, but Tech defender Anthony Midget intercepted {{the ball at}} the Tech 41-yard line. Trailing by five, Tech's offense began a drive to potentially further cut Florida State's lead or put the Hokies in the lead themselves. After slipping {{on the field and}} taking a loss, Vick completed a 20-yard pass to Hawkins, who picked up a first down and pushed Tech to the Florida State 39-yard line. After a short rush by Kendrick, Vick scrambled to the State 21-yard line for another first down. On the next play, Vick was sacked for a seven-yard loss, but recovered the lost ground by running for 22yards on the next play. With a first down at the Seminoles' seven-yard line, Vick handed the ball to Kendrick, who ran seven yards straight ahead for a Tech touchdown, giving the Hokies the lead {{for the first time in}} the game. Again, Beamer ordered a <b>two-point</b> conversion attempt, but again, Florida State stopped the Hokies short. Despite that failure to pick up the <b>two-point</b> conversion, Tech took a 2928 lead with 2:13 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Among {{defensive}} players, Florida State safety Nick Moody had 12tackles, {{the most}} in the game. Virginia Tech's leading defensive player was safety Eddie Whitley, who had ninetackles and two pass breakups. Tech's Davon Morgan and Jeron Gouveia-Winslow were responsible for the only turnovers in the game; each had one interception. Gouveia-Winslow’s 24-yard interception return for a touchdown was the second such score in an ACC Championship Game. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Nigel Bradham's defensive <b>two-point</b> conversion was only the fifth in all of college football during the 2010 season. Florida State received no penalties during the game, and Virginia Tech received only four. The fourpenalties were the fewest in an ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season, the Virginia Tech defense {{was one of the best}} in the country. It was No. 4 in scoring defense (allowing 12.9 points per game), No. 11 in rushing defense (allowing 102.2 yards per game), and No. 7 in total defense (284.9 yards per game). The Hokies had 23 interceptions during the regular season, second-most in the country and behind only USC's 24 interceptions. The Hokies also found success on special teams defense. In total, Tech blocked ten kicks during the regular season: six punts, two field-goal attempts and two point-after tries. Tech's defense also scored 52 points: eight touchdowns, a safety and a <b>two-point</b> runback of an intercepted conversion pass.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's offense {{returned}} to the field at its 35-yard line after Georgia Tech's kickoff and a 30-yard return by C. J. Spiller. During the ensuing drive, Spiller was the key player for the Tigers. On five consecutive plays, he received the ball during rushing plays. He gained 3, 13, 6, 2, and 41 yards, respectively, {{on each of these}} plays en route to the end zone and a touchdown. Clemson attempted a <b>two-point</b> conversion, but the try failed and the Tigers simply tied the Yellow Jackets, 13–13.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{finished}} with twoturnoversVirginia Tech fumbled the ball once and threw oneinterception, while Boston College's offense threw two. Each team earned sevenpoints off of turnovers, and Virginia Tech blocked twokicks. The two blocked kicks effectively netted fivepoints for Virginia Tech, as the blocked field goal prevented Boston College from scoring threepoints, {{and the other}} blocked kick was returned 75yards for a rare defensive <b>two-point</b> conversion. The two blocked kicks by Virginia Tech were {{the first and second}} blocked kicks in ACC Championship Game history, and Boston College's fumble return for a touchdown was the first fumble recovery and defensive touchdown in ACC Championship Game history.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down, needing three yards for a first down. Weinke completed a pass for {{just short of the}} needed three yards. Instead of punting the ball away, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden ordered the team to attempt to convert the first down. He brought backup quarterback Marcus Outzen into the game as a misdirection move, and instead of running a quarterback sneak as anticipated, Outzen tossed the ball to Minor, who ran for 16yards and a first down. During the play, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that advanced the ball further and gave Florida State a first down at the Virginia Tech 23-yard line. Weinke returned to the game and threw a 10-yard pass to Chaney for another first down. Weinke threw an incomplete pass, then Tech stopped a rush up the middle for no gain. On third down, Weinke connected on a touchdown pass to Dugans, returning the lead to Florida State. The Seminoles, as had Virginia Tech before them, elected to attempt a <b>two-point</b> conversion. Unlike Virginia Tech's failed <b>two-point</b> conversions, the Seminoles successfully earned two points with a pass to Warrick, and the scores gave Florida State a 3629 lead with 12:59 remaining.|$|E
5|$|In April–May 1970, Fischer won at Rovinj/Zagreb with 13/17 (+10−1=6), by a <b>two-point</b> margin, {{ahead of}} Gligorić, Hort, Korchnoi, Smyslov, and Petrosian. In July–August, Fischer crushed the mostly {{grandmaster}} field at Buenos Aires, winning by a 3½-point margin, scoring 15/17 (+13−0=4). Fischer then played first {{board for the}} U.S. Team in the 19th Chess Olympiad in Siegen, where he won an individual Silver medal, scoring 10/13 (+8−1=4), with his only loss being to World Champion Boris Spassky. Right after the Olympiad, Fischer defeated Ulf Andersson in an exhibition game for the Swedish newspaper Expressen. Fischer had taken his game to a new level.|$|E
5|$|In high school, {{he played}} running back on offense more {{regularly}} than linebacker on defense. He shared running duties {{as a sophomore}} and junior before becoming the starter as a senior at Catholic Central High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He established his school career rushing record of nearly 3,000yards. As a senior, he scored a <b>two-point</b> conversion to give his school a one-point victory and a berth in the 2005 Michigan High School Athletic Association state championship game at Ford Field. He was {{also a member of}} a three-time state champion high school rugby team and was invited to try out with the United States national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|In his season-opening {{debut with}} the San Francisco 49ers, Smith caught one pass for 11 {{yards in the}} 20-3 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. The {{following}} game, Smith caught six passes for a season-high 120 receiving yards and a 75-yard touchdown, followed up with a <b>two-point</b> conversion catch during the 49ers 43-18 loss to the Steelers. On September 27, 2015, Smith started his {{first game of the}} season, but registered no catches in a 47-7 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The following week, Smith caught two passes for a total of 54-yards, but the 49ers loss to the Green Bay Packers team, losing 17-3.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{quarter of the}} game, the Eagles took a 70 lead on a 51-yard fumble return for a touchdown. The Eagles' offense {{dominated}} {{the first half of}} the game statistically, but failed to add to its early lead until the second quarter, when a field goal made it 100. Virginia Tech answered with a touchdown of their own, but Boston College responded with a seven-play, 74-yard touchdown drive of its own. Then came perhaps the most pivotal play of the game. During the extra point kick following the Boston College touchdown, Virginia Tech's Duane Brown blocked the kick, which was caught by the Hokies' cornerback Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75yards for a defensive <b>two-point</b> conversion.|$|E
5|$|Merritt {{brought the}} score to 59–35 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game {{drew to a}} close, there were several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable to {{capitalise}} on the opportunities, continuing to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a <b>two-point</b> shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62–37.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina {{began their}} 195657 {{campaign}} with three straight victories {{by a wide}} margin of victory. In their fourth game, the Tar Heels traveled Columbia, South Carolina, to play against South Carolina, where the Gamecocks took the Tar Heels to overtime before North Carolina was able to come away with the victory by four points. Near the end of December, the Tar Heels participated in the annual Dixie Classic The Tar Heels won the classic, and also remained undefeated, after beating Wake Forest in the championship game. North Carolina then won five more games before going into double overtime against Maryland and winning the game 6561 to earn their seventeenth consecutive victory. In the following game, Duke and North Carolina were tied at 7373 before Tar Heel Kearns sank two free throws to give North Carolina a <b>two-point</b> lead before the game ended. The Tar Heels closed out the regular season with six more victories to end the season with a record of 240. North Carolina won their quarterfinal matchup in the ACC Tournament by twenty points to advance to the semifinals against Wake Forest. The Demon Deacons were ahead 5958 as the game entered the final minute. With time running out, Rosenbluth made a <b>two-point</b> shot and was fouled in the act of shooting, which sent him to the line to shoot a free throw; he made the free throw and the Tar Heels won 6159. The Tar Heels then beat South Carolina in the championship to earn a bid to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} possession, Boston College needed only seven plays and just under {{three minutes to}} travel 74yards. The drive culminated in a 14-yard quarterback {{scramble}} for a touchdown. Duane Brown, who had blocked the first Boston College field goal attempt, again charged through the Boston College offensive line and blocked the extra point attempt. This time, the ball bounced {{into the hands of}} Virginia Tech's Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75yards for a defensive <b>two-point</b> conversion. The play kept Boston College's lead within a single touchdown and extra point. With 5:27 remaining in the half, the score was now 169 in favor of Boston College.|$|E
5|$|On {{the opening}} kickoff {{of the second}} half, Onterio McCalebb scored a {{touchdown}} on an 83-yard return to cut the Alabama lead to 24–14. Alabama responded on their next possession with a 28-yard Shelley field goal for a 27–14 lead entering the fourth quarter. On the third play of the fourth quarter, Auburn's Clint Moseley threw an interception to DeMarcus Milliner that was returned 35-yards for a touchdown and after a successful <b>two-point</b> conversion, Alabama led 35–14. After getting the ball back on downs late in the quarter, Jalston Fowler scored on a 15-yard touchdown run, to cap a drive that included a 57-yard Richardson run, and made the final score 42–14.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fourth quarter began, the Virginia Tech drive {{that began in the}} waning moments of the third quarter came to an end. The Hokies were forced to punt, and Louisville began its first drive of {{the fourth quarter}}. The Cardinals' Harry Douglas ran for 29yards on their first play of the drive. On the second, Hunter Cantwell {{completed}} a 29-yard touchdown pass to Gary Barnidge. It took Louisville just 33seconds and two plays to travel 58yards and earn a touchdown. The score gave Louisville a 24–13 lead with 13:32 remaining to play. But just as it took Louisville just two plays to score, so too did it take Virginia Tech two plays to answer the Louisville touchdown. After taking over at his team's 22-yard line, Marcus Vick completed a 54-yard pass to wide receiver David Clowney. Virginia Tech and Louisville committed offsetting 15-yard personal foul penalties before the play, to no effect on the Hokie offense. On the next play after the long pass, Cedric Humes rushed for 24yards and the answering Hokie touchdown. It took just 28seconds for Virginia Tech to answer the Louisville touchdown. Having done that, Tech went Louisville one better, successfully scoring a <b>two-point</b> conversion on a pass from Vick to Morgan. The touchdown and <b>two-point</b> conversion cut the Louisville lead to 24–21.|$|E
5|$|Team World held a <b>two-point</b> lead {{coming into}} the first mixed doubles round, where they split the three points {{available}} with Team North America. The North American pair of John Morris and Kaitlyn Lawes dominated Team World's Niklas Edin and Christina Bertrup. Heather Nedohin made a game-saving shot with Dean Gemmell to tie their game with Michael Goodfellow and Eve Muirhead, and Christoffer Svae and Carmen Schäfer stole a win over Marc Kennedy and Allison Pottinger after Pottinger was light on a draw.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech {{searching for a}} way to answer Georgia's {{previous}} two scores and quash the momentum Georgia had picked up. On the third play of the quarter, however, Virginia Tech quarterback Sean Glennon threw an interception to Georgia's Tony Taylor. Beginning on their own 35-yard line, Georgia capitalized on the mistake quickly, courtesy of a 15-yard personal foul penalty and a 41-yard completion from Stafford to Milner. Georgia, hoping to tie the time, attempted and completed a <b>two-point</b> conversion. The resulting scores tied the game at 21–21 with 12:39 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The next Mean Green drive {{ended in}} another interception, {{this time by}} Midshipmen linebacker Matt Wimsatt. After the ensuing drive stalled at midfield, the Midshipmen downed a punt at the North Texas two-yard line. Two plays later the Mean Green were called for holding in the end zone, giving Navy a safety. Campbell {{returned}} the ensuing free kick for a touchdown, giving the Midshipmen a 74–56 lead. Running back Micah Mosley scored another touchdown for the Mean Green, but their <b>two-point</b> conversion attempt failed, leaving them down 74–62. The Mean Green attempted another onside kick, but Navy recovered. One first down was enough to enable the Midshipmen to run out the clock for the win.|$|E
