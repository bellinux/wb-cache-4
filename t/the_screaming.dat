50|$|Reni Celeste, film {{philosopher and}} publisher, notes about Michel Chion, composer, that he “locates <b>the</b> <b>scream</b> in <b>the</b> {{voice of the}} female and compares it to the female orgasm.

50|$|David N. Green, musician, {{writer and}} composer, wrote in 1987 an essay about musicians using screams as a singing {{technique}} in music.

2500|$|In {{the late}} twentieth century, <b>The</b> <b>Scream</b> was imitated, parodied, and (following its {{copyright}} expiration) outright copied, which led to it acquiring an iconic status in popular culture. It was used {{on the cover of}} some editions of Arthur Janov's book <b>The</b> Primal <b>Scream.</b> In 1983–1984, pop artist Andy Warhol made a series of silk prints copying works by Munch, including <b>The</b> <b>Scream.</b> His stated intention was to desacralize the painting by making it into a mass-reproducible object. Munch had already begun that process, however, by making a lithograph of the work for reproduction. Erró's ironic and irreverent treatment of Munch's masterpiece in his acrylic paintings <b>The</b> Second <b>Scream</b> (1967) and Ding Dong (1979) is considered a characteristic of post-modern art. The expression of Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) in the poster for the movie Home Alone was inspired by <b>The</b> <b>Scream.</b> Cartoonist Gary Larson included a [...] "tribute" [...] to <b>The</b> <b>Scream</b> (entitled <b>The</b> Whine) in his Wiener Dog Art painting and cartoon compilation, in which the central figure is replaced by a howling dachshund. <b>The</b> <b>Scream</b> has been used in advertising, in cartoons such as The Simpsons, films, and on television.
