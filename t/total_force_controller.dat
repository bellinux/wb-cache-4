40|$|In this paper, a new robust <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> is {{proposed}} for Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs) by using conventional Sliding Mode Control (SMC) and Disturbance Observer (DOb). The position {{measurement of the}} actuator 2 ̆ 7 s link is subtracted from the desired deflection of the spring so that the force control goal {{is defined as the}} desired position of the motor; i. e., the force control is simply performed by designing a position controller at motor side. However, the position accuracy of the motor is influenced by the dynamics of the actuator and environment. Since they cannot be easily identified in practice, the dynamics of the actuator 2 ̆ 7 s link and environment are considered as unknown disturbances {{in the design of the}} proposed controller. In order to improve the robustness, conventional SMC-based robust <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> is designed without considering the unknown disturbances. Although the robust force control can be theoretically performed by using the conventional SMC-based controller, it suffers from chattering in real implementations. Conventional DOb-based robust motion controller is designed at motor side so that not only the disturbances are cancelled by feeding-back their estimations but also the control signal of SMC-based robust <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> is lowered. Hence, a simple yet efficient robust <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> is designed for SEAs.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> to maintain desired normal forces during a very stiff contact operation conducted in a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine. <b>Force</b> <b>controller</b> approach described in this thesis requires the accurate knowledge of the nominal tool path a priori. Obtaining the nominal tool path accurately is carried out by a vision based profile tracking system presented in this thesis. Both the force control and visual profile tracking systems require {{the development of an}} active control system to respond to force and vision signals. To facilitate the active control, a two-stage approach has been taken. The first stage is to bring the CNC machine under real-time control of an external computer. The second stage is the design of the active axis controller. This is achieved by adding sensor feedback loops to the external axis controller. The purpose of the active vision based profile tracking system is to automatically generate the tool path accurately. Emphasis is on combining low resolution vision with visual control of the precision CNC machine to attain the accuracy required for metal spinning. Combination of visual profile tracking and an edge detection method that gives sub-pixel accuracy were used to obtain the required tool path. A curvature detection algorithm was developed to identify segments of the tool path by assuming that the tool path consists of circular and straight line segments. The developed active <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> operates in a dynamic setup and is used to maintain tool forces at desired levels. The complete control system operates {{in a manner similar to}} reaction compensation and the <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> can be viewed as an integrating on-off controller with minimum integral wind-up effect. As a result, a direct dependency of the control efforts on error signals has been eliminated. In addition, the <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> brings in artificial damping that ensures the stability of the control system.

40|$|Regulating {{machining}} forces provides significant economic benefits by increasing operation productivity and improving part quality. Machining force regulation is a challenging problem since the force process varies significantly under normal operating conditions. Since fixed-gain controllers cannot guarantee system performance and stability as the force process varies, a substantial research {{effort has been}} invested {{in the development of}} adaptive <b>force</b> <b>controllers.</b> However, adaptive controllers can be difficult to develop, analyze, implement, and maintain due to their inherent complexity. Consequently, adaptive machining <b>force</b> <b>controllers</b> have found little application in industry. In this paper, a model-based machining force control approach, which incorporates detailed force process models, is introduced. The proposed design has a simple structure and explicitly accounts for the changes in the force process to maintain system performance and stability.

Human tissue, which is generally viscoelastic, nonlinear and anisotropic, is often described as purely elastic for its simplicity in contact force control design and online computation. However, the elastic model cannot reproduce the complex properties of a real tissue. Based on in vitro animal tissue relaxation tests, we identify the Hunt-Crossley viscoelastic model as the most realistic one to describe the soft tissue's mechanical behavior among several candidate models. A force control method based on Hunt-Crossley model is developed following the state feedback design technique with a Kalman filter based active observer (AOB).

40|$|Abstract. Basing on a {{constraint}} Jacobian induced orthogonal {{decomposition of}} the task space and by requiring the <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> to be orthogonal to the constraint manifold, {{the dynamics of the}} constrained robots under hybrid control is decomposed into a set of two equations. One describes the motion of robots moving on the constraint manifold, while the other relates the constraint force with the hybrid controller. This decomposition does not require the solution of the constraint equation in partition form. In this setting, the hybrid control of constrained robots can be essentially reduced to robust stabilization of uncertain nonlinear systems whose uncertainties do not satisfy the matching condition. A continuous version of the sliding-mode controller (from Khalil [12]) is employed to design a position <b>controller.</b> The <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> is designed as a proportional force error feedback of high gain type. The coordination of the position <b>controller</b> and the <b>force</b> <b>controller</b> is shown to achieve ultimately bounded position and force tracking with tunable accuracy. Moreover, an estimate of the domain of attraction is provided for the motion on the constraint manifold. Simulation for a planar two-link robot constraining on an ellipse is given to show the effectiveness of a hybrid controller. In addition, the friction effect, viewed as external disturbance to the system, is also examined through simulations.

Expand the functions of the existing Talent Management Board (TMB) to provide policy guidance for <b>total</b> <b>force</b> manpower issues and coordinate with leadership to issue a <b>Total</b> <b>Force</b> Manpower Strategic Plan.
