5|$|As the Great Depression hit the United States, Fairbanks bucked {{the poor}} {{economic}} trend. Thanks to <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Railroad, large gold dredges {{could be brought}} in, and these returned the area's gold mines to profitability. In 1938, Lathrop {{took advantage of the}} good economic situation by reviving <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Miner as a weekly supplement to the News-Miner. The Miner covered happenings in the gold-mining camps outside Fairbanks and was focused on areas outside the city. In 1939, Fairbanks radio station KFAR was founded, and it shared the Lathrop building with the News-Miner, which occupied the bottom floors of the building.|$|E

5|$|In January 1941, a {{disagreement}} between Settlemier, {{one of his}} reporters, {{and the editor of}} <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Miner resulted in several changes to the News-Miner. Settlemier was replaced as editor by the reporter, David B. Tewkesbury, and <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Miner was discontinued. Its editor, E.F. Jessen, created Jessen's Weekly, a separate newspaper, to compete with the News-Miner. The Weekly lasted until 1968, when it was closed by the Internal Revenue Service. The same year that Jessen founded his weekly newspaper, the United States became involved in the Second World War. Travel to and from Alaska was restricted, and after Japan invaded <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> islands of Attu and Kiska, the News-Miner was censored by the U.S. Army. Fairbanks benefited from a military construction boom as the United States built the Northwest Staging Route to ferry Lend-Lease aircraft to the Soviet Union. The boom left the News-Miner short-staffed, but it continued operations throughout the war.|$|E

5|$|On July 31, the Tanana River {{began to}} {{overflow}} its banks in Nenana.

The flooding of <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Railroad track in town forced a halt to all passenger and freight operations between Anchorage and Fairbanks, effectively cutting off Fairbanks from rail traffic.|$|E

5|$|The 1995 race {{featured}} 22 mushers, of whom 13 finished. Budget {{problems caused}} the first prize {{to drop by}} 25% to $15,000, contributing to the low participation.

The 1997 race was won by Rick Mackey, brother of later Quest winner Lance Mackey; the two are the only brother-brother winning tandem in Quest history. Following the 1997 race, financial troubles again arose, this time on <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> side. Canadian organizers secured international sponsorship for the 1998 race, and when they refused to let this sponsorship money {{be used to pay}} debts accumulated in Alaska, members of <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> board threatened to host a separate competition.
