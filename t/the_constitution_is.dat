5|$|Section Eight {{describes}} {{processes for}} enforcing and amending the Constitution. <b>The</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> the supreme {{law of the}} land, therefore other laws and edicts cannot conflict with it. If a conflict occurs, the Constitution applies. If <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> not in conflict, but a law and a decree is, the law would be enforced.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> {{the result of}} the {{ordinary}} law of the land. In other words, it is not the source but the consequence of the citizens' rights.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the members}} of the Presidential Elections Committee, which is the body {{empowered}} to ensure that candidates for the office of President have the qualifications required by <b>the</b> <b>Constitution,</b> <b>is</b> a member of the PCMR appointed to this post by the Chairman of the Council.|$|E
50|$|It is {{commonly}} {{believed that the}} drafting of <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> heavily influenced by Józef Piłsudski, who died {{two and a half}} weeks after <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> passed.|$|R
25|$|Morsi {{reinstated}} parliament {{days after}} his election, and lawmakers set to work drafting a <b>constitution.</b> <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> passed over <b>the</b> objections of opposition members who argued the process was faulty. When put to a referendum in December 2012, <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> approved by a nearly 28-point margin, as supporters successfully argued that approval of <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> needed to ensure stability.|$|R
50|$|A <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{adopted in}} March 1992. <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> semi-presidential. It {{is unclear how}} long <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> even {{nominally}} operational. In April 1992 President Dudayev began to rule by decree and in June 1993 parliament was dissolved.|$|R
5|$|The President of Croatia and the Government {{cooperate}} {{in the formulation}} and implementation of Croatia's foreign policy. This provision of <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> an occasional source of conflict {{between the president and}} the government. The president decides on the establishment of diplomatic missions and consular offices of the Republic of Croatia abroad, at the Government's proposal and with the countersignature of the prime minister. The president, following prior countersignature of the prime minister, appoints and recalls diplomatic representatives of the Republic of Croatia, at the proposal of the Government and upon receiving the opinion of an applicable committee of the parliament. The president receives letters of credence and letters of recall from foreign diplomatic representatives.|$|E
5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should {{take the lead in}} promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. <b>The</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, {{be thought of as a}} general haven of reform movements.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{signed on}} 7 April 2008 at 13:00 local {{time at the}} {{national}} library in Pristina. <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified on 9 April and came to effect on 15 June 2008.|$|R
50|$|The Arkansas General Assembly is {{authorized}} by <b>the</b> Arkansas <b>Constitution,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> state's fifth <b>constitution.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>was</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified on January 30, 1836, and <b>the</b> current <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> adopted in 1874. <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> has also <b>been</b> amended throughout the state's history since 1874.|$|R
50|$|Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> promulgated on February 5, 1857, {{under the}} threats of the clergy that who swore <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> would <b>be</b> excommunicated.|$|R
5|$|The President of Croatia may {{dissolve}} Parliament {{upon the}} request of the government if the government proposes a confidence motion to Parliament and the majority of all deputies adopt a motion of no confidence or if Parliament fails to approve government budget 120 days after the budget is proposed in the parliament. That decision must be countersigned by the Prime Minister to become valid. The President may also dissolve Parliament after a motion of no confidence supported by a majority of all deputies has been adopted and a new government cannot be formed within 30 days or if a new government cannot be formed after general elections (maximum period of 120 days). However, the President may not dissolve Parliament at {{the request of}} the government if a procedure to determine if the President has violated provisions of <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> in progress.|$|E
5|$|When {{drafting}} the Belarus Constitution, the Supreme Soviet deputies {{were influenced by}} the constitutions of various countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United States. Internally, the Constitution {{was influenced by the}} period of Soviet domination and a desire to bring back traditions brushed aside by the Soviet Government. The structure of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> similar to the Russian Federation: for example, the office of the President has powers analogous to those granted to the President of Russia. Overall, the Constitution sought to preserve the statehood of Belarus from pro-Russian unity movements, provide a strong head of state that could cure the ailments Belarus would endure in the post-Soviet era, and lay out a compromise between the political factions in Belarus.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} two sections.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Constitution</b> of Kenya <b>is</b> <b>the</b> supreme {{law of the}} Republic of Kenya. There {{have been}} three {{significant}} versions of <b>the</b> <b>constitution,</b> with <b>the</b> most recent redraft being enabled in 2010. The 2010 edition replaced <b>the</b> 1963 independence <b>constitution.</b> <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> presented to <b>the</b> Attorney General of Kenya on 7 April 2010, officially published on 6 May 2010, and was subjected to a referendum on 4 August 2010. <b>The</b> new <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> approved by 67% of Kenyan voters. <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> promulgated on 27 August 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Secession: Referring {{to words}} in the {{preamble}} to <b>the</b> <b>Constitution,</b> Lincoln stated that <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> established [...] "to form a more perfect union" [...] than the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union had effected. Since the Union established under the Articles was explicitly perpetual in name and text, thus the Union under <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> equally perpetual. He added that even if <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>were</b> to be construed as a simple contract, {{it could not be}} legally rescinded without an agreement between all parties, meaning all of the states, North and South.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Constitution</b> of Ukraine (Конституція України) is the nation's {{fundamental}} law. <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{adopted and}} ratified at the 5th {{session of the}} Verkhovna Rada (parliament) of Ukraine on 28 June 1996. <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> passed with 315 ayes out of 450 votes possible (300 ayes minimum).|$|R
25|$|A law {{to amend}} <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> a {{law for the}} {{purposes}} of Article 13.|$|E
25|$|In an originalist interpretation, if {{the meaning}} of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> static, then any ex post facto {{information}} (such as {{the opinions of the}} American people, American judges, or the judiciaries of any foreign country) is inherently valueless for interpretation of {{the meaning of}} the Constitution, and should not form any part of constitutional jurisprudence. <b>The</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> thus fixed and has procedures defining how it can be changed.|$|E
25|$|Plebiscite is {{the electoral}} process by which an {{initiative}} on <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> approved or rejected by the people.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the Syrian civil war, a {{referendum}} on a new <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> held on 26 February 2012. <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> approved by <b>the</b> populace, and the article stating that Ba'ath Party was [...] "the leading party of society and state" [...] <b>was</b> removed and <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified on 27 February.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> amended {{in early}} 1998.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{draft of}} <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{concluded}} by <b>the</b> Assembly. On 2 and 3 December 1979 the Iranian constitutional referendum <b>was</b> held and <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> ratified.|$|R
25|$|The second legal {{criterion}} is {{that the}} constitution must be rigid. This is important to ensure that constitutional provisions can only be changed by an authority that is higher in status than the ordinary legislative body existing under the Constitution. However, rigidity {{does not mean that}} <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> completely immutable. If <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> static, the nation's political development may be stunted. Instead, rigidity of the Constitution merely contemplates that compared to ordinary legislation, the Constitution should be more difficult to amend.|$|E
25|$|He {{suggested}} that {{the date of the}} elections should be decided by the parliamentary opposition, with him acting merely to guarantee that <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> respected.|$|E
25|$|Further, {{and even}} though not subject to {{legislative}} entrenchment, material change to other aspects of <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to occur absent broad-based support, either through broad legislative agreement or by referendum.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> amended on April 1, 2013.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} on 21 May 2016.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} on 26 May 2017.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> {{silent on}} the {{question}} of whether or not a state may unilaterally leave, or secede from, the Union. However, the Supreme Court, in Texas v. White (1869), held that a state cannot unilaterally do so.|$|E
25|$|Because {{it is not}} supreme law, <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>is</b> {{in theory}} {{comparatively}} easy to reform, requiring only a majority of Members of Parliament to amend it, {{as illustrated by the}} abolition of the Legislative Council in 1950.|$|E
25|$|Certainly {{all those}} who have framed written constitutions {{contemplate}} them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and consequently the theory of every such government must be, that an act of the legislature repugnant to <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>is</b> void.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> amended on April 1, 2013.|$|R
50|$|The Arizona Territory was {{authorized}} {{to hold a}} constitutional convention in 1910 at which <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> drafted and submitted to Congress. <b>The</b> original <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> approved by Congress, but subsequently vetoed by President William H. Taft on his objections concerning the recalling of judges. <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> amended by <b>the</b> constitutional convention removing the recalling of judges and resubmitted upon which President Taft approved Arizona's statehood as the 48th state on February 14, 1912.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Utah <b>Constitution</b> <b>was</b> drafted at a {{convention}} that opened on March 4, 1895 in Salt Lake City. <b>The</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>was</b> later {{approved by the}} citizens of Utah.
