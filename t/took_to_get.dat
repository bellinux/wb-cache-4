25|$|Chicago is {{the largest}} hub in the {{railroad}} industry. Six of the seven Class I railroads meet in Chicago, with the exception being the Kansas City Southern Railway. As of 2002, severe freight train congestion caused trains to take as long {{to get through the}} Chicago region as it <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there from the West Coast of the country (about 2 days). According to U.S. Department of Transportation, the volume of imported and exported goods transported via rail to, from, or through Chicago is forecast to increase nearly 150 percent between 2010 and 2040. CREATE, the Chicago Region Environmental and Transport Efficiency program, comprises about 70 programs, including crossovers, overpasses and underpasses, that intend to significantly improve the speed of freight movements in the Chicago area.|$|E

25|$|After leaving Virgin, the Wallflowers {{went back}} to playing Los Angeles clubs in hopes of getting signed with another label. The band found it {{difficult}} to even get label representatives to come to their shows. In the year it <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> another record deal the Wallflowers gained and lost several band members. Bass player Barrie Maguire was asked to leave for undisclosed reasons in early 1993. The Wallflowers continued playing shows with replacement bass player Jimmie Snider until May 1993 when the band hired Greg Richling. Dylan and Richling went to high school together. The Wallflowers continued to play club shows in Los Angeles through early 1994 when drummer Peter Yanowitz left the band to join his girlfriend Natalie Merchant's band. Interestingly, Yanowitz brought in Barrie Maguire to help record Merchant's debut solo album, Tigerlily. Around the time of Yanowitz's departure the Wallflowers caught the attention of Jimmy Iovine and Tom Whalley of Interscope Records, who then signed the band to their label in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{marginalization}} {{degree of}} the district was {{directly related to the}} time it took for the results to be carried to the corresponding CEDAT. Those of very low marginalization took an average of 4:31 hours; those of low marginalization an average of 6:14 hours; medium marginalization an average of 6:54 hours; high marginalization 8:45 hours; and very high marginalization an average of 10:32 hours. The time it <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> results from a polling place to the corresponding CEDAT was also directly related to the average distance between the polling place and the CEDAT. Almost two thirds of Calderón's votes came from districts with very low marginalization, arriving first, with almost three percentage points advantage over López Obrador. Moreover, it was only on those districts that Calderón obtained victories, while López Obrador was ahead mainly in districts with low, medium, and high marginalization; Madrazo only won in some districts with very high marginalization. Pliego Carrasco states that taking all these factors into consideration completely explains the behavior of the partial tallies, in particular the changes in the rates of growth that began occurring around 9 pm, and the further changes (outlined by the Alianza in their judicial filings) between 2 and 3 am. Pliego Carrasco criticizes Mochán and others for not considering the marginalization and the distance between districts and the corresponding CEDAT, and for considering only a very rough urban/rural sorting {{of the district}}s and using methods and techniques that are valid for the natural sciences and engineering but that he considers unjustified in their application to social sciences.|$|E

500|$|The barn's main posts {{are made}} of oak. Each is about [...] square and sits on a block of Reigate sandstone, a common {{building}} material in medieval London. The posts were cut into shape using axes, adzes and saws, the marks from which can still be seen in some instances. The builders cut and fitted the timberwork together {{on the ground and}} scratched Roman numerals, called assembly marks, on the joints to indicate where pieces of timber were to be combined. Some of the pairs of main posts were made from the trunks of very large individual trees which were cut in two. They were all placed upside down, relative to the original direction of the tree. This was because the bottom of a tree is always wider than the top; the greater width was needed to accommodate the joints with the beams that support the roof. Despite the care that the builders <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the joints right, they may have made some mistakes along the way, as some of the timbers have holes for pegs and mortises that were never used. Alternatively, the timbers may have been reused from another construction.|$|E

There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is what it <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> you to watch NYPD Blue and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E

Rock Sound made a favorable comparison to Thin Lizzy for the track [...] "Lunar", and to Baroness for [...] "The Gem", giving the album a score of 9 out of 10. The PRP described the album as [...] "heavier" [...] than Hello Master, with its songs having [...] "an alarming amount of depth", but referred to the track [...] "Murphy's Law" [...] as [...] "questionable" [...] in an otherwise favorable review which gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. Artrocker's Stuart Gadd also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, as he enjoyed the stylistic reminders of Iron Maiden and other classic metal he heard on the album, and went as {{far as to say that}} despite being released in early 2010 it was already the best metal record of the year. David Marchese, writing for Spin, also praised the album with a score of 8 out of 10, even saying that [...] "Someone should be fired for the delay , because this baby burns".|$|E
