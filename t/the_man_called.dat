5|$|The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show was {{the first}} {{spin-off}} series derived from The Flintstones, minus the theatrical film <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Called</b> Flintstone in 1966. Several individuals wrote episodes for the series, including Joel Kane, Woody Kling, Howard Morganstern, Joe Ruby, and Ken Spears. Executively produced by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's Hanna-Barbera Productions, Charles A. Nichols served as the director and Iwao Takamoto was an additional producer. The main title theme and music for The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show were composed by Hoyt Curtin and Ted Nichols.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Duke Marshall, {{a nephew}} of Chief Justice John Marshall and former {{resident}} of Washington County, Kentucky, {{was living in}} San Felipe. He noticed that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>called</b> John Parker bore a strong resemblance to the Desha family of Kentucky and that he breathed through a silver tube like the one used by Isaac Desha. Marshall arrested Desha. After another former Kentuckian in the area also said he believed the suspect was Isaac Desha, Desha admitted his identity and confessed to murdering Early. He said he had intended to rob the Americans who had traveled with him from San Antonio, but the Mexican had watched him too closely. Although there was no jail in the town, a local blacksmith was commissioned to construct irons to restrain Desha until his trial.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{was created by}} Marv Wolfman and Len Wein in the fanzine Super Adventures in 1966. Seven years later John Romita, Sr. tweaked {{the design of the}} character's uniform. Nova debuted in Nova #1 in 1976, written by Wolfman and drawn by John Buscema. Wolfman intended the teenage character to be an homage to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man, down to his humble working-class roots and alliterative alter-ego. The original Nova series, <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Called</b> Nova, lasted 25 issues from September 1976 to May 1979. Dangling plot lines were resolved in issues 206-214 of Fantastic Four (also by Wolfman) and issue 24 of Rom the Spaceknight. The character then disappeared into obscurity until returning {{as a member of the}} original New Warriors team debuting in The Mighty Thor #411 (December 1989), and continuing through New Warriors #1-75, Annual #1-4 (July 1990—September 1996).|$|E

500|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{has strong}} {{elements}} of an epic; for instance, Ged's place in Earthsea history is described {{at the very}} beginning of the book in the following terms: [...] "some say the greatest, and surely the greatest voyager, was <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>called</b> Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage." [...] The story also begins with words from the Earthsea song [...] "The Creation of Éa", which forms a ritualistic beginning to the book. The teller of the story then goes on to say that it is from Ged's youth, thereby establishing context for the rest of the book. In comparison with the protagonists of many of Le Guin's other works, Ged is superficially a typical hero, a mage who sets out on a quest. Reviewers have compared A Wizard of Earthsea to epics such as Beowulf. Scholar Virginia White argued that the story followed a structure common to epics in which the protagonist begins an adventure, faces trials along the way, and eventually returns in triumph. White went on to suggest that this structure can be seen in the series as a whole, as well as in the individual volumes.|$|E
500|$|Waugh was {{approached}} at the Oberoi by an Indian man, {{who was also}} staying at the hotel. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>called</b> himself [...] "John" [...] and gave no surname. John {{said he was a}} man who had won money betting on cricket and asked Waugh to provide pitch and weather information; he also asked the Australian to reveal inside knowledge about the team, such as tactics and player selections, in exchange for US$4,000. Waugh accepted the money and agreed to provide information about the pitch and weather, but he refused to divulge the tactics that the Australians intended to use against their opposition, or information on which players would play and what their role would be. Information on pitch conditions provides an insight into the strategies that the team might adopt and which players might be used, and teams will field different players depending on the pitch, as their skills are suited to different conditions. The arrangement with John remained in place until the end of the 1994–95 Australian summer. Waugh later said that at the time, he did not see anything wrong with his actions, reasoning that the agreement was similar to a player speculating about their form and the playing conditions in a pre-match media interview.|$|E

2500|$|Jeff Weaver retired {{the side}} in order, and the Cardinals {{went to the}} ninth, three outs away from their first World Series title in 24 years. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>called</b> on to get those three outs would be Adam Wainwright, who had won the job of closer after the star free agent brought to St. Louis in 2002, Jason Isringhausen, had season-ending surgery. Detroit's {{clean-up}} hitter, Magglio Ordóñez, led off the inning. He proceeded to work a full count but then grounded out. The second batter, Sean Casey, worked a full count and then doubled to bring the tying run to the plate. The third batter, Iván Rodríguez, got ahead in the count 2–0 but grounded back to Wainwright on the next pitch, putting the Cardinals one out away. The fourth batter, Plácido Polanco, fell behind 1–2, but then worked a walk to put the tying run on. The fifth batter, Brandon Inge, fell behind 0–2, again putting the Cardinals one strike from a World Series championship. He did not extend the drama any longer, as he swung and missed at the next pitch (making it the first World Series to end on a strikeout since the 1988 World Series), giving the World Series title to the Cardinals. The final play of the 2006 season was made at 10:26pm Central Standard time. [...] After the game, Wainwright, who threw a curveball for strike three to win the pennant and a slider to Inge to win the Series, said [...] "I'll probably never throw another curve or slider again without thinking of those two pitches." ...|$|E
