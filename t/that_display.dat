Images represent themes {{of the river and}} of legal history.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Anuncio Digital Media, {{a locally}} started digital {{advertising}} firm, installed its first mall-based digital signage network, {{which consists of}} a series of twenty plasma screen televisions around the main concourse and in the food court <b>that</b> <b>display</b> six-second sound-free advertisements. Post Oak Mall was the first of four CBL-owned malls to receive this network, with four other CBL malls scheduled to follow. The advertising displays were activated on September 1, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are {{the most}} {{important}} breeders because they produce the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species are also important because they produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders <b>that</b> <b>display</b> optimal breeding behaviours. Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes to pass on. All of these factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish.|$|E
5|$|Many {{poisonous}} or distasteful {{animals that}} advertise their presence with warning coloration (aposematism) use patterns that emphasize rather than disrupt their outlines. For example, skunks, salamanders and monarch butterflies all have high contrast patterns <b>that</b> <b>display</b> their outlines. These advertising patterns exploit the opposite principle to disruptive coloration, {{for what is}} in effect the exactly opposite effect: to make the animal as conspicuous as possible.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that humans respond to {{computer}} personalities and that they prefer computers with personalities similar to their own. However, it is not clear if this phenomenon makes a difference in how a person works. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether users interacting with a computer similar to them, in terms of extroversion and introversion, work better and more successfully when given a task. ^ Since previous work has shown that users prefer working with computers similar to themselves, it was reasonable to theorize that they work better with such computers. Therefore, the following hypotheses were formed considering introvert and extrovert personalities: Hypothesis 1 : Introvert users will complete a task more correctly with the help of a computer <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> introvert characteristics than one <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> extrovert characteristics. Hypothesis 2 : Extrovert users will complete a task more correctly with the help of a computer <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> extrovert characteristics than one <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> introvert characteristics. ^ Conversely, since users do not prefer working with computers dissimilar to themselves, it was reasonable to conclude that they will not work as well with a computer that is opposite to them as with a computer similar to them. Therefore, the following hypotheses were formed: Hypothesis 3 : Introvert users will complete a task less correctly if assisted by a computer <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> extrovert characteristics than one <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> introvert characteristics. Hypothesis 4 : Extrovert users will complete a task less correctly if assisted by a computer <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> introvert characteristics than one <b>that</b> <b>displays</b> extrovert characteristics. To prove or disprove the above hypotheses, an experiment was conducted using methods similar to those of the previous studies. The experiment did not provide evidence that confirmed the hypotheses, but it did provide evidence and questions for future work. ...|$|R
