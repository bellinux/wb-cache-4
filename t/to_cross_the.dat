5|$|Even though Vrbanac {{ordered a}} halt to the {{operation}} shortly after midnight on 18/19 September, the Bjelovar Corps failed to cancel new crossing attempts it had ordered for 6:00 the following morning. The attacks went ahead, albeit at 10:30, with the 52nd and the 125th Home Guard regiments' battlegroups trying <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Sava River at different locations. Despite strengthening river currents and continued VRS artillery fire, small reconnaissance elements managed <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> river, only to be forced back an hour later.|$|E
5|$|Five North Korean Army (KPA) {{divisions}} massed {{around the}} city preparing <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Naktong River and assault it {{from the north and}} west. Defending the city were the 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK II Corps. In a series of engagements, each of the North Korean divisions attempted <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Naktong and attack the defending forces. The success of these attacks varied by region, but attacks in the 1st Cavalry Division sector were repulsed and the attacks in the South Korean sector were more successful.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the Bad Axe River, on 1 August 1832, Black Hawk and Winnebago prophet and fellow British Band leader White Cloud advised the band against wasting time {{building}} rafts <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River, because the U.S. forces were closing in, urging them instead to flee northward and seek refuge among the Ho-Chunk.

5|$|After the Warrior left, Black Hawk {{decided to}} seek {{refuge in the}} north with the Ojibwes. Only about 50 people, {{including}} Wabokieshiek, agreed to go with him; the others remained, determined <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi and return to Sauk territory. The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north {{when he learned that}} the American army had closed in on the members of the British Band who were trying <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi. He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, he gave up the attempt. Sauk chief Weesheet later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for abandoning the people during the final battle of the war.|$|E

5|$|American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver, who {{explored}} {{the river in}} 1792, proved {{that it was possible}} <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Columbia Bar.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of June 1807, the Emperor reassessed his strategic situation and decided {{that he needed to}} move northeast, in order to prevent Bennigsen's Russian army from using the bridge at Friedland <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Alle river. If the Russians managed <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Alle river at Friedland, they could then move closer to their Prussian allies, who were based in Königsberg. Napoleon drew up a plan, giving Marshal Murat two army corps and a powerful cavalry reserve, with orders to march on Königsberg, while sending the rest of the troops towards Friedland. Leading the thrust towards Friedland was Marshal Jean Lannes's Reserve Corps (two infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade), with Grouchy's dragoons and Nansouty's horse carabiniers and cuirassiers temporarily attached. In Murat's absence, Grouchy was the senior cavalry commander and was to take overall command of all the cavalry that remained with the Emperor.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Lee and the other <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, {{and the location of}} the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had less to do with the shape of the bridge than the fact that arch was derived from arcus, meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E
