After the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions are unlocked, and Time Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car. There are three secret cars; the '13th Racing' (from the first Ridge Racer) of <b>the</b> <b>Novice</b> course, and the new '13th Racing Kid' (of the Intermediate course) and 'White Angel' (of the Expert course). These cars are unlocked upon winning the respective course's Time Trial race.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} effect of changes in ball properties and cognitive demands {{on the performance of}} adolescent male athletes of varying levels of soccer expertise. Participants moved through a course under two conditions: decision and no decision, and with two types of soccer balls, regular and futsal. The experts moved through the courses with both balls significantly faster than <b>the</b> <b>novices</b> and had a lower percentage of control errors with the regular ball but not with the futsal ball. Both groups performed significantly slower under the decision condition, but no differences were found between conditions in the percentage of control errors made. <b>The</b> <b>novices</b> made a significantly smaller percentage of control errors with the futsal ball than the regular ball, although the type of ball had no effect on their performance times. These results suggest that the experts display better soccer skills and cognition than <b>the</b> <b>novices</b> and that <b>the</b> properties of the futsal ball appear to reduce the technical demands for <b>the</b> <b>novices...</b>|$|R

5|$|When she was {{ten years}} old, Van Dijk started, {{together}} with her two brothers and Mariëlle Kerste, cross-training on a bike {{during the summer and}} she began competing in regional races. Because Van Dijk performed well, she started competing in national races at the age of 15 in 2002. In the same year, in her first national championship, she finished in fourth place. The following year, she won the Dutch national road championship in <b>the</b> <b>novice</b> category. In 2004, Van Dijk won two more national titles, this time as a junior, in the road race and in the road individual time trial. In the latter, she beat Marianne Vos, though Vos would avenge her defeat in Road World Championships in Verona, Italy. Vos won the junior road race world title, with Van Dijk finishing third. In 2005, Van Dijk again won the Dutch national junior title in the individual time trial but finished second in the road race, again behind Vos. In 2007, when Van Dijk was considered for selection in regional speed skating, she had to choose between speed skating and cycling– ultimately, she chose cycling.|$|E
