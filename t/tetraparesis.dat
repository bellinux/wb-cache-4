5000|$|Copper {{deficiency}} myelopathy {{in humans}} was discovered and first described by Schleper and Stuerenburg in 2001. They described {{a patient with}} a history of gastrectomy and partial colonic resection who presented with severe <b>tetraparesis</b> and painful paraesthesias and who was found on imaging to have dorsomedial cervical cord T2 hyperintensity.

The patient was treated with parenteral copper and the patient`s paraesthesias did resolve. Since this discovery, there has been heightened and increasing awareness of copper-deficiency myelopathy and its treatment, and this disorder has been reviewed by Kumar.Sufferers typically present difficulty walking (gait difficulty) caused by sensory ataxia (irregular muscle coordination) due to dorsal column dysfunction or degeneration of the spinal cord (myelopathy). Patients with ataxic gait have problems balancing and display an unstable wide walk. They often feel tremors in their torso, causing side way jerks and lunges.|$|E

40|$|An 18 -month-old European shorthair cat was {{presented}} with a two week history of progressive decrease in consciousness, ambulatory <b>tetraparesis,</b> moderate ataxia and generalised decreased-to-absent postural reactions.

Histopathological examination revealed a mild-to-moderate lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltration, predominantly in the dorsal spinal roots, cranial nerves and ganglia in association with marked demyelination and proliferation of Schwann cells.

40|$|Background: We {{report a}} 56 year old male hypertensive, who {{presented}} with a posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) as an initial manifestation of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS). His first symptoms were right hemiparesis and hemihypoesthesia, followed by headache, dizziness, dysarthria and a general feeling of discomfort. On the third day, flaccid <b>tetraparesis,</b> impairment of consciousness, epileptic seizures and respiratory failure appeared, along with severe hypertension. Cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed the characteristic PRES lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses revealed albumin-cytological dissociation and nerve conduction studies showed an axonal demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, which confirmed the diagnosis of GBS. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin was given together with antihypertensive therapy and mechanical ventilation, achieving an important clinical and imaging remission of PRES, but maintaining <b>tetraparesis</b> during the hospitalization. Twelve months after discharge and regular motor rehabilitation, the patient achieved complete autonomy on the activities of daily living.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} individuals suffering from spastic <b>tetraparesis</b> as a consequence of cerebral palsy tune their trunk involvement to accuracy demands in a spoon-handling task. Twenty-two participants (ten adolescents with spastic <b>tetraparesis</b> and 12 control participants) had to transport a spoon filled with water or sugar to a small or a large bowl that was placed within reach. Even though trunk displacement was larger in the tetraparetic participants {{than it was in the}} control participants, the effects of the imposed accuracy constraints were remarkably similar. Participants in both groups increased trunk displacement with increasing precision requirements. Furthermore, in both groups the largest trunk involvement was found in the initial and final part of the substance-transporting phase, when wrist velocity was lowest. We propose several explanations for these findings and conclude that the large trunk involvement in individuals with tetraparetic cerebral palsy should, in any case, not be regarded as a primary symptom of the disorder, but rather as an adaptive reaction to increased task demands. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Gastrostomy {{tube feeding}} (GTF) is {{indicated}} {{for children with}} feeding difficulties due to tetraspastic cerebral palsy, {{although there are no}} definitive conclusions about the benefits of GTF. OBJECTIVE: To compare nutritional status and diet of pediatric patients with <b>tetraparesis</b> cerebral palsy who are fed by GTF with those fed orally (PO). METHODS: A transversal and descriptive study on 54 patients with spastic <b>tetraparesis</b> was held. The referred parameters were: weight, knee height and estimated height, cutaneous folds and circumferences. The Frisancho reference was used to compare the skin folds and body circumferences. The Brooks et al. curve was adopted as a reference for weight, height, and BMI. Food inquiry was performed using the Habitual Dietary Recall method. The total energetic value (TEV) of macronutrients and fibers was performed by AvanutriÂ® version 4. 0, a nutrition software program. The differences of nutritional parameters between the GTF and the PO groups were calculated by chi-squared and Fisherâ€™s exact tests, and the comparison between the groups for variable numbers was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. The significance level adopted was 5 %. RESULTS: The PO group presented more individuals in the malnourished range (24. 14 %) and high levels of adipose and thin mass depletion. The ingestion of lipids was larger in the GTF group, even though the proteins and fibers were higher in the PO group. The comparison between the diets in the GTF group indicated that the mixed diet (industrialized and artisanal) supplied a greater contribution of proteins and fibers. CONCLUSION: Comparing the groups, the <b>tetraparesis</b> cerebral palsy patients fed orally have a greater impairment of their nutritional status, even though they have higher intakes of protein and fiber than those patients fed by gastrostomy, demonstrating a consistent argument for the use of gastrostomy...|$|E

Although a recent MRI she did at the beginning of symptoms showed no significant pathologies, except for a cervical disc herniation and adjacent spinal degeneration, and stenosis that confused the diagnostic procedure, newer imaging with CT and MRI, which was performed due to progression of <b>tetraparesis,</b> revealed the formation of a cervical epidural abscess. Surgical drainage was done after a complete infection workup. The patient showed immediate neurological improvement after surgery. She received antibiotics intravenously for 3 weeks and orally for another 6 weeks. The patient was free from complications 24 months after surgery. A high index of suspicion is most important in making a rapid and correct diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess. The classic clinical triad (fever, local pain, and neurologic deficits) is not sensitive enough for early detection. Continuous clinical, laboratory, and imaging monitoring are of paramount importance. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention could optimize the final functional outcome...|$|E
