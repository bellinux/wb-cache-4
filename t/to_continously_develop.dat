40|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of high-temperature superconductors is a pseudogap regime appearing in the underdoped cuprates above the superconducting transition temperature Tc. The pseudogap <b>continously</b> <b>develops</b> out of the superconducting gap. In addition, high-frequency conductivity experiments show a superconducting scaling of the optical response in the pseudogap regime, pointing towards a superconducting origin of the pseudogap. The phase-fluctuation vortex scenario is further supported by the measurement of an unusually large Nernst signal above Tc and the recently observed field-enhanced diamagnetism which scales with the Nernst signal. In this paper, we use a simple phenomenological model to calculate the paraconductivity and magnetic response caused by phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter above Tc. Our results are in agreement with experiments such as the superconducting scaling of the optical response and the spin (or Pauli) susceptibility, and further strengthen the idea of a phase-fluctuation origin of the pseudogap.

In [Busch & Kaiser 2003], the noise term {{is included in the}} slow v-variable, while in the analytical model, noise is added to the fast activator variable u. Usually the location of the additive noise term in the FHN system is not essential for the output dynamics, because the fluctuations shift the relative positions of the null clines in a similar way.

40|$|Due to {{the cheap}} and {{flexible}} framework {{that the underlying}} IP-technology of the internet provides, IP-networks are becoming popular {{in more and more}} contexts. For instance, telecommunication operators have started to replace the fixed legacy telephony networks with IP-networks. To support a smooth transition towards IP-networks, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) was standardized. SCTP is used to carry telephony signaling traffic, and solves a number of problems that would have followed from using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in this context. However, the design of SCTP is still heavily influenced by TCP. In fact, many protocol mechansisms in SCTP are directly inherited from TCP. Unfortunately, many of these mechanisms are not adapted to the kind of traffic that SCTP is intended to transport: time critical message-based traffic, e. g. telephony signaling. In this thesis we examine, and adapt some of SCTP's mechanisms to more efficiently transport time critical message-based traffic. More specifically, we adapt SCTP's loss recovery and message bundling for timely message transfers. First, we propose and experimentally evaluate two loss recovery mechanisms: a packet-based Early Retransmit algorithm, and a modified retransmission timeout management algorithm. We show that these enhancements can reduce loss recovery times with at least 30 - 50 %, in some scenarios. In addition, we adapt the message bundling of SCTP to better support timely message delivery. The proposed bundling algorithm can in some situations reduce the transfer time of a message with up to 70 %. In addition to these proposals we have also indentified and reported mistakes {{in some of the most}} popular SCTP implementations.

40|$|Plants {{have the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>continously</b> {{generate}} new organs by maintaining populations of stem cells throught their lives. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) provides a stable environment {{for the maintenance of}} stem cells. All cells inside the SAM divide, yet boundaries and patterns are maintained. Experimental evidence indicates that patterning is independent of cell lineage, thus a dynamic self-regulatory mechanism is required. A pivotal role in the organization of the SAM is played by the WUSCHEL gene (WUS). An important question in this regard is that how WUS expression is positioned in the SAM via a cell-lineage independent signaling mechanism. In this study we demonstrate via mathematical modeling that a combination of an inhibitor of the Cytokinin (CK) receptor, Arabidopsis histidine kinase 4 (AHK 4) and two morphogens originating from the top cell layer, can plausibly account for the cell lineageindependent centering of WUS expression within SAM. Furthermore, our laser ablation and microsurgical experiments support the hypothesis that patterning in SAM occurs at the level of CK reception and signaling. The model suggests that the interplay between CK signaling, WUS/CLV feedback loop and boundary signals can account for positioning of the WUS expression, and provides directions for further experimental investigation. </p...|$|R

Further, bounding box-trained end-to-end models require extensive training data.

In this paper, we present a two-layer object detection method for brand logos and other stylized objects for which prototypical images exist. It can scale to large numbers of unique classes. Our first layer is a CNN from the Single Shot Multibox Detector family of models that learns to propose regions where some stylized object is likely to appear.

Because resistance to fluoroquinolones and macrolides, which are commonly used to treat human infections, has emerged in C. jejuni, it is imperative <b>to</b> <b>continously</b> monitor resistance patterns and examine the genetic variation in strains from human infections and animal reservoirs. Our previous study of C. jejuni from human campylobacteriosis cases showed a significantly higher rate of tetracycline resistance compared to national trends, and identified multilocus sequence type (ST) - 982 and a history of cattle contact to be associated with tetracycline resistance. To further investigate these associations, we conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the frequency of antimicrobial resistance and examine the genetic diversity of C. jejuni recovered from 214 cattle at three Michigan herds. Overall, the prevalence of C. jejuni was 69. 2 % (range: 58. 6 – 83. 8 %) for the three farms, and 83. 7 % (n = 113) of isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. Resistance to only tetracycline predominated among the cattle isolates (n = 89; 65. 9 %) with most resistant strains belonging to ST- 459 (96. 5 %) or ST- 982 (86. 4 %). Among the 22 STs identified, STs 459 and 982 were more prevalent in one feedlot, which reported the use of chlortetracycline in feed upon arrival of a new herd. PCR-based fingerprinting demonstrated that the ST- 982 isolates from cattle and humans had identical banding patterns, suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmission. Resistance to macrolides (1. 5 %) and ciprofloxacin (16. 3 %) was also observed; 14 of the 22 ciprofloxacin resistant isolates represented ST- 1244. Together, these findings demonstrate a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistant C. jejuni in cattle and identify associations with specific genotypes. Continuous monitoring and identification of risk factors for resistance emergence are imperative to develop novel methods aimed at decreasing pathogen persistence in food animal reservoirs and the frequency of resistant infections in humans...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} validation of two inversion algorithms based on an explicit and an implicit atmospheric correction scheme to retrieve the concentration and distribution of water constituents in European coastal waters from multi-spectral satellite data. The algorithms are designed for radiance measurements of the grating spectrometer MERIS on board of the ENVISAT satellite of the European Space Agency ESA. A validation of all inversion steps is performed with a match-up analysis of in situ measurements taken simultaneously to the satellite overpasses. The findings of this thesis contribute to {{a deeper understanding of}} possible operational algorithms and their limitations in the retrieval of the water constituents: chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter and yellow substance absorption at 443 nm. The developed algorithms are based on the inversion of radiative transfer simulations by using artificial neural network techniques. Compared to standard look-up table approaches the main advantages of artificial neural networks are their ability <b>to</b> <b>continously</b> approximate the function's output data and their robustness against noisy input data. Standard methods for the retrieval of water constituents from satellite measurements consist of two steps: an explicit atmospheric correction to derive the spectral reflectance of the water body at mean sea level followed by an inversion method to retrieve the water constituents from the previously atmospherically corrected spectra. Often more than 90 % of the total measured signal originates from atmospheric scattering. Beside the choice of the bio-optical model, the accuracy of the water retrieval {{is directly related to the}} accuracy of the explicit atmospheric correction scheme. To overcome possible errors in an atmospheric correction this work investigates the accuracy and limits of an implicit atmospheric correction method, which directly relates the satellite measured signal at the top of the atmosphere to the concentrations of the water constituents. The results of this so called direct inversion method are compared both to in situ measurements as well as to an indirect inversion algorithm based on an explicit atmospheric correction...|$|R
