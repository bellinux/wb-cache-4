50|$|A freight {{forwarder}} offering a consolidation service, will issue its own air waybill or bill of lading. From now on AWB {{will be used}} to refer to both. This is called a Forwarder's or House AWB with its equivalent House BL. These act as contracts of carriage between the shipper and the forwarder, who in this case becomes a Deemed Carrier. The forwarder in turn enters into contracts with one or more carriers, often using more than one mode of transportation. The contract of carriage between the forwarder and carrier is called a Master Air Waybill (MAWB or MBL). A House Air Waybill (HAWB) or Bill of Lading (HBL) could act as a multimodal <b>transport</b> <b>document.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{carriage}} of goods by sea, air or land, goods may be lost, damaged or deteriorated. The bill of lading (<b>transport</b> <b>document</b> used almost exclusively for {{carriage of goods}} by sea) is a contract of carriage between the consignor, the carrier and consignee that acts as a receipt of transfer of goods and as a negotiable instrument. The bill of lading also determines rights and liabilities agreed between parties to an international sale contract. Also reservations as to {{the quality and quantity of}} the goods are marked on the bill when accepting goods so as to stifle any accusations from the consignee of damage in transit. The consignor retains ownership of the goods until the bill of lading is transferred to the consignee. Most bills of lading today are governed by international conventions such as the Hague Rules (International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading); Hague-Visby Rules, which is a revised version of the Hague Rules by a Brussels Protocol in 1968; and Hamburg Rules. These rules impose minimum responsibilities and liabilities that cannot be softened by contract.

The results suggest that the intended Member States’ policies to a great extent are aligned with the corresponding EU policies although the degree of alignment varies among Member States and freight transport policy areas. Infrastructure investments and differences among countries in relation to transport taxes, vehicle weights, and dimensions were identified as major barriers for the development of a European Co-Modal Freight Transport System. Policies towards removing existing barriers along with standardization actions, e. g., single <b>transport</b> <b>document,</b> enhancement of the training of the freight transport and logistics personnel, and further adoption and implementation of ICT, can substantially improve the competitive position of European intermodal freight systems...|$|E

40|$|The Rotterdam Rules {{have come}} to {{harmonise}} and update the law of international carriage of goods wholly or partly by sea. This Convention has been praised for being {{more aware of the}} interrelation between carriage and international sale contracts. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the impact that the Rotterdam Rules will have on international commercial sales when the applicable law is English law. The focus of the research has been placed on the provisions of the Rotterdam Rules which have been inserted to facilitate trade. The international trade of goods heavily relies on documentary performance. The transport documents are of the utmost significance and where they are negotiable, they enable sales down a string through transfer of a document of title. The provisions of the Rotterdam Rules allowing the seller to obtain the appropriate document for tender to the buyer have been examined, to discover possible implications on CIF and FOB contracts. Thus, study of the compatibility of the Rotterdam Rules with the Incoterms is critical. Equally significant has been the research of the relation between the requirements a <b>transport</b> <b>document</b> or electronic record should satisfy under the Rotterdam Rules and a letter of credit governed by the UCP 600, as this is the preferred method of payment in modern overseas sales. Moreover this thesis investigates {{the way in which the}} <b>transport</b> <b>document</b> can secure the seller’s and buyer’s rights under their contract of sale, if issued in an electronic form. Currently there is a particular interest in paperless contracting especially in the oil trade. Thus, whether the Rotterdam Rules can operate successfully, along with eUCP and modern registries and what law reforms need to take place to optimise trade facilitation and certainty in this area have also been examined. Finally because international sale agreements incorporate English law due to the advantages of freedom of contract, this made necessary the discussion of the trade dimensions of a volume contract that derogates from the Rotterdam Rules. The fluctuating balance between codification, consolidation of legal principles and freedom of contract as reflected by the Rotterdam Rules and texts of other rule-setting organisations underpins the findings of this thesis. Thus, not surprisingly, the way the Rotterdam Rules, which are a piece of international codification, legitimise freedom of contract in agreements that would otherwise be subject to a mandatory regime deserves special consideration. All the chapters are strongly interrelated both in conceptual and teleological legal terms. This thesis asserts that the trade implications from the application of the Rotterdam Rules are due to the idiosyncrasies of the regulation of carriage and trade laws. Although they may touch upon common concepts, they are constituted by varied legal sources and drafted by delegations, which, due to their background and composition harmonise the law based on different priorities. This justifies the synergies identified in this thesis; it is a thesis which goes beyond the implications identified and suggests the way forward so that the Rotterdam Rules can have a positive effect on sales concluded on shipment terms...|$|E

40|$|The most {{well known}} and {{developed}} sea <b>transport</b> <b>document</b> is the bill of lading, a legal institution of its own with many advantages, {{but it is also}} known to be a main contributor to high costs of trade due to delayed arrival of original documents, inaccurate or insufficient information and fraudulent issuance of incorrect or forged bills of lading. The trade community’s response to the problems associated with the bill of lading has been to develop the concept of the electronic bill of lading. This work began as early as 1970 but still has not gained commercial momentum. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to investigate whether electronic bills of lading are legally valid and if such documents can be submitted and accepted as evidence {{in a court of law}} and if there are such legal obstacles, to investigate international and/or national initiatives aimed at resolving the situation. A secondary purpose is to investigate how electronic bills of lading are used today and how their functionality is perceived by the trade parties. The traditional bill of lading is a document of title granting right to control of the goods to its holder. It is by Swedish law not clear if an electronic bill of lading qualifies as such a document of title meaning that a buyer of goods that is being transported under an electronic bill of lading may not have the right to control of the goods. Delayed arrival of original bills of lading cause carriers to deliver goods against letters of indemnity instead of surrender of bills of lading, hereby exposing themselves to risk and loss of P&I cover. Paper bills of lading are considered secure but are still subject to fraud and forgery. Electronic alternatives are considered equally or more secure, much thanks to the use of electronic signatures. World trade is increasing, in part due to the introduction of ICT systems that minimizes manual intervention and allows for free flow of information between concerned parties. Current offerings of electronic bills of lading are integrated in such information systems. Existing, such as the American, and proposed, such as the Rotterdam Rules, legislation that promotes the use of electronic bill of lading applies the principle of equivalence, whereby it is the functionality, not the media, which defines the legal qualities of a <b>transport</b> <b>document.</b> The document of title functionality is achieved by applying the principle of singularity, according to which, only one party may control the transport record, which is the functional equivalence of being the holder of a traditional bill of lading. Such laws do not yet exist in Sweden, leaving it unclear whether holders of electronic transport records have the same right to control of the goods as do holders of traditional paper bills of lading. Key conclusions of the thesis are that legislation based on the functional equivalence principle would eradicate the legal obstacles to the use of electronic bills of lading and that such legislative action combined with the current trend of implementing ICT systems in the shipping industry would serve to overcome the “traditional inertia” that has characterized the industry for so long, and ease the transition in to modern document management systems that will serve to eradicate the problems caused by the paper bill of lading...|$|E

50|$|Pollard's espionage nearly came {{to light}} in 1984 when a {{department}} head noted a report on Soviet military equipment and questioned why it was germane to the office. Pollard, whom the report was traced to, was asked about it, and he replied {{that he had been}} working on terrorist networks, which was accepted as valid. In 1985, a co-worker anonymously reported Pollard's removal of classified material from the NIC. The coworker noted that Pollard {{did not seem to be}} taking the material to any known appropriate destination, such as other intelligence agencies in the area. Although Pollard was authorized to <b>transport</b> <b>documents</b> and the coworker said the documents were properly wrapped, it appeared out of place that Pollard would be <b>transporting</b> <b>documents</b> on a Friday afternoon when there was little going on and people seemed to be focused on an upcoming long weekend.

Taking the initiative to secure it, the supervisor glanced over it and saw it was unrelated to antiterrorism matters in the Caribbean, which is what the section focused on. Looking at more unrelated documents, the supervisor believed foreign intelligence might be involved, but was unable to determine which nation might be interested.|$|R
40|$|Transport {{documents}} play {{a crucial}} role in international trade of goods. Their role is particularly evident in the area of massive, rapid and reliable supply of goods worldwide. Among many diversity and heterogeneous issues related to the transport documents, the question of transfer of rights incorporate into a bill of lading has a particular meaning. In this paper we’ll try to make analysis of some legal and economic aspects of transport documents. Through analysis of this issue, we will try to point out their function in international trade, their perception from the banking sector, and ultimately, their contribution to the rapid and stable international trade of goods. The complexity of the issue stems from the existence of multiple legal relations and the participation of multiple stakeholders in the transport and sale agreement. Although the law explicitly governs this issue, the practice raises more contentious situations that generate numerous arbitration and litigation cases. In this sense, the question is: which of the <b>transport</b> <b>document</b> has the status of proprietary document, which of them has the status of security, and finally, which of the issued documents are legal basis for the implementation of the letter of credit, prior to the banking sector!? On the other hand, the question of the reliability of these legal documents, justification and validity of electronic waybill is raised. Attitude towards the practice of transport documents, and resolving the issue of the responsibility of the parties, for the most part are based on the type of bill of lading issued by the carrier. Numerous judicial and arbitral decisions that determine the liability of the carrier, forwarder and logistics provider are based on the status of the transport documents issued by them. Theoretical analysis and positive law are only solutions on paper. In reality, business practice and autonomous commercial law are key instrument for executions of sale contracts. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the era of}} {{electronic}} revolution, the tendency of full implementation {{of electronic}} communication {{in the field of}} shipping and transport sector (logistic sector), is a fact that not surprise us at all. Process of replacing hard copy communication with electronic shipping communication has undergone a great expansion. The use of EDI systems in all industrial branches, including transport and shipping industry, create great innovations, and are treated as a major benefit for the international mass and fast transfer of goods. Digitalization in the field of trade, transport and logistic operator’s contributes to reducing paper costs, reducing timeline for transport route, and simplification of analysis and storage of transport and trade documents. Despite these efficiencies and convenience, until recently, electronic documentation in the field of transport was not covered by an international convention. Today, this subject has been covered by many international regulations, but business practice still shows doubt regarding the reliability of electronic transfer of property of the goods. This is especially case {{when it comes to the}} negotiable bill of lading as a document of title in the sea transport. Based on the concept of transfer bill of lading, three systems are created and: SeaDocs Registry Limited (SeaDocs), Bolero - Bill of Lading Electronic Registry Organisation, Global trade system TM. The purpose of this article is to analyze and elaborate each of these systems individually, and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Throught study of these systems, the author’s goal is to prove the justification of bill of lading as electronic <b>transport</b> <b>document</b> in which property rights on the goods are incorporate. More accurately, is there a place for full implementation of electronic bill of lading in the area of maritime transport (hereafter E/B/L). What is the degree of the risk from using E/B/L whit respect to ownership of the goods?! Finally, which of the existing systems of electronic transport can be trusted the most?!...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} potential synergies between an electronic waybill (e-Waybill) and other Intelligent Transport System (ITS) services. An e-Waybill service, as presented in this thesis, {{should be able to}} perform the functions of a paper waybill (which is an important <b>transport</b> <b>document</b> and contains essential information about a consignment) and it should contain at least the information specified in a paper waybill. To investigate synergies between the e-Waybill solutions and ITS services, we present 5 conceptual e-Waybill solutions that differ in where the e-Waybill information is stored, read, and written. These solutions are further investigated for functional and technical requirements (non-functional requirements), which can potentially impose constraints on a potential system that should implement the e-Waybill service. A set of 20 ITS services are considered for synergy analysis in this thesis. These services are mainly for road transport, however most of them are relevant to be considered for utilization in other modes of transport as well. For information synergy analysis, the e-Waybill solutions are assessed based on their synergies with ITS services. For different ITS services, the required input information entities are identified; and if at least one information entity can be provided by an e-Waybill at the right location we regard it to be a synergy. The result from our synergy analysis may support the choice of practical e-Waybill systems, which has the possibility to provide high synergy with ITS services. This may lead to a higher utilization of ITS services and more sustainable transport, e. g., in terms of reduced congestion and emissions. Additionally, a service design method has been proposed for supporting the process of designing new ITS services, which primarily utilizes on functional synergies with already existing ITS services. In order to illustrate the usage of the suggested method, we have applied it for designing a new ITS service, i. e., the Liability Intelligent Transport System (LITS) service. The purpose of the LITS service is to support the process of identifying when, where, and by whom a consignment has been damaged and who was responsible when the consignment was damaged...|$|E
