Nickel elements have a limited temperature range because the amount of change in resistance per degree of change in temperature becomes very non-linear at temperatures over 572 °F (300 °C).

A brief overview of heavy ion physics at present and at the next generation heavy ion facilities is given with a special emphasis on the conditions for heavy ion detection and the potential advantage of cryogenic detectors for applications in heavy ion physics. Two types of calorimetric low <b>temperature</b> <b>detectors</b> for the detection of ener-getic heavy ions have been developed and their response to the impact of heavy ions was investigated systematically {{for a wide range of}} energies (E = 0. 1 – 360 MeV/amu) and ion species (4 He [...] . 238 U). Excellent results with respect to energy resolution, ∆E/E ranging from 1 to 5 × 10 − 3 even for the heaviest ions, and other basic detec-tor properties such as energy linearity with no indication of a pulse height defect, energy threshold, detection efficiency and radiation hardness have been obtained, representing a considerable improvement as compared to conventional heavy ion detectors based on ionization.

50|$|The device {{consists}} of three functional units, each corresponding to the Sanger sequencing steps. The Thermal Cycling (TC) unit is a 250-nanoliter reaction chamber with integrated resistive <b>temperature</b> <b>detector,</b> microvalves, and a surface heater. Movement of reagent between the top all-glass layer and the lower glass-PDMS layer occurs through 500-μm-diameter via-holes. After thermal-cycling, the reaction mixture undergoes purification in the capture/purification chamber, and then is injected into the capillary electrophoresis (CE) chamber. The CE unit {{consists of}} a 30-cm capillary which is folded into a compact switchback pattern via 65-μm-wide turns.|$|E

Depending on the detector(s) (see below) installed on the GC, {{there may be a}} number of detector conditions that can also be varied. Some GCs also include valves which can change the route of sample and carrier flow. The timing of the opening and closing of these valves can be important to method development.|$|E
5000|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} gauges rely on {{the fact}} that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure. In this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it. A [...] thermocouple or Resistance <b>Temperature</b> <b>Detector</b> (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the Pirani gauge which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10 torr to 10−3 torr, but they are sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.|$|E

50|$|Thermowells are tubular {{fittings}} used {{to protect}} temperature sensors installed in industrial processes. A thermowell consists of a tube closed {{at one end and}} mounted in the process stream. A temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or resistance <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> is inserted in the open end of the tube, which is usually in the open air outside the process piping or vessel and any thermal insulation. Thermodynamically, the process fluid transfers heat to the thermowell wall, which in turn transfers heat to the sensor. Since more mass is present with a sensor-well assembly than with a probe directly immersed into the process, the sensor's response to process temperature changes is slowed by the addition of the well. If the sensor fails, it can be easily replaced without draining the vessel or piping. Since the mass of the thermowell must be heated to the process temperature, and since the walls of the thermowell conduct heat out of the process, sensor accuracy and responsiveness is negatively impacted by the addition of a thermowell.|$|E
5000|$|One popular {{technique}} for electro-thermal {{characterization of materials}} is the 3ω-method, in which a thin metal structure (generally a wire or a film) is deposited on the sample {{to function as a}} resistive heater and a resistance <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> (RTD). The heater is driven with AC current at frequency ω, which induces periodic joule heating at frequency 2ω due to the oscillation of the AC signal during a single period. There will be some delay between the heating of the sample and the temperature response which is dependent upon the thermal properties of the sensor/sample. This temperature response is measured by logging the amplitude and phase delay of the AC voltage signal from the heater across a range of frequencies (generally accomplished using a lock-in-amplifier). Note, the phase delay of the signal is the lag between the heating signal and the temperature response. The measured voltage will contain both the fundamental and third harmonic components (ω and 3ω respectively), because the Joule heating of the metal structure induces oscillations in its resistance with frequency 2ω due to the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of the metal heater/sensor as stated in the following equation: ...|$|E

5000|$|To be {{representative}} of the average temperature of fluid, the thermowell must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the process pipe or vessel (Normally 1/3 rd of the pipe inside diameter). A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (approximately 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the thermowell projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element. So, for a grounded thermocouple spring-loaded into a thermowell with a 1-inch-diameter shank and a tip thickness of [...]25 inch, a typical immersion length would equal 5.5 inches (1 inch OD x 5 + [...]25 inch well tip thickness +.25 inch sensor wall thickness = 5.5 inches). A thermowell is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long straight bore that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a [...]260-inch bore matching a [...]250-inch sensor). A thermowell is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, welded, sanitary cap or flanged process connection. The temperature sensor such as a thermometer, thermocouple or resistance <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> is inserted in the open end of the thermowell and typically spring-loaded to ensure that the outside tip of the temperature sensor is in metal to metal contact with the inside tip of the thermowell.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The gas {{temperature}} in vessel will be significantly increased {{according to the}} aeration speed and pressure during the aeration or deflation for the ultrahigh pressure vessel. Due to the restriction of air tightness and structure for the ultrahigh pressure vessel, {{it is difficult to}} measure the {{gas temperature}} by adopting the traditional measurement method without change of the vessel structure.

The sensor principle {{consists of a}} heating resistor, which creates a symmetrical temperature profile, and two <b>temperature</b> <b>detectors</b> symmetrically placed {{on both sides of}} the heater.
