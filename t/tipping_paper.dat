30|$|An {{analysis}} of cigarettes that “pass” the RIP test (i.e., greater than 75  % {{of the test}} cigarettes that extinguish before burning to the <b>tipping</b> <b>paper,</b> usually set by a regulator) to establish the location of extinguishment {{in relation to the}} band may help to understand the dominant mechanism. This is illustrated in Fig.  4, case A represents extinguishment of the test cigarette significantly ahead of the band, possibly caused by the cigarette coal being in contact with the substrate alone with virtually no influence of the band; in cases B and C, the band plays a role in the extinguishment but affects the advanced restriction to oxygen availability to different extents. In case D, however, the cigarette extinguishes immediately after passing through the band; {{it is likely that the}} band still plays its role in suppressing the smouldering tendency of the burning coal. A failed RIP cigarette using the banding technology is therefore a cigarette that its bands are not sufficient to achieve either of the four situations described and the cigarette continue to burn the end of its tobacco column.|$|E
40|$|This study investigates by {{nonlinear}} constitutive equations {{the influence}} of <b>tipping</b> <b>paper,</b> cigarette paper, filter, and tobacco rod {{on the degree of}} filter ventilation and draw resistance. Starting from the laws of conservation, the path to the theory of fluid dynamics in porous media and Darcy's law is reviewed and, as an extension to Darcy's law, two different nonlinear pressure drop-flow relations are proposed. It is proven that these relations are valid constitutive equations and the partial differential equations for the stationary flow in an unlit cigarette covering anisotropic, inhomogeneous and nonlinear behaviour are derived. From these equations a system of ordinary differential equations for the one-dimensional flow in the cigarette is derived by averaging pressure and velocity over the cross section of the cigarette. By further integration, the concept of an electrical analog is reached and discussed in the light of nonlinear pressure drop-flow relations. By numerical calculations based on the system of ordinary differential equations, it is shown that {{the influence of}} nonlinearities cannot be neglected because variations in the degree of filter ventilation can reach up to 20 % of its nominal value...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundDevelopment of {{cigarettes}} that reduce exposure to harmful smoke constituents is a suggested tobacco harm reduction strategy, but robust methods for {{measurement of change}} are required. We investigated whether changes in biomarkers of exposure (BoE), effective dose (BoED) and biological effect (BoBE) could be detected after switching from conventional cigarettes to a reduced-toxicant-prototype cigarette (RTP). MethodsRegular smokers of 6 – 8 mg ISO tar yield cigarettes were recruited in Hamburg, Germany, and supplied with a conventional 7 mg ISO tar yield cigarette for 2 weeks then switched to the same cigarette with a different <b>tipping</b> <b>paper</b> (control) or the RTP for 6 months. Subjects smoked mostly at home and attended five residential clinic visits where urine and blood samples were collected for analysis. Primary endpoints were changes in specific biomarker levels compared with non-smoker background levels. Changes in daily cigarette consumption were also investigated. ResultsBoE levels in controls generally increased over the study period, whereas most BoE and all BoED significantly declined in RTP smokers. Most BoBE data were similar across groups and/or too variable within individuals to detect changes. Increased daily cigarette consumption was affected by supply of free cigarettes, perceived shorter smoking time per cigarette than usual brands, and perceived reduced harm. ConclusionsDespite increased cigarette consumption, reductions in BoE and BoED were detectable...|$|E

40|$|Background: Second hand smoke (ETS) -associated {{particulate}} matter (PM) contributes considerably to indoor air contamination and constitutes a health risk for passive smokers. Easy to measure, PM {{is a useful}} parameter to estimate the dosage of ETS that passive smokers are exposed to. Apart from its suitability as a surrogate parameter for ETS-exposure, PM itself affects human morbidity and mortality in a dose-dependent manner. We think that ETS-associated PM should be considered an independent hazard factor, separately from the many other known harmful compounds of ETS. We believe that brand-specific and tobacco-product-specific differences in the release of PM matter and that these differences are of public interest. Methods: To generate ETS of cigarettes and cigarillos as standardized and reproducible as possible, an automatic second hand smoke emitter (AETSE) was developed {{and placed in a}} glass chamber. L&M cigarettes (“without additives”, “red label”, “blue label”), L&M filtered cigarillos (“red”) and 3 R 4 F standard research cigarettes (as reference) were smoked automatically according to a self-developed, standardized protocol until the tobacco product was smoked down to 8 mm distance from the <b>tipping</b> <b>paper</b> of the filter. Results: Mean concentration (Cmean) and area under the curve (AUC) in a plot of PM 2. 5 against time were measured, and compared. CmeanPM 2. 5 were found to be 518 μg/m 3 for 3 R 4 F cigarettes, 576 μg/m 3 for L&M “without additives” (“red”), 448 μg/m 3 for L&M “blue label”, 547 μg/m 3 for L&M “red label”, and 755 μg/m 3 for L&M filtered cigarillos (“red”). AUCPM 2. 5 -values were 208, 214 μg/m 3 ·s for 3 R 4 F reference cigarettes, 204, 629 μg/m 3 ·s for L&M “without additives” (“red”), 152, 718 μg/m 3 ·s for L&M “blue label”, 238, 098 μg/m 3 ·s for L&M “red label” and 796, 909 μg/m 3 ·s for L&M filtered cigarillos (“red”).
