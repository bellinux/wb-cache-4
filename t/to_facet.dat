40|$|Using first-principles {{calculations}} {{we studied}} the energetics (surface energy, step energy, stability with respect <b>to</b> <b>faceting)</b> of the low- and high-Miller-index (vicinal) Cu surfaces, namely, the (111), (100), (110), (311), (331), (210), (211), (511), (221), (711), (320), (553), (410), (911), and (332) surfaces. Our calculations {{are based on}} density-functional theory employing the all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) method. We found that the unrelaxed vicinal Cu surfaces between (100) and (111) are unstable relative <b>to</b> <b>faceting</b> at 0 K, while fully relaxed vicinal surfaces between (100) and (111) are stable relative <b>to</b> <b>faceting,</b> which is {{in agreement with the}} observed stability of vicinal Cu surfaces at room temperature. Thus atomic relaxations {{play an important role in}} the stability of the vicinal Cu surfaces. Using the surface energies of Cu(111), Cu(100), and Cu(110) and employing the effective pair-potential model, which takes into account only the changes in the coordination of the surface atoms, the surface energies of the vicinal Cu surfaces can be calculated with errors smaller than 1. 0 % compared with the calculated FLAPW surface energies. This result is due to the almost perfect linear scaling of the surface energies of the Cu(hkl) surfaces as a function of the total number of broken nearest-neighbor bonds. Furthermore, we calculate step-step interactions as a function of terrace widths and step energies of isolated steps...|$|R

50|$|A {{faceting}} {{machine is}} broadly defined as any device {{that allows the}} user to place and polish facets onto a mineral specimen. Machines can range in sophistication from primitive jamb-peg machines to highly refined, and highly expensive, commercially available machines. A major division among machines is found between those that facet diamonds {{and those that do}} not. Specialized equipment is required for diamond faceting, and faceting as an occupation rarely bridges the gap between diamond and non-diamond workmanship. A second division can be made between industrial faceting and custom/hobby faceting. The vast majority of jewelry-store gemstones are faceted either abroad in factories or entirely by machines. (Diamonds are the exception, owing to the training and specialized equipment required <b>to</b> <b>facet</b> them.) Custom jewelry is still commonly made of custom metalwork and mass-produced gemstones, but unusual cuts or particularly valuable gemstone material will likely be faceted on a personal faceting machine.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} temporal evolution of silicon surface topography under 500 -eV argon ion bombardment for two angles of incidence, namely 70 ° and 72.5 °. For both angles, parallel-mode ripples are observed at low fluences (up to 2 × 1017 ions cm- 2) which undergo a transition <b>to</b> <b>faceted</b> structures {{at a higher}} fluence of 5 × 1017 ions cm- 2. Facet coarsening takes place at further higher fluences. This transition from ripples <b>to</b> <b>faceted</b> structures is attributed to the shadowing effect due to a height difference between peaks and valleys of the ripples. The observed facet coarsening is attributed to a mechanism based on reflection of primary ions from the facets. In addition, the role of sputtering is investigated (for both the angles) by computing the fractional change in sputtering yield {{and the evolution of}} surface roughness.|$|R

Patients and methodsA prospective case-control study was conducted from January 2011 to June 2013. The selected patients suffered from lumbar spinal stenosis due <b>to</b> <b>facet</b> joint arthrosis and received two corticosteroid facet joint injections at two week intervals compared to the control-group with the same disease. Demographic data, clinical parameters and outcomes in six months were collected. The primary endpoint was the reduction of visual analogue score (VAS) for pain. ResultsSixty-four patients received a facet joint injection against 65 patients {{in the control group}}. The mean age was 67. 03 ± 12. 1 and 66. 02 ± 13. 7 and the sex ratio was 0. 64 and 0. 71, respectively in the “injection group” and “control group. ” All patients had a VAS> 4. At one, three and six months, 53 (82. 2 %), 41 (64. 06) and 26 (40. 62) patients had, respectively more than 75 % pain reduction against 27 (41. 53 %), 15 (23. 08) and 7 (10. 77) patients in the control group (p< 0. 01). Patients in the injection group were five times more improved than the control group at six months with OR= 5. 67 95 % CI[2. 07, 6. 16]. ConclusionThis work shows the effectiveness of facet joint injections to relieve pain due <b>to</b> <b>facet</b> joint arthrosis that continued at six months of follow up...|$|E

40|$|A {{majority}} of the American population will experience low-back pain during their lifetime. With this debilitating condition affecting more people every day, a solution is required to help the population. One {{of the causes of}} low-back pain is facet degeneration. Currently, there are no replacement devices on the market that solves this issue. This thesis presents a design of a facet joint replacement to reduce low-back pain due <b>to</b> <b>facet</b> degeneration. A finite element model of the lumbar spine (L 3 -L 5) was developed to evaluate the implant. Range of motion (ROM), facet contact forces and intervertebral disc stresses were compared for the instrumented and intact model. Futhermore, two additional surgical cases, a laminectomy and facetectomy, were also considered. It was found that the implant followed intact ROM and disc stresses better than a laminectomy and facetectomy. However, there was a large increase in facet contact forces at the adjacent non-operated level, which may ultimately lead <b>to</b> <b>facet</b> degeneration at the adjacent level. Further mechanical testing of the implant is required...|$|E
