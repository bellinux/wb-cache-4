The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession.

5|$|An incensed Democratic {{majority}} in the Kentucky General Assembly created a committee to investigate <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>of</b> voter fraud, even as armed citizens from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky poured into the state capital under auspices of keeping Democrats from stealing the election. Before the investigative committee could report, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin while entering the state capitol on January 30, 1900. As Goebel lay in a nearby hotel being treated for his wounds, the committee issued its report recommending that the General Assembly invalidate enough votes to give the election to Goebel. The report was accepted, Taylor was deposed, and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31. He died three days later on February 2.|$|E
5|$|Evidence against Croitoru and Gravelle was {{presented}} {{over the course}} of eight weeks in 2006, but the judge stated that the case against the two accused was not strong. Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant withdrew the charges on June 12, 2006. Following this action by the attorney general, both Croitoru and Andre Gravelle announced plans to file lawsuits against people involved with the prosecution. Gravelle is suing for $25 million, and Croitoru is seeking $15 million for wrongful imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Hamilton Police Services was ordered to pay Gravelle $10,000 for court costs. In June 2006, Croitoru also pleaded guilty to <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>of</b> extortion and violating the terms of his bail. As a result, he was forced to forfeit $10,000 of the bail money.|$|E
5|$|In 1173, {{more than}} two years after the murder of Becket, King Henry II of England decided to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury; there were two candidates: Richard, and Odo, prior of Canterbury. Previously, Roger, the abbot of Bec Abbey, had been elected, but refused the office. On 3 June 1173, Richard was chosen, {{although}} the monks preferred Odo. Both sides appealed to Rome, and Richard journeyed to Rome with Reginald fitz Jocelin, who had recently been elected Bishop of Bath, to rebut <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>of</b> simony, illegitimate birth, and swearing an oath to the king that had been raised. After hearing the charges, they were dismissed and the election was ratified on 2 April 1174 and on 7 April 1174 the new archbishop was consecrated at Anagni by Pope Alexander III. Richard returned to England {{at the close of the}} year bearing his pallium which he had received directly from the pope. He was also granted legatine powers by Alexander III.|$|E

5|$|Rose Beuret and Rodin {{returned}} to Paris in 1877, {{moving into a}} small flat on the Left Bank. Misfortune surrounded Rodin: his mother, who had {{wanted to see her}} son marry, was dead, and his father was blind and senile, cared for by Rodin's sister-in-law, Aunt Thérèse. Rodin's eleven-year-old son Auguste, possibly developmentally delayed, was also in the ever-helpful Thérèse's care. Rodin had essentially abandoned his son for six years, and would have a very limited relationship with him throughout his life. Father and son now joined the couple in their flat, with Rose as caretaker. <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> <b>of</b> fakery surrounding The Age of Bronze continued. Rodin increasingly sought more soothing female companionship in Paris, and Rose stayed in the background.|$|E
5|$|The Anti-Relief partisans {{nominated}} former Senator John J. Crittenden {{for one of}} the {{two seats}} apportioned to Franklin County in the state House. The Relief Party countered with Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent area lawyer. During the sharply contested campaign, both John U. Waring and Patrick Henry Darby, a land speculator, said that Sharp's life was at risk if he won. Opponents revived <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>of</b> Sharp's illegitimate child. It was also alleged that Sharp had claimed that the child was mulatto and said he had a certificate from Cooke's midwife to that effect; whether Sharp made this claim may never be known for certain. Despite the controversy, Sharp netted the most votes in the election, winning by 69 {{out of a total of}} 1600 votes cast in the county.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1221 Maulay {{was accused}} of treason by Richard Mucegros and Hubert de Burgh before the king. The {{specific}} crime was alleged to be a plot to hand over Eleanor of Brittany, then held at Corfe Castle, to King Louis IX of France. Maulay was imprisoned for a short time, but on 4 June was released after surrendering Corfe to the king. He was allowed to retain his sheriffdom. The accusation may have owed more {{to the fact that}} Maulay had recently taken Mucegros' lands into custody because Mucegros had failed to make a payment due for a royal fine. The event may also have been used by de Burgh as an opportunity to weaken Maulay's patron and de Burgh's rival for power, Peter des Roches, while des Roches was out of England. The loss of Corfe by one of des Roches' primary supporters would have weakened des Roches' standing and power. In July Peter des Roches returned to England and in late July was instrumental in the clearing of Maulay from <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>of</b> treason. Maulay was not given back custody of Corfe, but on 29 July the royal government discharged the 7000 marks that Maulay still owed for his marriage fine. The stated reason for the release of this debt was to compensate Maulay for his expenses while controlling Corfe, but the real reason appears to have been to compensate for the loss of Corfe. In late 1221 Maulay agreed to go on crusade with Peter des Roches and Falkes de Breauté, another of des Roches supporters. The loss of Damietta in September meant that the three men postponed their departure, and in November 1221 Maulay was replaced as sheriff. In return for Maulay's agreement to the ouster, the Exchequer wrote off more debts that Maulay owed the government, this time over 8800 marks. Maulay retired to his lands in Yorkshire.|$|E

5000|$|In this charge, Cardigan formed up {{his unit}} and <b>charged</b> <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> the Valley of the Balaclava, {{under fire from}} Russian {{batteries}} in <b>the</b> hills. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Light Brigade caused 278 casualties of the 700-man unit.

The aim <b>of</b> any cavalry <b>charge</b> is to scatter the enemy lines and frighten the enemy off <b>the</b> battlefield. <b>The</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Light Brigade so unnerved the Russian cavalry, which had been routed by the Heavy Brigade, that the Russians were set to full-scale flight.|$|R
