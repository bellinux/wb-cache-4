5|$|Leggetts Creek has {{relatively}} {{high levels of}} <b>total</b> <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> and electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the creek ranged from 538.00 to 979.50 micro-siemens per centimeter, {{with an average of}} 677.54 micro-siemens per centimeter. The concentration of dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 680.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 411.96 milligrams per liter. The creek is fairly alkaline, with a pH ranging from 7.64 to 9.23 and averaging 8.20. The concentration of salinity in the creek averages 345 parts per million, but reaches levels as high as 435 parts per million and as low as 280 parts per million. This is within the recommended limit of 1000 parts per million, but a 2013/2014 study nevertheless recommended reducing the salinity of the creek.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, <b>total</b> <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids,</b> alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} on solution extracted from 85 soil samples collected at a prawn aquaculture in Kerpan. These soil samples were taken at depths of about 2 m by using hand auger. Localities of samples were along several parallel lines which are perpendicular to the coast to about 20 km towards inland. Water samples were also collected from boreholes drilled at depths of 10 to 25 m for chemical analysis. Hydrochemical data of water extracted from soil samples taken from depths of 1 - 2 m show chloride concentrations ranging from 12 to 6, 500 mg/L. The wide range of ion concentrations indicates the presence of different type of water which can be classified as fresh to saline. <b>Total</b> <b>dissolved</b> <b>solid</b> values of the water samples also show quite a considerable range of concentrations ranging from 100 to 40, 000 mg/L representing fresh to saline type of water. This saline zone is within about 1 km from the coast if interpreted based on <b>total</b> <b>dissolved</b> <b>solid</b> values while the distance is much further towards inland which is 4 - 5 km based on chloride concentrations. In coastal areas, the presence of salt water {{can be associated with}} direct intrusion of sea water into the underground water system or it can be contributed from the infiltration of sea water through the rivers or canals during high tides into the coastal plain. The presence of salt water is supported by the increase in the concentration of natrium, kalium and calcium towards the sea. Based on spatial distribution map of chloride concentration, high salinity contour seems to follow the shape of the aquaculture ponds in the study area indicating some possibility of infiltration of sea water in the pond into the neighbouring areas. Water samples from boreholes drilled to depths of 10 to 25 m were taken and analysed in order to detect for any influence of sea water intrusion into the salinity of groundwater in the study area. Borehole water samples show chloride concentration ranging from 2, 030 to 13, 000 mg/L while the concentration of <b>total</b> <b>dissolved</b> <b>solid</b> ranges from 3, 233 to 9, 280 mg/L. The high chloride and <b>total</b> <b>dissolved</b> <b>solid</b> concentrations in the samples indicate the areas near the boreholes or within 1 km from the coast were contaminated due to the intrusion of sea water...|$|R
