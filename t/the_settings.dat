5|$|Like Usmar Ismail, Djajakusuma was {{influenced}} by realism. However, while Ismail preferred to focus on national-level themes, Djajakusuma was more drawn to simple, locally relevant storylines with educational messages. This realism carried over into Djajakusuma's work in wayang. <b>The</b> <b>settings,</b> traditionally drawn, were instead created as three-dimensional sets, including representations of trees, rocks, and water. According to Soemardjono, who often edited Djajakusuma's films, the director enjoyed experimenting with new techniques to better convey his intentions.|$|E
50|$|In Earth, <b>the</b> <b>setting's</b> future history {{includes}} a war pitting {{most of the}} Earth against Switzerland, fueled by outrage over the Swiss allowing generations of kleptocrats to hide their stolen wealth in the country's secretive banks.

5|$|Landscape was a {{secondary}} concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare {{and when they}} did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; <b>the</b> <b>settings</b> tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.|$|E
5|$|Movies, {{television}} shows, and documentaries {{have been}} filmed {{in and around}} Sawtooth National Forest, particularly around the Sun Valley area. Movies filmed in Sun Valley include I Met Him in Paris (1937), Sun Valley Serenade (1941), and Bus Stop (1956). Clint Eastwood's 1985 film Pale Rider was filmed in the SNRA, mostly in the Boulder Mountains in late 1984. The opening credits scene was shot south of Stanley {{in front of the}} Sawtooth Mountains. The SNRA was one of <b>the</b> <b>settings</b> of the 2010 3-D computer animated film Alpha and Omega.|$|E
5|$|Norton Internet Security 2000, {{released}} January 10, 2000, was Symantec's {{first foray}} beyond virus protection and content control filters. Its release followed an alliance between Internet provider Excite@Home and antivirus vendor McAfee.com to provide Internet subscribers with McAfee's new firewall software, McAfee Personal Firewall. Version 2000s firewall, based on AtGuard from WRQ, filters traffic at the packet level. It can block ActiveX controls and Java applets. Other functionalities include cookie removal, and banner ad blocking. ZDNet found the ad blocker removed graphics {{that were not}} ads, breaking pages. Adjusting <b>the</b> <b>settings</b> fixed the problem, however the process was complicated. ZDNet noted {{the lack of information}} presented concerning attacks the firewall blocked.

5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS was that <b>the</b> <b>settings,</b> made through four main input dials, were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, {{the entire system}} had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E
5|$|The large armlet of pierced gold (opus interrasile) showed {{traces of}} {{hematite}} {{on the reverse}} side, which {{probably would have been}} used as a type of jeweller's rouge. This is the earliest known and documented use of this technique on Roman jewellery. Gilt items showed the presence of mercury, indicating the mercury gilding technique. The black inlay on the cast silver tigress shows the niello technique, but with silver sulphide rather than lead sulphide. <b>The</b> <b>settings</b> of stones where garnet and amethyst remain, in the body chain, have vacant places presumed to be where pearls were set, and show elemental sulphur as adhesive or filler.|$|E

Organized projects, such as Tamriel Rebuilt and , attempt to recreate the originally envisioned Morrowind province and other parties of Tamriel, as seen in other The Elder Scrolls games. For example, there are interpretations of both Cyrodiil and Skyrim, <b>the</b> <b>settings</b> of later The Elder Scrolls games.|$|E

30|$|A {{total of}} 158 ECEC {{settings}} {{were invited to}} participate in this study, and 93 agreed to do so. The sampling procedure follows a probability proportional to size selection approach, such that the number of children in a setting determined <b>the</b> <b>setting’s</b> probability of being part of <b>the</b> sample. ECEC <b>settings</b> from both rural and urban areas of Norway were included. The non-participation of 41 % of <b>the</b> approached <b>settings</b> could be due to several reasons. Some of <b>the</b> invited <b>settings</b> had no groups that fulfilled the study’s criterion of having at least three or more children who were born in 2011 and 2012 and whose parents gave their consent for participation. Other settings reported having undergone structural changes, such as merging two ECEC settings into one.|$|R
5|$|Version 2002 was {{announced}} August 28, 2001. The Family Edition was dropped, so parental controls and information filtering are bundled with this release.

PC Magazine found the default settings, aimed at avoiding frequent notifications, were somewhat permissive. Windows 95 support was also dropped.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{worked on}} the {{character}} designs for the main cast. He was originally only {{going to work on}} Aya and Eve, but after seeing <b>the</b> <b>settings</b> for the other characters, he offered to design them too. The team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower. This was inspired by a similar scene in Parasite Eve II. When the title was being developed for PSP, the team's main challenge with the character was to make her look as realistic as possible while retaining her established physical traits. Using this new realism, the team wanted to portray the fear felt by humans when faced with such threats through Aya. Achieving this realism proved {{one of the most difficult}} aspects of development. Her alternate costumes were not a high priority for the team, so their artists had high creative freedom.|$|E
5|$|She {{learned to}} draw during her {{schooling}} at Papunya and Haasts Bluff, but her first {{experience as a}} painter came working on backgrounds for the pictures created by her father. From the Pintupi/Luritja language group, Daisy Jugadai {{was one of a}} range of artists who came to painting through the Ikuntji Women's Centre in the early 1990s. She is credited with {{a significant role in the}} centre's establishment. She began with screen printing and linocut printmaking, but quickly shifted to acrylic painting, producing many of her best works during the mid-1990s. Western Desert artists such as Daisy Jugadai will frequently paint particular 'dreamings' or Tjukurrpa for which they have personal responsibility or rights. A complex concept, Tjukurrpa refers to the spiritual knowledge of the landscape and custodianship of it; it also refers to laws, rules or stories that people must maintain and re-produce in their communities. Daisy Jugadai portrayed in her art both those for which she had personal responsibility, and those of her late husband and late father. These included honey ant, spinifex and emu dreamings; geographical locations that were <b>the</b> <b>settings</b> for these paintings included Muruntji waterhole and Talabarrdi, and other locations around Kungkayunti, where her family had lived for many years.|$|E
