40|$|Transition {{zones in}} railway tracks are the {{locations}} with considerable changes in vertical support structures, e. g., near bridges. Due to possible water flow constrictions in transition zone structures, there is frequently an increased moisture {{level in the}} ballast/subballast layers, which is a potential source of track degradation. This paper presents results of the moisture condition measured in three transition zones using ground penetrating radar, where the ballast/subballast are analyzed. The relationship between the moisture condition and track degradation in the transition zones is studied by comparing it to the longitudinal track level that {{is measured by the}} <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>coaches.</b> A strong connection is found between the high moisture condition and track degradation in the transition zones. The dynamic behavior of the transition zones with high moisture condition is analyzed using the Finite Element method. Differential stiffness and settlement are taken into consideration in the transition zone model, which is also coupled with a vehicle. The ballast/subballast layers are modelled as solid elements. Increased moisture conditions are considered as a reduction of elastic modulus, according to laboratory findings. Results show that high moisture leads to an increase of dynamic wheel loads in the transition zone, which explains the connection and confirms that the high moisture condition is a source of transition zone problems...|$|R

40|$|<b>Track</b> <b>inspection</b> is {{purposely}} {{performed to}} recover tracks from defects and damage and eliminate potential safety hazards. It is scheduled through an exhaustive process that usually integrates many disciplines such as optimization, statistics, risk management, etc. Spending {{so much of}} a monetary and an emotional investment in an original schedule (referred to as master schedule hereafter) that the scheduler wants to deliver might be a good excuse not to develop a solid ‘Plan B’. Plan B here refers to scheduler responses or a contingency plan when the master schedule does not go as expected. It is found that there is often low to moderate probability of a crisis occurring when a schedule is executed in a real environment. Nevertheless, its impact can leave transportation services to the mercy of the disruption as shown by the Christmas 2014 incident where a huge volume of passengers using King's Cross and Paddington services experienced both inconvenience and discomfort due to engineering delays and train disruption. Thus, this paper aims to discuss the potential of considering ‘Plan B’ or contingency plan if incidents arise that were not expected during <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> schedule execution. Benefits, general guidelines and relevant strategies for creating a contingency plan are also discussed. We highlight the rationale to support the claim that an original schedule of <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> jobs should be adapted to respond to a new context e. g. inspection vehicle machine breakdown, new inspection requests, man-made hazards, terrorist attack, extreme weather, climate change, etc. It is however proposed to develop an appropriate set of performance measure that is used to guide rescheduling in <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> due to financial, equipment inventory, manpower, safety regulations, time and spatial constraints.

40|$|Abstract — It is {{commonly}} accepted {{that the most}} efficient way to monitor track condition and other infrastructure assets is by means of <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> vehicles, collecting multi- parameter data simultaneously at normal line speeds. However, technological limitations have meant that up until recently it has not been possible to acquire subsurface trackbed parameters such as ballast thickness and ballast quality in a similar manner. A multi-channel ground-penetrating radar system is presented, capable of operating on a road-rail vehicle and at speeds of up to 100 mph suspended beneath a modified <b>track</b> <b>inspection</b> train. The system can collect up to 4 simultaneous channels of data across the trackbed, and provide a rapid analysis of ballast thickness and quality. This is achieved by the application of novel multivariate signal and image processing techniques to automatically detect, quantify and map variations in ballas...|$|R
