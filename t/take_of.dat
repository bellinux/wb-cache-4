The camera fades to Lauren, who sings the bridge as she stands next to a background of rocks, as a <b>take</b> <b>of</b> another man is shown. The group is then scattered in different spots standing in a large rock formation, where shots of Dinah alone are spliced as she sings the chorus. Normani shares the chorus, as she sings on top of the rock cliff, shown earlier in the video. Camila seductively lays down and grabs her hair, in similarity to Ally. Several men approach the girls as they arrive in a convertible Jeep Wrangler. They greet and socialize with each other.|$|E
5|$|Avatar {{crossed the}} $1billion {{mark on the}} 19th day of its {{international}} release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days. It became the fifth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the only film of 2009 to do so. In its fourth weekend, Avatar continued to lead the box office domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217, and becoming the highest-grossing 2009 release in the United States. In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446, and set a fifth-weekend record with a <b>take</b> <b>of</b> $42,785,612. It held the top spot to set the sixth and seventh weekend records earning $34,944,081 and $31,280,029 respectively. It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theatres.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{reportedly}} {{joined the}} cast of Prometheus in February 2011 with Idris Elba and Kate Dickie. Harris described Fifield as an audience surrogate who is very cautious and questions dangerous situations. Jon Spaihts, author of Alien: Engineers (the original prequel), wrote Fifield as changing directly into an Alien from the black mutagen, tying the film into the Alien canon. During its evolution into Prometheus, Ridley Scott decided to diverge from the previous films and establish a separate canon. In a deleted <b>take</b> <b>of</b> Fifield's mutated face he is more deformed and reminiscent of an Alien, with an elongated cranium under the melted, translucent helmet, long arms and sharp teeth. The character's final depiction retained Fifield's human appearance.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one <b>take</b> <b>of</b> Steve Carell putting {{his face in the}} putty, so he was instructed to hold his breath as long as he possibly could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E

5|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} {{successfully}} bred in captivity, both for falconry and for release back into the wild. Until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the US were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the US Endangered Species Act was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances. Peregrine falcons {{were removed from the}} United States' endangered species list in 1999. The successful recovery program was aided by the effort and knowledge of falconers – in collaboration with The Peregrine Fund and state and federal agencies – through a technique called hacking. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited <b>take</b> <b>of</b> wild peregrines was allowed in 2004, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Pictures of {{shooting}} the music video in Lyngby, Denmark were released on Aqua's Facebook page on 14 September 2011. A <b>take</b> <b>of</b> the video was also uploaded on their YouTube channel. The video was officially uploaded on YouTube on 22 September. Directed by Michael Sauer Christensen, {{it is set}} in an eerie, empty house that is reminiscent of a horror film, where a black cloud wanders through {{the halls of the}} house. The members wear black and gray clothing in the video, with Nystrom's costume gradually changing throughout. The video ends by the members exiting the house through the roof and transforming into a beam of light shooting into the sky. The video uses a shortened radio edit of the original song, omitting the bridge.|$|E

5|$|The 18th {{century was}} indeed {{the golden age of}} the chair, {{especially}} in France and England (including Colonial America), between which there was considerable give and <b>take</b> <b>of</b> ideas. Even Diderot could not refrain from writing of them in his Encyclopédie. The typical Louis Seize chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.|$|E
5|$|The common {{thresher}} {{is widely}} caught by offshore longline and pelagic gillnet fisheries, {{especially in the}} northwestern Indian Ocean, the western, central, and eastern Pacific, and the North Atlantic. Participating countries include the former USSR, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico. The meat is highly prized for human consumption cooked, dried and salted, or smoked. In addition, their skin is made into leather, their liver oil is processed for vitamins, and their fins are used for shark fin soup. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported a worldwide common thresher <b>take</b> <b>of</b> 411 metric tons in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The film's scathingly bad {{reviews and}} poor word-of-mouth {{led to a}} precipitous falling-off in its grosses. Having earned $11,548,898 from 3,307 screens on its opening weekend, its take {{collapsed}} by 67 percent to $3,924,921 the following weekend, giving an average <b>take</b> <b>of</b> $1,158 per screen. The film made 85 percent of its entire domestic gross in its first 10 days and flatlined thereafter, with earnings dropping a further 75 percent {{by the end of}} its third week to $1million. The following week, facing earnings of just $205,745, Warner Bros. attempted to cut its losses by slashing the number of screens at which the film was being shown. The number was reduced from 2,587 to 641. By its sixth weekend on release, the film was showing on 95screens and had made $18,993 in a week – less than $200 per screen.|$|E

5|$|The master <b>take</b> <b>of</b> {{the song}} was {{recorded}} by Dylan, with Tom Wilson producing, during the recording sessions for the Another Side of Bob Dylan album on June 9, 1964.

5|$|The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at {{position}} 22 and thereafter declined. The track was promoted by a music video, which {{was directed by}} Marco Brambilla. The video features a long <b>take</b> <b>of</b> the camera pulling away from West. The video received positive reviews from critics and received two nominations for MTV Video Music Awards. West performed the song on Saturday Night Live, at the 2010 BET Awards, at the 2011 Coachella Music Festival, and his Watch the Throne Tour. When performing the song, West often wore clothes made from red leather. A remix of the track featuring rapper Jay-Z was released on August 20, 2010, {{as a part of}} West's weekly GOOD Fridays series.|$|E

When the episode's editor first received one <b>take</b> <b>of</b> the scene in which Veronica and Mac sarcastically dance in response to accusations of doing a poor job on a school project, the editor called the writing staff into the editing room; they proceeded to view the scene fifteen times because of its humorous nature.
