50|$|Vessel {{operators}} {{have the}} most control over fuel usage {{by the way they}} use the engine(s) <b>throttle.</b> Wind, <b>current,</b> hull condition, load, and propulsion system health can all impact fuel burn both positively or negatively. Some operators choose to lower engine speed, and hence vessel speed, in an attempt to save fuel. However, engine RPM and vessel speed alone are not indicative of total fuel consumption, so arbitrarily lowering engine speed does not guarantee fuel savings. One must do the workflow calculations on how the propulsion system is operating under existing changing conditions and then tie that to fuel consumption. Simply lowering engine RPM does not guarantee an optimum vessel speed setting based on conditions. Some modern fuel management systems are designed to perform these calculations while underway and make recommendations to the vessel master.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the current}} paper is to {{investigate}} inner flow behavior on stall inception in a transonic compressor rotor. The stall inception process is numerically carried out by unsteady 3 -D simulations based on the <b>throttle</b> model. The <b>current</b> study shows that stall starts {{from the tip of}} the blade, and stall cell extends to the axial, circumferential and radial directions. Through the comparison of flow transition characteristics at different flow rate conditions, the interface between the incoming flow and tip clearance flow shifts forward to the upstream as the mass flow decreases. Eventually, the shock detaches from the blade leading edge, and tip clearance flow spills into the adjacent blade passage, thus stall happens in the affected blade passages...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent advances}} in ion propulsion system design which promise to increase the propulsion system reliability by reducing the overall system complexity. The greatest simplification in the overall propulsion system operation is accomplished through {{a change in the}} ion engine throttling strategy. By using three grid optics it is possible to effect engine throttling at a constant beam curent over at least a 3. 8 to 1 variation in input power. Throttling at a constant beam current results in a single discharge chamber operating point and eliminates the need for active propellant flow controllers and complex engine throttling software. Detailed mission analysis calculations for a CNSR mission performed using this constant beam <b>current</b> <b>throttling</b> strategy indicate only a small reduction in delivered payload and increase in required propellant relative to a conventional throttling profile based on varying the beam curent...|$|R
40|$|With the SMART- 1, Department of Defense, and {{commercial}} industry successes in Hall thruster technologies, NASA has started considering Hall thrusters for science missions. The recent Discovery proposals included a Hall thruster science mission and the In-Space Propulsion Project is investing in Hall thruster technologies. As the confidence in Hall thrusters improve, ambitious multi-thruster missions are being considered. Science missions often require large throttling ranges {{due to the}} 1 /r(sup 2) power drop-off from the sun. Deep throttling of Hall thrusters will impact the overall system performance. Also, Hall thrusters can be <b>throttled</b> with both <b>current</b> and voltage, impacting erosion rates and performance. Last, electric propulsion thruster lifetime qualification has previously been conducted with long duration full power tests. Full power tests may not be appropriate for NASA science missions, and a combination of lifetime testing at various power levels with sufficient analysis is recommended. Analyses of various science missions and throttling schemes using the Aerojet BPT- 4000 and NASA 103 M HiVHAC thruster are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a basic architecture of an intelligent {{driver warning system}} which embodies an adaptive driver model for indirect collision avoidance. In this study, the driver modelling objective is focused only on longtitudinal car-following, and the model inputs are chosen to be the past history of throttle angle, controlled vehicles's speed, range and range rate to the front vehicle whereas the model output is chosen to be the <b>current</b> <b>throttle</b> angle. An artificial neural network called CMAC and a conventional linear model are independently applied to model the real driver data taken from test track and motorway environments. The CMAC model is chosen because of its nonlinear modeling capability, on-line learning convergence and minimum learning interference characteristics, whereas the linear model is chosen as a control benchmark to examine the nonlinear characteristics of the driver's behaviour. The modeling capabilities are then evaluated based on one-step ahead prediction error performances over the training and testing sets, learning curves and correlation based model validation techniques. Modeling {{results suggest that the}} past history of the throttle dynamics plays a critical role in reducing the deviation of the error correction, which in turn suggest that the throttle dynamics is generally slow for road driving. Also, the time scale dependency of the model on the driver's behaviour varies significantly from the test track to motorway environment. In the driver modeling expermient, the time scale was chosen such that the deviation of the error correlation was minimised. The test track results suggest that the chosen inputs are indeed relevant variables for modeling the driver's behaviour. Unlike that of the CLM, the degree of error deviation was found to be acceptable for the test track scenario, implying a significant nonlinear coupling of the throttle output with the speed, range and range rate data. Whereas for the motorway data, the modeling performance for both models is comparable, and the time scale of the driver model is approximately three times longer than that used in the test track data...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis addresses the design of a control scheme based on Fuzzy Logic to minimize automobile fuel consumption and exhaust emissions while maximizing battery state of charge (SOC) for hybrid vehicles. The advantages the hybrid vehicle has over the conventional vehicle are very low emission of pollutants, and more efficient fuel consumption if controlled properly. The principal components of the drive train are an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. Since there are two devices, it becomes impossible for the driver to individually control both components while driving along, and {{it will be necessary to}} automate the use of these elements so that the vehicle is driven in the same way as a conventional vehicle. In the parallel configuration, both devices apply torque directly to the drive shaft for propelling the vehicle. Each component of the hybrid vehicle is modeled, and <b>throttle</b> angle, motor <b>current</b> and brake torque command are chosen as the control inputs. Another input considered is the driver behavior. This input is obtained from an Artificial Neural Network that classifies the behavior based on the pedal angle characteristics over a period of time. The problem in question is how to distribute the energy demands for each component of the hybrid vehicle so that the objectives, maximizing the battery SOC and minimizing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, are met. Because these objectives depend on different components, we must decide how to demand energy from them to fulfill the driver request and at the same time meeting the objectives. A Fuzzy Logic Controller is designed to meet the driver demand so that the engine, motor and battery are as little exposed as possible to abrupt transitions. Smooth transitions are desired in the engine in order to decrease fuel consumption and emission of pollutants. Smooth transitions in the battery will lead to extended battery life. Simulation results verify that the controller achieves the design objectives. Because the design procedure is based on trial and error, optimality is not guaranteed. Also stability is hard to prove, since there is not much information on this particular issue of Fuzzy Logic...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis addresses the development of a control scheme to maximize automobile fuel economy and battery state-of-charge (SOC) while meeting exhaust emission standards for parallel hybrid electric vehicles, which are an alternative to conventional passenger vehicles. The principle components of the drive train are a small internal combustion engine and an electric motor, both of them applying torque directly to the drive shaft for propelling the vehicle. Each component of the parallel hybrid vehicle is modeled, and <b>throttle</b> angle, motor <b>current</b> and brake torque command chosen as the control inputs. A performance index describing the total fuel and battery charge used, as well as pollutants emitted over the federal drive cycle, is defined. The problem is to find the optimal control inputs, as a function of time, that minimize the performance index under the chosen drive cycle while satisfying lower and upper bounds on the controls as well as the torque command constraint, derived from the drive cycle speed that the vehicle must follow. The problem is formulated so that optimal control theory can be used by defining the Hamiltonian of the system and deriving the Euler-Lagrange equations. Four special cases for the control bounds which are of practical importance are considered. But, because of the complicated analytical derivatives, solving the general analytical problem is not tractable. The alternate approach that is chosen is a numerical optimization method that solves the constrained optimization problem using the Recursive Quadratic Programming Method. 'To evaluate various control schemes, a set of selected performance measures are studied: only SOC performance, and balanced fuel and SOC performance. Simulations under the federal drive cycle show that we achieve the design objectives while getting better results than with a simple logic controller. The optimum control results suggest that the throttle should always be kept wide open for the SOC to be maximized. This should be accomplished with Buntin's logic controller and would allow us to keep his easy control implementation while improving his performance...|$|R
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} installed capacity of renewable, sustainable energy {{is essential in}} order to keep the earth habitable. However, the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy do not strictly follow human energy demands. Therefore an energy of sufficient magnitude buffer is essential to provide a constant supply of energy that matches the demand as closely as possible. Chemical energy shows high potential in terms of clean, long-term energy storage with efficient conversion to electricity. The DEMO project intends on manufacturing a monolithic photovoltaic device for the production of hydrogen gas and hydrocarbon products by the electrochemical splitting of water and carbon dioxide. an aSi:H/a-SiGe:H/nc-Si:H triple junction device is proposed to generate a combination of voltage and current to drive the electrochemical reactions efficiently, while simultaneously addressing scalability by using earthabundant materials. In this thesis, efforts were made to optimise the a-SiGe:H subcell as well as finding the optimal combination of materials to use as tunnel recombination junctions as intermediate layers between subcells of the multi-junction device. The best performing a-SiGe:H p-i-n single-junction device achieved a VOC = 719 mV, JSC = 17. 2 mA/cm 2, F F = 0. 63 and η = 7. 85 % as processed on an Asahi VU superstrate. This performance was observed show a strong decline with increasing intrinsic layer thickness and increasing deposition rate. Although a conclusive optimal device structure was not obtained, it is believed that bandgap profiling by adjusting the germanium content in the intrinsic layer as well as applying buffer layers can substantially improve the performance of the a-SiGe:H single-junction solar cell. To assess long-term stability, an a-SiGe:H single-junction device was subdued to 1000 h light soaking. Meta-stable defects induced by recombination of photo-generated charge carriers resulted is a strong degradation in F F of 20 % relative. VOC and JSC showed similar relative decreases in performance with 9. 0 % and 8. 6 %, respectively. The resulting relative drop in conversion efficiency for the degraded solar cell is observed to be 34 %. The best tunnel recombination junction for an a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H double junction consists of a 5 nm highly doped n+-type nc-SiOx :H layer with a 2 nm nc-Si:H p-layer, placed between 25 nm nc-SiOx :H n-layer and a 16 nm nc-SiOx :H p-layer that resulted in good combination of F F, VOC and JSC by improved tunnelling, charge separation and better light management. The best tunnel recombination junction for an a-SiGe:H/nc-Si:H double-junction consists of a highly doped n+ nc-SiOx :H layer with a 2 nm nc-Si:H p-layer. These layers are sandwiched between an 50 nm ncSiOx :H n-layer, of which the first half has linearly increasing oxygen content, and a 16 nm nc-SiOx :H p-layer of the a-SiGe:H subcell and nc-Si:H subcell, respectively. These tunnel recombination junctions were used to further develop a p-i-n a-Si:H/a-SiGe:H/nc-Si:H triplejunction solar cell on a wet-etched glass superstrate with ZnO:Al as both sacrificial layer for texturing and as transparent conductive oxide. The best performing triple-junction device achieved a VOC = 1. 96 V, JSC = 6. 21 mA/cm 2, F F = 0. 63 and η = 7. 63 % with respective intrinsic layer thicknesses of 175 nm/ 120 nm/ 3000 nm. The conversion efficiency of this current mismatched device is <b>throttled</b> by the <b>current</b> limiting a-SiGe:H middle cell. Enhancing the a-SiGe:H material quality allows for thicker absorber layer to increase current generation without compromising the electrical performance, which can significantly improve the performance the triple-junction device. This device is able to achieve an estimated solar-to-fuels efficiency of 4. 9 % for producing hydrogen with a high performance electrode and an an IrOx counter electrode. Assuming similar electrode performance, the solar-to-fuels efficiency for producing both hydrogen and methane is expected to be 2. 4 %. Hydrocarbons with higher electrochemical potential are not likely to be produced with such a device due to the higher electrochemical potentials. Using the measured degraded performance of the a-SiGe:H subcell, a relative decrease in water splitting efficiency of 21 % is expected for the triple-junction device.
