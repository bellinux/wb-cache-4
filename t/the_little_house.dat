Small-town life is portrayed grimly by Sinclair Lewis in the novel Main Street, and more gently and affectionately by Garrison Keillor in his tales of Lake Wobegon. St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald writes of the social insecurities and {{aspirations}} of the young city in stories such as Winter Dreams and The Ice Palace (published in Flappers and Philosophers). Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem The Song of Hiawatha was inspired by Minnesota and names many of the state's places and bodies of water.

It is believed that he vacationed as much as he did in 1943-45 at <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> White <b>House</b> because his real love for vacations, sailing on the Atlantic, was too dangerous during wartime, even if it was just on inland waterways like the Chesapeake Bay or the Potomac River. One major change was that soldiers from Fort Benning were stationed at <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> White <b>House</b> to patrol the woods surrounding the farm.|$|R

25|$|Wilder did {{not keep}} copies of her {{correspondence}} with Lane, but Lane kept carbon copies of virtually everything she ever wrote, including the correspondence with her mother concerning <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>House</b> books. The correspondence shows that Wilder sometimes adamantly refused to accept some of Lane's suggestions, {{and at other times}} gratefully accepted them. Lane's diaries show reactions to time spent on the project ranging from anger and frustration over financial loss from lack of her own work to elation at the success of the books and the prestige and income they brought to Wilder.|$|E
25|$|Farmer Boy, {{published}} in 1933, is the second-published of <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>House</b> books {{and it is}} commonly numbered two in the series, but its story is unrelated {{to that of the}} inaugural novel, Little House in the Big Woods. It features the boyhood of Laura's future husband Almanzo Wilder from before his ninth birthday until after his tenth. The Wilder family – in the novel as in fact – lived in New York state. In the book, Almanzo has two sisters, Eliza Jane and Alice, and one brother, Royal. In reality, he had a sister named Laura, but she was left out of the book. The book describes his schooling, holidays, farm work, and most of all, food.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Jesse James became a {{national}} sensation. The Fords {{made no attempt to}} hide their role. Robert Ford wired the governor to claim his reward. Crowds pressed into <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>house</b> in St. Joseph to see the dead bandit. The Ford brothers surrendered to the authorities and were dismayed to be charged with first-degree murder. In the course of a single day, the Ford brothers were indicted, pleaded guilty, were sentenced to death by hanging, and were granted a full pardon by Governor Crittenden. The governor's quick pardon suggested he knew the brothers intended to kill James rather than capture him. The implication that the chief executive of Missouri conspired to kill a private citizen startled the public and added to James' notoriety.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> Round <b>House</b> was {{originally}} {{an addition to}} a front porch for a Victorian-style house {{in the nearby town}} of Paola, and was called such because it was indeed round in shape. Because of increased truck traffic from Missouri on K-68 through town, Louisburg was contacted by the State of Kansas about needing an inspection station. As a solution, <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Round <b>House</b> was moved to Louisburg in the 1930s to serve as a border checkpoint office. As years passed, <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Round <b>House</b> became a home to a variety of small businesses, and had been used as temporary housing during World War II. The shape and size aided in it becoming a landmark to Louisburg. In 2005, <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> Round <b>House</b> was moved from its original location to the Louisburg City Lake, and has been restored by the community due to its historical value to the town.|$|R

25|$|The {{fountain}} {{is a large}} granite surface, {{forming an}} elongated backrest, measuring about 3 metres wide and 1.20 metres high. On {{the left of the}} rock is a carved human figure, about 1.10 metres tall, upright, but deteriorated, and possibly male with a beard, wrapped in a toga, holding in his left arm a bulky object. It is flanked above by Latin inscription, the first word partially cut into the stone. To the right of the figure (just slightly below) is a rectangular building cut into the rock, about 0.7 metres high, 0.6 metres wide and 0.12 deep, with the worn figure of human head. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>house</b> is crowned by a triangular pediment with a bird engraved into its triangular form, while other Latin inscriptions are engraved into its sides, extending to the base. At the base of this granite structure flows the fountain's water.|$|E
25|$|Historians are {{uncertain}} {{as to whether}} Lane's mother was a naturally skilled novelist who never discovered her talents until her sixties – with Lane's only contribution to Wilder's success being her encouragement and her established connections in the publishing world – or if Lane essentially took Wilder's raw manuscripts in hand and completely ghostwrote the series of books known today. Researchers believe the truth is somewhere between these two positions. The writing career of Wilder as a rural journalist and a credible essayist began {{more than two decades}} before <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>House</b> series, and Lane's formidable editing and ghostwriting skills are well-documented. The existing written evidence includes ongoing correspondence between Lane and her mother concerning the development of the multi-volume series along with Lane's extensive personal diaries detailing the time she spent working on the manuscripts, and Wilder's own initial draft manuscripts. All of this reveals an ongoing mutual collaboration that involved Lane more extensively in the earlier books, and to a much lesser extent by the time the series ended, as Wilder's confidence in her own writing ability increased. Lane insisted to the end that her role was little more than that of her mother's adviser, despite documentation to the contrary.|$|E
