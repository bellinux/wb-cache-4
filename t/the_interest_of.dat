This is because the moral permissibility of vaccine refusal follows from such a parental prerogative only if the only (weighty) moral reason in favor of vaccination is that vaccination is a means for promoting <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> others. However, there are two additional weighty moral reasons in favor of routine vaccination: fairness and concern for the vulnerable. These moral reasons in favor of vaccination are not defeated by a parental prerogative to prioritize <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> one’s children over <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> others...|$|R
