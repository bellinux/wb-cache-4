5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt {{was talking to}} the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} that he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had been}} invited to stay at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, the home of Arthur Wilson and his family. Among Edward's party were his advisers, Lord Coventry and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams; Gordon-Cumming, a friend of the prince, was also invited. On the first night the guests played baccarat, and Stanley Wilson <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Gordon-Cumming {{illegally}} adding to his stake. Stanley informed other members of the Wilson family, and they agreed to watch him on the following evening. Gordon-Cumming was again seen to be acting in a suspicious manner. The family members asked the advice of the royal courtiers who, with the agreement of the prince, confronted Gordon-Cumming and pressured him into signing a document that declared he would never play cards again, in exchange for the silence of the guests.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently Schelling {{identified}} himself with Baruch de Spinoza, to whose <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> himself as approaching. The Darstellung meines Systems, and the expanded {{treatment in the}} lectures on a System der gesamten Philosophie und der Naturphilosophie insbesondere given in Würzburg in 1804, contain elements of Spinoza's philosophy.|$|E

60|$|Now Alan <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{opportunity}} for a word in season and made a great mistake.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Gannett assented readily. It {{would ease}} the engineer's mind, she <b>thought,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{her with a}} chaperon.|$|R
25|$|During {{a voyage}} across the Barents Sea {{in search of}} the Northeast Passage in 1553, English {{explorer}} Hugh Willoughby <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> islands to the north, and islands called Willoughby's Land were shown on maps published by Plancius and Mercator in the 1590s, and they continued to appear on maps by Jan Janssonius and Willem Blaeu into the 1640s.|$|E

25|$|In May 1793, {{he arrived}} at the island of Vanikoro, {{which is part of the}} Santa Cruz group of islands (now part of the Solomon Islands). D'Entrecasteaux <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> smoke signals from several {{elevated}} areas on the island, but was unable to investigate due to the dangerous reefs surrounding the island and had to leave. He died two months later. The botanist Jacques Labillardière, attached to the expedition, eventually returned to France and published his account, Relation du voyage à la recherche de La Pérouse, in 1800.|$|E
60|$|Sir James {{interpreted}} the heightened {{color in the}} way most gratifying to himself, and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> never <b>saw</b> Miss Brooke looking so handsome.|$|R
60|$|He quailed at that threat, for, {{deleterious}} as I <b>thought</b> him, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> I meant it; but he affected {{to prefer}} {{it that way}} to taking {{it out of the}} bottle.|$|R
60|$|Saturius <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> his chance. Domitian was so {{intoxicated}} that {{it would}} be useless to attempt to explain matters that night. Clearly he should retire as soon as possible.|$|R
500|$|In December 1852, Norton <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a {{business}} opportunity when China, facing a severe famine, placed {{a ban on}} the export of rice, causing the price of rice in San Francisco to skyrocket from four to thirty-six cents per pound (9 to 79 cents/kg). When he heard the Glyde, which was returning from Peru, was carrying [...] of rice, he bought the entire shipment for $25,000 (or twelve and a half cents per pound), hoping to corner the market.|$|E
500|$|Innis {{maintained}} that scholars {{had no place}} in active politics and that instead, they should devote themselves, first to research on public problems, {{and then to the}} production of knowledge based on critical <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> the university, with its emphasis on dialogue, open-mindedness and skepticism, as an institution that could foster such thinking and research. [...] "The university could provide an environment", he wrote, [...] "as free as possible from the biases of the various institutions that form the state, so that its intellectuals could continue to seek out and explore other perspectives." ...|$|E
500|$|The agents then {{speak to}} an {{electric}} power company lineman named Roky Crikenson, who claims he witnessed the abduction of Chrissy and Harold, {{and then turned}} his eyewitness account into a movie screenplay entitled [...] "The Truth About Aliens." [...] He recounts a strange visit to his home {{from a pair of}} men in black, who told him that the UFO he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the night before was merely the planet Venus, and threatened to kill him if he told anyone otherwise. Roky's screenplay describes his meeting with the third alien (who calls himself Lord Kinbote), who took him {{to the center of the}} Earth and told Roky that he had a great mission for him. In telling Roky's version of events to Jose Chung, Scully explains that Roky suffers from a [...] "fantasy-prone personality." [...] Mulder, however, thinks that Roky's story contains some partial truths and decides to have Chrissy re-hypnotized. This time Chrissy claims that she was captured by the U.S. military, not aliens, and they brainwashed her into believing that she was abducted by aliens.|$|E
25|$|James's {{writings}} {{were also}} {{influential in the}} development of Autonomist Marxism as a current within Marxist <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> himself <b>saw</b> his life's work as developing the theory and practice of Leninism.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{the place}} for a heavy fish," [...] {{reflected}} Arthur, and, even as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a five-pound carp rise nearly to the surface, in order to clear the obstruction of the wall, and sink silently into the depths.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you {{for your}} warning, Sir Hugh," [...] and even beneath {{the shadow of the}} silk hood Hugh <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> his eyes smile, and seeing, remembered all the folly of such talk.|$|R
500|$|When {{the agents}} track down Chantara, whose face is pixelated, {{she claims that}} her pimp {{attacked}} Ricky and fears that he will kill her. She pleads with the agents for protection. Mulder and Scully have Wetzel guard Chantara while they assist the police in the raid of a crack house. However, the two are drawn back outside when Wetzel [...] encounters the entity, wildly shooting at it. Inside a police car, the agents find Chantara with her neck broken. When Mulder questions Wetzel, {{he admits that he}} <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the [...] "wasp man", a monster his older brother told him about when he was a kid. Though other deputies express skepticism, Mulder finds flattened bullets; indicating they physically impacted something, though no trace is found of what they struck. Mulder formulates a theory that the entity changes its form to correspond with its victims' worst fears. Wetzel, Ricky, and Chantara all expressed fear shortly before their run-ins with the entity; it was visible to them, but not to others. The agents think that Steve and Edy may be the entity's next target because they were in the vicinity of Ricky's attack. They head to their house, only to find the couple {{in the middle of an}} argument. After Edy expresses fear of a separation from Steve, the couple reconciles. Based on this situation, Mulder proposes that the entity ignored Steve and Edy because they did not exhibit mortal fear.|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} began Gordon-Cumming {{discussed}} the tapestry with Wilson, commenting {{that the different}} colours of the cloth {{made it difficult to}} see the counters; Gordon-Cumming put a piece of white paper in front of him on which to place his now highly-visible stake. Although many of the inexperienced party were playing for small stakes, Gordon-Cumming was betting between £5 and £25 for a coup; he played the [...] system of betting, in which if he won a hand with a £5 stake, he would add his winnings to the stake, together with another £5, as the stake for the next hand. Soon after play began Stanley Wilson <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Gordon-Cumming add two red £5 counters onto his stake after the hand had finished, but before the stake had been paid—a method of cheating known in casinos as after he thought that this had happened a second time, Wilson turned to Levett and, according to the later court transcripts, whispered [...] "My God, Berkeley, this is too hot!" [...] further explaining that [...] "the man next to me is cheating!" [...] After Levett also watched for a few minutes, he agreed, saying to Wilson [...] "this is too hot". After half an hour the game was completed and the prince congratulated Gordon-Cumming on his play; the future king also asked Mrs Wilson for a more suitable table for the following day. Stanley Wilson instructed the butler to move a longer, three-foot wide table in and cover it with green baize. Wilson then discussed the cheating with Levett. The two men were uncertain what steps to take, and agreed that Stanley would ask his brother-in-law, Lycett Green, for his advice. Although Lycett Green thought it impossible that Gordon-Cumming would have cheated, Stanley told him that he was certain, as was Levett.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, film {{director}} David Lynch was interviewed on Dutch television about Loose Change, {{to which he}} said that the film made him look at what he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> that he now had questions and [...] "...no answers." ...|$|E

60|$|There, not thirty yards away, was the {{drawbridge}} of {{the slave}} camp, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it tremble, {{as if it was}} about to fall.

2500|$|On October 24, 2001, USAMRIID {{scientist}} Peter Jahrling {{was summoned}} to the White House after he reported signs that silicon had been added to anthrax recovered from the letter addressed to Daschle. Silicon would make the anthrax more capable of penetrating the lungs. Seven years later, Jahrling told the Los Angeles Times on September 17, 2008, [...] "I believe I made an honest mistake", adding {{that he had been}} [...] "overly impressed" [...] by what he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> under the microscope.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, {{the party}} chose a Calgary clergyman turned businessman, John T. Lowery, to succeed Maccagno. [...] Lowery <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> some hope in an electoral {{arrangement}} with Social Credit, which he believed was {{showing signs of}} modernization and rejuvenation under Manning's successor, Harry Strom. He was likely encouraged in this by the party's two federal Cabinet ministers, Bud Olson and Pat Mahoney, who had Social Credit pasts. When word of negotiations to that effect came out, it became evident that any such proposal was deeply opposed by the core membership of both parties. Lowery resigned {{in the face of}} it.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} half of The Shadow's tenure in the pulps, his past and {{identity}} are ambiguous. In The Living Shadow, a thug claims to have seen the Shadow's face, and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> [...] "a piece of white that looked like a bandage." [...] In The Black Master and The Shadow's Shadow, the villains both see The Shadow's true face and remark that The Shadow is a man of many faces with no face of his own. It was not until the August 1937 issue, The Shadow Unmasks, that The Shadow's real name is revealed.|$|E
6000|$|When <b>he</b> arrived <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{everything}} <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> delightful and magnificent. Diamonds were as plentiful as pebbles, and {{the gold}} and silver, the beautiful dresses, the sweetmeats and pretty things that were everywhere quite amazed him; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> to himself: [...] "If the Princess consents to leave all this, and {{come with me to}} marry the King, he may think himself lucky!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Hugh Grant {{was offered}} {{the role of the}} Doctor again ahead of Christopher Eccleston, and later said {{publicly}} that he regretted dismissing it without much <b>thought</b> when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> how good the series was - and that he was hoping to play a villain in the ongoing programme instead.|$|R
60|$|As they {{disappeared}} in the recesses of the wall, Night--the stormy, the eventful, the fatal!--reached its last limit; and the famished sentinel on the fortifications of the besieged city roused himself from his dreary and absorbing <b>thoughts,</b> for <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that the new day was dawning in the east.|$|R
2500|$|In April 2011, {{during the}} trial of the civil suit brought by Corrie's parents, an IDF officer testified that Corrie and other activists had spent hours trying to block the bulldozers under his command. He {{went on to say that}} it was a war zone [...] "where Palestinian militants used {{abandoned}} homes as firing positions and exploited foreign activists for cover". He shouted over a megaphone for the activists to leave, tried to use tear gas to disperse them and moved his troops several times. [...] "To my regret, after the eighth time, (Corrie) hid behind an earth embankment. The D9 operator didn't see her. She <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1553 English {{explorer}} Hugh Willoughby {{with chief}} pilot Richard Chancellor were sent out with three vessels {{in search of}} a passage by London's Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands. During the voyage across the Barents Sea, Willoughby <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> islands to the north, and islands called Willoughby's Land were shown on maps published by Plancius and Mercator into the 1640s. The vessels were separated by [...] "terrible whirlwinds" [...] in the Norwegian Sea and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. Richard Chancellor was able to drop anchor in the White Sea and trudge his way overland to Moscow and Ivan the Terrible's Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the Muscovy Company.|$|E
2500|$|To {{judge the}} success of the Libby Prison escape solely by the number of men who crossed Federal lines would be a mistake. [...] Richmond was deeply {{affected}} by the break, and Libby Prison itself was thrown into chaos, much to the satisfaction and raised morale of the remaining prisoners. [...] Lieutenant Colonel Cavada recorded some of the more humorous effects of the escape inside the prison. [...] On one occasion, the entire camp was roused {{in the middle of the}} night for a roll call because a sentry <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> something down in a sewer. [...] It turned out to be his own shadow. [...] Even the Confederate warden, Major Thomas P. Turner, was visibly shaken. [...] Cavada commented, [...] "Really, when our distracted little Commandant now comes into our rooms, he keeps his knees well together, it is necessary to be very cautious, some of us might slip out between his legs!" ...|$|E
60|$|During the servant's {{explanation}} Barney {{had been}} casting {{about in his}} mind for some means of rescuing the princess without so great risk of detection, and as the plan of the secret passageway became clear to him <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a way to accomplish the thing with comparative safety {{in so far as}} detection was concerned.|$|R

6000|$|Walking {{toward his}} club, Percy's natural {{serenity}} of mind {{was a little}} troubled by the remembrance of Captain Bervie's language and conduct. The Captain had interested {{the young man in}} spite of himself. His first idea was to write to Bervie, and mention what had happened at the renewed consultation with Doctor Lagarde. On second <b>thoughts,</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> reason to doubt how the Captain might receive such an advance as this, {{on the part of a}} stranger. [...] "After all," [...] Percy decided, [...] "the whole thing is too absurd to be worth thinking about seriously. Neither he nor I are likely to meet again, or to see the Doctor again--and there's an end of it." ...|$|R
