5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected <b>toddlers.</b> Of the 94 maltreated <b>toddlers</b> in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E

5|$|A {{small group}} of <b>toddlers</b> show a {{distressing}} way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, found that infants between 7 and 30 months responded more favorably to being picked up by their fathers. Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure <b>toddlers</b> when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children {{learn to deal with}} stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|E

30|$|This {{article is}} backgrounded by {{researchers}} using of visual methodology for naturalistic research to document young children’s learning. Recent {{interest in the}} speed and immediacy of mobile phone video capture leads to new opportunities in educational research. This small study aims to find if mobile phone video is an appropriate research tool for the capture of fleeting moments of learning, in <b>toddler</b> initiated play. Inspired by participation in an ethically approved pilot project: ‘Studying Babies and Toddlers: Cultural Worlds and Transitory Relationships’, the study uses a cultural-historical Theoretical approach to analyse mobile phone video data of one <b>toddler’s</b> pontaneous play activity. It is argued that greater attention be paid by educators to transitory moments of <b>toddler</b> play {{in relation to their}} pedagogical significance. A fortuitous moment of <b>toddler</b> initiated symbolic play activity is video captured on mobile phone and used for discussion. Drawing on Vygotsky’s concepts of the social genesis of higher mental functions and perezhivanie, the <b>toddler’s</b> initiated symbolic play activity is analysed. Analysis is supported by visual methodology, where video image data are linked with transcript to create a narrative of the moment of <b>toddler’s</b> initated play. Data are found to exemplify the ontogenesis of higher mental functions being culturally mediated and supported in the <b>toddler’s</b> symbolic play activity. Futhermore, findings show how tactile and visual qualities of a cultural object attract a <b>toddler’s</b> sensory responses, which in turn, activate the creative moment of symbolic play. The <b>toddler’s</b> momentary playful action captured on mobile phone video, sheds light on how symbolic activity reflects thinking processes to offer insight into how <b>toddler</b> (Luci) can, in a passing moment, imbue a cultural object with new symbolic meaning. Findings imply that using mobile phone video for later review, makes it possible for educators to pay more immediate attention to <b>toddler’s</b> activity in frequently overlooked transitory moments of play. Potentially, the ubiquitous mobile phone can help educators discover the pedagogical significance of a <b>toddler’s</b> smallest moment of symbolic activity, and in practice, offer ethical and caring extension to support their learning.|$|R
5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships {{that may lead}} to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and {{there is a lack of}} clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and <b>toddlers</b> brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E

5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. <b>Toddlers</b> and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E
5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and <b>toddlers.</b> In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic <b>toddlers</b> differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E

5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young <b>toddlers</b> acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E
