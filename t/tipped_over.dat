5|$|Still {{relatively}} inexperienced, Low ordered {{too many}} {{men to the}} outside of the boat to work on the buildup, and the Rose Pink <b>tipped</b> <b>over</b> too far. The portholes had been left open, and the vessel took on water and sank, with the death of two men. The Rose Pink had been carrying most of the provisions, and Low—by now captaining a captured schooner, the Squirrel—and his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a pint (around 275ml) per man, per day.|$|E
5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be <b>tipped</b> <b>over</b> by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
5|$|Fiorentina had {{chances to}} equalise {{in the second}} half, with a long shot from {{substitute}} Matías Fernández <b>tipped</b> <b>over</b> the crossbar by Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina, and Iličić missing a one-on-one. The team also brought on Rossi in place of Joaquín after 72 minutes, his first action since his injury in January. Despite being reduced to ten men {{for the last ten}} minutes after a second booking for Gökhan Inler after he fouled Iličić, Napoli extended their lead in injury time when substitute Mertens scored a third after being set up by Callejón.|$|E

5|$|L.F. Wade International Airport {{sustained}} some {{roof and}} runway lighting damage, and the Bermuda Weather Service building lost a storm shutter and saw water forced inside a communications room. A restaurant {{at the site}} of the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse was severely damaged, requiring a complete roof replacement. The Causeway was largely spared, with some damage to the safety walls alongside the road, and it was partially reopened on October 18 after initial repairs. However, one of two lanes remained shut down for several days. Many boats were washed ashore and damaged or wrecked by the storm, and other vessels <b>tipped</b> <b>over</b> in boatyards. According to preliminary estimates, properties in the Dockyard alone incurred US$1 million (2014 BMD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|In St. Tammany Parish, the storm's {{effects were}} mainly limited to wind damage: gusts reached 48mph (77km/h), {{knocking}} down trees and power lines. A storm surge of 4.3ft (1.3m) flooded 20 {{homes in the}} parish. Winds in Jefferson Parish gusted up to 55mph (88km/h), causing minor roof damage and power outages. In Orleans Parish, a storm surge of 5.81ft (1.77m) destroyed 85 fishing camps constructed on wooden pilings. Winds gusting up to 68mph (109km/h) left 80,000 residences without power in the parish. Throughout the state, a total of 160,000 homes and businesses lost power due to the hurricane. Georges is blamed for three indirect fatalities; two men collapsed and died due to medical conditions aggravated by {{the stress of the}} evacuation, and another died {{as the result of a}} house fire sparked by an emergency candle that was <b>tipped</b> <b>over.</b> Damages from the storm totaled approximately $30.1million.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{that would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and <b>tipped</b> <b>over.</b> All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
50|$|A sidecar {{makes the}} bike asymmetrical. A fixed mounted rig with right mounted sidecar can go faster in left turns than in right turns because the sidecar {{prevents}} it from <b>tipping</b> <b>over.</b> In right turns, they can <b>tip</b> <b>over</b> if curves are taken too fast. Some techniques {{can be used}} to take a right curve faster without tipping, like usage of the brake on the sidecar, which some are fitted with.|$|R

5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which <b>tipped</b> <b>over</b> and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E
5|$|As Prapiroon neared Hong Kong, {{thousands}} of people were stranded in airports as hundreds of flights {{in and out of the}} area were cancelled. Twenty cargo containers in the harbour were <b>tipped</b> <b>over</b> and one person was injured by the falling containers. A total of 381 flights were cancelled and 725 were delayed, affecting about 10million people. Compensation costs from the travel delays amounted to $1.9million (2006USD). According to airport authorities, the storm caused the worst disruption in the airport's 20-year history. Winds were recorded up to 103km/h (63mph) in the harbour. The highest gust was recorded on Green Island at 193km/h (119mph). Seven people were injured by objects blown around by the wind. A cargo vessel, with a crew of 23, ran aground near the harbour. No injuries were reported from the incident. Two other incidents with vessels occurred near Ma Wan and Tuen Mun. Seven hundred trees were blown down and another 1,600 sustained damage. Maximum rainfall from Prapiroon was estimated at 8.1in (207.5mm). Two landslides were also reported and about 200 hectares of farmland was damaged. A storm surge of 2.71m (8.89ft) was recorded.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the static and dynamic stability analysis of rack or frame computer/server products during shipping and relocation. The static stability {{is the ability}} of server products to resist <b>tipping</b> <b>over</b> on a typical raised floor in a datacenter or when it is installed in its operational product environment. The dynamic stability is the ability to resist <b>tipping</b> <b>over</b> when a velocity change occurs during re-location either on flat or inclined planes. The product consists of a frame or a rack in which components such as processor units, input-output units and power supplies are installed. The static stability analysis presented here calculates the <b>tip</b> <b>over</b> threshold angle, which is the maximum angle of an inclined plane on which the product can be placed without <b>tipping</b> <b>over.</b> The location of the installed components in a frame, the dimension and weight of the installed components, and the dimension of the product dictate the overall static stability of the product. Specifically, those parameters affect the location of the center of gravity of the product and the <b>tip</b> <b>over</b> threshold angle. The <b>tip</b> <b>over</b> threshold angle is a critical parameter influencing the dynamic stability of the product [...] The dynamic stability of an unpackaged product moving on casters can be calculated using the conservation of mechanical energy principle. Finite element modeling {{is a good way to}} evaluate the dynamic stability of a product during manual handling or mechanical handling; for instance, on a forklift. The objective of the finite element modeling is to provide guidelines on the maximum speed, minimum radius curvature, and safe turning speed of a forklift when transporting a product. The main objective of the analysis presented here is to provide a method for analyzing the static and dynamic stability of a rack style computer server product during shipping, relocation, and handling...|$|R
