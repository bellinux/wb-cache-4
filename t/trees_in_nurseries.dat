The experimental material consisted of maiden trees of sour cherry 'Łutówka' budded on seedlings of mahaleb cherry (Prunus mahaleb L.) of unknown origin. The experiment evaluated the effect of four budding times: 15 July, 1 August, 15 August, and 1 September, {{on the quality of}} cherry <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> a <b>nursery.</b> The mean for the three years showed that budding time did not {{have a significant effect on}} the quality of cherry <b>trees</b> <b>in</b> the <b>nursery.</b> It was observed that the budding of mahaleb cherry performed on the two August dates (1 st and 15 th) had a more beneficial effect on the growth and branching of trees than the budding done on 15 July and 1 September.

First, were immersed the seeds, before planting, in the prepared solutions. At 150 days after sowing, 50 % of the plantlets of each initial treatment underwent a second foliar application in the same proportion as that used initially. One two-factor design was established and germination rates to 35, 40, 45, 50 and 55 days after sowing was evaluated. The variables were evaluated growth height, number of pairs of leaves, stem diameter and leaf area of positions. The results show that Fitomas-E accelerates the germination of seeds of the coffee plant. The effect was positive growth indicators evaluated, resulting in increases between 9 and 53 % of the leaf area of treatment compared with the control. The second application of Fitomas-E stimulated the growth of seedlings for all indicators evaluated. By increasing levels of FitoMas-E, rates augmented bioestimulante efficiency, achieving the best results by applying 3 ml/L Fitomas-E in the solution...|$|R

The industry of recycled paper produces tons of waste, which is a clean material composed mainly of cellulose that can be potentially used as a component in plant growth substrate. In the present experiment, the paper mill sludge pelletized has been added to the growing media with the aim of increasing the water storage in the substrate and, at the same time, of contrasting soil compaction. Three species, Quercus ilex, Lagerstroemia indica, Prunus serrulata ‘Kanzan’, have been planted in 40 L pots using two substrates: i) control, composed of peat, pumice, zeolites (chabasite) and compost; ii) experimental, composed of compost, zeolites (chabasite), pumice and pellet.
