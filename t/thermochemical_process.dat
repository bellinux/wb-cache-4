50|$|Examples of {{reactions}} satisfying high entropy changes are metal oxide dissociations, as the products have more excitation levels {{due to their}} gaseous state (metal vapors and oxygen) than the reactant (solid with crystalline structure, so symmetry dramatically reduces the number of different excitation levels). Consequently, these entropy changes can often be larger than the water-splitting one and thus a reaction with a negative entropy change is required in the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>process</b> so that Eq.(5) is satisfied. Furthermore, assuming similar stabilities of the reactant (ΔH°) for both thermolysis and oxide dissociation, a larger entropy change in the second case explained again a lower reaction temperature (Eq.(3)).|$|E
