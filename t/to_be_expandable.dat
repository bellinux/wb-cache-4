2500|$|Dodger Stadium was {{the first}} Major League Baseball stadium since the initial {{construction}} of the original Yankee Stadium to be built using 100% private financing, and the last until AT Park in San Francisco opened in 2000. [...] Ground was broken for Dodger Stadium on September 17, 1959. [...] The top of local ridges were removed and the soil was used to fill in Sulfur and Cemetery Ravines to provide a level surface for a parking lot and the stadium. [...] A local elementary school (Palo Verde) was simply buried and sits beneath the parking lot northwest of third base. [...] A total of 8 million cubic yards of earth were moved {{in the process of}} building the stadium. [...] 21,000 precast concrete units, some weighing as much as 32 tons, were fabricated onsite and lowered into place with a specially built crane to form the stadium's structural framework. [...] The stadium was originally designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expandable</b> to 85,000 seats by expanding the upper decks over the outfield pavilions; the Dodgers have never pursued such a project.|$|E

50|$|Since MSX BASIC {{was meant}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expandable</b> from inception, it was {{possible}} to write add-on modules quite easily. Support for specific hardware was commonly added by means of expansion cartridges, which also served as the interface to the hardware in question. MSX Disk-BASIC is an example, bundled in the cartridge that provides the hardware interface to the disk drives, it adds commands to access the floppy disk drives.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} feature of the Doom engine is its modular data files, which allow most of the game's content {{to be replaced by}} loading custom WAD files. Wolfenstein 3D was not designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expandable,</b> but fans had nevertheless figured out how to create their own levels for it, and Doom was designed to further extend the possibilities. The ability to create custom scenarios contributed significantly to the game's popularity (see the section on WADs, below).|$|E

50|$|The design {{also allowed}} for Shea Stadium <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expandable</b> to 90,000 seats, simply by {{completely}} enclosing the grandstand. It was also {{designed to be}} later enclosed by a dome if warranted. In March 1965, a plan was formally announced to add a glass dome and add 15,000 seats. The Mets strongly objected to the proposal. The idea was later dropped after engineering studies concluded that the stadium's foundation {{would be unable to}} support the weight of the dome.|$|E

50|$|In April 2017, the {{ownership}} group {{announced that it}} had an option to purchase five adjacent parcels of land, totaling 40 acre, in the Butchertown neighborhood just {{to the east of}} Slugger Field for a mixed-use project that would include a 10,000-seat soccer stadium. The plan calls for the stadium <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expandable</b> to 20,000 seats, and the overall complex would also include offices, retail space, and a hotel. The stadium is currently projected to open in 2020, satisfying a USL mandate that all franchises play in soccer-specific stadiums by that time.|$|E

5000|$|Groundbreaking for Brooks Stadium {{was held}} on July 30, 2002. Phase I of the stadium {{construction}} contained 6,408 seats, while the foundation and infrastructure of the stadium was designed to support future expansion to 20,000 seats. The stadium was formally dedicated on September 6, 2003, as the Chanticleer football team opened its inaugural game vs. Newberry College {{in front of a}} crowd of more than 8,000. The stadium was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expandable</b> to seat nearly 20,000. On October 7, 2006, the field was named James C.

Using adaptive filtering techniques, we design our online algorithm to automatically tune the underlying parameters based on the minimization of the regularized sequential prediction error. We demonstrate the generality and flexibility of the proposed approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Moreover, we analytically investigate the performance of our algorithm by obtaining both bounds of the prediction errors, and consistency results for variable selection...|$|R
50|$|However, the stadium's {{real purpose}} was to attract a major league team to the Metroplex. It had been built to major league specifications, and was {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expandable</b> to up to 50,000 seats. Due to its location in a natural bowl, only minimal renovations (such as connecting dugouts directly to the clubhouses) {{would be necessary to}} ready it for a big-league team. Although it was built primarily for baseball, its general shape was very similar to the major league multi-purpose stadiums that were beginning to emerge in the mid-1960s. The Metroplex had been mentioned as a possible expansion site since the 1950s, and Arlington Mayor Tom Vandergriff figured that Arlington, halfway between the two cities, would be the best site for a prospective major league team.|$|E

Elgin's downtown had also been the center of city renovations and new developments. New townhouses, condo towers, loft spaces, and art galleries have opened in the last decade. In October 2003 the Gail Borden Public Library moved into a new $30 million, 139,980 square foot, 460,000 volume-capacity building. In August 2009 the city opened the first ever satellite branch. The 10,000 square foot Rakow Branch, situated on Elgin's West Side, was LEED registered, and was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expandable</b> up to 30,000 square feet.

50|$|The {{original}} Merlin {{was replaced}} with the Merlin Plus system in the late 1980s, using circuit cards <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expandable</b> to 8 lines and 20 telephones, much like the original 820 model. The original Merlin Plus was dubbed the 820d. It was identical in features to the earlier Merlin 820 with the Feature Package 2 cartridge installed. Following the 820d was the 820d2. The 820d2 included the previous features as the 820d but featured an Automatic System Access (ASA) processor coupled with a voice synthesis capabilities and a Busy Buster. The ASA processor provided users with call forwarding, direct extension dial, and system answer capabilities. The busy buster allowed users to have the 820d2 automatically retry a busy number every minute for up to 10 minutes and notify the user when the call was connected. Both the ASA and Busy Buster required a their own voice terminal port to function. In the early 1990s, the Merlin II and Merlin Legend debuted with even more features and expandability, and new MLX telephones, but the system was also backwards compatible with the original Merlin telephones.|$|E

5000|$|CPU had {{financed the}} {{development}} of a SC/MP based microcomputer system using the income from its design-and-build consultancy. This system was launched in January 1979 as the first product of Acorn Computer Ltd., a trading name used by CPU to keep the risks of the two different lines of business separate. The microcomputer kit was named as Acorn System 75. Acorn was chosen because the microcomputer system was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>expandable</b> and growth-oriented. It also had the attraction of appearing before [...] "Apple Computer" [...] in a telephone directory.Around this time, CPU and Andy Hopper set up Orbis Ltd. to commercialise the Cambridge Ring networking system Hopper had worked on for his PhD, but it was soon decided to bring him into CPU as a director because he could promote CPU's interests at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. CPU purchased Orbis, and Hopper's Orbis shares were exchanged for shares in CPU Ltd. CPU's role gradually changed as its Acorn brand grew, and soon CPU was simply the holding company and Acorn was responsible for development work. At some point, Curry had a disagreement with Sinclair and formally left Science of Cambridge, but did not join the other Acorn employees at Market Hill until a little while later.The Acorn Microcomputer, later renamed the Acorn System 1, was designed by Sophie Wilson (then Roger Wilson). It was a semi-professional system aimed at engineering and laboratory users, but its price was low enough, at around GB£80, to appeal to the more serious enthusiast as well. It was a very small machine built on two cards, one with an LED display, keypad, and cassette interface (the circuitry {{to the left of the}} keypad), and the other with the rest of the computer (including the CPU). Almost all CPU signals were accessible via a Eurocard connector.|$|E
