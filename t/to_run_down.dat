5|$|On defense, linebacker Vince Hall, in {{his second}} game after {{recovering}} from a broken forearm, led all defensive players with 11tackles. Hall also recorded an interception in the late stages of the fourth quarter that allowed Virginia Tech <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> the clock and force Boston College into a hasty offense. Tied for third overall was Tech's Xavier Adibi, who recorded nine tackles (one for loss) and caught the game-ending interception. Adibi returned the interception 40yards for a defensive touchdown that sealed the victory for the Hokies.|$|E

5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how {{it came to be}} used after the battle while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, {{including}} Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the wagon <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> the hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing some of the men off the wagon and aggravated their injuries.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> {{the clock}} by running the ball straight ahead for a four-yard gain. Tech backup quarterback Nick Sorensen then entered the game, {{and running back}} Andre Kendrick gained a first down with a run to the 33-yard line. Kendrick then gained a first down at the Alabama 39-yard line. Kendrick continued to advance the ball with short runs, draining the clock to secure the Tech lead. Tech's third backup quarterback, Dave Meyer, also entered the game as the final seconds ticked off the clock and Virginia Tech secured its 387 win.|$|E
5|$|The {{casting process}} for Monica Reyes was unconventional. Gish {{received}} a call from her agent, who informed her that The X-Files were looking for a new female character. Gish applied for the part, but instead of having to a do a reading, she only had to meet with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. After receiving the part, Gish's first shot was scheduled four in the morning; her first scene in the episode was <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> a hill to discover a former abductee.|$|E

5|$|NC State, {{needing to}} score, {{drove down the}} field and kicked a go-ahead 33-yard field goal with 7:12 {{remaining}} in the game. After a failed possession, Tech was forced to punt the ball away, allowing NC State <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> the clock. The Virginia Tech defense eventually forced a stop, giving the Tech offense one final {{chance to win the}} game. With 1:53 on the clock and beginning from their own 20-yard line, the Hokies drove 57 yards to the NC State 23-yard line. There, kicker Chris Kinzer successfully kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired to give Virginia Tech a 25-24 win.|$|E
5|$|On State's {{first play}} after the punt, fullback Mal Crite {{ran for a}} 40-yard gain, pushing State's offense to the Tech 46-yard line with just over four minutes left. State pushed forward another seven yards, but failed to gain another first down and {{prepared}} to punt the ball back to Tech with 3:14 remaining in the game. Rather than punt the ball, however, State punter Kelly Hollodick instead received the snap on fourth down and ran for a first down. Because State retained possession, {{it was able to}} continue <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> the clock after the fake punt. Tech stopped the clock once by calling a timeout and prevented State from gaining another first down. With 2:01 remaining in the game, State punted the ball into Tech's end zone for a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{returned}} the kick to their 43-yard line, and the Hokies proceeded {{to run out}} the clock by executing running plays—which do not stop the clock at their conclusion. Tempers ran high among Texas players, and Texas defender Stoney Clark was ejected from the game after throwing the football at a Virginia Tech player following {{the conclusion of a}} play. Texas was assessed two personal-foul penalties, which advanced the ball to the Texas 31-yard line and gave Virginia Tech a first down. Tech continued <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> the clock with rushing plays, and the Hokies brought in freshman backup quarterback Al Clark to supervise the game's final plays. The clock rolled to zero, and Virginia Tech secured a 2810 victory.|$|E

5|$|Dean Peterson {{is forced}} to expel the nerds, and a remorseful Homer {{immediately}} invites them {{to move in with}} his family. However, their presence quickly disrupts the normal family routine, and Marge orders Homer to evict them, leading him {{to try to get the}} three re-admitted to the school. Homer's plan involves an attempt <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> Dean Peterson with his car, but have the nerds push Peterson out of the way at the last moment, with the hope that Peterson would readmit the nerds out of gratitude for saving his life. But the plan backfires, and Homer winds up running down the dean, seriously injuring him. At the hospital, Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks, and asks that Benjamin, Doug, and Gary be reinstated. The dean agrees to reinstate them and does not punish Homer, agreeing to forget everything that has happened. The nerds thank Homer for his assistance and move back into their old dormitory room.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's offense {{began work}} from its 36-yard line, but ran four plays without gaining {{a first down}} and turned the ball over on downs. Virginia Tech, whose offense began at the Florida State 45-yard line, {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> the clock. In eight plays, Tech advanced 21 yards and drained 3:22, then turned the ball over on downs at the Seminole 26-yard line. Florida State's offense entered the game one final time and conducted a 12-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 20-yard pass from Manuel to running back Chris Thompson for a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point made the score 44–33, but only seven seconds remained in the game. The Seminoles attempted an onside kick {{in an attempt to}} have another opportunity for offense, but the Hokies recovered the kick and proceeded to run out the final seconds, earning a 44–33 victory.|$|E
5|$|The Terminator kills Sarah's {{mother and}} impersonates her when Sarah, {{unaware of the}} Terminator's ability to mimic victims, {{attempts}} to contact her via telephone. When they realize he has reacquired them, they escape in a pickup truck. In the ensuing chase, Kyle is wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Enraged‚ Sarah knocks the Terminator off his motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator hijacks a tank truck and attempts <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> Sarah, but Kyle slides a pipe bomb onto the tanker, causing an explosion that burns the flesh from the Terminator's endoskeleton. It pursues them to a factory, where Kyle activates machinery to confuse the Terminator. He jams his final pipe bomb into the Terminator's abdomen, blowing the Terminator apart, injuring Sarah, and killing Kyle. The Terminator's still functional torso reactivates and grabs Sarah. She breaks free and lures it into a hydraulic press, crushing it.|$|E

5|$|The post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 20-yard line, and the Hokies began an offensive drive hoping <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> the clock and preserve their two-touchdown lead. Because the game clock continues to run on rushing plays, the Hokies executed five consecutive rushing plays, picking up a first down in the process. The Hokies were unable to gain a second first down, however, and Tech punted from its 40-yard line. The kick rolled out of bounds at the Eagles' 28-yard line with 9:28 remaining in the game, and Boston College took over on offense. On the first play after the punt, however, Tech defender Jason Worilds tackled Davis, forcing a fumble, which bounced {{into the hands of}} fellow defender Orion Martin, who ran it 17 yards for a defensive touchdown. The extra point bounced off an upright, however, and was no good. Still, with just 9:05 remaining in the game, Tech took a commanding 30–10 lead.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>down</b> {{the clock to}} secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping the clock and forcing a Florida State punt. Only {{a minute and a}} half had run off the clock, and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off the clock, and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.|$|E
