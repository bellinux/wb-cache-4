In October 2006, the museum announced plans to <b>turn</b> <b>galleries</b> into conference rooms, remove most of the museum's focus on art, and lay off 28 of its 85 employees (most of whom were security guards for the art gallery). At the time, Copia had $68 million ($ today) in debt. That year the museum also lowered its original adult admission fee of $12.50 to $5.

The museum also began hosting weddings and renting its space more frequently {{in order to raise}} revenue. In 2007, the museum altered its theme significantly by removing its focus on food and art, and instead focusing solely on wine. It replaced some of its gardens with vineyards, changed its displays to focus more on the history and aspects of wine and viticulture, and decreased the restaurant's and programs' focus on food.|$|R
