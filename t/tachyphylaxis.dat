5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; midazolam {{should not be used}} for longer than 72 hours due to risks of <b>tachyphylaxis,</b> and the possibility of development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as neurological complications. Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological complications.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and <b>tachyphylaxis</b> can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952 {{researchers}} at Ciba discovered the first orally available vasodilator, hydralazine. [...] A major shortcoming of hydralazine monotherapy {{was that it}} lost its effectiveness over time (<b>tachyphylaxis).</b> [...] In the mid-1950s Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. discovered and developed chlorothiazide, which remains {{the most widely used}} antihypertensive drug today. This development was associated with a substantial decline in the mortality rate among people with hypertension. The inventors were recognized by a Public Health Lasker Award in 1975 for [...] "the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension".|$|E
50|$|Use of {{intranasal}} decongestants (such as oxymetazoline) {{for more}} than three days leads to <b>tachyphylaxis</b> of response and rebound congestion, caused by alpha-adrenoceptor mediated down-regulation and desensitization of response. Oxymetazoline-induced <b>tachyphylaxis</b> and rebound congestion are reversed by intranasal fluticasone.|$|E
5000|$|Antidepressant {{treatment}} <b>tachyphylaxis</b> (ADT <b>tachyphylaxis),</b> {{also known}} as Prozac poop-out, is a medical condition in which progressive or acute tolerance effects are seen following chronic administration of a drug. [...] ADT <b>tachyphylaxis</b> specifically refers to a sudden decrease in response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Although less commonly prescribed as antidepressants (having lost popularity following the introduction of SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or MAOIs, have also incurred a [...] "poop-out" [...] effect among depressed patients.|$|E
50|$|ADT <b>tachyphylaxis</b> {{incorporates}} drug sensitivity as {{a potential}} causal factor for the decreased response. However, tolerance provides a more accurate explanation. While the exact cause of ADT <b>tachyphylaxis</b> in individual cases is unknown, drug tolerance is a more comprehensive model, as it includes mechanisms of pharmacodynamic tolerance, metabolic tolerance, and others.|$|E
50|$|Psychedelics such as LSD-25 and psilocybin-containing {{mushrooms}} demonstrate {{very rapid}} <b>tachyphylaxis.</b> In other words, {{one may be}} unable to 'trip' two days in a row. Some people are able to 'trip' by taking up to three times the dosage, yet some users {{may not be able to}} negate <b>tachyphylaxis</b> at all until a period of days has gone by.|$|E
50|$|Dobutamine, a direct-acting beta agonist used in {{congestive}} heart failure, also demonstrates <b>tachyphylaxis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Nitroglycerine {{and other}} nitrovasodilators of the nitrate type {{demonstrates}} <b>tachyphylaxis,</b> requiring drug-free intervals when administered transdermally ...|$|E
50|$|Nicotine {{may also}} show <b>tachyphylaxis</b> {{over the course}} of a day, {{although}} the mechanism of this action is unclear.|$|E
50|$|Ranitidine, {{used for}} acid reflux {{treatment}}, can display rapid <b>tachyphylaxis</b> within {{six weeks of}} treatment initiation, limiting its long-term use potential.|$|E

50|$|Hydralazine {{displays}} <b>tachyphylaxis</b> {{if given}} as a monotherapy for antihypertensive treatment. It is administered with a beta-blocker {{with or without}} a diuretic.|$|E
50|$|Other {{options include}} {{increasing}} {{dose of the}} same medication, or supplementation with another antidepressant. Dual reuptake inhibitors, also known as tricyclic antidepressants {{have been shown to}} have lower rates of <b>tachyphylaxis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nitrates exhibit {{development}} of tolerance, or more specifically <b>tachyphylaxis,</b> meaning that repeated application {{results in a}} fast decrease of effect, usually within 24 hours. A pause of six to eight hours restores the original effectiveness. This phenomenon was originally {{thought to be a}} consequence of depletion of thiol (-SH) groups necessary for the reduction of nitrates. While this theory would fit the fact that molsidomine (which is not reduced) does not exhibit <b>tachyphylaxis,</b> it has meanwhile been refuted. Newer theories include increase of oxidative stress resulting in deactivation of NO to peroxynitrite, and liberation of the vasoconstrictors angiotensin II and endothelin as the blood vessels' reaction to NO-mediated vasodilation.|$|E
5000|$|Down-regulation occurs, for example, when a cell is overstimulated by a neurotransmitter, hormone, or {{drug for}} a {{prolonged}} period of time, and {{the expression of the}} receptor protein is decreased {{in order to protect the}} cell (see also <b>tachyphylaxis).</b>|$|E
50|$|Ranitidine {{used to be}} {{administered}} long-term for reflux treatment, sometimes indefinitely. However, PPIs have taken over this role. In addition, a fairly rapid <b>tachyphylaxis</b> can develop within 6 weeks of initiation of treatment, further limiting its potential for long-term use.|$|E
50|$|Topical nasal or {{ophthalmic}} decongestants quickly develop <b>tachyphylaxis</b> (a rapid {{decrease in}} the response to a drug after repeated doses over {{a short period of}} time). Long-term use is not recommended, since these agents lose effectiveness after a few days.|$|E
50|$|Theacrine has {{demonstrated}} clinical safety and non-habituating effects in healthy humans over 8 weeks of daily use {{at up to}} 300 mg/day. Moreover, {{there was no evidence}} of <b>tachyphylaxis</b> that is typical of neuroactive agents such as caffeine and other stimulants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tachyphylaxis</b> is {{characterized}} by the rate sensitivity: the response of the system depends on the rate with which a stimulus is presented. To be specific, a high-intensity prolonged stimulus or often-repeated stimulus may bring about a diminished response also known as desensitization.|$|E
50|$|Repeated {{application}} {{can result}} in <b>tachyphylaxis</b> (reduced effectiveness) due {{to the formation of}} anti-mouse antibodies in the patient, which accelerates elimination of the drug. It can also lead to an anaphylactic reaction against the mouse protein, which may be difficult to distinguish from a CRS.|$|E
50|$|Hormone replacement, {{when used}} in menopausal women {{in the form of}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone implants, is cited as having potential to lead to <b>tachyphylaxis,</b> but that citation is based on a single study done in 1990 and no follow-up research is available to support this interpretation.|$|E
50|$|Ro4-1539 {{has never}} {{formally}} undergone clinical trials in humans, {{but based on}} its effects in animals it {{would be expected to}} produce effects similar to those of other potent opioid agonists, including strong analgesia, sedation, euphoria, constipation, itching, <b>tachyphylaxis</b> and respiratory depression, which could be harmful or fatal.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} G protein-coupled receptors, {{signalling}} by the μ-opioid receptor is terminated through several different mechanisms, which are upregulated with chronic use, leading to rapid <b>tachyphylaxis.</b> The most important regulatory proteins for the MOR are the β-arrestins arrestin beta 1 and arrestin beta 2, and the RGS proteins RGS4, RGS9-2, RGS14, and RGSZ2.|$|E
50|$|ADT <b>tachyphylaxis</b> {{specifically}} {{occurs in}} depressed patients using SSRIs and MAOIs. Currently, SSRIs are the preferred treatment for depression among clinicians, as MAOIs require {{the patient to}} avoid certain foods and other medications due to the potential for interactions capable of inducing dangerous side effects. Provided {{is a list of}} medications known to be subject to Poop-out.|$|E
5000|$|Tachyphylaxis: The acute {{development}} of tolerance {{to the action}} of a drug after repeated doses. Significant <b>tachyphylaxis</b> can occur by day 4 of therapy. Recovery usually occurs after 3 to 4 days rest. This has led to therapies such as 3 days on, 4 days off; or one week on therapy, and one week off therapy.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{affected}} by ADT <b>tachyphylaxis</b> experience a noticeably sudden progressive decrease {{in response to}} SSRIs. The reported rates of this condition vary from 9% to 33% of SSRI users, {{and the majority of}} those affected are less responsive to subsequent treatments. In most observational studies, these individuals suffer a recurrence or relapse of depression without changing the previously effective dose.|$|E
50|$|To prevent <b>tachyphylaxis,</b> {{a topical}} steroid is often {{prescribed}} {{to be used}} on a week on, week off routine. Some recommend using the topical steroid for 3 consecutive days on, followed by 4 consecutive days off. Long-term use of topical steroids can lead to secondary infection with fungus or bacteria (see tinea incognito), skin atrophy, telangiectasia (prominent blood vessels), skin bruising and fragility.|$|E
50|$|At {{systemic}} {{and local}} levels, ibopamine {{has been proved}} to be of low toxicity. It is well-tolerated since no obvious changes to the haematological and behavioural parameters have been observed after administration. Ibopamine eye drop at 2% concentration, containing 1 mg of the compound, did not show any significant systemic side-effects and <b>tachyphylaxis</b> phenomena whereas the oral dosage is higher than 400 mg per day.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tachyphylaxis</b> (Greek ταχύς, tachys, [...] "rapid", and φύλαξις, phylaxis, [...] "protection") is {{a medical}} term {{describing}} an acute, sudden decrease {{in response to a}} drug after its administration, i.e. a rapid and short-term onset of drug tolerance. It can occur after an initial dose or after a series of small doses. Increasing the dose of the drug may be able to restore the original response.|$|E
5000|$|Metoclopramide, a {{dopamine}} D2 receptor antagonist, increases contractility {{and resting}} tone within the GI tract to improve gastric emptying. In addition, dopamine antagonist {{action in the}} central nervous system prevents nausea and vomiting. Similarly, the dopamine receptor antagonist domperidone is also used to treat gastroparesis. Erythromycin is known to improve emptying of the stomach but its effects are temporary due to <b>tachyphylaxis</b> and wane after a few weeks of consistent use.|$|E
50|$|There {{remains a}} need for more efficacious {{antidepressant}} agents. Although two-thirds of patients will ultimately respond to antidepressant treatment, one-third of patients respond to placebo, and remission is frequently sub-maximal (residual symptoms). In addition to post-treatment relapse, depressive symptoms can even recur in the course of long-term therapy (<b>tachyphylaxis).</b> Also, currently available antidepressants all elicit undesirable side-effects, and new agents should be divested of the distressing side-effects of both first and second-generation antidepressants.|$|E
50|$|It {{has never}} been used in humans, but would be {{expected}} to produce effects similar to those of other potent opioid agonists, including strong analgesia, sedation, euphoria, constipation, itching and respiratory depression which could be harmful or fatal. Tolerance and dependence {{would be expected to}} develop rapidly based on the potency of the drug, as it is of a similar strength to the potent fentanyl analogues and so would most likely cause pronounced <b>tachyphylaxis</b> following repeated dosing.|$|E
50|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; midazolam {{should not be used}} for longer than 72 hours due to risks of <b>tachyphylaxis,</b> and the possibility of development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as neurological complications. Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological complications.Midazolam is also sometimes used in newborns who are receiving mechanical ventilation, although morphine is preferred, owing to its better safety profile for this indication.|$|E
50|$|A-77636 is a {{synthetic}} drug which {{acts as a}} selective D1 receptor full agonist. It has nootropic, anorectic, rewarding and antiparkinsonian effects in animal studies, but its high potency and long duration of action causes D1 receptor downregulation and <b>tachyphylaxis,</b> and unlike other D1 full agonists such as SKF-82,958, it does not produce place preference in animals. A-77636 partially substituted for cocaine in animal studies, and has been suggested {{for use as a}} possible substitute drug in treating addiction, but it is better known for its use in studying the role of D1 receptors in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{mechanism}} of action of the sympathomimetic appetite suppressants {{in the treatment of}} obesity is not fully known, these medications have pharmacological effects similar to those of amphetamines. Amphetamine and related sympathomimetic medications (such as benzphetamine) are thought to stimulate the release of norepinephrine and/or dopamine from storage sites in nerve terminals of the lateral hypothalamic feeding center, thereby producing a decrease in appetite. This release is mediated through the binding of benzphetamine to VMAT2 and inhibiting its function, causing a release of these neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft through their reuptake transporters. <b>Tachyphylaxis</b> and tolerance have been demonstrated with all drugs of this class.|$|E
