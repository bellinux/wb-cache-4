5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{the stars}} of TGS, decide <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the sick crew. They think about getting the crew soup but are too lazy to do it; instead they decide that {{laughter}} is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very unsuccessful show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over the crew, as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating her for it.|$|E

The poll showed large majority support from Democrats, Republicans and independents.|$|E
5000|$|Betty Friedan {{referred}} to penis envy as a purely parasitic social bias typical of Victorianism and particularly of Freud's own biography, and showed how the concept {{played a key}} role in discrediting alternative notions of femininity in the early to mid twentieth century: [...] "Because Freud's followers could only see woman in the image defined by Freud - inferior, childish, helpless, with no possibility of happiness unless she adjusted to being man's passive object - <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> women get rid of their suppressed envy, their neurotic desire <b>to</b> be equal. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> women find sexual fulfilment as women, by affirming their natural inferiority".|$|R

[...] sighed Phil, with a look and tone that made his comrades forget their pique in sudden self-reproach; for not one of them could deny his words, or help feeling that the prayers of such {{innocent}} souls would avail much.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{mother has}} got work nearer home, Lotty and Caddy go to school, and Tot {{is safe and}} warm, with Miss Parsons to look after her. Miss Parsons is {{a young woman who}} was {{freezing}} and starving in a little room upstairs, too proud to beg and too shy and sick to get much work. I found her warming her hands one day in Mrs. Kennedy's room, and hanging over the soup-pot as if she was eating the smell. It reminded me of the picture in Punch where the two beggar boys look in at a kitchen, sniffing at the nice dinner cooking there. One says, 'I don't care for the meat, Bill, but I don't mind if I takes a smell at the pudd'n' when it's dished.' I proposed a lunch at once, and we all sat down, and ate soup out of yellow bowls with pewter spoons with such a relish it was fun to see. I had on my old rig; so poor Parsons thought I was some dressmaker or work-girl, and opened her heart to me as she never would have done if I'd gone and demanded her confidence, and patronized her, as some people do when <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> I promised her some work, and proposed that she should do it in Mrs. K.'s room, as a favor, mind you, so that the older girls could go to school and Tot have some one to look after her. She agreed, and that saved her fire, and made the K.'s all right. Sarah (that's Miss P.) tried to stiffen up when she learned where I lived; but she wanted the work, and soon found I didn't put on airs, but lent her books, and brought her and Tot my bouquets and favors after a german, and told her pleasant things as she sat cooking her poor chilblainy feet in the oven, as if she never could get thawed out.|$|E
