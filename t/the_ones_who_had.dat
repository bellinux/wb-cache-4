He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and forcible rape and testified against the other three in their trials. He received a 30-year sentence.

It was Starr's first release since [...] "It Don't Come Easy", a year before. During this period, his {{priority}} {{had been to}} develop a career as an actor in films such as 200 Motels (1971) and Blindman. Further aligning himself with Britain's glam rock movement, Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie (1972), a film starring Bolan that included Starr's footage of a T. Rex concert held at Wembley on 18 March. With [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", NME critic Bob Woffinden noted Starr's success in establishing himself {{in the two years}} since the Beatles' break-up, and wrote that the single [...] "confirmed that he and Harrison, dark horses both, were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> managed their solo careers more purposefully and intelligently" [...] compared with McCartney and Lennon.|$|E

2500|$|The {{extent of}} popular {{support among the}} Lakota people for {{independence}} is unclear. Russell Means and Canupa Gluha Mani have claimed that some 13,000 Lakota, including 77% {{of the population of}} Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, have shown support for the Republic of Lakotah, and that the eight-member delegation which traveled to Washington, D.C. was only a portion of some 77 tribal elders and activists taking part in the movement. However, Rapid City Journal reporter Bill Harlan reported on his blog that [...] "most folks I talk to hadn't heard about the declaration. <b>The</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> heard the news, to a person, did not {{want to talk about it}} on the record." [...] The Journal has also noted that [...] "there were no tribal presidents in the group which made the announcement, no one from the top ranks of any of the Lakota Sioux tribes." [...] Nanwica Kciji, an Oglala Lakota and first president of the Native American Journalists Association, has also discredited the December 2007 developments, arguing that the Lakotah Freedom Delegation [...] "never considered that treaties are made between nations and not individuals." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese scholar Hidetada Mukai wrote Austen {{never gave}} the precise {{wealth of the}} Bertram family, but it is {{mentioned}} that Mr. Rushworth has an annual income of £12,000 and the Bertrams live on less than that. Hidetda noted that Mansfield Park is described in the novel as a modern house, and Sir Thomas wants Maria to marry Mr. Rushworth to improve the social prestige of his family, suggesting that the Bertrams are a nouveau riche family whose income depends on the plantation in Antigua. The abolition {{of the slave trade}} in 1807 did indeed, as the abolitionists had hoped, impose serious strain on the plantations of the British West Indies as without new slaves from Africa to replace <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> died of yellow fever and malaria, it become more difficult to turn a profit owing to labour shortages, and Austen may have been referring to this crisis on the Caribbean plantations when Sir Thomas leaves for Antigua for two years to deal with unspecified problems on his plantation. Hidetada pointed that when Sir Thomas returns after his two-year absence in Antigua, none of his children are happy to see him again, suggesting that Sir Thomas is an oppressive father, and that Austen made him a slave master with his plantation in Antigua as an way of indicating that. Hidetada further argued that Austen made Sir Thomas a slave master as an feminist attack on the patriarchal society of Regency England, noting that the way in which Sir Thomas treats woman, including his own daughters and as well as Price, as disposable commodities to be traded and bartered for to his own advantage is parallel with his treatment of his slaves who are exploited to support his lifestyle. Hidetada also noted that Sir Thomas talks much about his time in the West Indies, but when Price asks him about his slaves, she is greeted with [...] "dead silence", suggesting Sir Thomas cannot speak of something that he knows in his heart to be wrong.|$|E
