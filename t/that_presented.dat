5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as <b>that</b> <b>presented</b> to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|It was in {{this manner}} that Fortune and Loveday claimed that they {{received}} a text, The Cosmic Doctrine, which was dictated to them in segments by the Masters between July 1923 and February 1925. These communications discussed the existence of seven planes of the universe, and were {{very similar to the}} ideas promoted in Moriarty's writings, in particular his Aphorism of Creation and Cosmic Principles. The cosmology present in this book was also similar to <b>that</b> <b>presented</b> in Theosophy. In the following years, Fortune distributed this material among her senior students, before publishing an edited version of The Cosmic Doctrine in 1949.|$|E

5|$|The Dawn of Love {{intentionally}} {{presents a}} moral dilemma to viewers. By his open depiction of nudity and sensuality, Etty makes {{the same argument}} as <b>that</b> <b>presented</b> by Comus, that it is rational for the viewer to succumb to their lustful thoughts while in private. The picture presents the same moral challenge to the viewer as that which Comus presents to The Lady, that of remaining true to her better, moral and rational, nature, despite there being no apparent disadvantage in surrendering to desire.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{the first volume of}} three Darwin wrote about the geology he had {{investigated}} during the voyage, and was widely recognised as a major scientific work <b>that</b> <b>presented</b> his deductions from all the available observations on this large subject. In 1853, Darwin was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal for the monograph and for his work on barnacles. Darwin's theory that coral reefs formed as the islands and surrounding areas of crust subsided has been supported by modern investigations, and is no longer disputed, while the cause of the subsidence and uplift of areas of crust has continued to be a subject of discussion.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{idea for}} a video game <b>that</b> <b>presented</b> the Metroid series in a pinball setting came to Kensuke Tanabe after he learned that Fuse Games had {{previously}} worked on Mario Pinball Land, another pinball video game.

The game was sold with a Rumble Pak accessory for the Nintendo DS, marking the first time the accessory was available for the Nintendo DS.|$|E

5|$|With {{the rapidly}} deteriorating {{military}} {{situation for the}} German Army on the Eastern Front, it became increasingly important to interrupt the flow of supplies from the Western Allies to the Soviet Union. By December 1943, the German Army was forced into continuous retreat. The Luftwaffe had been seriously weakened by four long years of war, and increasing Allied anti-submarine capabilities were steadily degrading {{the effectiveness of the}} U-boats. The only effective weapon at the disposal of the Germans in Norway was Scharnhorst—Tirpitz was badly damaged, and the four remaining heavy cruisers were committed to the Baltic. During a conference with Hitler on 19–20 December, Großadmiral Karl Dönitz decided to employ Scharnhorst against the next Allied convoy <b>that</b> <b>presented</b> itself. Erich Bey, by now promoted to Konteradmiral, was given command of the task force.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{presented}} its {{judgment in}} the Bosnian Genocide Case, {{in which it}} had examined atrocities committed in detention camps, including Omarska, in relation to Article II (b) of the Genocide Convention. The Court stated in its judgment:Having carefully examined the evidence presented before it, and taken note of <b>that</b> <b>presented</b> to the ICTY, the Court considers {{that it has been}} established by fully conclusive evidence that members of the protected group were systematically victims of massive mistreatment, beatings, rape and torture causing serious bodily and mental harm during the conflict and, in particular, in the detention camps. The requirements of the material element, as defined by Article II (b) of the Convention are thus fulfilled. The Court finds, however, on the basis of evidence before it, that it has not been conclusively established that those atrocities, although they too may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, were committed with the specific intent (dolus specialis) to destroy the protected group, in whole or in part, required for a finding that genocide has been perpetrated.|$|E
5|$|The 1962 {{edition of}} the Roman Missal, {{published}} {{a few months before}} the Second Vatican Council opened, was the last <b>that</b> <b>presented</b> the Mass as standardised in 1570 by Pope Pius V {{at the request of the}} Council of Trent and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass. Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by Pope Clement VIII in 1604, Pope Urban VIII in 1634, Pope Pius X in 1911, Pope Pius XII in 1955, and Pope John XXIII in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops; but Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorised parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses. Except for the scriptural readings, which Pope Benedict allowed to be proclaimed in the vernacular language, it is celebrated exclusively in liturgical Latin.|$|E
