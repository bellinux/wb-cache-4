In 2008, the team won their 500th game, and they also drafted DeSean Jackson, a receiving threat when paired with McNabb.|$|E

[...] However, the 1979-1980 campaign was a forgetful one as the team <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back.</b> [...] Cotchery and Andre did not perform up to expectations. [...] Senior Perry Smith was the lone bright spot for the team. [...] He later earned First Team All-GSC Conference honors {{for the first time in}} his career. [...] LU as a team, meanwhile, finished fifth in the conference and 14-12 overall. [...] Murphy’s third season at the helm started off with his third straight major freshman acquisition as he recruited Dennis Williams to play Tiger men’s basketball. [...] He also picked up Randy Terry, who was a prospect from Jones County Junior College, to replace Smith at shooting guard. [...] Terry was a native of nearby Tuscaloosa and known for his phenomenal shooting ability. [...] That season was a huge step in the right direction for LU basketball. [...] Williams, Cotchery, Andre, and Terry formed a solid core, which carried the team to a 19-9 season. [...] Cotchery and Andre received First Team All-GSC Conference honors. [...] Williams was named the GSC Freshman of the Year. [...] Murphy was named the GSC Coach of the Year.
