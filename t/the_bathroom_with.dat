40|$|Background: The {{most common}} oral hygiene aid {{used to improve}} the oral health of an {{individual}} is toothbrush and it is often neglected to maintain in a proper aseptic condition, which could probably result in contamination by various micro-organisms. Aims: 1) To assess the microbial contamination of the hard deposit on the toothbrush head, between the bristle tufts, after 1 and 3 months of use. 2) To assess the microbial contamination of the hard deposit on the toothbrush head, between the bristle tufts, which were kept in <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>with</b> and without attached toilet. Setting and Design: An in vitro study. Materials and Methods: Twenty toothbrushes kept in <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>with</b> an attached toilet and 20 toothbrushes kept in <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> without an attached toilet were collected from the participants, making it a total of 40. Among these 20 toothbrushes in each group, 10 were used for 1 month duration and 10 were used for 3 months duration. Results: Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, Lactobacillus, Klebsiella, Candida species were isolated in 1 month and 3 months used toothbrushes kept in <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> without attached toilet. Escherichia coli was found in 3 months used toothbrushes kept in <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>with</b> attached toilet. Micro-organisms were found in isolated form in toothbrushes used for 1 month, whereas in toothbrushes used for 3 months they are found in clumps. Conclusion: Hard deposit on the toothbrush head between bristle tufts is a nidus for growth of micro-organisms, which not only affects the oral health but also affects the general health of an individual...|$|R

The singer took several cast members and some friends home with her for a small party.

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had served as showrunners of seasons three and four. They returned to the show to produce this and several other episodes while under contract with The Walt Disney Company. The episode was written by Reid Harrison and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It {{had one of the}} longest episode gaps between its conception to the time it was finished. The idea was first conceived at a story retreat. Jean found a copy of TV Guide while in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>with</b> The X-Files on the cover. Feeling a crossover would be a good idea, he came back into the room, told Reiss his idea, and the pair pitched it. None of the other staff wanted to do it, so Reiss and Jean decided to do it themselves. Before the episode was produced, the script was sent to Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, who said that it was an [...] "honor" [...] to be satirized by The Simpsons. Jean was worried that the episode was not funny, as at the table reading {{there were only a few}} of the writers present and as such, the script got no laughs at all. It took a long time to come up with an ending, and an explanation for the alien. Originally, it was just going to be left as a mystery. Mulder and Scully's office was designed to be exactly the same as the one used in The X-Files. After it had been finished, Fox sent the episode out for a critical review, which was [...] "really great". The scene with the [...] "Homer is a dope" [...] T-shirts originally had an extra line: [...] "I told you, we're sold out!", thus filling in the plot error in the actual episode in which Homer asks for some T-shirts, despite just being told that they were sold out. The scene after Homer's first encounter with the alien, in which he runs through a field writing [...] "Yahhh!" [...] in the grass, was written by David M. Stern, and added in after the original read through.|$|E

David Bischoff wrote a novel based on the film published by Avon Books in June 1990. A unique aspect {{of the novel is}} how Bischoff adapts the sequence where the film breaks. In the novel, the Brain Gremlin subdues and locks Bischoff in his bathroom before taking the reins for a little bit to explain that the Gremlins take over {{at this point in the}} film, his displeasure at Bischoff using the nickname [...] "Mr. Glasses" [...] instead of his official name, and begins a treatise on politics before Bischoff breaks his way out of <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>with</b> an axe and subdues the Brain Gremlin.

2500|$|On August 8, 1996, the Los Angeles Daily News {{announced}} that Jon Seda and Edward James Olmos {{had joined the}} cast as Chris Perez and Abraham Quintanilla, respectively. After Lopez received the role, she decided to stay with Suzette at her home to study her character in the recordings and footage the family shared with her. Lopez felt that her [...] "spirit and [...] spirit were so similar" [...] which was echoed by the singer's family who found that Lopez mimicked similar personality traits of Selena. They believed that Lopez' body language, laugh, and how she talked were identical to that of Selena's. Lopez had constant dance rehearsals for the film and said how she would arrive at the studio {{late in the day}} after finishing filming for another role.

Suzette discovered that Jackie Guerra, who played her in the film, constantly fixed her fitted and asked her family if she had done that before in which the family replied that she unknowingly does so. Band member Pete Astudillo, had to do a screen test of himself for the film and said how he had to improvised in several of his scenes since he had little dialogue in the film. American actor Jon Seda portrayed Chris Perez in the film and often spent time with Perez for character development. Seda said how he had spent time with Perez at the home he shared with Selena and found a price sticker in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>with</b> a scribbled letter that read [...] "Selena and Chris, I Love You" [...] and expressed on how that further inspired him to [...] "show the love they [...] had" [...] in the film.
