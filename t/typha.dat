5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (<b>Typha</b> angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E
5|$|Carrington Moss is a lowland raised bog. The area drains slowly, which {{slows the}} {{decomposition}} of plant life {{and leads to}} the accumulation of peat. Over thousands of years this raises the level of peat and forms a gently sloping dome (hence, raised). Such areas support {{a wide range of}} flora and fauna; Sphagnum balticum, a medium-sized bog moss, was recorded on Carrington Moss in the 1880s, although locally it is now presumed to be extinct. Lancashire- or bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba), cranberries, bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia), and the cotton sedge have also been recorded. In 1923 species of trees recorded by E. Price Evans for the Journal of Ecology included English oak (Quercus robur), and common ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Undergrowth included common hazel (Corylus avellana), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Several species of ground vegetation included creeping soft grass (Holcus mollis), common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), iris (Iris pseudacorus), mad-dog weed (Alisma plantago-aquatica), and cat-o'-nine-tails (<b>Typha</b> latifolia).|$|E
5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include <b>typha</b> latifolia, phragmites australis, mentha aquatica, and lythrum salicaria. Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the common teal, shoveler, warbler, kingfisher, water rail, and nightingale.|$|E

We investigated host associations among C. turbatus, C. <b>typhae,</b> and their parasitoids in Europe. Of particular interest was host specificity of Trichomalus perfectus (Walker) and Mesopolobus morys (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), candidates for biological control of C. obstrictus in North America.

25|$|<b>Typha</b> {{stems and}} leaves {{can be used}} to make paper. It is strong with a heavy texture and it is hard to bleach, so it is not {{suitable}} for industrial production of graphical paper. In 1853, considerable amounts of cattail paper were produced in New York, due to a shortage of raw materials. In 1948, French scientists tested methods for annual harvesting of the leaves. Because of the high cost these methods were abandoned and no further research was done. Today <b>Typha</b> is used to make decorative paper.|$|E

40|$|The Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs Pollen <b>Typhae</b> and Pollen <b>Typhae</b> Carbonisatus {{have been}} used as a {{hemostatic}} medicine promoting blood clotting for thousands of years. In this study, a reliable, highly sensitive method based on LC-MS/MS has been developed for differentiation of the heating products of total flavonoids in Pollen <b>Typhae</b> (FPT-N). Twenty three peaks were detected and 18 peaks have been structurally identified by comparing retention times, high resolution mass spectrometry data, and fragment ions with those of the reference substances and/or literature data. Additionally, 15 compounds have been quantified by multiple reaction monitoring in the negative ionization mode. It was found that the contents of the characterized compounds differed greatly from each other in FPT-N samples. Among them, the content of huaicarbon B significantly increased at first, while it decreased after heating for 25 min, which could be considered as the characteristic component for distinguishing FPT-N. The present study provided an approach to rapidly distinguish the differences of FPT-N samples. In addition, the actively summarized characteristic fragmentation might help deducing the structure of unknown flavonols compounds. Furthermore, transformation rules of flavonoids during the heating process in carbonisatus development could contribute to hemostatic therapeutic component exploration...|$|R

25|$|Reed {{plants and}} {{floating}} reed islands (called plaur in Romania) {{are the most}} common and well known components of the Danube Delta. Vegetation of this ecosystem consists of the common reed (Phragmites communis) and, on near river banks, mace reed/cattail (<b>Typha</b> latifolia, <b>Typha</b> angustifolia), sedge (Carex dioica, Carex stricta), Dutch rush (Scirpus radicans, Schoenoplectus lacustris), and brook mint (Mentha aquatica), etc. They provide ideal spawning and nesting grounds. The plaur are a mixture of reed roots, grass and soil, usually floating or anchored to the riverbed. As a rule, the reed surrounds the lakes and ponds, and slowly invades the water surface.|$|E

40|$|Sera {{from the}} rats with {{different}} drug treatments (atorvastatin, Tiaozhi granule, or its extracts) were collected. LO- 2 cells or HepG 2 cells were pretreated with different sera {{as the following}} groups randomly: (1) blank control group, (2) positive control group (atorvastatin group), (3) Tiaozhi granule water extract groups, (4) Tiaozhi granule alcohol extract groups, and (5) alcohol extracts for each component: Pollen <b>Typhae</b> Angustifoliae, Curcuma longa L., and Rhizoma Alismatis. LO- 2 cells were cotransfected with plasmid carrying SR-BI and pRL-TK promoter genes. Promoter activity {{was measured by the}} luciferase reporter gene assay. The mRNA and protein expressions of SR-BI were examined using real-time PCR and western blot analyses. Our results show that promoter activity and mRNA and protein expression levels of the SR-BI were significantly upregulated by Tiaozhi granules alcohol or water extracts in a dose-dependent manner. Pollen <b>Typhae</b> Angustifoliae alcohol extract with a high dosage could also increase SR-BI activity and expression, but not the extracts from Curcuma longa L. and Rhizoma Alismatis. Both Tiaozhi granule alcohol and water extracts can upregulate SR-BI gene expression.

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} Pollen <b>Typhae</b> as used in traditional Chinese medicine, a high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) method has been developed, validated and applied to chromatographic fingerprinting and quantitation of its eight main bioactive flavonoids (naringenin, isorhamnetin 3 -O-(2 G-α-l-rhamnosyl) -rutinoside, rhamnetin 3 -O-neohesperidoside, isorhamnetin, quercetin 3 -O-(2 G-α-l-rhamnosyl) -rutinoside, quercetin 3 -O-neohesperidoside, kaempferol and quercetin).

40|$|SUMMARY 1. This {{third part}} deals with "Clavariaceae," a family {{designation}} {{used in a}} traditional and descriptive, rather than a taxonomic, sanse. 2. Two of the author's previously published proposals {{for the conservation of}} certain names are replaced by slightly altered ones. They aim at the safeguarding of the names Clavulinopsis Overeem, Lachnocladium. Lev., and Ramaria (Pr.) Bonord. A proposal to conserve Pterula Fr. in its current sense is withdrawn as superfluous. 3. Some forgotten or neglected names are listed, e. g. Scleroglossum Pers. and Xyloglossum Pers. These two names are typified by a species that makes them synonyms of Acrospermum Tode ex Fr. (Ascomycetes). 4. The following typifications, among others, deserve attention: Dendrocladium Lloyd by Lachnocladium giganteum Pat., Holocoryne (Fr.) Bonord. by Clavaria falcata Pers. ex Fr., and Ramaria S. F. Gray by Clavaria pratensis Pers. 5. One new combination is made: Pistilliva <b>typhae</b> (Hohn.)

25|$|<b>Typha</b> are {{considered}} to be dominant competitors in wetlands in many areas, and they often exclude other plants with their dense canopy.
