5|$|The okapi occurs across central, {{northern}} and eastern Democratic Republic of <b>the</b> <b>Congo,</b> and {{north and east}} of <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> river. The species ranges from the Maiko forest northward to the Ituri forest, then through the river basins of the Rubi, Lake Tele and Ebola {{to the west and}} the Ubangi river further north. Smaller populations exist west and south of <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> river. They are also common in the Wamba and Epulu areas. The okapi is extinct in Uganda.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1960s, Liberia {{dispatched}} troops, including a movement control unit, to support ONUC during <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> Crisis, and were airlifted into <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> by the United States Air Force. The Liberian troops were initially in Équateur province. In 1961, during their first combat action in country, 300 Liberian troops repelled an attack by 5,000 Baluba tribesmen and their European officers.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{the copper}} {{deposits}} in the Katanga Province (former Shaba province) of the Democratic Republic of <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> were the top producer of cobalt with almost 40% world share, reports the British Geological Survey. By 2015, DRC supplied 60% {{of the world}} production of 32,000 tons at prices of $20,000 to $26,000 per ton, including artisanal mining which supplied 10 to 25%. The political situation in <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> influences the price of cobalt significantly.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was interpreted as an affront to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within <b>the</b> <b>Congo,</b> it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E

5|$|Marcel Antoine Lihau or Ebua Libana la Molengo Lihau (29 September 1931 – 9 April 1999) was a Congolese politician, jurist, and law {{professor}} {{who served as}} the initial First President of the Supreme Court of Justice of <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> from 1968 until 1975 and was involved in the creation of two functional constitutions for the Democratic Republic of <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Operation Grandslam or Operation Grand Slam was an {{offensive}} undertaken by United Nations peacekeeping forces from 28December 1962 to 15January 1963 against the gendarmerie (military) of the State of Katanga, a secessionist state rebelling against the Republic of <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> in central Africa. The Katangese forces were decisively defeated and Katanga was forcibly reintegrated into <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} arrival of the Belgian {{government}} in exile in London, negotiations began between the Belgians and the British about the role which <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> would play in the Allied war effort. The British were determined that <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because, after the fall of Dutch and British colonies in the Far East to Japan, the Allies were desperate for raw materials like rubber which <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> could produce in abundance. Eventually, the two parties came to an arrangement in which all the British demands were accepted, including a 30 percent devaluation of the Congolese franc.|$|E

5|$|The Governor-General of <b>the</b> <b>Congo,</b> Pierre Ryckmans, {{decided on}} the day of Belgium's {{surrender}} that the colony would remain loyal to the Allies, {{in stark contrast to the}} French colonies that later pledged allegiance to the pro-German Vichy government. <b>The</b> <b>Congo</b> was therefore administered from London by the Belgian government in exile during the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{initial address}} {{received}} a mixed reception within <b>the</b> <b>Congo.</b> In some quarters {{it was widely}} supported. However, some believed that it merely highlighted the fact that Lumumba was inexperienced (and overly provocative) in comparison with Kasa-Vubu's measured and diplomatic approach. Members of Lumumba's own party, including Kanza, praised the speech itself but believed that the venue in which it had been delivered was inappropriate. Lumumba's address was also notably acclaimed by figures within the international Pan-African and Black Power movements including Malcolm X. The speech may have further heightened racial violence between white settlers and native Congolese which were already distrustful. As {{a result of the}} threat to its expatriates, Belgium deployed troops to the country and, amid mounting violence, several regions of <b>the</b> <b>Congo,</b> notably Katanga, seceded and declared their own independence, starting five-years of violence and political unrest known as <b>the</b> <b>Congo</b> Crisis.|$|E

5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country.
