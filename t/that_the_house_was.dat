However, Mulder tells him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> bought by his father after Samantha's abduction, convincing him that Roche is not telling the truth. Mulder plans to bring Roche back to prison, but—following another dream about Samantha—awakens to find Roche gone, with his badge, gun, and phone stolen.|$|E
5|$|In late May 2007, {{following}} the FBI raid, questions surfaced {{about whether or}} not Jew actually lived in his San Francisco home, and whether or not Jew therefore met the residency requirements of his supervisor position. The house in question (on 28th Avenue in the Sunset District) was owned by his father, though Jew's neighbors said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> vacant and utility bills showed little to no usage of water or electricity. Jew claimed that {{he spent most of his}} time at his flower shop, but was not able to provide more information in response to City Attorney Dennis Herrera's formal requests.|$|E

5|$|Sebring Farms {{was reduced}} to piles of rubber, with four tall royal palm trees left standing. Only six people in the town survived. The hotel at Miami Locks (today known as Lake Harbor) was the sole {{structure}} to survive the storm. The bodies of many dead animals were resting on the canal banks. Ninety-nine people died in that town. In Chosen, only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people. At Henry Martin's store, the building lost its roof during the storm, forcing the occupants {{to move into the}} restroom. A house that was full of people floated about half a mile (0.8km) from its original location. The occupants were unaware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> moving until it collided with a railroad embankment. Twenty three people died in Chosen.|$|E
5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank {{for the next}} twenty years. The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth of}} Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys bought their first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who noticed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> on fire. He pounded on the door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat and}} death of Richard III at Bosworth field was a double blow for the heralds, for they lost both their patron, the King, and their benefactor, the Earl Marshal, who was also slain. The victorious Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII soon after the battle. Henry's first Parliament of 1485 passed an Act of Resumption, in which large grants of crown {{properties}} made by his two predecessors to their supporters were cancelled. Whether this act affected {{the status of the}} College's charter is debatable; however, the act did facilitate the de facto recovery of Coldharbour to the crown. Henry then granted the house to his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort, for life. This was because it was supposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> granted personally to John Writhe the Garter King of Arms and not to the heralds as a corporation. As a result, the heralds were left destitute and many of their books and records were lost. Despite this ill treatment from the King, the heralds' position at the royal court remained, and they were compelled by the King to attend him at all times (albeit in rotation).|$|E

25|$|The first {{owners of}} the Suffolk House remains disputed by two quarters, which either claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} in the early 1790s for Light, or constructed in 1809 for the subsequent governor of Penang, William Edward Phillips, about 15 years after Light's death.|$|E

25|$|The {{white house}} scandal {{triggered}} yet another scandal as Peña Nieto {{has been linked}} to another house owned by Juan Armando Hinojosa Cantú, owner of Grupo Higa. The house was used during the presidential campaign in 2012 and a few times following his election. The official statement from the President's office, however, claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> used only a few times for meetings and not when he was president.|$|E

25|$|An 1882 history {{suggests}} that the Martin house was built as early as 1730. But records show that all four of Hendrick Martin's children were baptized in Kaatsbaan, the last by 1743, suggesting the family had not moved across the river before that year. In 1751 the deed for the property which includes the house was recorded. It seems likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> built near the latter end of that period.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Kildare House and Carton House, the Fitzgeralds did not {{commission}} Frescati House, {{however in}} the 1760s, they extended and enhanced it. They {{are said to}} have spent £85,000 on the house (equivalent to many millions of euro in 2016 terms). It tripled in size and received flanking wings and bay windows to take advantage of its sea views. It was at this time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> given its name, Frescati, a deliberate corruption of the Italian resort of Frascati.|$|E

25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{improvement was}} {{the extraction of}} smoke through a flue. Still later, a proper hearth would be added with a stone chimney. This made cooking easier and meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> now free of smoke. On the down side, the hearth was no longer really a source of light and there was less energy for heating the house. Later still, {{one of the larger}} rooms would be built as a parlour with a separate stove heated from the Diele.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} {{the house was}} painted gray.

The logistics of managing a national bird atlassing project, with 3000 volunteer atlassers mapping the avifauna of a continent, stretched the resources of the organisation beyond reasonable limits, but the RAOU was forced to grow in the process.|$|E
