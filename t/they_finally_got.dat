He introduced the company, Pro Batter Sports, to the England & Wales Cricket Board and in 2010 Pro Batter completed the installation of two units at the National Performance Centre at Loughborough. Interestingly it was not until Dene Hills, an Australian Cricket Coach, joined the ECB in late 2008, as batting coach, that <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> in touch with Pro Batter regarding the possibility of using the machines for cricket; something Fountain had identified over a year before.|$|E

With wins over the West Virginia Mountaineers and the Connecticut Huskies, they began conference {{play with a}} 2–0 record. They next traveled to face the 16th-ranked Marquette Golden Eagles for their first true road game of the season, however they lost by 26points to give Mike Brey his worst loss as Notre Dame coach.

25|$|At {{the start}} of the second half, Arsenal came out on top, {{constantly}} pressing for an equaliser. They were denied two penalties by referee Lee Probert before <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> an equaliser in the 71st minute, with centre-back Laurent Koscielny bundling a header from Bacary Sagna over the line following a corner. Many believed that a goal kick should have been given instead of a corner as it appeared that substitute Yaya Sanogo got the last touch. In the 79th minute, Gibbs had a chance to put Arsenal in front when he had just goalkeeper Allan McGregor to beat, but he could not hit the target, shooting high of the goal. Arsenal had another chance for a winning goal in injury time, but Olivier Giroud's shot was saved by McGregor.|$|E
25|$|On 20 May 1863, Lord Clifden faced 30 {{rivals in}} the Derby Stakes at Epsom Downs. Ridden again by George Fordham, {{he started the}} race as the 4/1 favourite. Also {{near the front of}} the betting were Hospender and Gellie at 9/1 and Macaroni and Saccharometer at 10/1. There was a delay to the start of almost one hour after the horses were fifteen minutes late going to post and then there were over thirty false starts. When <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> under way, Lord Clifden was {{positioned}} in about tenth place by Fordham, as Bright Cloud led the field. With one mile still to run Bright Cloud faded and left Donnybrook and Lord Clifden in the lead. The Cloud was in third place until the six-furlong pole, where he swerved and brought down Saccharometer. The incident also caused King of the Vale to unseat his rider and almost brought down Fantastic. As the horses rounded Tattenham Corner, Lord Clifden had a slight lead over Donnybrook, with Tom Fool lying in third. As then entered the finishing straight Donnybrook and Lord Clifden's nearest challengers were Tom Fool and Macaroni. Inside the final furlong Macaroni closed down the leader and with Lord Clifden stumbling in the last stride got the better and won by a short-head. Rapid Rhone finished in third place, half a length behind Macaroni and Lord Clifden. After the race many people thought that the race was either a dead heat or that Lord Clifden had won. The following day Lord Clifden turned out for the Great Surrey Foal Stakes, where his only rival was the French horse Jarnicoton. Lord Clifden led until the final furlong, where he was challenged. The pair raced side by side, but Jarnicoton's stirrup broke and Lord Clifden won by a head.|$|E

500|$|One {{complaint}} {{many customers}} have with Schwa {{is that it}} is exceedingly difficult to get a reservation. GQ magazine describes a typical customer as having spent weeks trying to get past the always full answering machine that serves as Schwa's primary reservation system. [...] The restaurant attracts an estimated 60 requests for its 26 seats each day, and is notoriously slow at returning phone calls. One couple got so frustrated with the system that they drove down to the restaurant to make a reservation in person. Upon arrival, they were told they had to call it in. Despite their frustration, the couple kept trying and when <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> in they remarked, [...] "You know what? It was worth it." [...] According to Carlson, most customers' first comment when they arrive at Schwa is either to complain about how difficult it was to get a reservation or to ask for another one. Schwa will not seat customers without a reservation, even if the restaurant is empty.|$|E
500|$|Accordingly, one of {{the main}} events was the Intercontinental Championship match between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, brothers-in-law in real life as Smith was married to Diana Hart, Bret's sister. On {{television}} broadcasts leading up to SummerSlam, interviews with Diana and her mother Helen portrayed the family as being torn apart by the upcoming match. Bruce Hart publicly supported Smith, while Owen Hart sided with his brother Bret. Diana stated that she did not know who she wanted to win the match, as she had close ties to both men. She ultimately stated that she simply hoped that neither wrestler would get hurt. Prior to the match, Smith was hospitalized with a legitimate staph infection in his knee, which he suffered during a match with Mike Sharpe on July 20 in Worcester, Massachusetts (the fact was revealed by his wife Diana years later on the Hart & Soul documentary); despite the concerns about his health, he decided to wrestle the match as planned. Bret Hart later revealed {{in an interview that he}} doubted the legitimacy of the injury and that he believed Davey Boy in fact had a drug problem and that in the two months prior to their match he could not contact him to sort out what they were going to do at Wembley, and when <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> to the stadium Smith revealed that he had not slept in over 48 hours. However, Hart also stated that as bad as Smith's personal issues were, he [...] "sucked it up" [...] and hit every spot in the match.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is because}} of all the above, that the Universities of Salamanca and Alcalá were led to fight against the {{creation}} of a new university in Madrid, where the school was, from which most of their students came.

2500|$|Even {{though most}} of their {{original}} land was taken over, {{this was the first}} turning point for the Pomo people.

[...] From 1852-1878, many Pomo Indians tried to rekindle their cultures and find peace to what had happened to them. Many people let this time be a learning and spiritual time, where they could have visions and see what the future would have in store. It was a time to build, a time to connect, a time of hope, and a time of change.|$|E
2500|$|Putting {{the whole}} ordeal behind them, Dream Theater once again entered BearTracks Studios {{to record their}} sixth studio album. Four years after they first petitioned EastWest {{to allow them to}} release a double album, <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> their chance with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. The first disc {{consisted}} of five tracks of 7–13 minutes in length, and the second disc was devoted entirely to the 42-minute title track, which remains to date the longest song Dream Theater has written. Many of the song's melodies and musical themes originated in an instrumental piece, written by Rudess, which would eventually become the song's [...] "Overture". Those themes were then expanded {{by the rest of the}} band to form individual chapters in a complete story.|$|E
2500|$|The Grim Game was Houdini's first {{full-length}} {{movie and}} is {{reputed to be}} his best. Because of the flammable nature of nitrate film and the inherent chemical instability of the acetate [...] "safety" [...] film that supplanted it, only 10 percent of old silent movies exist. Film historians considered the film lost. One copy did exist hidden {{in the collection of}} a private collector only known to a tiny group of magicians that saw it. Dick Brookz and Dorothy Dietrich of The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania had seen it twice on the invitation of the collector. After many years of trying, <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> him to agree to sell the film to Turner Classic Movies who restored the complete 71-minute film. The film, not seen by the general public for 96 years was shown by TCM on March 29, 2015, as a highlight of their yearly 4-day festival in Hollywood.|$|E
50|$|The next weekend, Hero and Necro again {{caused a}} {{disruption}} during the ROH shows. They attacked ROH Commissioner Jim Cornette {{as well as}} Whitmer and Pearce. <b>They</b> also <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> the attention of Joe, who personally declared war on CZW. On April 22, ROH's 100th show in Philadelphia featured a battle between Team ROH (Joe, Whitmer and Pearce) and Team CZW (Hero, Necro and Super Dragon). The team of Hero, Necro Butcher, and Super Dragon {{went on to win}} the ROH vs. CZW main event, after Castagnoli revealed his allegiance to Hero and CZW by first attacking Samoa Joe and then helping Hero pin Pearce for the win. On July 15 at ROH's Death Before Dishonor IV Hero led Team CZW into the Cage of Death for a five-on-five main event against Team ROH. Hero had teased that he had made a deal with a mystery fifth man, who turned out to be Hero's hated rival Eddie Kingston. Although ROH's surprise fifth man Bryan Danielson turned on Samoa Joe in an effort to incapacitate Joe before their title match, Team ROH finally put CZW away when Homicide arrived in the Cage and pinned Nate Webb for the win. The following day on their Newswire, ROH stated that the war with CZW was over, thanks to Homicide.|$|R
50|$|Ohio State couldn’t {{move the}} ball on its first carry of the second half, and Michigan’s ensuing {{possession}} ended in a failed 53-yard field goal attempt by Greg Willner.

The Wolverines <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> the best of the exhausted OSU defense in the fourth quarter, as Leach led Michigan back down the field on a drive capped by his own score on a 3-yard option run. The Bob Wood extra point put Michigan up 14-7. Ohio State desperately needed a first down, and after almost coughing up the ball again, <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> their first one since the second quarter. That seemed to motivate the scarlet-and-gray offense, and <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> began moving the ball toward the Michigan goal line. With 3:30 left in the game, Greene handed off to Johnson on a fourth-and-goal, and the game was tied up 14-14.|$|R

Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> reconcile.|$|R
2500|$|When <b>they</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> to bat on {{the third}} day England quickly {{collapsed}} to 25/4, but then debutant Colin Cowdrey made 40, adding 72 for the 5th wicket with Trevor Bailey who ground out 88 over 283 minutes. With the [...] "Barnacle" [...] immobile at one end – he took 160 minutes to reach 38 – the Australian bowlers worked their way through the tail until Denis Compton, who had broken the metacarpal bone in his hand on the boundary fence, came at number 11. Before the match a local businessman had promised £100 to the first English batsman to hit a six. Realising that the innings was soon to close, the stonewaller extraordinaire Trevor Bailey hit Ian Johnson into the stands for the prize. The wickets were shared among the Australian bowlers: Ray Lindwall was the best with 3/27 and Ian Johnson took 3/46.|$|E
2500|$|Britain {{borrowed}} everywhere {{it could}} and made heavy purchases of munitions and supplies in India during the war. [...] Previously India owed Britain large sums; {{now it was}} reversed. Britain's sterling balances around the world amounted to £3.4 billion in 1945; [...] India's share was £1.3 billion (equivalent to $US 74 billion in 2016 dollars.) In this way the Raj treasury accumulated very large sterling reserves of British pounds that was owed to it by the British treasury. However, Britain treated this as a long-term loan with no interest and no specified repayment date. Just when {{the money would be}} made available by London was an issue, for the British treasury was nearly empty by 1945. [...] India's balances totalled to Rs. 17.24billion in March 1946; of that sum Rs. 15.12billion [...] was split between India and Pakistan when they became independent in August 1947. <b>They</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> the money and India spent all its share by 1957.|$|E
2500|$|On December 26, 1968, a {{commercial}} Pan American 707 landed at Elmendorf [...] AFB instead of Anchorage International Airport because of weather conditions. [...] Clearance was delayed {{several times to}} accommodate other traffic.

[...] The jet crashed just off the west end of the runway, killing all crew members. [...] Cargo consisting of mail and food packages was largely consumed by ground fire following impact.
