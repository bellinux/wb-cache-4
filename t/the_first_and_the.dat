5|$|An unknown {{librettist}} retained four {{of these}} seven combined stanzas, using <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two last unchanged as customary, and expanding the third by adding text for a recitative. He paraphrased the other stanzas for two arias and another recitative. Bach structured the cantata in six movements and scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of trumpet, oboe, strings and continuo. The first movement is a chorale fantasia dominated by the trumpet. In the unusual third movement, Bach has an alto and a tenor voice alternate for the recitative, while they sing the lines from the third hymn stanza in a duet. The fourth movement is a dramatic bass aria, accompanied by a restless continuo. Due to the compiled hymns, the melody of the closing two stanzas {{is different from the}} one used in movements 1 and 3.|$|E
5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> third division but lately, have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector is declining. Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E

5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid {{layer of the}} cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As {{an example of the}} wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E

5|$|Centralized {{buildings}} of circular or octagonal plan also became used for baptistries and reliquaries {{due to the}} suitability of those shapes for assembly around a single object. Baptisteries began {{to be built in}} the manner of domed mausolea during the 4th century in Italy. The octagonal Lateran Baptistery or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been <b>the</b> <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> style spread during the 5th century. The Church of the Holy Apostles, or Apostoleion, probably planned by Constantine but built by his successor Constantius in the new capital city of Constantinople, combined the congregational basilica with the centralized shrine. With a similar plan to that of the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, four naves projected from a central rotunda containing Constantine's tomb and spaces for the tombs of the twelve Apostles. Above the center may have been a clerestory with a wooden dome roofed with bronze sheeting and gold accents.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, Antoine Lavoisier {{published}} {{a list of}} 33 chemical elements, grouping them into gases, metals, nonmetals, and earths. Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme. In 1829, Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner observed {{that many of the}} elements could be grouped into triads based on their chemical properties. Lithium, sodium, and potassium, for example, were grouped together in a triad as soft, reactive metals. Döbereiner also observed that, when arranged by atomic weight, the second member of each triad was roughly the average of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> third; this became known as the Law of Triads. German chemist Leopold Gmelin worked with this system, and by 1843 he had identified ten triads, three groups of four, and one group of five. Jean-Baptiste Dumas published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals. Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements, they had yet to build one scheme that encompassed them all.|$|E
5|$|In October 1914, the 7th Division {{arrived in}} France, forming {{the basis of}} the British III Corps; the cavalry had grown into its own corps of three divisions. By December 1914, the BEF had expanded, fielding five army corps divided between <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Second Armies. As the Regular Army's {{strength}} declined, the numbers were made up— first by the Territorial Force, then by the volunteers of Field Marshal Kitchener's New Army. By the end of August 1914, he had raised six new divisions; by March 1915, the number of divisions had increased to 29. The Territorial Force was also expanded, raising second and third battalions and forming eight new divisions, which supplemented its peacetime strength of 14 divisions. The Third Army was formed in July 1915 and with the influx of troops from Kitchener's volunteers and further reorganisation, the Fourth Army and the Reserve Army, which became the Fifth Army were formed in 1916.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum is a {{chemical}} element with symbol La and atomic number 57. It is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metal that tarnishes rapidly {{when exposed to}} air and is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is the eponym of the lanthanide series, a group of 15 similar elements between lanthanum and lutetium in the periodic table, of which lanthanum is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prototype. It is also sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals and is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements. The usual oxidation state is +3. Lanthanum has no biological role in humans but is essential to some bacteria. It is not particularly toxic to humans but does show some antimicrobial activity.|$|E

5|$|The cantata is {{structured}} in seven movements, framed as the earlier chorale cantatas by a chorale fantasia and a chorale four-part setting, of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> twelfth stanza {{in the original}} words by the reformer Speratus, published in the First Lutheran hymnal. The theme is salvation from sin by God's grace alone. An anonymous librettist paraphrased the content of ten inner stanzas to alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for a chamber ensemble of four vocal parts, flauto traverso, oboe d'amore, strings and continuo. He gave all three recitatives to the bass, like a sermon interrupted in reflection by a tenor aria with solo violin and a duet of soprano and alto with the wind instruments.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of the name Belograd {{appeared}} on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal letter to Bulgarian ruler Boris I.

For about four centuries, the city remained a battleground between the Byzantine Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Bulgarian Empire. Basil II (976–1025) installed a garrison in Belgrade.
