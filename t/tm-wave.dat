40|$|Field {{enhancement}} {{effect of}} metal probe in evanescent field, induced {{by using a}} multi-layers structure for exciting surface plasmon resonance (SPR), is analyzed numerically by utilizing two-dimensional (2 D) <b>TM-wave</b> finite difference time-domain (FDTD) method. In this letter, we used a fundamental mode Gaussian beam to induce evanescent field, and calculated the electric intensity. The results show that compared with the nonmetal probe, the metal probe has a larger field enhancement effect, and its scattering wave induced by field enhancement has a bigger decay coefficient. The field enhancement effect should conclude that the metal probe has an important application in nanolithography...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is the {{investigation}} of decay processes influence on non-linear stage of reactive instability development, beam-plasma instability in Raman mode of operation as an example. Shortened equations of motion of the weakly bounded waves have been obtained for the first time, one of which is instable with respect to the decay for its half subharmonic. Analytical solution has been received for the limiting case of waves equilibrium determination. Theoretical analysis determines the possibility of control over instability saturation level. The obtained characteristic decay lengths of axially-symmetrical <b>TM-wave</b> decay for its half harmonic in continuous tubular plasma determines optimal length of transformation of powerful axially-symmetrical wave in the waveguideAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{solve a problem}} of the {{appropriate}} and efficient truncation of the computational domain (a principal problem of computational electrodynamics) in so-called open problems (the problems where the computational domain is infinite along one or more spatial coordinates) for the case of TE- and <b>TM-waves</b> in axially-symmetrical open compact resonators with waveguide feed lines. Also, {{a number of questions}} have been considered that occur when solving far-field problems and problems involving extended sources or sources located in the far-zone. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic field {{propagation}} {{through a}} transition layer between the positive-index and negative-index materials with linearly changing dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability was investigated. It is shown that at oblique incidence, {{the components of}} both TE- and <b>TM-waves</b> exhibit singular behavior {{in the vicinity of}} the point where both dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability are equal to zero. In this case, finite dissipation of electromagnetic field energy takes place even at infinitesimally small values of losses. These results are applicable to a broader class of inhomogeneous metamaterials and may provide a new platform for the realization of low intensity nonlinear optics in metamaterials.

40|$|The 10 m long ALS curved sector tank 1 s {{formed from}} two shells {{out of which}} the beam chamber is machined. Vacuum pumping and photon stops are located in an {{antechamber}} connected to the beam tube through a lcm slot. In order {{to determine whether the}} beam is signifi-cantly coupled to the antechamber, measurements of longitudinal beam impedance were performed up to 26 GHz, well above the cutoff frequency of the beam pipe. Two different schemes were used: In the first, the wire method was adapted for above cutoff; in the second, rhe impedance was detected from the response to <b>TM-waves</b> propagated in the aperture without a wire. Temperature at various locations in the setupwas recorded for laterphase corrections. Antennas were placed in the antechamber ro detect radiated power or possible resonances A reference measurement was made with the slot sealed by a flexible gasket of knitted wire The seal was then removed and the response with antechamber recorded. The setup was checked by inserting known obstacles. Both measurement methods provided equally low numbers with Z/n < 0. 001 Ohm over the whole frequency range No reson,ancez attributable to the antechamber were observe...|$|R
