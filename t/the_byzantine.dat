5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Byzantine</b> success {{had another}} corollary: {{deliverance}} from constant Arab {{pressure on the}} eastern frontier allowed <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> government to concentrate on affairs in Europe, and, in particular, neighboring Bulgaria. The Bulgarians were pressured into accepting <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> form of Christianity, thus beginning this nation's absorption into <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> cultural sphere.|$|E
5|$|But on {{the wings}} the {{situation}} was different. Qanatir, commanding <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> left flank which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim base camp.|$|E
5|$|Deprived of {{his left}} wing (still {{in pursuit of the}} Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> centre. They first routed <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> skirmishers before {{breaking}} into small detachments and smashing into various points of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> line. This charge broke <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E

The inclusion of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> is particularly important because it was <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> who initially requested a Crusade to the holy land. <b>The</b> <b>Byzantines</b> had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuk Turks through warfare, and they were eager to seek western military support to reclaim that territory.|$|R
50|$|Maurice {{defeated}} the Persians at Dara in 586 and recaptured the fortress, but the Persians under Khosrau II defeated <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> in 604. This time Persians destroyed the city, but <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> later rebuilt it in 628. In 639 the Muslim Arabs captured it, and it remained {{in their hands}} until 942 when it was sacked by <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines.</b> It was sacked again by John I Tzimiskes in 958, but <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> never recaptured it.|$|R
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} Byzantine Italy and Saracen Sicily, <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> emperor, Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071–1078), betrothed {{his son to}} Robert Guiscard's daughter. When Michael was deposed, Robert took this {{as an excuse to}} invade <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire in 1081. His army laid siege to Dyrrhachium, but his fleet was {{defeated}} by the Venetians. On October 18, the Normans engaged a Byzantine army under Alexios I Komnenos outside Dyrrhachium. The battle began with <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> right wing routing the Norman left wing, which broke and fled. Varangian mercenaries joined in the pursuit of the fleeing Normans, but became separated from the main force and were massacred. Norman knights in the centre attacked <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> centre and routed it, causing the bulk of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> army to rout.|$|E
5|$|In 1204, Constantinople, {{the capital}} city of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire was taken by the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade and the Republic of Venice. This led to the {{collapse}} of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire and the establishment of the Latin Empire.|$|E
5|$|In Aland's Profile, Kurt and Barbara Aland {{placed the}} codex's Gospels in Category III, meaning it has {{historical}} importance, with {{the profile of}} 1191, 802, 601/2, 69s.

5|$|Phase 2: Khalid divided his mobile guard {{into two}} {{divisions}} and attacked the flanks of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> left center, while the infantry of the Muslim right center attacked from front. Under this three-pronged flanking manoeuvre, the Byzantines fell back. Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing renewed its offense with its infantry attacking {{from the front}} and the cavalry reserve attacking the northern flank of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> left wing. As <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> left center retreated under three-pronged attacks of Khalid, <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> left wing, having been exposed at its southern flank, also fell back.|$|E

5|$|The social {{structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Greeks was primarily supported by a rural, agrarian base that consisted of the peasantry, and {{a small fraction of}} the poor. These peasants lived within three kinds of settlements: the chorion or village, the agridion or hamlet, and the proasteion or estate. Many civil disturbances that occurred during the time of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire were attributed to political factions within the Empire rather than to this large popular base. Soldiers among <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Greeks were at first conscripted amongst the rural peasants and trained on an annual basis. As <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire entered the 11th century, more of the soldiers within the army were either professional men-at-arms or mercenaries.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Roman Empire, <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire was the sole {{successor}} of the Roman Empire. Charlemagne's imperial coronation in 800 put strain on Western relations with <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire ruled from Constantinople. When Otto I became emperor in February 962, there was contention between him and <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire, and this issue revived in 967 between Otto and Nikephoros II Phokas over the dominion of Italy. On 25 December 967, Pope John XIII anointed Otto II as Otto I's co-emperor.|$|E
5|$|Alice's sister, Melisende, Fulk's wife, persuaded Fulk {{to allow}} Alice {{to return to}} Antioch in 1135. Alice wanted to tighten the {{relationship}} of the principality and <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire; therefore, she offered Constance's hand to Manuel, a son of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Emperor, John II Komnenos. To prevent <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> marriage, Fulk sent his envoy France to Raymond of Poitiers to urge him to come to Antioch, which he did, traveling in disguise, because RogerII of Sicily wanted to capture him in southern Italy.|$|E

5|$|All three named commanders were slain {{during the}} battle, and Khalid was {{selected}} as the commander. He was able to maintain his heavily outnumbered army of 3,000 men against an army of 10,000 of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire and Ghassanid Arabs in what would be known as the Battle of Mu'tah. Khalid assumed command of the Muslim army at the crucial moment, and defeated <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> forces even when another 10,000 soldiers had arrived as reinforcements for the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|Andronicus' {{rule was}} marked by {{incompetence}} and short-sighted decisions {{that in the long}} run would damage <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire beyond repair. He began to debase <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> hyperpyron, resulting in a reduction of the value of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> economy; taxes were decreased for the Powerful, i.e. landed aristocracy and instead placed upon the Knight-class Pronoia. To popularize his rule he repudiated the union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches decreed by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.|$|E

2500|$|The Byzantine–Bulgarian wars [...] were {{a series}} of {{conflicts}} fought between <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> and Bulgarians which began when the Bulgars first settled in the Balkan peninsula in the 5th century, and intensified with {{the expansion of the}} Bulgarian Empire to the southwest after 680 AD. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Byzantines</b> and Bulgarians continued to clash over the next century with variable success, until the Bulgarians, led by Krum, inflicted {{a series of}} crushing defeats on <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines.</b> [...] After Krum died in 814, his son Omurtag negotiated a thirty-year peace treaty. In 893, during the next major war, Simeon I, the Bulgarian emperor, defeated <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> while attempting to form a large Eastern European Empire, but his efforts failed.|$|R
50|$|It is {{probable}} that captives from this disaster were among <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> ransomed in <b>the</b> prisoner exchange of February 884, while eighty years later, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas recovered the seven gold and silver crosses taken by Yazaman, when Tarsus fell to <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines.</b>|$|R
5|$|European music between 800 and 1100 {{became more}} sophisticated, more {{frequently}} requiring instruments capable of polyphony. The 9th-century Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh mentioned in his lexicographical discussion of music instruments that, in <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire, typical instruments included the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably {{a type of}} harp or lyre), salandj (probably a bagpipe) and the lyra. <b>The</b> <b>Byzantine</b> lyra, a bowed string instrument, is an ancestor of most European bowed instruments, including the violin.|$|E
5|$|Géza's and Solomon's {{relationship}} only {{began to}} worsen {{during the siege}} of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> fortress of Belgrade in 1071. Its commander preferred to surrender to Géza instead of the king and <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> envoys who arrived in the Hungarian camp {{after the fall of}} Belgrade only negotiated with Géza. The division of the booty also gave rise to a new conflict between Solomon and Géza. Although Géza accompanied the king on a new campaign against <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire in 1072, but his brother, Ladislaus stayed behind with half of the troops of their duchy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1340s {{relations}} with <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire temporarily deteriorated. Ivan Alexander demanded the extradition of his cousin Šišman, {{one of the}} sons of Michael Asen III, threatening <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> government with war. Ivan Alexander's show of force backfired, as the Byzantines managed to see through his intentions and sent against him the fleet of their ally, the Turkish emir of Smyrna Umur Beg. Landing in the Danube Delta, they pillaged the countryside and attacked nearby Bulgarian cities. Forced to restrain his demands, Ivan Alexander invaded <b>the</b> <b>Byzantine</b> Empire again {{at the end of}} 1341, claiming that he was summoned by the people of Adrianople. However, Ivan Alexander's troops were defeated twice by Turkish allies of the Byzantines near the city.|$|E
50|$|In late March 555, the {{supporters}} of Agila, in fear of <b>the</b> recent <b>Byzantine</b> successes, turned and assassinated him, making Athanagild {{the king of the}} Goths.

50|$|This {{position}} {{was to the}} advantage of the Muslims, as the Copts were the natives of the land of Egypt and both <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> and <b>the</b> Muslims were strangers. Though some Copts from personal considerations continued to support <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines,</b> <b>the</b> sympathies of the Copts were now, by and large, with the Muslims. The Copts were not supposed to fight against <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> on behalf of the Muslims, but they undertook to help the Muslims in the promotion of war effort and in the provision of stores, build roads and bridges for them, and provide them moral support.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} spring, {{however, the}} Arabs {{launched a new}} assault by sea and land, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> and their allies to evacuate Carthage. The Arabs slaughtered the civilians, totally destroyed the city and burned it to the ground, leaving the area desolate {{for the next two}} centuries. After the departure of the main force of <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> and their allies, another battle was fought near Utica and the Arabs were again victorious, forcing <b>the</b> <b>Byzantines</b> to leave that part of North Africa for good.|$|R
