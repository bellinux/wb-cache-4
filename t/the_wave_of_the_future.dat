25|$|Despite {{the seeming}} success, however, the Gimlet was already {{becoming}} obsolete; guided missiles were now {{considered to be}} <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Production of Gimlet was cancelled in early 1957, after production of 15,000 rockets; that October, the T-Gimlet version was cancelled as well. Although the missile age meant that Gimlet did not enter operational service, the production processes developed for the rocket would be modified and used {{in the production of}} the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile.|$|E
25|$|Ceres, as the Goddess who has {{control over}} nature's {{resources}} and cycles, may astrologically {{be considered the}} planet of the Environment. Returning to mythology, an early environmental villain is the figure of Erysichthon, the tearer up of the earth, who cut down trees in a grove sacred to Ceres-Demeter, {{for which he was}} punished by the goddess with fearful hunger. In this sense Ceres became an emerging archetype in the awareness of recent climate change, and is entering our collective consciousness as a {{need to take care of}} our natural and irreplaceable resources in the 21st century. Ceres represents a leap towards a future of ecological responsibility and knowledge. As an indicator for environmental or community activism, Ceres would represent for some astrologers <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E

He played with his rock band at the event. Upon his entrance, Charlie Cook of The Cook Political Report rated McCotter's chances of nomination as [...] "virtually impossible". CBS News and other outlets commented on McCotter's lack of name recognition and described him as a [...] "little-known" [...] candidate. Nevertheless, the Free Press noted he had about $480,000 available in his congressional account to transfer to his presidential campaign account.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy saw Brandt as <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> in West Germany and was hoping he would replace Konrad Adenauer as {{chancellor}} following elections later in the year. Kennedy made this preference clear by inviting Brandt, the West German opposition leader, to an official meeting at the White House a month before meeting with Adenauer, the country's leader. The diplomatic snub strained relations between Kennedy and Adenauer further during an especially tense time for Berlin. However, following {{the building of the}} Berlin Wall in August 1961, Brandt was disappointed and angry with Kennedy. Speaking in Berlin three days later, Brandt criticized Kennedy, asserting [...] "Berlin expects more than words. It expects political action." [...] He also wrote Kennedy a highly critical public letter in which he warned that the development was liable [...] "to arouse doubts about the ability of the three [...] Powers to react and their determination" [...] and he called the situation [...] "a state of accomplished extortion".|$|E
