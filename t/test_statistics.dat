The concept of power is useful in explaining the consequences of adjusting the significance level and is heavily used in sample size determination. The two methods remain philosophically distinct. They usually (but not always) produce the same mathematical answer. The preferred answer is context dependent. While the existing merger of Fisher and Neyman–Pearson theories has been heavily criticized, modifying the merger to achieve Bayesian goals has been considered.|$|E
25|$|For the {{important}} {{case in which}} the data are hypothesized to follow the normal distribution, depending {{on the nature of the}} test statistic and thus the underlying hypothesis of the test statistic, different null hypothesis tests have been developed. Some such tests are z-test for normal distribution, t-test for Student's t-distribution, f-test for f-distribution. When the data do not follow a normal distribution, it can still be possible to approximate the distribution of these <b>test</b> <b>statistics</b> by a normal distribution by invoking the central limit theorem for large samples, as in the case of Pearson's chi-squared test.|$|E

The exact finite-sample statistical procedure to test general linear restrictions of portfolio weights is obtained. The results are generalized to elliptically contoured distributions, which extends {{a number of}} financial theorems, to non-normal distributions. It is proved that the proposed global minimum variance portfolio weights estimator and <b>testing</b> <b>statistics</b> are financially and statistically interpreted for the heavy-tail distributions with tail index less than two.

25|$|In {{statistic}}s, the Durbin–Watson statistic is a {{test statistic}} used to detect the presence of autocorrelation (a relationship between values separated from each other by a given time lag) in the residuals (prediction errors) from a regression analysis. It is named after James Durbin and Geoffrey Watson. The small sample distribution of this ratio was derived by John von Neumann (von Neumann, 1941). Durbin and Watson (1950, 1951) applied this statistic to the residuals from least squares regressions, and developed bounds tests for the null hypothesis that the errors are serially uncorrelated against the alternative that they follow a first order autoregressive process. Later, John Denis Sargan and Alok Bhargava developed several von Neumann–Durbin–Watson type <b>test</b> <b>statistics</b> for the null hypothesis that the errors on a regression model follow a process with a unit root against the alternative hypothesis that the errors follow a stationary first order autoregression (Sargan and Bhargava, 1983). Note that the distribution of this test statistic {{does not depend on}} the estimated regression coefficients and the variance of the errors.|$|E

2500|$|A more {{rigorous}} treatment of testing the random walk null hypothesis for United States stock prices using one-sided optimal statistical tests {{is due to}} Alok Bhargava. It is important to separately test the random walk null hypothesis against stationary and explosive alternatives using two one-sided tests. In contrast, two-sided asymptotic tests such as those employed by Lo and MacKinlay can lead to misleading conclusions because the process could be stationary or explosive under the alternative hypothesis.

If the game is not completed within the allotted time then it is drawn, regardless of who has scored the most runs when time expires.
