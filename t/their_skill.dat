5|$|Gruban {{successfully}} appealed {{against his}} internment, {{and as soon}} as he was freed brought Booth to court. The case was so popular that the involved barristers found it physically difficult to get into the court each day due to the size of the crowds gathered outside. Although the barristers on both sides were noted for <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty. This was one of the first noted cases of Patrick Hastings, and his victory in it led to him applying to become a King's Counsel.|$|E
5|$|Musical contest, {{particularly}} among the Maguindanao, have become a unique feature of these kulintang performances. They occur at almost all the formal occasions mentioned above, particularly weddings. What has made the Maguindanao {{stand out from the}} other groups is that they practice solo gong contest – with individual players showcasing <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> on the various ensemble instruments – the agung, gandingan and the kulintang – as opposed to only group contest, where performers from one town and another town are pitted against each other.|$|E

5|$|The first St. John's dog {{was said}} to be brought to England in or around 1820, but the breed's {{reputation}} had already spread to England; there is a story that the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury saw a St. John's dog on a fishing boat and immediately made arrangements with traders to have some of these dogs imported to England. These ancestors of the first labradors so impressed the Earl with <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> and ability for retrieving anything within the water and on shore that he devoted his entire kennel to developing and stabilising the breed.|$|E
5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved <b>their</b> <b>skill.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

5|$|The protagonist wields four {{different}} styles of weapons throughout the game: sword, spear, axe, and bazooka. Almost all swords, axes, and spears have four versions, and repeated use of them can increase <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> levels {{to a maximum of}} three, unlocking a new charged attack with each level. The range and power of each type of weapon increased the more it is used; for instance, spears at a high enough level may be thrown at an enemy across the screen, while the swords and axes can cut swathes of destruction around the boy's vicinity. With the exception of the Bone Crusher, all swords, axes, and spears can cut through vegetation; some weapons are required to break rocks and other barriers.|$|E
5|$|When using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection {{for online}} multiplayer, the player can choose between a match with a random {{opponent}} {{from around the}} world, or a match with someone that the player has exchanged friend codes with. Worldwide matches are limited to two players, with the weather conditions being randomly generated and a map randomly chosen from a set list. Worldwide match players can choose if they want an opponent close to <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> level or to play against an opponent regardless of skill level. When playing with a friend, more options are opened up to allow greater customization of the match, such as the type of weather and {{the duration of the}} match. Voice chat is only supported when playing with a friend, and is unavailable during worldwide online play. However, Caulder can not be used in ONLINE multiplayer due to his extreme advantages.|$|E
5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E

5|$|During the 5th and 6th century many Sogdians took up {{residence}} in the Hexi Corridor where they retained autonomy in terms of governance and had a designated official administrator known as a sabao, which suggests their importance to the socioeconomic structure of China. The Sogdian influence on trade in China is also made apparent by a Chinese document which lists taxes paid on caravan trade in the Turpan region and shows that twenty-nine out of the thirty-five commercial transactions involved Sogdian merchants, and in thirteen of those cases both the buyer and the seller were Sogdian. Trade goods brought to China included grapes, alfalfa, and Sassanian silverware, as well as glass containers, Mediterranean coral, brass Buddhist images, Roman wool cloth, and Baltic amber. These were exchanged for Chinese paper, copper, and silk. In the 7th century the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang noted with approval that Sogdian boys were taught {{to read and write}} at the age of five, though <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> was turned to trade, disappointing the scholarly Xuanzang. He also recorded the Sogdians working in other capacities such as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers.|$|E
5|$|The Highland peoples were {{renowned for}} <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> in headhunting, {{which was a}} symbol of bravery and valor. Almost every people group except the Yami (Tao) practiced headhunting. Once the victims had been {{dispatched}} the heads were taken then boiled and left to dry, often hanging from trees or shelves constructed for the purpose. A party returning with a head was cause for celebration, as it was believed to bring good luck. The Bunun people would often take prisoners and inscribe prayers or messages to their dead on arrows, then shoot their prisoner with the hope their prayers would be carried to the dead. Taiwanese Hoklo Han settlers and Japanese were often the victims of headhunting raids as they were considered by the aborigines to be liars and enemies. A headhunting raid would often strike at workers in the fields, or set a dwelling alight and then decapitate the inhabitants as they fled the burning structure. It was also customary to later raise the victim's surviving children as full members of the community. Often the heads themselves were ceremonially 'invited' to join the community as members, where they were supposed to watch over the community and keep them safe. The indigenous inhabitants of Taiwan accepted the convention and practice of headhunting as one of the calculated risks of community life. The last groups to practice headhunting were the Paiwan, Bunun, and Atayal groups. Japanese rule ended the practice by 1930, but some elder Taiwanese could recall the practice as late as 2003.|$|E

25|$|In Season 2, skill rankings were {{assigned}} {{on a scale}} of 1 to 5000; a player was then subsequently assigned one of seven tiers tied to the skill ranking: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster. A player could enter a new tier by increasing <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> ranking. For all tiers up through Diamond, the player could never lose that tier ranking even if <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> dropped below the tier's threshold. Master and Grandmaster tiers required the player to continue to play; losing too many matches or not playing {{over a period of time}} could cause the player to fall out of that tier. End of season rewards were based on these tier rankings. Blizzard found that the method of bringing forward Season 1 skill rankings to Season 2 caused too many players of lower skill rank to be filtered into the Gold and Platinum tiers. This caused a wide distribution of player skills within these rank tiers and also caused players that started in Gold or Platinum tiers to have <b>their</b> <b>skill</b> rank drop significantly despite having even win-loss records.|$|E
