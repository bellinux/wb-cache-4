50|$|Initially, {{embroidery}} {{was primarily}} or even almost exclusively women's work, this changed abruptly {{with the introduction}} of embroidery machines. The work on the machine was now exclusively men's work, the woman was, however, still required as a helper - she took care of the replacement of broken needles and <b>the</b> <b>threading,</b> if <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> had ended (<b>the</b> <b>threads</b> in a hand-embroidery machine are only about one meter long, and it has hundreds of needless).|$|R
5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, the threads of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked to identify <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged {{and free of}} cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{changes in}} the liquid in the cnida make it a much more {{concentrated}} solution, so that osmotic pressure forces water in very rapidly to dilute it.

40|$|Most {{distributed}} {{object-oriented programming}} languages typically support a medium-grain parallel programming style for a virtual machine {{composed of a}} network of workstations.

Interactions between <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> of computations are best supported by explicit programming abstractions. We present a distributed object-oriented programming language called Pragati, and its support for interaction paradigms in multi-threaded computations via a number of examples. We observe that the programming abstractions of Pragati help capture a wide range of interaction behaviour between <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> of distributed application...|$|R
5|$|Eugenides {{and several}} critics {{compared}} Cal's condition to mythical creatures {{described by the}} ancient Greeks. The author alluded his protagonist's nature and heritage to the Minotaur, the half-man and half-bull creature. Cal's father is conceived after his grandparents' attendance of a theatric play entitled The Minotaur. The puzzle of Cal's genetic identity is akin to the creature's labyrinth, and <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> that leads out of the maze is held here by his paternal grandmother, a former silk farmer. Frances Bartkowski, a scholar of English, named Callie in her puberty as a chimera. The mythical monster is an analogy for a complex personality, a mixture of body parts from various animals that each represents a human aspect or characteristic. Similarly, adolescent Callie is an amalgamation of her genes, neither male nor female, neither adult nor child, and yet all {{of them at the}} same time.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Brinkley {{left his}} family to try to regain <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> of his education, this time in St. Louis, Missouri. He was unable to pay Bennett Medical College the tuition he owed them, so they refused to forward his {{scholastic}} records {{to any of the}} medical schools that Brinkley had approached. Instead, Brinkley bought a certificate from a shady diploma mill known as the Kansas City Eclectic Medical University and returned home. On February 11, 1913, his daughter Naomi Beryl Brinkley was born. The family of five immediately moved to New York City, and shortly thereafter to Chicago. When Brinkley refused to give up his goal of becoming a doctor, Sally Brinkley left him one final time, taking the three girls home to North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Ultimate X match pitting {{the teams}} of Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) against Jay Lethal and The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) (MCMG) was another {{featured}} match on the card. This match {{was the result}} of Team 3D's feud with the TNA X Division. In October 2007, Team 3D began a storyline in which they were trying to eliminate the X Division. MCMG became their rivals in <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> with MCMG defeating Team 3D at Genesis. TNA X Division Champion Lethal later joined MCMG in the fight; around the same time, Devine turned on the division and joined Team 3D. The teams then fought in a Six Man Tag Team Tables match at Turning Point, which Devine and Team 3D won. The two teams fought again on the December 6, 2007 episode of Impact! in a Six Man Tag Team Ladder match, which Devine and Team 3D won. On the December 20, 2007 episode of Impact!, Lethal and MCMG defeated Devine and Team 3D in a Double North Pole match to determine the stipulation to their match at Final Resolution; choosing an Ultimate X match over a Plate glass Tables match. On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked and injured MCMG in the storyline by beating their hands with kendo sticks.|$|E
5000|$|Weaving {{is done by}} {{intersecting}} <b>the</b> longitudinal <b>threads,</b> <b>the</b> warp, i.e. [...] "that {{which is}} thrown across", with <b>the</b> transverse <b>threads,</b> <b>the</b> weft, i.e. [...] "that which is woven".|$|R
50|$|The major {{diameter}} of external threads is normally {{smaller than the}} {{major diameter}} of <b>the</b> internal <b>threads,</b> if <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> are designed to fit together.

5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the region}} in and around Chadderton was {{dominated}} by dispersed agricultural settlements. During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, particularly fustian and silk weaving. A fulling mill at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era, and during the Early Modern period the weavers of Chadderton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776. The damp climate below the South Pennines provided ideal conditions for textile production {{to be carried out}} without <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for industrial-scale manufacture of yarn and fabric for the global market. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting cotton spinning in the factory system, which became the dominant source of employment in the locality. The construction of multi-storey steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and cultural transformation in the region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.|$|E
25|$|Racks of bobbins {{are set up}} to hold <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> {{while it}} is rolled onto the warp bar of a loom. Because <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> is fine, often three of these would be {{combined}} to get the desired thread count.|$|E
25|$|Piecing {{involved}} repairing sporadic yarn breakages. At the rollers, {{the broken}} yarn would be {{caught on the}} underclearer (or fluker rod on Bolton mules), while at the spindle it would knot itself into a whorl on the spindle tip. If the break happened on the winding stroke the spindle {{might have to be}} stopped while <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> was found. The number of yarn breakages was dependent {{on the quality of the}} roving, and quality cotton led to fewer breakages. Typical 1,200 spindle mules of the 1920s would experience 5 to 6 breakages a minute. The two piecers would thus need to repair <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> within 15 to 20 seconds while the mule was in motion but once they had <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> it took under three seconds. The repair actually involved a slight rolling of the forefinger against the thumb.|$|E
50|$|The {{two halves}} of the nut have {{chamfered}} ends (60° to axis), which helps <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> to find engagement during the closing action. Usually the screw and nut are also oiled for lubrication. Such provisions prolong the service life of <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> by minimizing wear.|$|R
50|$|When weaving on a loom, {{the beads}} {{are locked in}} between <b>the</b> warp <b>threads</b> by <b>the</b> weft <b>threads.</b> <b>The</b> most common bead weaving {{technique}} requires two passes of <b>the</b> weft <b>thread.</b> First, an entire row of beads is strung on <b>the</b> weft <b>thread.</b> Then <b>the</b> beads are pressed in between <b>the</b> warp <b>threads.</b> <b>The</b> needle is passed back through the beads above <b>the</b> warp <b>threads</b> to lock <b>the</b> beads into place. Heddle looms were popular {{near the beginning of}} the 20th century. They allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. There are still a few Heddle Bead Looms being manufactured today. The most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off <b>the</b> warp <b>threads.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{handloom}} is {{a simple}} machine used for weaving. In a wooden vertical-shaft looms, the heddles are fixed {{in place in the}} shaft. <b>The</b> warp <b>threads</b> pass alternately through a heddle, and through a space between the heddles (the shed), so that raising the shaft raises half <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> (those passing through the heddles), and lowering the shaft lowers <b>the</b> same <b>threads</b> — <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> passing through <b>the</b> spaces between the heddles remain in place. This was a great discovery in the 13th century.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> ISO <b>threading</b> for freewheels (Single or Multiple Speed) is {{the same}} as for track/fixed cogs. A {{standard}} single speed BMX style freewheel can be used on <b>the</b> track <b>threads</b> <b>the</b> hub. Because of the stepped down lock ring threads, not as many <b>threads</b> of <b>the</b> freewheel engage <b>the</b> hub <b>threads</b> as they would if it were threaded to a freewheel threads, however, this is not a problem since the same number of threads are sufficient to secure a track cog. The force applied to a freewheel {{is the same}} as that applied to a fixed cog of the same size, so <b>the</b> missing <b>threads</b> cause no durability issue. Also, there is never any reverse torque on <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> with a freewheel, so a freewheel actually puts less strain on <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> than a fixed cog does.|$|R
50|$|The {{acorn nut}} {{is a type}} of {{fastener}} which gets its name from its shape. Acorn nut is its common name and it is also called a crown hex nut, blind nut, cap nut or domed cap nut. It is a nut that has a domed top to cover <b>the</b> <b>threads.</b> This is to prevent contact with <b>the</b> external <b>thread</b> to protect <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> or protect other things <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> would rub against. In addition the dome gives a more finished appearance. It is usually made of brass, steel, stainless steel (low carbon content) or nylon. It can also be chrome plated and given a mirror finish.|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{are that}} most {{are not very}} efficient. Due to the low efficiency they cannot be used in continuous power transmission applications. They also have {{a high degree of}} friction on <b>the</b> <b>threads,</b> which can wear <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> out quickly. For square <b>threads,</b> <b>the</b> nut must be replaced; for trapezoidal threads, a split nut may be used to compensate for the wear.|$|R
