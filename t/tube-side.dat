Meanwhile, the tube vibration occurs because of the periodic alternating force. It is verified that this vibration is beneficial to heat transfer [18 – 20]. In this paper, the flow-induced vibration by shell-side is studied because the effect of <b>tube-side</b> on the vibration of planar elastic tube bundle can be ignored [21].|$|E
40|$|In a {{time that}} crude oil prices are {{constantly}} higher than US $ 60 per barrel, low fouling heat exchangers can reduce total fouling cost in all crude oil preheat trains {{in the world with}} a throughput of 74 Mn bpd by 90 %.

Besides this saving on fouling cost, substantial additional savings can be realized on energy by a more ‘energy efficient’ design of the crude oil preheat train. The advantages of the low fouling exchanger have been achieved by novel, although already proven, heat transfer mechanisms for both the <b>tube-side</b> and the shell-side of the exchanger.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} various circulating water flow rate assumptions on the results from analyzing the performance impact of tube plugging in a condenser. The <b>tube-side</b> water’s flow rate has a strong influence in the results of condenser calculations. Affecting flow rate is the pressure drop of the circulating water. This paper advocates accounting for flow rate variations. The equations to account for <b>tube-side</b> pressure drops in the circulating water system are presented, as foundation for this accounting. The purposes of the paper are to present the development of key equations, to demonstrate application of the method of analysis, and to support the assertion that circulating water flow assumptions (as tube plugging varies) are important. The dependence of flow on tube plugging is calculated by accounting for the hydraulic balance between the <b>tube-side</b> circuit’s pressure drop and the pressure head provided by the circulating water pump. Of principal interest is the condenser’s shell side pressure. Comparisons of condenser performance are shown for several different assumptions about flow rate. Example plots are used to illustrate the effects of alternative modeling assumptions. Two models are used. The first is a submodel of a condenser and circulating water pump, along with supply and receiver reservoirs and associated piping. The second is a fossil steam turbine Rankine cycle that includes a condenser and circulating water pump. The method of calculation of the condenser’s shell-side equilibrium pressure closely follows the standard published by the Heat Exchange Institute.

When using expensive but high efficient biocatalysts their immobilization is necessary to reach long using times of the enzymes. Different kinds of immobilization are known.

In this case the substrate flow continuously through the <b>tube-side</b> of the capillary membranes of the membrane reactor and the cut-off of the membrane is choosen so that the enzyme is immobilized in the extracapillary volume of the reactor. The substrate diffuses through the membrane into the enzyme solution caused by the driving concentration difference which is always guaranteed by the enzymatically catalyzed reaction. The products diffuses back into the <b>tube-side</b> of the capillary membrane. So, a simple continuous process is realized by equally favourable relation between membrane area and reactor volume.

40|$|Pervaporation with {{hydrophobic}} membranes {{has been}} widely recognised as a possible process to recover organic compounds from wasterwater. Compared to vacuum pervaporation, on which many researchers have focused, sweep gas pervaporation has received little attention. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse opportunities for integrating and optimising both process layouts for the treatment of wastewater. The focus was on hollow fibre modules. Two module configurations of hollow fibre modules were considered: (1) shell-side and (2) <b>tube-side</b> feed flow. An advanced simulation program based on a phenomenological/semi-empirical model was used. The influence of (1) process parameters such as permeate pressure and the size of the sweep stream per module, and of (2) module design parameters such as void fraction or module configuration was determined for two model substances pyridine and phenol. Based on the simulations, guidelines for the optimisation of pervaporation are presented. These include the observation that for vacuum pervaporation shell-side feed flow is superior, whilst for sweep gas pervaporation <b>tube-side</b> feed flow should be selected. In the former case and for a given feed rate per module, the void fraction within the module should be selected as low as possible to reduce the effect of concentration polarisation. This approach is, however, limited by the pressure resistance of packed fibres causing an increasing pressure gradient on the feed side. For hydrophobic pervaporation of wastewater, sweep gas pervaporation should be combined with a moderate vacuum (of around 0. 1 bar) to improve the pervaporation performance; the performance at atmospheric pressure for the conditions selected leads to excessive membrane areas. Similar to vacuum pervaporation the void fraction should be selected as high as possible for <b>tube-side</b> feed flow, and as low as possible for shell-side feed flow...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTransformation of the <b>tube-side</b> mass {{transfer}} coefficient derived in hollow fibre membrane contactors (HFMC) of different characteristic length scales (equivalent diameter and fibre length) {{has been studied}} when operated in the low Graetz range (Gz< 10). Within the low Gz range, {{mass transfer}} is generally described by the Graetz problem (Sh= 3. 67) which assumes that the concentration profile comprises a constant shape over the fibre radius. In this study, it is experimentally evidenced that this assumption over predicts mass transfer within the low Graetz range. Furthermore, within the low Gz range (below 2), a proportional relationship between the experimentally determined mass transfer coefficient (Kov) and the Graetz number has been identified. For Gz numbers below 2, the experimental Sh number approached unity, which suggests that mass transfer is strongly dependent upon diffusion. However, within this diffusion controlled region of mass transfer, <b>tube-side</b> fluid velocity remained important. For Gz numbers above 2, Sh could be satisfactorily described by extension to the Lévêque solution, which can be ascribed to the constrained growth of the concentration boundary layer adjacent to the fibre wall. Importantly this study demonstrates that whilst mass transfer in the low Graetz range does not explicitly conform to either the Graetz problem or classical Lévêque solution, {{it is possible to}} transform the experimentally derived overall mass transfer coefficient (Kov) between characteristic length scales (dh and L). This was corroborated by comparison of the empirical relationship determined in this study (Sh= 0. 36 Gz) with previously published studies operated in the low Gz range. This analysis provides important insight for process design when slow <b>tube-side</b> flows, or low Schmidt numbers (coincident with gases) constrain operation of hollow fibre membrane contactors to the low Gz range...|$|E

40|$|Effect of Mixed Working Fluid Composition on Binary Cycle Condenser Heat Transfer Coefficients Dan Wendt, Greg Mines Idaho National Laboratory The use {{of mixed}} working fluids in binary power plants can provide {{significant}} increases in plant performance, provided the heat exchangers are designed {{to take advantage of}} these fluids non-isothermal phase changes. In the 1980 's testing was conducted at DOE's Heat Cycle Research Facility (HCRF) where mixtures of different compositions were vaporized at supercritical pressures and then condensed. This testing had focused on using the data collected to verify that Heat Transfer Research Incorporated (HTRI) codes were suitable for the design of heat exchangers that could be used with mixtures. The HCRF data includes mixture compositions varying from 0 % to 40 % isopentane and condenser tube orientations of 15 {sup o}, 60 {sup o}, and 90 {sup o} from horizontal. Testing was performed over a range of working fluid and cooling fluid conditions. Though the condenser used in this testing was water cooled, the working fluid condensation occurred on the <b>tube-side</b> of the heat exchanger. This <b>tube-side</b> condensation is analogous to that in an air-cooled condenser. <b>Tube-side</b> condensing heat transfer coefficient information gleaned from the HCRF testing is used in this study to assess the suitability of air-cooled condenser designs for use with mixtures. Results of an air-cooled binary plant process model performed with Aspen Plus indicate that that the optimal mixture composition (producing the maximum net power for the scenario considered) is within the range of compositions for which data exist. The HCRF data is used {{to assess the impact of}} composition, tube orientation, and process parameters on the condensing heat transfer coefficients. The sensitivity of the condensing coefficients to these factors is evaluated and the suitability of air-cooled condenser designs with mixtures is assessed.

The device consisted of ion exchange beads on the shell side of a hollow fiber ultrafiltration module. Loading of proteins on the stationary phase on the shell side was carried out for a period of 5 - 20 min from the permeate on the shell side produced from <b>tube-side</b> feed in ultrafiltration.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{model for a}} condenser with a wetted surface is developed by applying the governing conservations and rate equations and invoking the heat and mass transfer analogy. The heat exchanger is discretized in both the air-flow and refrigerant-flow directions for a cross-flow configuration. Axial conduction along the tube walls is neglected and uniform distribution of water is assumed at the heat exchanger front fin surface. Any water not evaporated in a finite control volume is assumed to flow into the downstream control volume, and the model is applicable for dry, partially wet, or fully wet surface conditions. Mass and energy balances are applied to each discretized volume (node) to examine the local heat and mass transfer. The model is capable of predicting local heat/mass transfer, wetness condition as well as pressure losses throughout the heat exchanger. The physics-based model is developed to handle a variety of operating conditions and heat exchanger geometries. Correlations for pressure drop and heat transfer coefficients can be easily replaced or modified for different air-side configurations. The <b>tube-side</b> analysis can also be easily adapted to accommodate different working fluids or <b>tube-side</b> designs. The general framework of the model is robust and flexible.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a flexible facility for evaluating the to-scale thermal performance of heat exchangers. During this phase of the project, exchanger testing was completed on three refrigerator evaporators: an as-manufactured plain-fin heat exchanger, a geometrically identical heat exchanger with brazed fin-tube contacts, and a spine-fin heat exchanger. These exchangers were selected because they are used in residential refrigeration, they are relatively simple, and because they provide a useful comparative study. The evaporator calorimeter was constructed with several air-side sections. Temperature and humidity control are provided in the thennal-conditioning section, and the flow-conditioning section provides thennal mixing, flow profile and turbulence control. In the test section, air temperature, velocity, pressure and humidity are measured. The <b>tube-side</b> flow is supplied and conditioned by a chiller; temperature and mass flow rate of the coolant are measured. The apparatus provides air mass flow rates up to about 725 kg/hr (1600 lb/hr); approach temperatures from - 23 ??C to 49 ??C (- 10 to 120 ??F); and relative humidity from about 30 % to 90 %. The coolant mass flow rate can reach about 500 kg/hr (1100 lb/hr) at temperatures as low as - 23 ??C (- 10 OF). With this apparatus, air-side and <b>tube-side</b> energy balances within ?? 3 % are typically obtained, with worst-case energy errors less than ?? 7 %. The overall heat exchanger conductance, UAT, was found to be highest for the spine-fin geometry. The overall conductance for the plainfin exchangers was roughly half that of the spine-fin geometry for Reynolds numbers from 500 to 3000 based on hydraulic diameter. Interestingly, when air-side area and <b>tube-side</b> resistance effects were considered, the plain-fin geometry had an air-side heat transfer coefficient roughly equal to that of the spine-fin geometry. Under dry-surface conditions, the plain-fin exchanger with brazed fin-tube junctions had an air-side conductance about 20 % higher than that of the unbrazed exchanger. This result is probably due to fin-tube contact resistance in the as manufactured plain-fin exchanger; unfortunately, it is unclear whether contact-resistance is important under frosting conditions.

40|$|Air-cooled {{condensers}} {{are routinely}} {{designed for a}} variety of applications, including residential air-conditioning systems. Recent attempts at improving the performance of these heat exchangers have included the consideration of microchannel tube, multilouver fin heat exchangers instead of the more conventional round tube-plate fin designs. In most packaged air-conditioning systems, however, the condenser surrounds the compressor and other auxiliary parts in an outdoor unit, with an induced draft fan {{at the top of this}} enclosure. Such a configuration results in significant mal-distribution of the air flow arriving at the condenser, and leads to a decrease in performance. This work addresses the issue of mal-distribution by adapting the air-side geometry to the expected air flow distribution. A microchannel tube, multilouver fin condenser is first designed to transfer the desired heat rejection load for an air-conditioning system under uniform air flow conditions. <b>Tube-side</b> pass arrangements, tube dimensions, and fin and louver geometry are varied to arrive at a minimum mass, 2. 54 kg condenser that delivers the desired heat load of 14. 5 kW. The design model is then used to predict the performance of the condenser {{for a variety of}} air flow distributions across the heat exchanger. It is found that for a 50 % air flow mal-distribution, the required condenser mass increases to 2. 73 kg. The air-side geometry (fin density and height) of the condenser is then systematically changed to optimally distribute the air-side surface area across the condenser to best address the mal-distributed air flow. It is found that linear fin density and height variations from the mean value of 40 % and 20 %, respectively, keeping the mean fin density and height the same, reduce the required condenser mass to 2. 65 kg even for this mal-distributed air-flow case. The influence of geometry variations on heat transfer coefficients, fan power and other performance measures is discussed in detail to guide the judicious choice of surface area and <b>tube-side</b> flow area allocations for any potential air flow mal-distribution. The results from this study can be used for the design of air-cooled condensers under realistic flow conditions. M. S.

Twenty-seven different industrial-types of heat exchangers with power ratings ranging between 100 and 800 kW were analyzed. This was done due to their large energy consumption and inefficiencies associated with their operation. Through numerical optimisation it was possible to conclude that the main variables that affected entropy generation were the steam inlet temperature, followed by the <b>tube-side</b> diameter for the given sample set. The main mechanism contributing to entropy generation was the effect of fluid friction, although this was only the case at smaller tube diameters. By using the principles of entropy generation minimization the entropy generated of each heat exchanger could be reduced by between 2 % and 64 %.

40|$|Due to {{the wide}} range of design possibilities, simple manufactured, low {{maintenance}} and low cost, cross-flow heat exchangers are extensively used in the petroleum, petrochemical, air conditioning, food storage, and others industries. In this paper a mathematical model for cross-flow heat exchangers with complex flow arrangements for determining epsilon -NTU relations is presented. The model is based on the tube element approach, according to which the heat exchanger outlet temperatures are obtained by discretizing the coil along the tube fluid path. In each cross section of the element, <b>tube-side</b> fluid temperature is assumed to be constant because the heat capacity rate ratio C*=Cmin/Cmax tends toward zero in the element. Thus temperature is controlled by effectiveness of a local element corresponding to an evaporator or a condenser-type element. The model is validated through comparison with theoretical algebraic relations for single-pass cross-flow arrangements with one or more rows. Very small relative errors are obtained showing the accuracy of the present model. epsilon -NTU curves for several complex circuit arrangements are presented.

40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years much {{progress}} has been made in heat exchanger design methodology. Even so, the design engineer still has to deal with a great deal of uncertainty. Whilst the methods used to predict heat transfer coefficients are now quite sophisticated and take account of many physical factors, the results they yield are still inaccurate. Physical property information is required for the estimation of heat transfer coefficients. Available information is often of dubious accuracy. Even given accurate properties modern methods for the predictions of <b>tube-side</b> heat transfer coefficient can be expected to have an accuracy of only ? 10 %. For the shell-side, higher errors (say, around ? 15 %) can be expected. Perhaps worst of all, comes the specification of fouling resistance (the allowance made for the thermal resistance presented by dirt layers deposited on the heat exchanger tubes). In most instances there is little science or understanding behind the specification of these resistances. Traditionally there have been two approaches to dealing with these uncertainties: over-specification of fouling resistance; and, addition of 'design margin' (i. e. addition of extra surface area).

The experimental apparatus consists essentially of two variable speed air compressors, a temperature controlled large water tank, in order to get saturated the primary line air, and the humidifier to be tested; in the secondary air line the gas flows from the compressor to the PPH tubes, increasing its humidity along its path.

However, higher energy consumption, lower productivity, and shorter membrane lifespan due to polarization and membrane fouling continue to present severe technical challenges to membrane-based separation. Improved membrane module design and novel hydrodynamics offer strategies to address these challenges. This review focuses on hollow fiber membrane modules which are well suited to membrane contactor separation processes. Attempts to improve membrane module design should begin with {{a better understanding of}} the mass transfer in the hollow fiber module; therefore, this review provides a summary of prior studies on the mass transfer models related to both the shell-side and <b>tube-side</b> fluid dynamics. Based on the mass transfer analysis, two types of technique to enhance hollow fiber membrane module performance are discussed: (1) passive enhancement techniques that involve the design and fabrication of effective modules with optimized flow geometry or (2) active enhancement techniques that uses external energy to induce a high shear regime to suppress the undesirable fouling and concentration polarization phenomena. This review covers the progress over the past five years on the most commonly proposed techniques such as bubbling, vibrations, and ultrasound. Both enhancement modes have their advantages and drawbacks. Generally, the passive enhancement techniques offer modest improvement of the system performance, while the active techniques, including bubbling, vibrating, and ultrasound, are capable of providing as high as 3 - 15 times enhancement of the permeation flux. Fundamentally, the objectives of module design should include the minimization of the cost per amount of mass transferred (energy consumption and module production cost) and the maximization of the system performance through optimizing the flow geometry and operating conditions of the module, scale-up potential, and expansion of niche applications. It is expected that this review can provide inspiration for novel module development. © 2013 Copyright Balaban Desalination Publications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{project on}} ceramic-supported polymer {{membranes}} {{focuses on the}} development of a novel class of membranes for the separation of organics from both organic-aqueous and organic-organic mixtures, Theses membranes are fabricated by a graft polymerization process where polymer chains are grown onto the surface of a ceramic support membrane. The surface graft polymerization process, developed at UCLA, results in the formation of a thin polymer layer covalently bonded to the membrane pore surface as a layer of terminally anchored polymeric chains. Through the selection of the polymer most appropriate for the desired separation task, the graft polymerized surface layer can be synthesized to impart specific separation properties to the membrane. It is expected that this project will lead to the demonstration of a new technology for the tailor design of a new class of selective and robust ceramic-supported polymer membranes. This new approach will allow the rapid deployment of task-specific membranes for the separation of waste constituents for subsequent recovery, treatment or disposal.

In another aspect of the study, the authors are studying the hydrophilic PVP CSP membrane for oil-in-water emulsion treatment with the goal of determining the optimal membrane polymer surface structure as a function of various operating conditions (e. g., <b>tube-side</b> Reynolds number and transmembrane pressure), Work is also in progress to characterize the polymer layer by AFM and internal reflection FTIR, and to model the conformation of the polymer surface layer. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{head of a}} human cadaver was {{positioned}} in a Cranex TOME multifunctional unit (Orion Corporation Soredex, Helsinki, Finland) to measure the organ radiation doses after tomographic examinations of {{the upper and lower}} edentulous jaw bone. Five consecutive examinations were carried out in the upper and lower anterior jaw regions to cover the entire frontal area, 2 in the upper and lower left premolar regions, and 3 and 4 in the upper and lower left molar regions, respectively. Each examination consisted of 4 slices with a 2 mm slice thickness. Thermoluminescent dosimeter chips were placed in the thyroid gland and bilaterally in the parotid and submandibular glands. Dosimetric measurements were repeated for the different tomographic examinations mentioned above. For spiral tomography in the maxilla, organ doses for both parotid glands were most elevated, while those for the thyroid glands were the lowest. Average doses per examination reached levels of 0. 27 mGy for the right (OS) parotid gland with frontal tomography, and 3. 89 mGy and 1. 67 mGy for the parotid gland at <b>tube-side</b> (TS) for premolar and molar tomography. For the thyroid gland, a minimal dose of < or = 0. 004 mGy was noticed for all examinations. For spiral tomography of the frontal area in the mandible, the OS parotid gland received the highest dose (0. 77 mGy), while for an analysis of the premolar and molar areas, doses were more elevated for the TS parotid gland (1. 22 mGy and 1. 72 mGy, respectively). For the TS submandibular gland, organ doses were also raised, with values of 0. 39 mGy for frontal, 1. 31 mGy for premolar and 1. 61 mGy for molar tomography. This study thus indicates that for conventional spiral tomographic examinations in the maxilla and the mandible, radiation doses for the TS submandibular and parotid glands were significantly more elevated than those to the thyroid gland. These values remain however below the organ doses previously reported for spiral CT involving both a full upper or lower jaw. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Internally-grooved {{refrigeration}} tubes maximize <b>tube-side</b> evaporative {{heat transfer}} rates {{and have been}} identified as a most promising technology for integration into compact cold plates. Unfortunately, the absence of phenomenological insights and physical models hinders the extrapolation of grooved-tube performance to new applications. The success of regime-based heat transfer correlations for smooth tubes has motivated the current effort to explore the relationship between flow regimes and enhanced heat transfer in internally-grooved tubes. In this thesis, a detailed analysis of smooth and internally-grooved tube data reveals that performance improvement in internally-grooved tubes at low-to-intermediate mass flux is a result of early flow regime transition. Based on this analysis, a new flow regime map and corresponding heat transfer coefficient correlation, which account for the increased wetted angle, turbulence, and Gregorig effects unique to internally-grooved tubes, were developed. A two-phase test facility was designed and fabricated to validate the newly-developed flow regime map and regime-based heat transfer coefficient correlation. As part of this setup, a non-intrusive optical technique was developed to study the dynamic nature of two-phase flows. It was found that different flow regimes result in unique temporally varying film thickness profiles. Using these profiles, quantitative flow regime identification measures were developed, including the ability to explain and quantify the more subtle transitions that exist between dominant flow regimes. Flow regime data, based on the newly-developed method, and heat transfer coefficient data, using infrared thermography, were collected for two-phase HFE- 7100 flow in horizontal 2. 62 mm - 8. 84 mm diameter smooth and internally-grooved tubes with mass fluxes from 25 - 300 kg/m²s, heat fluxes from 4 - 56 kW/m², and vapor qualities approaching 1. In total, over 6500 combined data points for the adiabatic and diabatic smooth and internally-grooved tubes were acquired. Based on results from the experiments and a reinterpretation of data from independent researchers, it was established that heat transfer enhancement in internally-grooved tubes at low-to-intermediate mass flux is primarily due to early flow regime transition to Annular flow. The regime-based heat transfer coefficient outperformed empirical correlations from the literature, with mean and absolute deviations of 4. 0 % and 32 % for the full range of data collected...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{problem in}} concentrating phosphoric acid {{is due to}} fouling on the <b>tube-side</b> of the heat {{exchangers}} of the evaporators. Scaling on the heat transfer surfaces occurs because of high supersaturation of phosphoric acid liquor with respect to calcium sulfate. A review of the existing literature reveals that no information is available on heat transfer and on crystallisation fouling of phosphoric acid solutions. Solubility of calcium sulfate is very important {{with regards to the}} scaling problems in phosphoric acid concentration plants. Hence, the solubility of different calcium sulfate types in phosphoric acid solution was studied and their dependency on acid concentration and temperature were investigated. A large number of measurements of heat transfer coefficient for water and phosphoric acid solutions under forced convective, subcooled flow boiling and pool boiling conditions at different temperatures, flow velocities, heat fluxes and concentrations were performed. The results show that the modified Gnielinski and Petukhov and Popov con-elations fit the experimental results for forced convective heat transfer to phosphoric acid solutions better than the other correlations. The Chen model and associated correlations were found suitable for the prediction of subcooled flow boiling heat transfer coefficients for phosphoric acid solutions. Applying the actual temperature driving force (Tw-Ti) instead of (Tw-Tb), a theoretical model was proposed, which permits the prediction of pool boiling heat transfer coefficients of phosphoric acid solutions with good accuracy. A large number of fouling experiments were carried out at different flow velocities, surface temperatures and concentrations to determine the mechanisms, which control deposition process. After clarification of the effect of operational parameters on the deposition process, a mathematical model was developed for prediction of fouling resistance. The activation energy evaluated for the surface reaction of the deposit formation was found to be 56, 829 J/mol. The predicted fouling resistances were compared with the experimental data. Quantitative and qualitative agreement for measured and predicted fouling rates, is good. Also, a kinetic model for crystallization fouling was developed, using the field data. The predictions of the suggested model are in good agreement with the plant operating data. Finally, a numerical model was developed for computer simulation of shell and tube heat exchangers. The agreement between the field data and the prediction of the model was very satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|Black liquor {{gasification}} at {{high temperature}} is a promising {{alternative to the}} conventional recovery boiler process used in chemical pulp mills today. Compared to a conventional recovery boiler a black liquor gasifier can increase the total energy efficiency of a chemical pulp mill and produce a synthesis gas {{that can be used}} for production of motor fuel. In Piteå, a 3 MW or 20 tons per day entrained flow pressurized black liquor gasification development plant has been constructed by Chemrec at Energy Technology Center. The plant has been run more than 12 000 h since 2005. One of the key parts in the gasification process is the spray burner nozzle where the black liquor is disintegrated into the hot gasifier as a spray of fine droplets. In this thesis the spray burner nozzle as characterized with high speed photography in order to visualize the atomization process of black liquor. The results showed that black liquor forms non-spherical and stretched ligaments and droplets with the considered nozzle. Comparison of the results with atomization of a syrup/water mixture showed that the results were qualitatively very similar which means that a syrup/water mixture can be used instead of black liquor for burner optimization experiments. This is a considerable experimental simplification. Also spatially resolved measurements of the gas composition in the development plant with a water cooled quench probe have been performed. From the gas composition measurement and the spray visualization it has been showed that the preheating of black liquor has a significant influence on the gas composition. Another important part in the gasification plant is the counter-current condenser where the gas is cooled and the water content in the gas is condensed away in vertical tubes that are cooled on the outside by a counter-current flow of water or steam. In this thesis a computational fluid dynamics model of the counter-current condenser have been developed. The model consists of a two-phase fluid model on the <b>tube-side</b> of the condenser and a single phase model of the shell side. Predictions from the model are in excellent agreement with temperature measurements from the condenser used in the 3 MW Black Liquor Gasification development plant. However, more validation data is necessary before a definite conclusion can be drawn about the predictive capability of the code, in particular with respect to scale up with about two orders of magnitude for commercial size gas coolersGodkänd; 2011; 20110228 (mikris); LICENTIATSEMINARIUM Ämnesområde: Energiteknik/Energy Engineering Examinator: Adj professor Rikard Gebart, Institutionen för teknikvetenskap och matematik, Luleå tekniska universitet Diskutant: Tekn lic Mats Lindblom, Chemrec, Piteå Tid: Fredag den 1 april 2011 kl 10. 00 Plats: E 231, Luleå tekniska universite...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{coupling}} {{of methane}} (OCM) represents {{an opportunity for}} the replacement of crude oil, which still is the main source for longer hydrocarbons and almost all base chemicals, with natural gas, or biogas. OCM turns methane catalytically into mostly ethylene and ethane. Thus, several different reactor types exist, out of which the packed-bed membrane reactor (PBMR) {{is one of the most}} promising given its combination of reaction and product separation in one apparatus and also the improved temperature control because of the gradual feeding of oxygen through the membrane. In previous simulation and optimization studies, one-dimensional models have been used to describe the conventional PBMR. However, due to radial diffusion and thermal conduction those models are not accurate enough. In this work, a two-dimensional model for the CPBMR is presented. Radial diffusion and thermal conduction in the packed-bed as well as in the reactor shell are considered while axial dispersion is neglected. In accordance with experimental studies, Knudsen’s diffusivity theory is applied to describe the flux through the membrane. The model is discretized using a combination of Lagrangian and Hermite collocating polynomials on finite elements. The two-dimensional model contains second order derivatives for the radial coordinate. Hence, continuity of both the collocated variable and the first derivative across all finite elements are required in that direction. In this case, Hermite polynomials are advantageous because they allow for the afore-mentioned continuity while negating the necessity of additional equality constraints. As an initial configuration, a length of 20 cm is assumed for the CPBMR with two separate heating/cooling segments of each 10 cm. The <b>tube-side</b> and shell-side diameters are set to 7 and 10 mm, respectively. Preliminary studies have shown that five radial and twelve axial finite elements are required to ensure a stable performance of all optimization studies for the given initial configuration. The resulting large-scale NLP contains more than 130, 000 variables. Most fluid properties and transport parameters are implemented as functions of local temperatures and concentrations rather than average values. A brief study shows that their joint influence cannot be neglected. Using La 2 O 3 /CaO as a catalyst with kinetics provided by Stansch et al. (1997), an overestimation of more than 25 percentage points can be observed in the yield of C 2 hydrocarbons in a one-dimensional model in comparison to the two-dimensional case. Optimization studies using the solver IPOPT result in operating conditions and reactor configurations with a yield in C 2 hydrocarbons of more than 40 %, which lets the two-dimensional model still appear to be more accurate than any one-dimensional case. However, experimental studies have never shown such a performance at this level. The partial pressure of oxygen in the catalytic packed-bed of the CPBMR will always be comparatively low, usually 1538 below 1000 Pa, because of the diffusive flux through the membrane. Most kinetic systems for OCM are derived from micro-catalytic packed-beds and are not meant for this range. Thus, it i...|$|E
40|$|Oscillatory baffled {{reactors}} (OBRs) are {{a form of}} {{plug flow}} reactor, in which tubes fitted with orifice plate baffles have an oscillatory motion superimposed upon the net flow of the process fluid. The interaction of the baffles with the oscillatory motion of the fluid generates uniform mixing and enhanced transport rates, whilst maintaining conditions approximating plug flow. Unlike conventional tubular reactors, where a minimum Reynolds number must be maintained, the <b>tube-side</b> mixing is independent of any net flow, potentially allowing long residence times to be achieved in a reactor of greatly reduced length-to-diameter ratio leading to much more compact designs. This suggests a niche application in converting long reactions from batch to continuous processing. Fermentations show characteristically long residence times. Therefore, they could be intensified in an OBR. Since one major advantage of the OBR is its highly uniform, controllable mixing, {{which can be used}} to enhance gas-to-liquid mass transfer, it should be suitable for biological reactions. Fed-batch or continuous fermentation is a second advantage, as it should minimise substrate and product inhibition. Lower, more uniform shear rates than in a stirred tank reactor would be an additional advantage for processing shear-sensitive cells. Previous research has shown that the OBR can provide higher biomass concentrations and greater gas-liquid mass transfer than conventional fermenters. In this work two different fermentation systems were studied. Firstly, as a benchmark experiment, the fermentation stage of the beer production process was investigated in order to determine any relative advantages of using the OBR. Secondly, the production of biopolymers, namely polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), by Pseudomonas putida KT 2442 was studied. Biopolymers are biodegradable polymers made from renewable resources. They can be made from plants or by microorganisms. P. putida is one such microorganism. Under nutrient limitation and carbon excess it produces polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), which are linear polyesters, to store carbon as energy resource. PHAs are biodegradable and are used in the production of bioplastics. The production of biopolymers from microorganisms is currently not cost-effective, because of expensive substrates, low yields and complex downstream processing. Therefore, intensification of PHA production to achieve higher yields in smaller, more efficient equipment at lower capital costs would be an advantage. The parameters investigated in the two systems were agitation rate and temperature. The main result of the beer fermentation was that beer could be successfully produced in the OBR with a significant reduction in time-to-completion to a fifth of that of a conventional beer fermentation. This was achieved at 37 ± 1 °C and an oscillatory Reynolds number (Reo) of 300. For the biopolymer production it was demonstrated that PHA can be produced in the OBR. The fermentation temperature and agitation rate resulting in the highest optical density (OD) and PHA yield in this parameter space were determined as 30 ± I °C and an oscillatory Reynolds number of 300 respectively. It was also demonstrated that using an OBR can lead to higher OD (10. 8 vs 7. 32) and dry cell weight (3. 75 g/L vs 2. 4 g/L) than in a comparable conventional stirred tank reactor.

40|$|Provisions {{are stored}} and {{displayed}} in supermarkets and grocery stores, at a temperature {{lower than the}} ambient, in display cabinets, which are responsible for {{a significant amount of}} the energy use in this sector. During the 1990 s, major changes in the regulations governing the use of synthetic refrigerants took place in Sweden. This resulted in many refrigeration systems being converted to systems with indirect cooling by means of a liquid secondary refrigerant. The cooling coil is an important component in a display cabinet and traditionally, different kinds of tube-coils, with aluminium fins on expanded circular copper tubes, have been used. Many secondary heat transfer media have relatively high viscosities at low tem¬peratures, and so the flow regime is often laminar, which may lead to poor heat transfer. However, it is possible to achieve high heat transfer coefficients even for laminar flows if an ap¬propriate design of the heat exchanger is applied. Flat-tube heat exchangers have been used {{for a long time in}} automotive applications, where compactness is important. The display cabinet application involves low air velocities in combination with condensation of water vapour, and sometimes even frosting, and is therefore different from other applications where flat-tube heat exchangers have been used earlier. The objective of this research work has been to find a suitable, more energy-efficient, heat exchanger design for indirectly cooled display cabinets. An efficiency that would mean that temperature differences would be so small that frosting could be avoided was aimed for. This research work has sandwiched experimental investigations with theoretical modelling and parameter studies. Initially, the heat transfer and pressure drop performance of conventional cooling coils operating with liquid secondary refrigerants was studied in full-scale experiments. Thereafter, the liquid-side (or <b>tube-side)</b> heat transfer was studied experimentally in small-scale experiments on three single multiport extruded flat tubes with different cross-sections. In both studies, the best agreement was found with predictions using the Gnielinski correlation for thermally developing laminar flows with the constant temperature boundary condition. After this, two different heat exchangers having flat tubes and plain fins on the air side were evaluated experimentally - one with continuous plate fins and one with serpentine fins. The results show that, for conditions similar to those of display cabinets, the heat transfer and pressure drop performance is affected to little or no extent by the occurrence of condensate water. Models for different types of flat-tube heat exchangers were thereafter created using the results from the experimental studies. In order to find appropriate optimising criteria for the display cabinet heat exchangers, the energy efficiency of a complete cooling system of an imagined supermarket has been studied. Finally, different designs of flat-tube heat exchangers with plain fins have been evaluated theoretically in a parameter study. The results show that considerable savings in the required electric drive power can be obtained in comparison with the traditional cooling coil. The savings can be up to 15 %. In addition, the flat-tube heat exchangers could operate with a minimum temperature difference of around 1 K. This makes frost-free operation possible for many display cabinet applications and thereby the savings potential even larger...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{actuated}} adsorption {{heat pumps}} offer {{the opportunity to}} improve overall energy efficiency in waste heat applications by eliminating shaft work requirements accompanying vapor compression cycles. The coefficient of performance (COP) in adsorption heat pumps is generally low. The objective of this thesis is to model the adsorption system to gain critical insight into how its performance can be improved. Because adsorption heat pumps are intermittent devices, which induce cooling by adsorbing refrigerant in a sorption bed heat/mass exchanger, transient models must be used to predict performance. In this thesis, such models are developed at the adsorbent particle level, heat/mass exchanger component level and system level. Adsorption heat pump modeling is a coupled heat and mass transfer problem. Intra-particle mass transfer resistance and sorption bed heat transfer resistance are shown to be significant, but for very fine particle sizes, inter-particle resistance may also be important. The diameter of the adsorbent particle in a packed bed is optimized to balance inter- and intra-particle resistances and improve sorption rate. In the literature, the linear driving force (LDF) approximation for intra-particle mass transfer is commonly used {{in place of the}} Fickian diffusion equation to reduce computation time; however, it is shown that the error in uptake prediction associated with the LDF depends on the working pair, half-cycle time, adsorbent particle radius, and operating temperatures at hand. Different methods for enhancing sorption bed heat/mass transfer have been proposed in the literature including the use of binders, adsorbent compacting, and complex extended surface geometries. To maintain high reliability, the simple, robust annular-finned-tube geometry with packed adsorbent is specified in this work. The effects of tube diameter, fin pitch and fin height on thermal conductance, metal/adsorbent mass ratio and COP are studied. As one might expect, many closely spaced fins, or high fin density, yields high thermal conductance; however, it is found that the increased inert metal mass associated with the high fin density diminishes COP. It is also found that thin adsorbent layers with low effective conduction resistance lead to high thermal conductance. As adsorbent layer thickness decreases, the relative importance of <b>tube-side</b> convective resistance rises, so mini-channel sized tubes are used. After selecting the proper tube geometry, an overall thermal conductance is calculated for use in a lumped-parameter sorption bed simulation. To evaluate the accuracy of the lumped-parameter approach, a distributed parameter sorption bed simulation is developed for comparison. Using the finite difference method, the distributed parameter model is used to track temperature and refrigerant distributions in the finned tube and adsorbent layer. The distributed-parameter tube model is shown to be in agreement with the lumped-parameter model, thus independently verifying the overall UA calculation and the lumped-parameter sorption bed model. After evaluating the accuracy of the lumped-parameter model, it is used to develop a system-level heat pump simulation. This simulation is used to investigate a non-recuperative two-bed heat pump containing activated carbon fiber-ethanol and silica gel-water working pairs. The two-bed configuration is investigated because it yields a desirable compromise between the number of components (heat exchangers, pumps, valves, etc.) and steady cooling rate. For non-recuperative two-bed adsorption heat pumps, the average COP prediction in the literature is 0. 39 for experiments and 0. 44 for models. It is important to improve the COP in mobile waste heat applications because without high COP, the available waste heat during startup or idle may be insufficient to deliver the desired cooling duty. In this thesis, a COP of 0. 53 is predicted for the non-recuperative, silica gel-water chiller. If thermal energy recovery is incorporated into the cycle, a COP as high as 0. 64 is predicted for a 90, 35 and 7. 0 °C source, ambient and average evaporator temperature, respectively. The improvement in COP over heat pumps appearing in the literature is attributed to the adsorbent particle size optimization and careful selection of sorption bed heat exchanger geometry. M. S.
