40|$|This {{thesis is}} about <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> and <b>the</b> state, more {{specifically}} <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> in former Yugoslavia and <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> in Bosnia Herzegovina today. How can there suddenly {{be such a}} change in <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> of <b>the</b> people when the state capacity collapses? Are norms and language important {{in order to maintain}} <b>the</b> same <b>identity?</b> My analysis about <b>the</b> Yugoslavian <b>identity,</b> how it was constructed, and later on <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> in Bosnia and Herzegovina, supports my hypothesis; that the state and <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> have a connection. The main purpose of my thesis is to see the difference between <b>the</b> Yugoslavian <b>identity</b> and <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> in Bosnia Herzegovina today, and {{to find out if the}} state capacity is important in <b>the</b> construction of <b>identities...</b>|$|R

5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} been {{influenced}} by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity.

5|$|After {{repeated}} positives {{over the}} summer, including tests from Leonardo Piepoli and Bernhard Kohl at the Tour de France, and Davide Rebellin and Stefan Schumacher from the 2008 Olympic Games, the UCI {{has sought to}} have samples taken during the Giro retested.

5|$|FBI {{director}} J. Edgar Hoover designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background {{investigations of}} employees {{were carried out}} by FBI agents.

Hoover's sense of the Communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews were not allowed to cross-examine or know <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> of those who accused them. In many cases they were not even told what they were accused of.|$|E
