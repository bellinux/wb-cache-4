The empty cradle shown top right extracts the ship longitudinally but its wheels can then be rotated 90o allowing it to park the ship transversely and freeing up the slipway for another vessel. The ferry bottom right can also be transported in the longitudinal as well as the transverse direction but uses a separate <b>transverse</b> <b>carriage</b> to change direction.|$|E
