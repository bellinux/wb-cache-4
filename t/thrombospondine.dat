As until now, the key {{events and the}} genes involved in the action of TSH remain largely uncharacterized, {{our goal was to}} identify new differentially expressed genes in TSH-induced thyroid proliferation. Using cDNA-AFLP, we visualized 105 different transcripts showing significant differential expression during the stimulation of dog thyrocytes with TSH for different times, in the presence of insulin. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses confirmed the pattern expression of 5 clones encoding known proteins: <b>thrombospondine</b> 1, TNFr 1, RhoE, RalB, and annexin A 2. These regulations provide molecular counterparts of in vivo physiological effects of TSH: angiogenesis (decreased thrombospondin 1), decreased apoptosis (decreased TNFR 1) and actin filament disruption, macropinocytosis and thyroid hormone secretion (decreased RhoE).

The size ofVWF is after secretion reduced by ADAMTS 13. ADAMTS 13 consists of ametalloprotease domain, a disintegrine-like domain, a <b>thrombospondine</b> type 1 repeat (TSP 1), a cysteine rich and a spacer domain, seven additional TSP 1 repeats and two CUB domains. The function of the different domains of ADAMTS 13 on its activity in vitro has beenstudied, but their contribution to the proteolysis of VWF remains largelyuncovered. Seven C-terminally truncated murine ADAMTS 13 (mADAMTS 13) mutants were constructed and expressed in HEK 293 T cells. Allmutants were characterised in vitro:both proteolysis of the truncated substrate GST-VWF 73 and VWF multimers wasinvestigated. The above tests are only qualitative and for kinetic analysis,FRETS-VWF 73 was used. As could be expected, murine MDTCS (devoid of the T 2 - 8 and CUB domains) retained full enzyme activity and like seen for human ADAMTS 13,mADAMTS 13 without spacer domain (MDT and M) had reduced catalytic efficiency(fifty fold reduction in kcat/KM). Similar domains inmurine and human ADAMTS 13 are important for the activity in vitro which motivates the use of murine models to study ADAMTS 13 in vivo. Using intravital fluorescencemicroscopy, platelet-decorated VWF multimers (strings) which form on theactivated/damaged endothelium of the mesenteric venules in mice, were visualised. These VWF strings are long-lived in Adamts 13 -/-mice, while they are rapidly digested in wild type mice and thus can beused as a measure for ADAMTS 13 activity invivo. Surprisingly the absence of the CUB domains completely abolished theADAMTS 13 activity, while MDTCS retained full functionality and the partial(del(T 6 -CUB)) or complete (delCUB) addition of the tandem T 2 - 8 repeats resultedin a gradual decrease of the activity. ADAMTS 13 CUB and T 2 - 8 domains influencethe proteolysis of platelet-decorated VWF strings in vivo and emphasise the importance of these domains. Possibly theTSP 1 repeats shield the spacer or the catalytic site and is this interactiononly broken after binding of the CUB domains to VWF. An interaction between theN- and C-terminal domains of ADAMTS 13 is currently under investigation andbinding of the TSP 1 repeats and CUB domains will be examined in the currentmodel. status: publishe...|$|E
