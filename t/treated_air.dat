5000|$|Unlike air purifiers, which filter or {{otherwise}} trap particles within an air circulator, air sanitizers {{have the ability}} to act on airborne microorganisms in open interior air space. A sneeze- or cough-generated pathogenic aerosol will take significant time to be treated by a circulating air purifier simply because air circulators are unable to treat all air of the room simultaneously. Air circulators treat a fractional room volume per unit time and exhaust the <b>treated</b> <b>air</b> back into the room resulting in fractional air dilution. In contrast, air sanitizers that are maintained at a sufficient and homogeneous concentration (see homogeneous (chemistry)) within the interior air space provide simultaneous treatment of the entire interior air space volume, but are not able to remove particles including allergens. Air purifiers and air sanitizers are therefore complementary air treatment solutions. An air sanitizer is not an air freshener which add fragrance to the air and do not claim to act on microbiological organisms.|$|E

40|$|Decomposition of toluene in air was {{studied by}} {{dielectric}} barrier discharge (DBD) {{on the one}} hand as well as UV light as assistance to DBD on the other hand. Input energy to reaction chamber, flow rate of contaminated air, and concentration of toluene were studied as parameters influencing on the decomposition rate of toluene by two methods. Increasing the input energy from 2. 8 kV to 4. 2 kV at flow rate 1 SLM was increased the decomposition rate of toluene from 3. 5 % to 10 %. However the decomposition rate of toluene was decreased with increasing both the flow rate and the concentration of toluene in a <b>treated</b> <b>air.</b> It was discovered synergetic effect of UV light assistance to DBD on toluene decomposition. The decomposition rate of toluene by UV assisted DBD was at least 3 times higher than by the DBD only, and 2 times higher than the sum of decomposition rates by the DBD and UV light made separately. Ozone concentration was decreased by UV assisted DBD in comparison with other one and this rate depends on flow rate of a <b>treated</b> <b>air.</b> This effect was discussed due to reaction activities of different radicals obtained by interaction of ozone and UV light...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Current {{efforts are}} {{underway}} {{to quantify the}} chemical concentration in a <b>treated</b> <b>air</b> space that elicits a spatial repellent (deterrent) response in a vector population. Such information will facilitate identifying the optimum active ingredient (AI) dosage and intervention coverage important {{for the development of}} spatial repellent tools – one of several novel strategies being evaluated for vector-borne disease control. This study reports initial findings from air sampling experiments conducted under field conditions to describe the relationship between air concentrations of repellent AIs and deterrent behavior in the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. Methods Air samples were taken inside and outdoors of experimental huts located in Pu Tuey Village, Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand in conjunction with mosquito behavioral evaluations. A mark-release-recapture study design using interception traps was used to measure deterrency of Ae. aegypti against 0. 00625 % metofluthrin coils and DDT-treated fabric (2 g/m 2) within separate experimental trials. Sentinel mosquito cohorts were positioned adjacent to air sampling locations to monitor knock down responses to AI within the <b>treated</b> <b>air</b> space. Air samples were analyzed using two techniques: the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Compendium Method TO- 10 A and thermal desorption (TD). Results Both the USEPA TO- 10 A and TD air sampling methods were able to detect and quantify volatized AIs under field conditions. Air samples indicated concentrations of both repellent chemicals below thresholds required for toxic responses (mortality) in mosquitoes. These concentrations elicited up to a 58 % and 70 % reduction in Ae. aegypti entry (i. e., deterrency) into treated experimental huts using metofluthrin coils and DDT-treated fabric, respectively. Minimal knock down was observed in sentinel mosquito cohorts positioned adjacent to air sampling locations during both chemical evaluations. Conclusions This study is the first to describe two air sampling methodologies that are appropriate for detecting and quantifying repellent chemicals within a <b>treated</b> <b>air</b> space during mosquito behavior evaluations. Results demonstrate that the quantity of AI detected by the mosquito vector, Ae. aegypti, that elicits repellency is far lower than that needed for toxicity. These findings have important implications for evaluation and optimization of new vector control tools that function through mosquito behavior modification as opposed to mortality. </p...|$|E
