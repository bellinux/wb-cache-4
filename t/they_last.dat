5|$|The 11 Canis-Minorids, {{also called}} the Beta Canis Minorids, are a meteor shower that arise near the fifth-magnitude star 11 Canis Minoris and were {{discovered}} in 1964 by Keith Hindley, who investigated their trajectory and proposed a common origin with the comet D/1917 F1 Mellish. However, this conclusion has been refuted subsequently {{as the number of}} orbits analysed was low and their trajectories too disparate to confirm a link. <b>They</b> <b>last</b> from 4 to 15 December, peaking over 10 and 11 December.|$|E

5|$|From {{time to time}} special {{seasonal}} {{festivals and}} events are held. <b>They</b> <b>last</b> only for a set {{period of time and}} offer a variety of fun or useful rewards. Many events have changed over time, adding new features and eliminating old ones. These events are geared towards any level, often restricting players to level 1, so that veterans and novice players alike can join in together. Events celebrated are often thematically based on real life equivalents, for example: Valentione's Day in place of Valentine's Day, the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza in place of Easter, and the Starlight Celebration in place of Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Liberty {{ships were}} an {{expedient}} {{solution to a}} pressing problem, and it was never intended that <b>they</b> <b>last</b> more than five years. It is remarkable that two (SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O'Brien) have not only survived seventy plus years of service, but {{that they are in}} 'like-new' condition, and {{are open to the public}} as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did not have the resources to build them. In 1939, they asked the United States to help solve the problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship's name starting with Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Millwall and West Ham {{have played}} each other 99 times competitively: Millwall have won 38, West Ham 34 and 27 have {{ended in a}} draw. Before the First World War the teams met 60 times in just 16 years, mostly in the Southern and Western Football Leagues. They have played a total of 39 times in league and cup {{competitions}} since 1916. The teams have usually competed in different divisions, spending only 12 seasons in the same tier of the Football League. Even so, the derbies have retained their passion and both sets of supporters still consider the other club their main rival. <b>They</b> <b>last</b> played {{against each other in}} the 2011–12 Championship. As of the 2017–18 season, West Ham play in the Premier League and Millwall play in the Championship, the tier below.|$|E

5|$|Millwall's fiercest rival is West Ham United. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} passionately contested local derbies in football. The two clubs have rarely met in recent years due to them playing in {{different}} leagues; the majority of their meetings happened before the First World War, with some 60 meetings between 1899–1915. The clubs have played 99 times since the first contest in 1899. Millwall have won 38, drawn 27 and lost 34. Despite violence between the two sets of supporters and calls for future games between the clubs to be played behind closed doors, <b>they</b> <b>last</b> met in the Football League Championship in 2011–12 with no outright ban on either set of fans, and no repeat of crowd trouble. The rivalry between the sides, specifically the clubs' two hooligan firms has been depicted on the big screen several times, in films such as Green Street.|$|E
5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. <b>They</b> <b>last</b> investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves {{and the consequent}} release of a prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: <b>they</b> <b>last</b> probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point {{makes it more difficult}} to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, which would make it event H0 (table, right).|$|E
