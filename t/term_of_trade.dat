The panel data analysis focuses on 66 developing countries for which we have the required data. We find that, theoretically and empirically, the effects of trade openness on budget balance through {{its effect on the}} instability of government revenue is quite clear: trade openness increases a country's exposure to external shocks (whether it is due to natural openness or to trade policy).

Among all determinants of exchange rate fluctuations, productivity differential is well known factor that explains long-run behavior of exchange rates. This concept supports Balassa-Samuelson effect, which explains that rapid economic growth is accompanied by real exchange rate appreciation because of differential productivity growth between tradable and non-tradable sectors (Drine and Rault 2001).

Median shocks to the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> are found to be highly persistent, yet with a large transitory component, and to account for only a small share of the variability of current account balances in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In contrast, <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> shocks are found to account for a relatively large proportion of the variability of current account balances in Australia and New Zealand.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between real exchange rate and <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand in two cases, namely a three-variable case and a four-variable case. The results of co-integration tests showed that there is long-run relationships among real exchange rate, <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> and relative demand for Malaysia. Moreover, there is long-run relationship among real exchange rate, <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> relative demand, and relative real interest rate for Malaysia and Thailand. The results of Granger causality showed that real exchange rate does not Granger cause <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> however the result is mixed for Thailand. The contribution <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> and relative demand to real exchange rate is mixed and small. Generally, the contribution <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> to real exchange rate is greater than the contribution of relative demand in Singapore. For Thailand, relative demand is more important than <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in the determination of real exchange rate. For Malaysia, the results are mixed...|$|R
