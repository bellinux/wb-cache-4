500|$|Curtis P. Iaukea {{was celebrated}} as a Hawaiian {{who survived the}} monarchy and lived <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He was also {{regarded}} as representing all that was apparently good about becoming American, even though {{until the end of}} his life the photos of my great-great-grandfather show him proudly wearing the uniforms and medals that accompanied his trips to faraway places as a diplomat for the Hawaiian Kingdom. He was never pictured wearing his uniforms, after the fact, for the Republic of Hawai‘i as its official diplomat. Even so, the territorial government regularly drew on his memories to close the gap between the Hawaiian Kingdom and the territory and in order to legitimize its own existence in the process. It needed to insert its inevitability into the historical narrative, and used my great-great-grandfather’s public memories to represent its [...] "evidence of inheritance." ...|$|E
500|$|In chapter 42, Sleipnir's origins are described. Gangleri (described {{earlier in}} the book as King Gylfi in disguise) asks High who the horse Sleipnir belongs to and what there is <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> High expresses {{surprise}} in Gangleri's {{lack of knowledge about}} Sleipnir and its origin. High tells a story set [...] "right {{at the beginning of the}} gods' settlement, when the gods established Midgard and built Val-Hall" [...] about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods in three seasons that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to this, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons with the help of no man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder was nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figured out who was responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki was to blame.|$|E
2500|$|Dancing Under the Red Star by Karl Tobien (...) {{tells the}} story of Margaret Werner, an {{athletic}} girl who moves to Russia right before the start of Stalin's terror. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who survived the Gulag <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. Mother, I'd like <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> You don't understand.|$|R
60|$|So I'm afraid you're miserable too. Write <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all.|$|R
60|$|Oh, it was {{you that}} ate it, then? Bruno didn't seem <b>to</b> like <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|So we {{begun to}} gaze, and he begun <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> {{out of the}} Arabian Nights.|$|E
60|$|Deronda then {{chose to}} point to some giant oaks worth looking at in their bareness. He also felt an {{interest}} in this piece of contemporary gossip, but he was satisfied that Mr. Vandernoodt had no more <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see,' said Mary, 'Mr. Snodgrass is {{very fond}} of Miss Emily, and Miss Emily's {{very fond of}} him, {{and if you were}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the old gentleman would carry you all away miles into the country, where you'd see nobody.' ...|$|E
60|$|The General {{seemed not}} to {{remember}} my part in that adventure, and I never had the heart <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R

60|$|Mister, {{have you}} ever had a real shock--something that came out of nowhere and just knocked you flat? I have, and I'm going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, if {{you must}} know. I was {{going to keep it}} to myself, for I didn’t think it would do any good <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I’ll tell you, but I don’t want it to go any further, unless it becomes {{necessary}} to speak.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, my man," [...] Walter {{said in a}} loud, steady voice, [...] "there are thirty {{soldiers}} in this house, and, if I give the word, you will get such a volley among you, that half of you will never go home <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> so I warn you to depart quietly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{that things}} got worse than ever; the wimmen and {{children}} stayed indoors {{and kept the}} doors shut, and the men never knew when they went out to work whether they’d come ’ome agin. They used to kiss their children afore they went out of a morning, and their wives too, some of ’em; even men who’d been married for years did. And several more of ’em see the tiger while they was at work, and came running ’ome <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "'The master {{says you}} are <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Bridget <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> so that, if they misbehave {{themselves}} inside the house, she can slip out {{and let you}} know. You understand that?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now see here, Mr. Stubbs," [...] said Toby, in alarm, [...] "you mustn't go <b>to</b> <b>telling</b> {{everybody}} <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> or Mr. Lord will know, an' then we'll be dished, sure." ...|$|R
50|$|For the 9th {{edition of}} Miss Earth, no single final {{question}} was asked. Instead, images were flashed on screen {{and each of}} the eight finalists were tasked <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> something <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well, I will,' said he, 'but {{there is}} nothing <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I and my wife have lived all our days on a moor in North Jutland, until this last year, when she took a fancy to go to Rome. We set out with our two sons but turned back long before we got there, and are now on our way home again. That's all my own story, and our two sons have lived with us all their days, so {{there is nothing}} more to be told about them either.' ...|$|E
60|$|With a roar {{of anger}} Buster Bear charged {{out of his}} hiding place. He rushed {{this way and that}} way! He roared with all his might! He was very terrible to see. Those who could fly, flew. Those who could climb, climbed. And those who were swift of foot, ran. A few who could neither fly nor climb nor run fast, hid and lay shaking and {{trembling}} for fear that Buster would find them. In less time than it takes <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Buster was alone. At least, he couldn't see any one.|$|E
60|$|Kitty laughed, {{and began}} to dance, feeling pleased and proud to find {{there was a good}} side to the shoes after all. Such twirlings and skippings as she made, such pretty steps and airy little bounds it was pretty to see; for it seemed as if her feet were bewitched, and went of themselves. The little girls were charmed, and tried to imitate her, but no one could, and they stood in a circle {{watching}} her dance till the bell rang, then all rushed in <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'They do. Sit down, Philip, and hear. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They know it. Poor Laura was {{so unhappy}} {{when you were}} ill, that mamma made it out from her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's an American who's {{staying in}} Florence. He came this mo'ning <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Even if he's drowned Mr. Hinkle {{believes}} he didn't mean to; {{he must have}} just fallen in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a paper," [...] Tommy said, nervous yet elated, and {{addressing}} all, [...] "that Grizel {{put in the}} coffin. She told me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>about</b> <b>it</b> when the cords fell on the lid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, Julian, {{there was}} nothing <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It</b> was a disagreeable {{incident}} altogether, and I considered then, as I have considered since, that it was hardly fair of {{me to go out}} with him when I was so certain of my shooting, and it was a hundred to one in my favour. I should never have done it if he had not forced the quarrel upon young Wilmington; for the young fellow must either have gone out, which would have been throwing away his life, or left the service." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the spring}} of 1907 I was the {{fortunate}} companion of the old plainsman on a trip across the desert, and a hunt in that wonderful country of yellow crags, deep canyons and giant pines. I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I want to show the color and beauty of those painted cliffs and the long, brown-matted bluebell-dotted aisles in the grand forests; I {{want to give a}} suggestion of the tang of the dry, cool air; and particularly I want to throw a little light upon the life and nature of that strange character and remarkable man, Buffalo Jones.|$|E
60|$|When at {{last the}} day came, the boys went off for a long walk, {{that they might have}} good appetites for dinner; as if they ever needed them! The girls {{remained}} at home to help set the table, and give last touches to various affairs which filled their busy little souls with anxiety. The school-room had been shut up since the night before, and Mr. Bhaer was forbidden to enter it on pain of a beating from Teddy, who guarded the door like a small dragon, though he was dying <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and nothing but his father's heroic self-denial in not listening, kept him from betraying a grand secret.|$|E

6000|$|MRS. BRENNAN. Don't be goin' {{out there}} till I tell you, you imp! I must speak {{to your father}} first. (Coming closer to him and {{lowering}} her voice.) Are you going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Colesworthy enfolded {{her in an}} approbatory embrace, {{and hurried}} home <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "There now!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "didn't I say that Lilian Budworth was a girl of good, sound common-sense?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are right. But {{if he had}} I don't see {{anything}} particularly immoral about it. If I had never done anything worse than that I shouldn't feel myself called to go upon my knees and cry peccavi. However, that ain't the point. The point is that a game of this sort don't at all suit my book, but," [...] here {{he looked at the}} clergyman shrewdly, [...] "why do you come <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> I should have thought that under all the circumstances you should have been glad. Isobel isn't likely to be exactly a beggar, you know, so it seems devilish queer that you should object, as I gather you do; unless it is to the kissing, which has been heard of before." ...|$|E
60|$|Though {{the myths}} which {{surround}} {{the arrival of}} the English in Britain have little historical value, they are yet interesting for the light which they throw incidentally upon the habits and modes of thought of the colonists. They have one character in common with all other legends, that they grow fuller and more circumstantial the further they proceed from the original time. Bæda, who wrote about A.D. 700, gives them in a very meagre form: the English Chronicle, compiled at the court of Ælfred, about A.D. 900, adds several important traditional particulars: while with the romantic Geoffrey of Monmouth, A.D. 1152, they assume the character of full and circumstantial tales. The less men knew about the conquest, the more they had <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{meeting at}} the station was a bright one, though so short, as {{scarcely}} to be worth the journey, if the value of such moments were to be reckoned by their number. There was Lord Marchmont to be spoken to, as well as Gerald, which broke into the time. Gerald looked very happy and pleasant. He said Edmund was the best fellow in the world, {{and that he had}} been very happy--shot lots of things--he wished he could stop <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Then Marian hurried what she had to say, while Lionel was looking after his luggage. [...] "Gerald, would you just try if you can do anything to spare Lionel's eyes? When you have the same things to do, could you not read to him, or something? they seem so much worse, and I am so afraid." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. He {{had put his}} cup down on {{the ground}} then, and he {{literally}} stepped into it. Some of the tea spirted over my dress--the gray one. I meant <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{what she}} said," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Brandreth ruefully. [...] "But I don't know. I have never spoken {{of it with}} her since I went <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> after I got Miss Northwick's note." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] Edwin counselled soothingly. [...] "Granser's all right. He's just gettin' to the Scarlet Death, ain't you, Granser? He's just goin' <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us <b>about</b> <b>it</b> right now. Sit down, Hare-Lip. Go ahead, Granser." ...|$|R
