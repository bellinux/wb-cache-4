The interpretation methods for interwell <b>tracer</b> <b>test</b> considering the geologic model have three kinds: analytic method, numerical simulation method, semi-analytic method.

Interpretations of the <b>tracer</b> <b>tests</b> in combination with geologic information, hydraulic-test information, and laboratory studies have resulted in a greatly improved conceptual model of transport processes within the Culebra. At locations where the transmissivity of the Culebra is low ( 4 x 10 {sup - 6 } m{sup 2 }/s), we conceptualize the Culebra as a heterogeneous, layered, fractured medium in which advection occurs largely through fractures and solutes diffuse between fractures and matrix at multiple rates. The variations in diffusion rate can be attributed to both variations in fracture spacing (or the spacing of advective pathways) and matrix heterogeneity. Flow and transport appear to be concentrated in the lower Culebra.

Although only a limited number of the many possible variations in fracture flow system properties is investigated, it is concluded that effective flow porosities derived from cross-hole <b>tracer</b> <b>tests</b> have a strong tendency to overpredict true flow porosities in fracture flow systems. This tendency toward overprediction decreases as the fracture conductivity relative to the background conductivity field decreases and as the orientation of the most conductive fractures becomes better aligned with the two wells. <b>Tracer</b> <b>tests</b> with small amounts of recirculation of water from the production well to the injection well are predicted to result in much better estimates of true flow porosity (on average), and with much less variability in the estimates, than tests with no reclrculation.

To obtain more reliable <b>tracer</b> <b>test</b> results, we propose a methodology that optimizes the design and analysis of tracer tests in a cross borehole mode by using vertical borehole flow rate measurements. Experiments using this approach, herein defined as the Bh-flow <b>tracer</b> <b>test,</b> have been performed by implementing three sequential steps: (1) single-hole flowmeter test, (2) cross-hole flowmeter test, and (3) <b>tracer</b> <b>test.</b> At the experimental site, core logging, pumping tests, and static water-level measurements were previously carried out to determine stratigraphy, fracture characteristics, and bulk hydraulic conductivity. Single-hole flowmeter testing makes it possible to detect the presence of vertical flows as well as inflow and outflow zones, whereas cross-hole flowmeter testing detects the presence of connections along sets of flow conduits or discontinuities intercepted by boreholes. Finally, the specific pathways and rates of groundwater flow through selected flowpaths are determined by tracer testing.

The ratio of longitudinal dispersivity alpha (L) and the flow length at the field scale is 1 : 10.
