5|$|The MESSENGER {{space probe}} may provide {{evidence}} regarding vulcanoids. Its opportunities {{will be limited}} because its instruments need to be pointed away from the Sun at all times <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage.</b> The spacecraft has already taken a few of a planned series of images of the outer regions of the vulcanoid zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{biological}} {{interest is}} focused on the species-rich mesotrophic grassland found across the site, which is actively maintained by grazing. The species present are predominantly grasses, although herbs and orchids are also found. The area has been classified as MG5 under the British National Vegetation Classification because of the species composition. The site is small and isolated, and therefore requires careful management <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage</b> caused by activity on neighbouring land.|$|E
5|$|The flyby {{spacecraft}} performed {{one of two}} divert maneuvers <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage.</b> A 14-minute burn {{was executed}} which slowed down the spacecraft. It was also reported that the communication link between the flyby and the impactor was functioning as expected. The impactor spacecraft executed three correction maneuvers {{in the final two}} hours before impact.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{from the}} release of Stage 2, changes {{were made to the}} hunter classes. Every class now {{possesses}} the ability to deploy a force field, an ability once exclusive to the Trapper class. It can be used to limit the Monster's movement to a small area. The ability's cooldown time decreases when the hunters deal enough damage to the monster. Starting from Stage 2, the health of all hunters regenerate if they manage <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage,</b> and they no longer have to rely on the Medic class.|$|E
5|$|The SSSI is {{economically}} {{important to}} the area because of the tourists it attracts for birdwatching and other outdoor activities, although sensitive wildlife sites are managed <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage</b> from {{the large numbers of}} visitors. Another threat is the encroachment of the sea on this soft coast. The Environment Agency considers that managed retreat {{is likely to be the}} long-term solution, and is working with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust to create new reserves inland to compensate for the loss of scarce habitats at the coast.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach2+ speeds; {{its maximum}} speed is Mach1.25 (about 950mph or 1,530km/h at altitude), but its {{low-level}} speed increased to Mach0.92 (700mph, 1,130km/h). The {{speed of the}} current version of the aircraft is limited by the need <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage</b> to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses serpentine air intake ducts (see S-duct) and fixed intake ramps, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.|$|E

5|$|Gustav {{had only}} {{effects on the}} Lesser Antilles. Large swells, light rain, and gusty winds were {{reported}} along the outer fringes of the hurricane. On August30, the Egyptian motorship Raseltin encountered rough seas in relation to Gustav, and the hull of the ship was damaged. The remnants of Gustav severely impacted a seismic research operation {{off the coast of}} the United Kingdom which took place between August25 and September12. The purpose of the operation was to collect seismic reflection profiles of the Rockfall Plateau. On September3, the members of the team had to quickly retrieve all buoys that were deployed <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage</b> to the sensors. However, some of the research tools were damaged before they were recovered. In all, the storm delayed the project by two days.|$|E
5|$|The player's craft has {{a limited}} amount of armour, which is {{depleted}} as the helicopter is hit by enemy fire. Should armour reach zero, the craft will be destroyed, costing the player a life. The player must outmanoeuvre enemies <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage,</b> but can replenish armour by means of power-ups or by airlifting rescued friendlies or captives to a landing zone. Vehicles have a finite amount of fuel which is steadily depleted as the level progresses. Should the fuel run out, the vehicle will crash, again costing the player a life. The craft can refuel by collecting fuel barrels. Vehicles also carry limited ammunition, which must be replenished by means of ammo crates.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{seeing the}} Unity approaching, Moore opened full sail and cut away his boats {{in an attempt}} to escape. As the Unity pulled closer, Moore opened fire. The Unity crew managed <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage</b> and pulled {{alongside}} the Margaretta. Led by Joseph Getchell and O'Brien's brother, John, the Unity crew stormed on board. Both sides exchanged musket shots as Moore tossed hand grenades onto the Unity. Moore was taken down by Samuel Watts with a musket shot to the chest. Once the Falmouth Packet caught up to the attack, it managed to pull along the other side of Moore's ship. With the combination of both crews, they were able to overwhelm the Margaretta.|$|E

5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage</b> to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage.</b> The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before midnight}} {{on the night}} of 8 April, Group 5, with Blücher in the lead, passed the outer ring of Norwegian coastal batteries. Lützow {{followed}} directly behind the flagship, with Emden astern. Heavy fog and neutrality requirements, which required the Norwegians to fire warning shots, permitted the Germans <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage.</b> The Norwegians, including those manning the guns at the Oscarsborg Fortress were on alert, however. Steaming into the Oslofjord at a speed of , the Germans came into range of the Norwegian guns; the 28cm, 15cm and 57mm guns opened fire on the invaders. During the ensuing Battle of Drøbak Sound, Blücher was hit by many shells and two torpedoes. She quickly capsized and sank with the loss of approximately 1,000 sailors and soldiers. Lützow was hit three times by 15cm shells from Oscarsborg's Kopås battery, causing significant damage.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{identification}} of a tropical disturbance on November6, a level four Typhoon Condition of Readiness (TCOR), {{the lowest level of}} alert, was raised for Guam. By November8, three days prior to Karen's arrival, this was raised to level three, prompting residents and military personnel to stock up on supplies. A public announcement was made that day as well, warning residents that the typhoon would likely strike the island. At 9:00p.m. on November10 (11:00UTC), a level two TCOR was put in place for Guam and a typhoon emergency was declared. Buildings were boarded up and emergency supplies were distributed. By 8:00a.m. (22:00UTC on November10), this was raised to level one, the highest level of warning. At this time, the USS Haverfield, USS Brister, USS Wandank, and USS Banner sought refuge from the storm over open waters. All personnel on the island were ordered to evacuate to typhoon-proof shelters and emergency rations were prepared. Strategic air command planes stationed on the island were relocated <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>damage.</b> Many residents on the island sought refuge in government buildings designed to withstand powerful storms while others evacuated to Wake Island. Roughly 24hours after the typhoon's passage, all warnings were discontinued.|$|E
