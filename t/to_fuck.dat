The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family.

Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E

It's going to become more and more difficult, and it's going to create more and more disillusioned people who become dishonest and angry and are willing <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> the next guy to get what they want. There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been so lucky that we've never had to do that. Part of it was because of our own tenacity, and part of it was because we were lucky.|$|E

"Sounding," [...] said Classic Rock, [...] "like it was {{recorded}} in a studio where the amps were set <b>to</b> <b>FUCK</b> YOU rather than 11 and armed with a dual attack of heavy and heaviest, Slayer's 10th studio album [...] offers a remarkable clarity of vision and strength of identity." ...|$|E
500|$|Around {{the time}} of the single's release, further full-page adverts {{appeared}} in the national press, this time asking readers [...] "***k The Millennium: Yes/No?", with a telephone number—the [...] "Millennium Crisis Line"—provided for voting: [...] "If you want <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> the millennium, press '1'. If not, press '2'." [...] The adverts were placed under the pseudonym K2 Plant Hire Ltd., who duly claimed that 18,436 (89%) of respondents wished <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> the millennium. [...] Thus, on 31 October 1997, K2 Plant Hire announced [...] "The People's Pyramid", an estimated -high structure built from as many house bricks as there were British 20th century births (estimated by the duo as 87 million), with no cost to the taxpayer. [...] According to Melody Maker, a statement posted on K2 Plant Hire's website [...] "pointedly contrast the intended virtues of their People's Pyramid with the drawbacks of the officially sponsored Millennium Dome". [...] The Guardian noted drily that the idea [...] "would appear to be far-fetched even by their own standards" [...] and [...] "Planning permission might pose a problem."

The lyrics 'Return to power draws near' is because he's waiting to get strong enough again to overthrow Heaven. And then 'Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears' is everybody's blood flowing into him. So basically, 'Raining Blood' is all the angels' blood falling on him." ...|$|E

500|$|Distribution rights <b>to</b> <b>Fuck</b> were {{obtained}} by THINKFilm in 2006. Movie chains {{did not use the}} film's title in their promotion, instead using references such as The Four-Letter Word Film. Mark Urman, chief of the theatrical division of THINKFilm, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that it was especially difficult (as an independent film distributor) to promote a film with a title media outlets did not wish to print. Urman told Variety that the intent of the production staff during promotion was a creative, original marketing campaign. THINKFilm marketed the documentary as a comprehensive, humorous look at the dichotomy between the taboo nature and cultural universality of the word [...] "fuck".|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1924 Reich {{published}} {{a series of}} papers {{on the idea of}} [...] "orgastic potency," [...] the ability to release the emotions from the muscles and lose the self in an uninhibited orgasm, an idea that Freud came to call Reich's [...] "Steckenpferd" [...] (hobby horse). Reich argued that psychic health and the ability to love depended on orgastic potency, the full discharge of the libido: [...] "Sexual release in the sex act must correspond to the excitement which leads up to it." [...] He wrote: [...] "It is not just <b>to</b> <b>fuck...</b> not the embrace in itself, not the intercourse. It is the real emotional experience of the loss of your ego, of your whole spiritual self." [...] He argued that orgastic potency was the goal of character analysis.|$|E

In 2006, The Edge said [...] "it never became a live favourite... I don't {{think that is what}} people come to U2 for." [...] In 2012, Willie Williams, U2's lighting designer and concert director, described the rehearsed version as [...] "extremely dramatic", saying [...] "in a stadium situation {{it could be argued that}} it might have the same dramatic impact as walking out on stage and telling the audience <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> off." ...|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Deuces" [...] is a slow, down-tempo R ballad that {{displays}} {{elements of}} house and pop music. The song has {{a length of}} four minutes and thirty-six seconds. It is backed by synth chords and [...] "eerie harmonies", with Brown's [...] "smooth vocals" [...] making use of auto-tune effects. According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, the song contains lyrical content about [...] "breaking {{it off with a}} girl after failed attempts to make the relationship work". In the first verse, Brown sings: [...] "All that bullshit is for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture / Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> up / You'll regret the day when I find another girl, that knows just what I need / She knows just what I mean." ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe {{compiled}} {{his list}} of most annoying TV characters. Jenny came second on the list and he stated: [...] "Wow.

[...] He also opined that Kirshner's portrayal of Jenny's [...] "vanity and chameleon-like qualities" [...] was perhaps too convincing. He perceived scriptwriters as eventually understanding the [...] "profundity of Jenny's annoying effect", and decided to escalate it. Gilbert concluded that in early seasons, when writers wanted the audience's sympathy with Jenny's journey of self-realization, he [...] "wanted her to leave The Planet for good." [...] Regarding Jenny's mental state, Lydia Martin from The Miami Herald quipped [...] "(Marina) sauntered into The Planet just <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> with Jenny's head.

500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{track is}} [...] "American Wedding", a 7-minute remake of [...] "Hotel California" [...] by American rock band Eagles.

[...] The song has a [...] "totally unexpected ending for a song told as a flashback." [...] The album ends with [...] "Nature Feels", a reinterpretation of MGMT's [...] "Electric Feel". The song exhibits Ocean as an [...] "openly fun character", opening the song with the line [...] "I've been meaning <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> you in the garden." [...] According to Pitchfork, no matter the mood, Ocean is always [...] "quick to add fine particulars that make his songs his songs". Pitchfork called [...] "Nature Feel" [...] an [...] "MGMT-sampling Garden of Eden fuck ode".|$|E

500|$|In March 1989, the Chili Peppers {{embarked}} on a two-month tour to break-in the new lineup. The [...] "Positive Mental Octopus tour" [...] saw the band play small venues throughout the United States, including several concerts on the East and West Coast. During this period, Frusciante began to assert more energy and his ego [...] "got a little swollen", according to Flea, [...] "He was running around being rude to girls and getting them pissed off. But that's to be expected, I mean, shit, you're 18 years old {{and you want to}} get laid really bad {{and all of a sudden}} you're in a band, the girls want <b>to</b> <b>fuck.</b> You're bound to go crazy." [...] Another incident, following a performance at the George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, caused legal repercussions; a student accused Kiedis of engaging in sexual misconduct and indecent exposure. The vocalist was subsequently arrested and released on bail pending a trial that was to be set for a later date.|$|E
500|$|I think that's bullshit. The word {{police can}} fuck off. I don't {{want to be}} policed! I'm not {{interested}} in political correctness. The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word [...] "cunt", I was horrified. People were calling each other cunts! And then I realized that, in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the back and said, [...] "Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!" [...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". If I say to you, [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me." [...] If I say, [...] "Why are you being such a bitch to me?," [...] well, that means something else.|$|E
500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me show you what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band was {{released}} in November 1969 through Atco and Capricorn Records. Atco was a subsidiary label of Atlantic Records, and Walden had not even created a logo for Capricorn Records; instead, the LP featured an Atco label with a [...] "barely noticeable" [...] line reading [...] "Capricorn Records Series." [...] The record received a poor commercial response, selling fewer than 35,000 copies upon initial release. Executives suggested to Walden that he relocate the band to New York or Los Angeles to [...] "acclimate" [...] them to the industry. [...] "They wanted us to act [...] "like a rock band" [...] and we just told them <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> themselves," [...] remembered Trucks. For their part, {{the members of the}} band remained optimistic, electing to stay in the South.

The band rented a $165-a-month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon, the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of New York City's Idlewild Airport. Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was [...] "where the brotherhood came to pass," [...] according to roadie Kim Payne; [...] "There was a pact made out there around a campfire—all for one and one for all ... Everybody believed [...] 100 percent." [...] Much of the material presented on the band's second album, Idlewild South, originated at the cabin. Oakley's wife rented a large Victorian home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon and the band moved into what they dubbed [...] "the Big House" [...] in March 1970.|$|E
500|$|Accounts of Wright's {{subsequent}} {{departure from}} the band differ. In his autobiography, , Mason says that Waters called O'Rourke, who was travelling to the US on the QE2, {{and told him to}} have Wright out of the band by the time Waters arrived in LA to mix the album. [...] In another version recorded by a later historian of the band, Waters called O'Rourke and asked him to tell Wright about the new recording arrangements, to which Wright allegedly responded: [...] "Tell Roger <b>to</b> <b>fuck</b> off..." [...] Wright disagreed with this recollection, stating that the band had agreed to record only through the spring and early summer, and that he had no idea they were so far behind schedule. Mason later wrote that Waters was [...] "stunned and furious", and felt that Wright was not doing enough to help complete the album. [...] Gilmour was on holiday in Dublin when he learnt of Waters's ultimatum, and tried to calm the situation. He later spoke with Wright and gave him his support, but reminded him about his minimal contribution to the album. [...] Waters, however, insisted that Wright leave, or he would refuse to release The Wall. Several days later, worried about their financial situation, and the failing interpersonal relationships within the band, Wright quit. News of his departure was kept from the music press. [...] Although his name did not appear anywhere on the original album, he was employed as a session musician on the band's subsequent The Wall tour.|$|E
