40|$|This study covers fish larval survey {{conducted}} by the Philippine multi-purpose vessel MV DA-BFAR in the Pacific seaboard and Celebes Sea in May to June 2010. The composition, distribution and abundance of fish eggs and fish larvae are described based on 40 sampling stations. There were 87 families identified and 8. 8 % of the total samples were Scombridae (<b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerels).</b> Of the <b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerels,</b> 39 % were yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), 21 % skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), 15 % bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and 15 % mackerels.

40|$|Uncertainties {{surrounding}} the evolutionary {{origin of the}} epipelagic fish family Scombridae (<b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerels)</b> are symptomatic of the difficulties in resolving suprafamilial relationships within Percomorpha, a hyperdiverse teleost radiation that contains approximately 17, 000 species placed in 13 ill-defined orders and 269 families. Here we find that scombrids share a common ancestry with 14 families based on (i) bioinformatic analyses using partial mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences from all percomorphs deposited in GenBank (10, 733 sequences) and (ii) subsequent mitogenomic analysis based on 57 species from those targeted 15 families and 67 outgroup taxa. Morphological heterogeneity among these 15 families is so extraordinary {{that they have been}} placed in six different perciform suborders. However, members of the 15 families are either coastal or oceanic pelagic in their ecology with diverse modes of life, suggesting that they represent a previously undetected adaptive radiation in the pelagic realm. Time-calibrated phylogenies imply that scombrids originated from a deep-ocean ancestor and began to radiate after the end-Cretaceous when large predatory epipelagic fishes were selective victims of the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. We name this clade of open-ocean fishes containing Scombrida...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tunas</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerels,</b> {{members of}} the teleost fish family Scombridae, are epipelagic predators capable of {{attaining}} high swimming speeds as well as undertaking long-distance migrations (for reviews, see Beamish, 1978; Magnuson, 1978; Joseph et al., 1988). All members of this family possess anatomical characteristics, such as a streamlined body shape and a high-aspect-ratio caudal propeller, that reduce drag or increase thrust production (Webb, 1975; Collette, 1978; Magnuson, 1978; Dewar and Graham, 1994). Scombrids also have caudal keels and finlets along their narrow caudal peduncles that are thought to aid in minimizing the turbulence encountered by the caudal fin as it moves laterally during swimming (Aleev, 1963; Collette, 1978; Magnuson, 1978). Although the tunas share these morphological traits with other scombrids, they alone can conserve metabolically derived heat to maintain {{the temperature of the}} slow-twitch, oxidative locomotor muscle significantly above that of the water and, thus, gain some independence from environmental temperature (Carey et al., 1971; Graham, 1973). Thus, tunas are endothermic and are considered to be regional heterotherms. The tunas constitute a monophyletic clade within the family Scombridae, and all taxa of the sister groups, the bonitos, mackerels and Spanish mackerels, are ectothermic (Carey e...|$|E
40|$|Lagonoy Gulf {{is a major}} {{fishing ground}} in the Philippines. It is large (3071 km 2) and deep (80 % of its area is 800 - 1200 m) where {{channels}} opening to the Pacific Ocean are entrenched. Its annual fishery production of 26, 000 MT in 1994 slightly decreased to 20, 000 MT in 2004. During the same 10 -year period, catches of higher order, predatory fishes decreased and were replaced by herbivores and planktivores. Scombrids such as <b>tunas</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerels</b> composed 51 - 54 % of total harvest. Of the 480 fish species identified in the gulf, 131 or 27 % are seaweed-associated or these fishes have utilized the seaweed habitat for juvenile settlement, refuge, breeding and feeding sites. The seaweeds occupy solely distinct beds (e. g., Sargassum) or overlap with seagrass and coral reef areas. About half of all fishes (49. 6 % or 238 species) are coral reef fishes. The most speciose fish genera are Chaetodon (19 spp.), Lutjanus (18 spp.), Pomacentrus (17 spp.) and Siganus (14 spp.). Among them, Siganus (Siganids or rabbitfishes) is the most speciose, commercially-important genus contributing 560 mt-yr- 1 to the total fishery production, including about 60 mt siganid juvenile catch. In recent years, {{there has been a}} continuing decline of siganid juvenile production. The major reasons are unregulated catching of juveniles and ovefishing of pre-adults and adults. The paper provides a general discussion about the diversity, fishery status and seasonality of occurrence of siganid juveniles, particularly along San Miguel Island, where most (90 %) of the juvenile harvest originates. It concludes with recommendations (including on marine protected areas) and research needs toward sustaining the resource...|$|E

40|$|In Spain, certain {{population-based}} {{studies have}} shown high blood mercury (Hg) levels due to the high consumption of fish. Some studies have stated {{that one of the}} most consumed fish in Spain is canned tuna. Different Spanish organisms consider that it is safe to consume canned tuna as it supposedly has a low mercury content, particularly in so-called light tuna. However, in Spain light tuna is mainly yellowfin <b>and</b> bigeye <b>tuna,</b> while in other countries it is mainly skipjack tuna. This study analyzed 36 cans of the most popular brands in Spain and examined the influence of the type of tuna, packaging medium (olive oil, sunflower seed oil, water or marinade), different brands, prices and expiration dates. Mercury concentrations (mg/kg) were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry and thermal decomposition amalgamation. The medians observed were (mg/kg) : light tuna: 0. 314; IQR: 0. 205 - 0. 594, white tuna: 0. 338; IQR: 0. 276 - 0. 558, skipjack: 0. 311; IQR: 0. 299 - 0. 322, frigate tuna: 0. 219; IQR 0. 182 - 0. 257 and mackerel: 0. 042; IQR 0. 029 -  0. 074. We found statistically significant differences between white <b>tuna,</b> light <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerel</b> (p = 0. 004); light <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerel</b> (p = 0. 002) <b>and</b> white <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerel</b> (p = 0. 006). However, we found no differences between white <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> light <b>tuna,</b> or among packaging medium, brands, prices or expiration dates. The limit of 0. 500 mg/kg of mercury in canned tuna was exceeded by the following percentages of the cans: 33. 3 % of light tuna, 16. 7 % of white <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> 0 % of Skipjack, frigate <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerel.</b> The mercury content of the cans of Spanish light tuna that were analyzed was variable and high. The results of this study indicate that stricter regulation of Hg in canned tuna is necessary. Until then, it is safer to recommend that vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women consume canned mackerel, which has a markedly lower mercury content. </p...|$|R

40|$|Specialisations in excitation–contraction {{coupling}} {{may have}} {{played an important role}} in the evolution of endothermy and high cardiac performance in scombrid fishes. We examined aspects of Ca 2 + handling in cardiomyocytes from Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), yellowfin <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus albacares) <b>and</b> Pacific bluefin <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus orientalis). The whole-cell voltage-clamp technique was used to measure the temperature sensitivity of the L-type Ca 2 + channel current (ICa), density, and steady-state and maximal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + content (ssSRload and maxSRload). Current–voltage relations, peak ICa density and charge density of ICa were greatest in <b>mackerel</b> <b>and</b> yellowfin at all temperatures tested. ICa density and kinetics were temperature sensitive in all species studied, and the magnitude of this response was not related to the thermal preference of the species. SRload was greater in atrial than in ventricular myocytes in the Pacific bluefin <b>tuna,</b> <b>and</b> in species that are more cold tolerant (bluefin <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerel).</b> ICa <b>and</b> SRload were particularly small in bonito, suggesting the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger plays a more pivotal role in Ca 2 + entry into cardiomyocytes of this species. Our comparative approach reveals that the SR of cold-tolerant scombrid fishes has a greater capacity for Ca 2 + storage. This specialisation may contribute to the temperature tolerance and thermal niche expansion of the bluefin <b>tuna</b> <b>and</b> <b>mackerel...</b>|$|R
