25|$|In para-Alpine skiing, {{the skier}} uses a mono-ski, which is {{required}} to have breaks {{on both sides of}} the ski. The para-Nordic sit-ski configuration has two skis. Skiers in this class use outrigger skis for balance, as leverage to right <b>themselves</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> fall, and for turning. A factoring system is used in the sport to allow different classes to compete against each other when there are too few individual competitors in one class in a competition. Factoring for the 2011/2012 alpine ski season was done based on subclass, with LW10.1 factoring being 0.7234 for Slalom, 0.7794 for Giant Slalom, 0.7942 for Super-G and 0.8004 for downhill, and LW10.2 factoring being 0.7399 for Slalom, 0.8152 for Giant Slalom, 0.8069 for Super-G and 0.8183 for downhill. The percentage for the para-Nordic 2012/2013 ski season was 86% and for LW10.5 was 91%.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{a history}} of disputed and {{lopsided}} land sales, there were strict laws in place regarding the sale of lands by the Native Americans. This handcuffed them {{from being able to}} support <b>themselves</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had no other means of generating income, such as in old age or to settle their debts. On this subject, Timothy lobbied the government during the winter of 1763-1764 and wrote to Andrew Oliver in November 1764, asking that they be allowed the same rights to sell their lands as the English. By this time, most citizens on both sides, including Timothy Woodbridge, were in favor of creating a separate township for the Native Americans and the Woodbridge family and friends. However, when the commissioners proposed that the English would then have to support their own school and church, without the mission funding, the proposal was almost universally opposed by the English.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 10th century, various Islamic sects rose in al-Us̲h̲būna and converted the Hispano-Roman population. These sects were a form of political organization in revolt against the hierarchical system of the Muslim conquerors which institutionalised obstacles to their social mobility. The elite descendants of Muhammad ranked first, then full-blooded Arabs, then Berbers or Moors, and lastly the Arabised Muslims and Hispano-Romans. Several Hispano-Roman leaders emerged, including Ali ibn Ashra and others, who claimed to be prophets or descendants of `Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib, regarded by Shias as the first Imam. With their allies in other cities they started civil wars against the Sunni Arab troops. The Mozarabs and the Jews were treated even worse, sometimes suffering persecution that, although regrettable in modern eyes, was a pale reflection of what the Catholics would do not only against Muslims and Jews, but even against fellow Christians <b>themselves</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> reconquered the land.|$|E

25|$|Several factors make large tree holes more {{valuable}} to Megaloprepus than small ones. Not only can their greater volume accommodate more naiads at a time, {{they have a}} higher density of prey {{in the form of}} tadpoles and mosquito larvae; this allows the naiads to grow more rapidly and reach adulthood sooner. In forests with a dry season, larger tree holes can last nearly a month longer before drying out completely. As a result, large tree holes can produce three cohorts per season, totalling perhaps a few dozen new adults, while only one or two emerge from a small hole. Large tree holes also give Megaloprepus better chances of surviving to emerge if one of its slower-growing relatives in genus Mecistogaster is already present. In a tree hole small enough to be effectively patrolled by a single naiad, the first species to hatch is likely to eat all newcomers, but in a large one Megaloprepus can escape long enough to outgrow and eventually eat an older resident. Finally, probably due to the greater abundance of prey, larger tree holes produce larger males that will be better able to defend a territory <b>themselves</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> reach reproductive maturity.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{interpret}} Maria's story ironically, {{arguing that}} the juxtaposition of Maria's sentimental and romantic narrative with Jemima's harsh and bleak narrative encourages such a reading.

While extremely rare, white-colored crocodiles and alligators do exist in other places.
