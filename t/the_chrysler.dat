5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building {{appears in}} several films set in New York {{and is often}} {{considered}} one of the best buildings in the city. In a 2001 survey, architectural critics ranked <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> as the third best building in the country. In the summer of 2005, the Skyscraper Museum in Lower Manhattan asked 100 architects, builders, critics, engineers, historians, and scholars, among others, to choose their 10 favorites among 25 of the city's towers. <b>The</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building came in first place, as 90% of respondents placed the building among their top 10 favorite buildings. In 2007, the building ranked ninth among 150 buildings in the AIA's List of America's Favorite Architecture.|$|E
5|$|These {{top stories}} are very narrow with low, sloped ceilings, and are useful only for holding {{radio-broadcasting}} and other mechanical and electrical equipment. Television station WCBS-TV (Channel 2) originally transmitted {{from the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> starting in 1938. The installation continued through the early 1950s, when it moved to the Empire State Building due to competition from RCA's transmitter at the latter tower. For many years, WPAT-FM and WTFM (now WKTU) also used <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building as a transmission site, but they also moved to the Empire State Building by the 1970s. Since then, there have not been any commercial broadcast stations located at <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{building}}, several large tenants leased space in <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building. <b>The</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Corporation moved into the building in 1930 and used the tower as its division headquarters until the 1950s. The mapmaking company Texaco and the magazine magnate Henry Luce were also two of the original tenants. Texaco moved out in 1977 because it wanted a more suburban workplace in Purchase, New York, for its employees. Luce's company Time Inc. was headquartered in the building until 1937, when it moved to the Rockefeller Center due to the latter containing more office space.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building is an Art Deco-style {{skyscraper}} {{located on}} the East Side of Midtown Manhattan in New York City, {{at the intersection of}} 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan. At , the structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before it was surpassed by the Empire State Building in 1931. It is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel structure. , <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> is the fifth-tallest building in the city.|$|E
5|$|The added {{height of}} the spire allowed <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building to surpass 40 Wall Street as the tallest {{building}} {{in the world and}} the Eiffel Tower as the tallest structure. <b>The</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than , and as one newspaper noted, the tower was also taller than the highest points of five states. The new Chrysler Building, appraised at $14 million, was also exempt from city taxes as per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union. Although the city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, Cooper Union opposed that measure, and because <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.|$|E
5|$|Construction on {{the first}} {{segments}} of <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Freeway started on January 30, 1959. The area where the freeway was built was called Black Bottom, a historic district that received {{its name from the}} soil found there by French explorers. In the 1940s and 1950s, the area was the home to a community of African-American entrepreneurs and businesses that rivaled Harlem in New York City. Black Bottom was one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, and at the time of freeway construction, it had wooden sewers and dilapidated buildings. The area, like Corktown to the west of downtown, was targeted for urban renewal and infrastructure improvements in the 1950s and 1960s, which included <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Freeway and public housing projects.|$|E
50|$|Fords had won 34 races before NASCAR {{adjusted}} {{the rules to}} allow <b>the</b> <b>Chryslers</b> to compete, {{but it was too}} late in the 55 event season for them to mount a championship challenge.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Jean Outland <b>Chrysler</b> Library {{is one of}} {{the largest}} art {{libraries}} in the South. The collection covers the entire history of world art, with special emphasis on material relevant to <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler's</b> permanent collection. <b>The</b> library subscribes to several hundred art-related journals, has an extensive collection of current and historical auction catalogues, and exchanges publications with 400 art museums around the world.|$|R
5000|$|DeSoto fared {{far worse}} than Chrysler for 1934. Without any [...] "standard" [...] car to sell, DeSoto's sales numbers plunged. And while the Airflow design looked {{somewhat}} sleek on <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler's</b> longer wheelbase, <b>the</b> DeSoto appeared to be short and stubby.|$|R
5|$|I-375 and <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Freeway {{begin at}} Jefferson Avenue and St. Antoine Street in {{downtown}} Detroit near the Renaissance Center. They run east before turning north. Just {{about a mile}} (1.6km) after the southern terminus, I-375 meets the Fisher Freeway which carries I-75 north of downtown. At this interchange, I-75 takes ramps to leave the Fisher Freeway and use <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Freeway, replacing I-375. I-375 is a four-lane freeway south of the I-75 interchange, where it widens to six lanes. The entire length of I-375 is included on the National Highway System, a network of roadways {{that are important to}} the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|On the 42nd Street side of <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building, a {{staircase}} {{from the street}} leads directly under the building to the New York City Subway station at Grand Central–42nd Street. It {{is part of the}} structure's original design. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which at the time was the operator of all the routes serving the 42nd Street station, originally sued to block construction of the new entrance because it would cause crowding, but the New York City Board of Transportation pushed to allow the corridor anyway. Chrysler eventually built and paid for the building's subway entrance. Work on the new entrance started in March 1930 and it opened along with <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building two months later.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the structure was built by Walter Chrysler, the head of <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Corporation. <b>The</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The building served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. Although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it, as Walter P. Chrysler decided {{to pay for it}} himself, so that his children could inherit it.|$|E
5|$|Chrysler {{realized}} that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having ordered Van Alen to change <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler's</b> original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to the narrow steel spire. However, the Empire State's developer John J. Raskob reviewed the plans and {{realized that}} he could add five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80-story building, and subsequently acquired the nearby plots needed to support that building's height extension. Two days later, the Empire State Building's co-developer, former Governor Al Smith, announced the updated plans for that skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of , higher than <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler's</b> 71st-floor observation deck.|$|R
50|$|For 1951 the Saratoga {{was built}} on the shorter 125.5 inch {{wheelbase}} but offered <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler's</b> famed Hemi V8. Also offered was Hydraguide power steering, an industry first, and Fluid Torque Drive, a true torque converter in place of Fluid Drive's fluid coupling.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> first European <b>Chrysler</b> was <b>the</b> French built <b>Chrysler</b> 180, {{launched}} in 1970. The 180 {{was the result}} of combining two projects that were previously being developed independently by Rootes and Simca. <b>The</b> larger engined <b>Chrysler</b> 2 Litre joined the range soon afterwards.|$|R
5|$|The family {{sold the}} {{building}} in 1953 to William Zeckendorf for its assessed price of $18 million. The 1953 deal included the annex and the nearby Graybar Building, which along with <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building sold for a combined $52 million. In 1957, <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building, its annex, and the nearby Graybar Building across 43rd Street was sold for $66 million in what {{was reported to be}} the largest real estate sale at the time. In 1960, it was purchased by Sol Goldman and Alex DiLorenzo, who received a mortgage from the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1961, the building's stainless steel elements, including the needle, crown, gargoyles, and entrance doors, were polished for the first time. A group of ten workers steam-cleaned the facade below the 30th floor, and manually cleaned the portion of the tower above the 30th floor, for a cost of about $200,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{lobby is}} the only {{publicly}} accessible part of <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building. When the building opened, {{the first and second}} floors housed an exhibition of Chrysler vehicles. This exhibition was closed before World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} in the show were provided by <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Corporation, {{as opposed to the}} parent series' vehicles that came from the Ford Motor Company. Although Jeeps are also prominent in the show, the brand itself would not become a part of Chrysler until the AMC buyout that occurred in 1987.|$|E
5000|$|Chrysler Australia's {{parent company}} began {{working closely with}} Mitsubishi Motors Corporation after they {{acquired}} a 15 percent interest in the company in 1971, with <b>the</b> result that <b>Chrysler</b> Australia began building <b>the</b> Mitsubishi-designed <b>Chrysler</b> Valiant Galant. <b>The</b> association with Mitsubishi also gave Chrysler Australia another winner - <b>the</b> 1977 <b>Chrysler</b> Sigma. With a range of 4-cylinder [...] "Silent Shaft" [...] engines, competitive pricing, [...] "Japanese" [...] style {{and the availability of}} a luxurious [...] "SE" [...] version, with optional leather trim (an innovative sales approach in its era), <b>the</b> Sigma marked <b>Chrysler's</b> sales comeback. Sigma soon became market leader in its class.|$|R
5000|$|The team {{now known}} as the Owen Sound NorthStars began life in 1973 as a Junior C team called the Satellites. They were the first junior {{lacrosse}} team in Owen Sound since <b>the</b> <b>Chryslers</b> folded in 1950 after a miserable season in which they went 1-13.|$|R
50|$|SmithGroup {{designed}} <b>the</b> attached <b>Chrysler</b> Headquarters (1996) tower {{crowned with}} the pentastar marque. The Headquarters tower was constructed between 1993 and 1996. <b>The</b> Walter P. <b>Chrysler</b> Museum, now closed {{was also on}} the campus.|$|R
5|$|Upon opening, {{there were}} mixed {{reviews of the}} building's design, ranging from inane and unoriginal to modernist and iconic. However, <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building has slowly evolved into a paragon of the Art Deco {{architectural}} style, and in 2007, it was ranked ninth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.|$|E
5|$|Many of Daniel Libeskind's {{original}} concepts {{from the}} 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design. One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries {{and a more}} traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline. The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building. It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building was the Reynolds Building, {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds. Prior to his involvement in planning the building, Reynolds was best known for developing Coney Island's Dreamland amusement park. However, when the amusement park was destroyed in a fire in 1911, Reynolds turned his attention to Manhattan real estate, where {{he set out to}} build the tallest building in the world.|$|E

50|$|A T-18/T-18a four-speed {{manual gearbox}} was {{standard}} for all years, while through 1979 the General Motors' Turbo-Hydramatic TH400, more commonly fitted to 3/4- and 1-ton trucks rather than SUVs, was optional. For comparison, the Chevy Blazer used the TH350 automatic. After 1979, the TH400 {{was replaced by}} <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler's</b> TorqueFlite 727.|$|R
50|$|With more testing {{following}} their debut at Donington, {{the team was}} able to improve and <b>the</b> three <b>Chrysler</b> LMPs appeared at Le Mans showing some speed. One of the three entries managed to take the sixth fastest qualifying time (Olivier Beretta driving), beating out both of the Bentley EXP Speed 8s. During the race itself, <b>the</b> <b>Chryslers</b> were able {{to remain in the}} top ten for most of the race until mechanical woes took out one entry halfway through the race. In the final hours, while running fourth and fifth, another Chrysler LMP suffered a fire on the Mulsannes straight, taking it out of the race. <b>The</b> lone remaining <b>Chrysler</b> was left to take a fourth-place finish, 23 laps behind the winning Audi R8.|$|R
5|$|The {{steel tip}} brought <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Building to {{a height of}} , greatly {{exceeding}} 40 Wall Street's height. However, contemporary news media did not write of the spire's erection, nor were there any press releases celebrating the spire's erection. Even the New York Herald Tribune, which had virtually continuous coverage of the tower's construction, did not report on the spire's installation until days after the spire had been raised.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} Army, Carradine became serious about his acting pursuits. It {{was at that}} time that he was advised to change his name to avoid {{confusion}} with his famous father. In 1963, he made his television debut on an episode of Armstrong Circle Theatre. Several other television roles were to follow including appearances on Bob Hope Presents <b>the</b> <b>Chrysler</b> Theatre and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. He made his feature film debut in 1964 in Taggart, a western based on a novel by Louis L'Amour.|$|E
