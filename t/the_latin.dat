50|$|He waged war {{successfully}} against <b>the</b> <b>Latins,</b> and {{a number}} of them were settled on the Aventine Hill.

50|$|The Battle of Trifanum {{was fought}} in 340 BC between the Roman Republic and <b>the</b> <b>Latins.</b> <b>The</b> Roman force {{was led by}} Manlius Imperiosus. He pursued <b>the</b> <b>Latins</b> to <b>the</b> north {{following}} the Battle of Vesuvius and met them at Trifanum {{near the mouth of}} the Liri River. Livy records that the two forces dumped their baggage and fought where they met. He claimed that the Romans were victorious and that their victory was so crushing that afterwards, when the consul entered Latium, <b>the</b> <b>Latins</b> immediately surrendered As the war continued for another two years it may be that <b>the</b> <b>Latins</b> were surprised at Trifanum and dispersed.|$|R
50|$|One year later, Manlius {{defeated}} <b>the</b> <b>Latins</b> at <b>the</b> Battle of Trifanum. <b>The</b> <b>Latins</b> {{were finally}} defeated in 338 BC at the Battle of Antium {{on the river}} Astura, where Gaius Maenius commanded the Roman naval forces which defeated <b>the</b> combined <b>Latin</b> armies of Antium, Lanuvium, Aricia and Velitrae.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly afterwards, in 495 BC, <b>the</b> <b>Latins</b> {{resisted}} {{calls from}} the Volsci to join with them to attack Rome, and {{went so far as}} to deliver the Volscian ambassadors to Rome.

A great crowd formed, including <b>the</b> freed <b>Latin</b> prisoners, who thanked their captors.

5|$|After {{months of}} negotiation, John and the envoys from <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> Empire signed a treaty in Perugia which was {{confirmed}} by Pope Gregory on 9 April 1229. John was elected emperor of <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> Empire for life as senior co-ruler with Baldwin II, who would marry John's daughter Marie. The treaty also prescribed that although Baldwin would rule <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> lands in Asia Minor when he was 20 years old, he would become sole emperor only after John's death. John also stipulated that his sons would inherit Epirus and Macedonia, but the two regions still belonged to Emperor of Thessalonica Theodore Doukas.|$|E
50|$|According to the Roman {{foundation}} myth as relayed by Livy, the Etruscans, led by King Mezentius {{allied with}} King Turnus of the Rutuli, attacked <b>the</b> <b>Latins</b> and <b>the</b> exiled Trojans, led by Latinus and Aeneas respectively. <b>The</b> <b>Latins</b> and Trojans were victorious, and Turnus {{was killed in}} battle. Peace was afterwards concluded {{on the basis that}} the river Tiber would be the common boundary between the Etruscans and <b>the</b> <b>Latins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Volsci began {{preparations}} for war, enlisting {{the aid of}} the Hernici and approaching <b>the</b> <b>Latins.</b> Stung by their recent defeat at Lake Regillus, <b>the</b> <b>Latins</b> were in no mood for war, and instead delivered the Volscian envoys to Rome, warning the Senate of the pending military threat. In gratitude, six thousand Latin prisoners were released, and the Senate agreed to consider a treaty with <b>the</b> <b>Latins,</b> which had previously been refused.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Latins</b> entered Samnium; <b>the</b> Roman-Samnite army {{moved to}} the Fucine Lake, then, {{avoiding}} Latium, entered the Campanian territory and attacked <b>the</b> <b>Latins</b> and Campanians near Mount Vesuvius. In the Battle of Vesuvius, the Romans, under consuls Decius Mus and T. Manlius Torquatus Imperiosus, defeated <b>the</b> <b>Latins.</b> According to Roman sources, Manlius reinstated army discipline by executing his son for his unintentional disobedience, while Decius sacrificed his own life to the gods for the Roman victory.|$|R
5|$|After {{recovering}} surprisingly fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> War. Rome defeated the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule.|$|E

5|$|All {{copies of}} Hymn {{are found in}} manuscripts of the Historia ecclesiastica or its {{translation}}, where they serve as either a gloss to Bede's Latin translation of the Old English poem, or, {{in the case of}} the Old English version, a replacement for Bede's translation in the main text of the History. Despite this close connection with Bede's work, the Hymn does not appear to have been transmitted with the Historia ecclesiastica regularly until relatively late in its textual history. Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy the vernacular text of the Hymn in manuscripts of <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> Historia. In three cases, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43, and Winchester, Cathedral I, the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter-century or more after the main text was first set down. Even when the poem is in the same hand as the manuscript's main text, there is little evidence to suggest that it was copied from the same exemplar as <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> Historia: nearly identical versions of the Old English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions of <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> text; closely related copies of <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> Historia sometimes contain very different versions of the Old English poem. With the exception of the Old English translation, no single recension of the Historia ecclesiastica is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of the vernacular poem.|$|E
