5000|$|Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Plane was a [...] {{narrow gauge}} incline railway that {{ran from the}} {{northern}} end of the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel to Carson Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Originally built to carry coal from the Jacob Beltzhoover mine, it was sold by the Pittsburgh Coal Company to the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad in 1871. It was used only for coal as early as 1864, passenger traffic was added in 1874 for the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad. For safety reasons, the tunnel was closed to passenger traffic, and passengers were diverted to the Castle Shannon Incline, constructed in 1890. Emergency use of the plane for passengers and freight continued as late as 1900. [...] Its use for the transport of passengers and freight other than coal was made obsolete by the Mount Washington Transit <b>Tunnel.</b> <b>Operation</b> as a coal incline continued until May 1, 1912.It was operated as a gravity plane, with returning empty cars being pulled to the mine mouth by the weight of the descending full coal cars.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{operation}} safety of expressway tunnels on operation {{efficiency of the}} expressway network is significant because tunnels are key sections in the network. In case of emergency, e. g. traffic accidents, it brings much difficulty to rescue work and may paralyze traffic in the tunnel and even that of the entire expressway. In order to guarantee the <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> safety, {{it is necessary to}} monitor the operation of tunnels and take effective measures to keep safety under control. This paper focuses on operation risk modeling of expressway tunnels and development of a monitoring-warning system for real time expressway <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> control. The research includes an investigation of expressway <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation,</b> risk analysis, development of risk modeling and intelligent monitoring-warning system and a pilot project. Over thirty cases of expressway <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> were investigated and filed data of the operation situations including traffic accidents, running speed, acceleration and deceleration of vehicles were collected. Then, the operation conditions and risks were analyzed and the operation risk model was then developed to solve the problem. Based on the investigation data of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation,</b> five types of emergency incidents were identified and classified with regard to the effect of incidents on the <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> risks and efficiency. The emergency incidents were defined respectively as traffic incidents, severe weather, overspeeding, dangerous goods transportation and scheduled event. These incidents were graded in relation to the levels of effect on <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> safety. Comprehensive traffic control measures for each incident were put forward respectively in order to achieve effective tunnel traffic management, which included speed limit, safe driving distance, closed lanes and traffic guides. To implement real time control and effective <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> management, an intelligent tunnel monitoring-warning system including the system software and relative equipment were developed with functions of information collection, information processing and transmission and information release. A pilot project has been implemented at Huotanwan tunnel (left line) on the Baomao expressway (G 65) in Hunan province, China...|$|E
