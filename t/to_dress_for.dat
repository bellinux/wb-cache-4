Walther demonstrates his understanding by composing two sections of a new Prize Song in a more acceptable style than his previous effort from act 1. Sachs writes down the new verses as Walther sings them. A final section remains to be composed, but Walther postpones the task.

Halák did not appear in a game for the Sabres and was ultimately dealt along with a third round draft pick to the Washington Capitals in exchange for Michal Neuvirth and Rostislav Klesla at the trade deadline. Halák dressed for the Sabres as the backup goaltender in one game, making him the 10th player in Sabres history <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>for</b> the team in a regular-season game but not play.|$|E
25|$|Women {{moving out}} of the Victorian era and into the Edwardian era were {{starting}} <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>for</b> a more active lifestyle. The evolving times brought a new fashion trend known as the “New Woman”. Active lives required less constricting clothing and required simpler and more streamlined clothing. The new woman was highly encouraged by women’s suffrage. Women that identified with this fashion movement were the type of women that were beginning to venture out of the domestic circle that they were told to maintain and beginning to pursue higher education, office jobs, and participating in active outdoor sports. The new and improved fashions allowed for women to swing a tennis racket, whack a golf ball, but the ideas of “proper” feminine attire reduced the progress of more practical sportswear.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, {{at the age}} of 37, Gibson {{became the}} first African-American woman to join the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) tour. Racial {{discrimination}} continued to be a problem: Many hotels still excluded people of color, and country club officials throughout the south—and some in the north—routinely refused to allow her to compete. When she did compete, she was often forced <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>for</b> tournaments in her car because she was banned from the clubhouse. Although {{she was one of the}} LPGA's top 50 money winners for five years, and won a car at a Dinah Shore tournament, her lifetime golf earnings never exceeded $25,000. She made financial ends meet with various sponsorship deals and the support of her husband, William Darben, brother of best friend and fellow tennis player Rosemary Darben, whom she married in 1965 (and divorced in 1976).|$|E
500|$|Amy and Rory chase River to a café at the Hotel Adlon, but the Teselecta arrives, {{bringing}} them aboard as allies, and takes on Amy's appearance, allowing the robot {{to get close}} to River to attack her. Before they can complete the attack, the TARDIS materialises; the Doctor, spurred on by the TARDIS' [...] "voice interface" [...] hologram of Amy's younger self, Amelia, has found time <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>for</b> the period and stops the attack, now aware of the Teselecta's nature. The captain speaks to the Doctor, informing him that River has been trained to kill him by the Silence, a religious order that believes that when [...] "the oldest question in the universe" [...] is asked, silence will fall across the universe. When the crew refuse to back down from attacking River, Amy uses the sonic screwdriver to turn the robot's [...] "antibodies"—its security robots—against the crew. The crew abandon the robot by being teleported away by their mothership, leaving Amy and Rory to face the antibodies.|$|E
500|$|HOK Sport {{designed}} the stadium. HOK Sport's {{project manager for}} the project, Melinda Lehman, said that the Rooney family asked for the stadium's design to [...] "acknowledge the history of Pittsburgh and also bring in an element of looking forward, this is where Pittsburgh is going." [...] In order to accomplish this, HOK Sport used steel structurally and externally. The stone used in Heinz Field's design is artificial, in order to decrease cost. Of the glass used in the stadium's design, Lehman said, [...] "The glass is a more modern building element, which ties {{into a lot of}} the buildings in [...] Pittsburgh and gives great views of the surrounding areas." [...] The Steelers and Panthers have their own locker rooms, which differ in size based on the amount of players each team is permitted <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>for</b> each game. The visitor facilities are modeled after the home locker rooms' design. As with its predecessor, Heinz Field's culinary service provider is Aramark; over 400eateries are located throughout the stadium. A bronze statue of Steelers founder Art Rooney, similar to those located outside PNC Park, was moved [...] from its previous position outside Three Rivers Stadium. In addition, a statue of a Pitt Panther over a paved depiction of Pitt's Cathedral of Learning was placed outside Gate A. Upon opening in 2001, Heinz Field's 27by96foot Sony JumboTron was the largest scoreboard in the NFL. In 2007, ESPN named the [...] "tipping" [...] of the oversized Heinz ketchup bottles atop the scoreboard one of the top ten touchdown celebrations in the NFL.|$|E

2500|$|After a brisk overture, {{the scene}} opens on {{a room with}} a bed, a chest of drawers, a table and chairs, a fireplace, and three doors. Cox is rushing <b>to</b> <b>dress</b> <b>for</b> the day. His landlord, Sergeant Bouncer, helps him get ready, while Cox {{complains}} about an uncomfortable pillow and an excessively short haircut, which makes him look like as though he is in the army. Any mention of the army sends Bouncer into a reverie about his own military career. The irritated Cox goes into his dressing-room, while Bouncer sings a mock-Handelian aria about his days in the militia, ending with his favourite catch-phrase, [...] "Rataplan! Rataplan!" [...] Cox asks Bouncer why the room always reeks of tobacco smoke. Bouncer suggests that it must be from the tenant in the attic, but Cox observes that smoke always travels up, not down. Cox also wonders why his supplies of coals, matches, candles, tea, sugar, etc., seem to be disappearing. Bouncer suggests it was the cat. When Cox will not accept this explanation, Bouncer launches into another reprise of [...] "Rataplan! Rataplan!" [...] Cox, at last, is late for work and leaves without resolving the mystery.|$|E
