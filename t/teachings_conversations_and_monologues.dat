The monastery was arranged after the canons of St. Theodore the Studite. There, for 20 years, Job served as hegumen (abbot) and engaged himself in the writing of theological books. The collection of his works, The Book of the Venerable Job of Pochayiv, Written by His Own Hand, contained 80 <b>teachings,</b> <b>conversations,</b> <b>and</b> sermons of St. Job, as well as excerpts he himself compiled from the writings of the Holy Fathers.

The writers found five types of swear words in Deadpool movie, those are sex term, body part term, excretion term, death term, and animal term. The findings show that sex term was the dominant type because this type was mostly used by the characters in Deadpool movie. The writer also classify the category of swear words based on {{the context of the}} <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> <b>monologue</b> found in Deadpool movie. The findings of this research show that there were seven categories of swear words used by the characters in Deadpool movie, such as intensifier category, exclamation of annoyance category, an insult category, exclamation of surprised category, rejection category, surprised question category, and the last is intensifier of unconcern category. The intention of using swear words by the characters that found in Deadpool movie showed that the characters in Deadpool movie used swear words not always to swear, but to express their other emotion and feeling in different situation...|$|R
40|$|Listening {{is defined}} as understanding, interpreting, evaluating, organizing, fixing ideas put forward in {{communication}} between listener and speaker, and identifying valuable ones to be stored in memory (Taşer, 2002 : cited in İşcan and Aydın, 2014). At the initial learning stages, language skills learners are exposed to are perceptive skills, namely reading and listening which has a vital importance for them to recognize vocabulary and perceive its pronunciation correctly. After detecting vocabulary, learners are expected to understand and convey messages in their target language. This is merely realized by learners who improve their listening skills in the target language; thus, they express their ideas more clearly, they accelerate their language skills <b>and</b> maintain mutual <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> <b>monologues</b> dramatically underlined in Common European Framework for References (CEFR). Even though there have been studies on Turkish teaching textbooks, study based on listening skills are not encountered. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study is to investigate to what extent the listening activities in the Turkish textbooks cover the scales of CEFR, make a comparative study among the books and present suggestions. At the end of the study, it is found that the activities in the listening parts and the guidance in instruction parts lack to embolden learners and motivate them before, during and after listening activities...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a corpus-based {{analysis}} to illustrate the extent {{and the depth of}} the similarities in the use of Vagueness Expressions (VEs) in spoken Italian and German. Adopting a semiotic approach to the study of vagueness, we have investigated the frequency and the distribution of VEs, conveying informational, relational and discourse vagueness in <b>conversations,</b> non-free-dialogues <b>and</b> <b>monologues.</b> The two languages do not exhibit the same qualitative and quantitative distribution of VEs because (a) German has twice as many VEs as Italian and (b) in Italian VEs are fairly limited to spontaneous conversations, while German speakers use VEs in all kinds of texts conveying the three types of Vagueness. This suggests that in German VEs are part of the linguistic norm, and not only a choice {{on the part of the}} speaker...|$|R
40|$|The detective {{series of}} Petra Delicado {{published}} by the contemporary Spanish writer, Alicia Giménez Bartlett presents the individual characters in a changing, complex and fragmented society. The {{emphasis is placed on}} the special circumstances that lead the characters to become the victim. The facts presented in this study, demonstrate that the character 2 ̆ 7 s ability to change their unfavorable circumstance are not {{due to the lack of}} agency or unwillingness. In some cases, the circumstances in which the individual is borne, places limited to their access to resources. In others, the characters in position of power manipulate others individual 2 ̆ 7 s circumstance to their advantage. These two facts, added to the indifference of society, make it difficult for the individual to change his/her situation. The emphasis in the victim 2 ̆ 7 s circumstance, consider the impact that society and social institutions exert upon their members. Therefore, in the narrative of Giménez Bartlett themes such as image, marginality, discrimination, indifference toward the suffering and harms done to others are revisited with much frequency. The idea that each individual is a stranger to themselves and that each has a moral duty toward others, are used to encourage the reflection upon those less fortunate. Parallel to these subjects, the mains characters are troublesome with existence, time and death. The passing of time, results in the loss of beauty and the strength of youth. The daily confrontation with death presents them with the unavoidable ending of their existence. The anguish and fears experiences by the characters toward the uncertainty of the future are frequently expressed in intradiegetic <b>conversations</b> <b>and</b> <b>monologues.</b> Those experiences are dealt with different behaviors or when there is no apparent way out, resorting to suicide as the only solution...|$|R

The basic ingredients haven’t changed, but Morby is {{figuring out how to}} retain and amplify his strongest points—his weary and wise voice, his understanding of how the musical pieces fit together—and leave everything else behind. On his debut, Morby’s voice cracked in places, suggesting effort that transcended ability, but Singing Saw finds him cool and controlled at every turn, fully aware of his limitations but confident in what he can accomplish within them. His singing is simultaneously intimate <b>and</b> distant, part <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> part stylized <b>monologue.</b> Single lines don’t really stand out, but Morby’s commitment to such elemental concerns has a cumulative effect, and the album’s lack of specificity becomes a strength." ...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of visual}} {{feedback}} during {{the production of}} American Sign Language was investigated by comparing the size of signing space during <b>conversations</b> <b>and</b> narrative <b>monologues</b> for normally sighted signers, signers with tunnel vision due to Usher syndrome, and functionally blind signers. The interlocutor for all groups was a normally sighted deaf person. Signers with tunnel vision produced {{a greater proportion of}} signs near the face than blind and normally sighted signers, who did not differ from each other. Both groups of visually impaired signers produced signs within a smaller signing space for conversations than for monologues, but we hypothesize that they did so for different reasons. Signers with tunnel vision may align their signing space with that of their interlocutor. In contrast, blind signers may enhance proprioceptive feedback by producing signs within an enlarged signing space for monologues, which do not require switching between tactile and visual signing. Overall, we hypothesize that signers use visual feedback to phonetically calibrate the dimensions of signing space, rather than to monitor language output. We thank Victor Ferreira, Tamar Gollan, Robert Slevc, and Bencie Woll for helpful comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript and Michael Schilling II for help with data collection. Finally, {{we would like to thank}} all the deaf and deaf-blind signers who participated in this research. No conflict of interest declared. Correspondence should be sent t...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the relationships}} between Secondary school music trainee teachers and the mentors who are primarily responsible for training them to teach music. The methodology was an in-depth collective case study of a sample of trainee music teachers and their mentors, adopting primarily the methods of non-participant observations and interviews. The study is located within a review of pertinent theories of mentoring and an analysis of empirical research. This analysis compares studies of ITT mentoring in different contexts, and demonstrates that, despite the diversity of mentoring practice, research has produced findings which are consistent across two or more studies. The collective case study consists of five individual cases ofmentoring relationships, {{each of which is}} presented so as to preserve its individuality. The talk in meetings between trainees and their mentors is then analyzed drawing on Mercer's (1995) typology of classroom talk as exploratory, cumulative and disputational. The analysis shows that exploratory talk has an underlying structure which is missing in cumulative and disputational talk. Analysis ofthe talk also reveals three further types of <b>conversation</b> between mentors <b>and</b> their trainees which are characterised as solo <b>conversations,</b> short <b>conversations</b> <b>and</b> parallel <b>monologues.</b> The study has two major conclusions: first, that in mentoring conversations exploratory talk is more likely to promote productive reflection than other types of talk, and second, that the potential for exploratory talk to promote reflection may not be fully realised by music mentors.

30|$|The {{second part}} of this paper {{investigated}} whether hearing part of a telephone conversation also had similar detrimental effects on sustained attention. Emberson, Lupyan, Goldstein, and Spivey (2010) previously found that overhearing half a conversation was more attentionally demanding than hearing a whole conversation. In their study, they had participants perform a dot-tracking task and a choice RT task where participants had to respond to target letters and ignore distracter letters (Emberson et al., 2010). Participants performed both these tasks while listening to (a) half a conversation (a “halfalogue”) comprising speech from one person’s part of a conversation, (b) a dialogue of both people’s parts of a <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> (c) a <b>monologue</b> where they heard one person’s recap of a conversation. The results showed that performance was impaired in the halfalogue condition compared to the dialogue <b>and</b> <b>monologue</b> conditions. From these results, Emberson et al. (2010) suggested that overhearing a conversation would also be disruptive to driving and other attentional tasks. We investigate this here by comparing the disruption of hearing half a conversation on a sustained visual attention task to that of having a conversation. If a dual-task cost was observed when people heard part of a conversation then this would have implications for the dangers of overhearing passenger conversations when driving. In experiment 3 we had participants perform an MOT task in three conditions: (1) when they were listening to a halfalogue, (2) when {{they were involved in}} a <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> (3) in silence. Experiment 4 more closely replicated the conditions used by Emberson et al. (2010) by comparing MOT performance when participants overheard half a conversation to when they overheard a dialogue between two people. The results showed that provided that the conversation was in a person’s native language, overhearing half a conversation did little to disrupt sustained attention. Taken together the results of experiments 1 – 4 showed that, although listening to a conversation did little to affect attention, engaging in a conversation had a large detrimental effect on attentional performance, regardless of conversational or task difficulty. We discuss the applied and theoretical implications of these data further in “General discussion”.|$|R
