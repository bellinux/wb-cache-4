500|$|DecembeRadio felt {{pressure}} to meet growing expectations following the accolades received for their previous album, DecembeRadio (2006), which won a Gospel Music Association Dove Award and {{was nominated for}} a Grammy Award. [...] "We had some great stuff go on with the first record, but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> thing {{over the past two years}} has been trying to make sure Satisfied is not a sophomore slump" [...] said lead guitarist Brian Bunn. [...] While the self-titled album was written and recorded with little thought to how the songs would translate in concert, the experience of opening for Third Day helped DecembeRadio learn what works best live. [...] Thus it was the band's goal to [...] "make sure every single song on the [...] album worked well in a live concert setting", according to Bunn.|$|E
500|$|Bruce David Forbes, {{author of}} Religion and Popular Culture in America, {{felt that the}} video drew on Madonna's {{childhood}} experiences and dramatized her efforts to renegotiate these relationships, in her daily interactions with her lover and father, and in relation to Catholicism, which the singer {{referred to in the}} line [...] "Oh father I have sinned". Dunn noticed that like the Pepsi commercial shot for her earlier single [...] "Like a Prayer", Madonna's persona is split into a child and adult, who repeatedly fuse and separate. Leslie C. Dunn commented that as the narrative developed, the child is shown singing, but the adult Madonna's voice is heard, and when the adult Madonna appears in a hallway, her shadow is that of a child. Madonna responded to these observations by saying: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> reason I was able to express myself and not be intimidated was not having a mother." ...|$|E
