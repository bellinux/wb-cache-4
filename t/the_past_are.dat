5|$|After {{learning}} {{about his past}} life, Harsha is rescued from the lake by a fisherman named Solomon (who is the reincarnation of Sher Khan) and, with Soloman's help, visits Udayghad. He gains access to Raghuveer's palace and overhears Ghora telling Raghuveer that if Indu's memories of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>are</b> not revived within the day they can never be revived, and she will be with Raghuveer forever. Harsha kidnaps Indu and takes her to Bhairavakona and in the process, Ghora is accidentally killed by Raghuveer. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life memories are revived; she reunites with Harsha. Harsha fights Raghuveer, {{and with the help}} of Solomon, manages to kill him.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> a {{term used}} to {{indicate}} the totality of events that occurred before a given point in time. <b>The</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> contrasted with and defined by {{the present and the}} future. The concept of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> derived from <b>the</b> linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. In addition, human beings have recorded <b>the</b> <b>past</b> since <b>the</b> advent of written language.|$|R

5|$|Multi-platform {{releases}} {{were common}} {{in the early days}} of RPGs, but there was a period during the 1990s when this was not generally the case. The sixth generation of home gaming consoles led many game developers to resume the practice, and some opted to develop primarily or exclusively for consoles. The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of programming tools. Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of the development budget than in <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>are</b> easily transferable between multiple platforms.|$|E

50|$|The {{consistency}} paradox or grandfather paradox {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> changed in any way, thus creating a contradiction. A time traveler {{can do anything}} that did happen, but can't do anything that didn't happen. Doing something that didn't happen results in a contradiction. Consistency paradoxes occur whenever changing <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>is</b> possible.|$|R
25|$|Primal therapy lacks protocol. In a usual setting between {{psychologist}} and client, a “believed cause” of certain painful {{thoughts and feelings}} from <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>are</b> generally addressed {{as a means to}} find amends to the root of the problem. Professionals that practice this therapy do not address such causes which calls its legitimacy into question.|$|E

Such improvements are then mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.|$|E
25|$|Bohm {{discussed}} {{the experience of}} listening to music. He believed the feeling of movement and change that make up our experience of music derive from holding the immediate {{past and the present}} in the brain together. The musical notes from <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>are</b> transformations rather than memories. The notes that were implicate in the immediate past become explicate in the present. Bohm viewed this as consciousness emerging from the implicate order.|$|E

25|$|Hawthorne's works {{belong to}} romanticism or, more specifically, dark romanticism, cautionary tales {{that suggest that}} guilt, sin, and evil are the most {{inherent}} natural qualities of humanity. Many of his works are inspired by Puritan New England, combining historical romance loaded with symbolism and deep psychological themes, bordering on surrealism. His depictions of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>are</b> a version of historical fiction used only {{as a vehicle to}} express common themes of ancestral sin, guilt and retribution. His later writings also reflect his negative view of the Transcendentalism movement.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary environments {{can shift}} their {{geographical}} positions through time. Coastlines can {{shift in the}} direction of the sea when the sea level drops, when the surface rises due to tectonic forces in the Earth's crust or when a river forms a large delta. In the subsurface, such geographic shifts of sedimentary environments of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>are</b> recorded in shifts in sedimentary facies. This means that sedimentary facies can change either parallel or perpendicular to an imaginary layer of rock with a fixed age, a phenomenon described by Walther's Law.|$|E

25|$|Dennett {{claims that}} {{conventional}} {{explanations of the}} colour change boil down to either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses, which he says {{are the result of}} Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where records of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>are</b> routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.|$|E
25|$|David Hume {{acknowledged}} {{that there are}} events constantly unfolding, humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by events prior or if they are independent instances. Hume opposed the widely accepted theory of Causation that ‘all events have a specific course or reason.’ Therefore Hume crafted his own theory of causation, which he formed through his empiricist and skeptic beliefs. He split Causation, into two realms “All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally {{be divided into two}} kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact”. Relations of Ideas are a priori, and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed “causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience”. Hume later goes onto say that even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>are</b> limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume’s separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas {{is often referred to as}} “Hume’s Fork”.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Yukito meets a {{girl named}} Kano Kirishima and a stray dog named Potato; Kano and Misuzu {{go to the same}} high school. Later that day, Yukito meets a third girl named Minagi Tohno, Misuzu's classmate, and her friend Michiru. Like Misuzu, both Kano and Minagi have strange personalities {{connected}} with mysterious pasts. Before long, a legend of [...] "one thousand summers" [...] begins to unfold where the mysteries of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>are</b> framed primarily by the relationship between Yukito and Misuzu. The cursed [...] "girl in the sky" [...] Yukito has been searching for turns out to be Misuzu. By the time he figures this out, she has already grown to love him and has passed her 15th birthday. Once these things have come to pass, the [...] "girl in the sky" [...] is cursed to die. The remainder of this arc is dedicated to Yukito's attempt to save her, trying to effectively break the curse.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in April 1996 to positive reviews. Mark Deming of Allmusic called it a [...] "superb debut" [...] and wrote, [...] "Welch's debts to artists of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>are</b> obvious and clearly acknowledged, but there's a maturity, intelligence, and keen eye for detail in her songs you wouldn't expect from someone simply trying to ape the Carter Family." [...] Bill Friskics-Warren of No Depression praised the album as [...] "breathtakingly austere evocations of rural culture". The Arlington Heights, Illinois Daily Heralds Mark Guarino observed that Revival was [...] "cheered and scrutinized as a staunch revivalist of Depression-era music only because her originals sounded so much like that era." [...] He attributed this to the biblical imagery of the lyrics, Burnett's threadbare production, and the plainly-sung bleakness in Welch's vocals. Ann Powers of Rolling Stone gave Revival a lukewarm review and criticized Welch for not singing of her own experiences, and [...] "manufacturing emotion." [...] Robert Christgau echoed Powers: Welch [...] "just doesn't have the voice, eye, or way with words to bring her simulation off." [...] Revival was nominated for the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, but lost to Bruce Springsteen's The Ghost of Tom Joad.|$|E
