5000|$|The clutch is {{typically}} disengaged by a thrust bearing that makes contact with pressure petals on the clutch ring plate and pushes them inward <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pad friction. Normally the bearing remains retracted {{away from the}} petals and does not spin. However, the bearing can be [...] "burned out" [...] and damaged by using the clutch pedal as a foot rest, which causes the bearing to spin continuously from touching the clutch plates.|$|E
50|$|The {{clutch in}} a manual-shift {{motorcycle}} transmission is typically {{an arrangement of}} plates stacked in alternating fashion, one geared on the inside to the engine and the next geared on the outside to the transmission input shaft. Whether wet (rotating in engine oil) or dry, the plates are squeezed together by a spring, causing friction build up between the plates until they rotate as a single unit, driving the transmission directly. A lever on the handlebar exploits mechanical advantage through a cable or hydraulic arrangement <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> spring(s), allowing the engine to freewheel {{with respect to the}} transmission.|$|E
50|$|Suresh Gopi {{plays the}} role of Vishwam, a man who has been convicted of the murder of those who raped his only daughter. Seetha, aka Anu (Priya Lal), is the heroine. She plays a college-going girl. Mohanlal plays Soorya Narayanan, an {{advocate}} who comes to the innocent man’s rescue. Soorya {{is one of the best}} lawyers in the entire country and is known to have a way with words. Soorya Narayanan takes it upon himself <b>to</b> <b>release</b> Vishwam from <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> of <b>the</b> judiciary, because he is convinced of the man’s innocence.|$|R
40|$|A tool {{comprises}} a first {{handle and}} a second handle, each handle extending from a gripping end portion to a working end portion, the first handle having first screw threads disposed circumferentially about an inner portion of a first through-hole at the working end portion thereof, the second handle having second screw threads disposed circumferentially about an inner portion of a second through-hole at the working end portion thereof, {{the first and second}} respective through-holes being disposed concentrically about a common axis of the working end portions. First and second screw locks preferably are disposed concentrically with the first and second respective through-holes, the first screw lock having a plurality of locking/unlocking screw threads for engaging the first screw threads of the first handle, the second screw lock having a plurality of locking/unlocking screw threads for engaging the second screw threads of the second handle. A locking clutch drive, disposed concentrically with the first and second respective through-holes, engages the first screw lock and the second screw lock. The first handle and the second handle are selectively operable at their gripping end portions by a user using a single hand to activate the first and second screw locks to lock <b>the</b> locking <b>clutch</b> drive for either clockwise rotation about the common axis, or counter-clockwise rotation about the common axis, or <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>the</b> locking <b>clutch</b> drive so that the handles can be rotated together about the common axis either the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction without rotation of <b>the</b> locking <b>clutch</b> drive...|$|R
5000|$|The {{accelerator}} (throttle) is <b>released,</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is pressed, and {{the gearbox}} is shifted into neutral.|$|R
5000|$|When <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal {{is fully}} <b>released,</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is fully engaged {{and all of}} the engine's torque is transferred. In this coupled state, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> does not slip, but rather acts as rigid {{coupling}} to transmit power to the gearbox.|$|R
3000|$|Pull <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> lever, enter 1 st gear, <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> lever in <b>the</b> {{range between}} 3, 500 and 4, 000  rpm; start and {{maintain}} a constant speed between 60 and 70  km/h. If necessary and possible, enter 2 nd gear using <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> as explained above; [...]...|$|R
5000|$|When {{shifting}} properly, {{the driver}} [...] "shifts" [...] to another gear and then <b>releases</b> pressure on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal to re-engage {{the engine to}} the driveshaft. If <b>the</b> pedal is <b>released</b> quickly, a definite lurch can be felt as the engine and driveshaft re-engage and their speeds equalize. However, if <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is <b>released</b> slowly <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> disc will [...] "slip" [...] against the flywheel; this friction permits the engine a smoother transition to its new rotation speed. Such routine slippage causes wear on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> analogous to <b>the</b> wear-and-tear on a brake pad when stopping. Some amount of wear is unavoidable, but with better clutching/shifting technique it can be minimized by <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> as close <b>to</b> the correct engine speed for the gear and vehicle speed as possible. When upshifting, this will involve allowing the engine speed to fall. Conversely, when downshifting, increasing the engine speed with <b>the</b> accelerator prior <b>to</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>clutch</b> {{will result in a}} smoother transition and minimal clutch wear.|$|R
50|$|Noise 2: This noise, {{commonly}} referred to as gear rattle, can be induced by lugging the engine in any gear, but is usually most noticeable in first or second gear. While the noise is occurring, if you press lightly on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal without <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> <b>the</b> noise will be reduced or eliminated.|$|R
50|$|The driver {{would use}} <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal any time when {{selecting}} low, high, or reverse gear. Once underway, the accelerator could be eased {{and the car}} would engage the overdrive. With the Fluid Drive coupling, the car could be brought {{to a halt in}} gear without <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> and would creep like an automatic.|$|R
50|$|Slipping <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as feathering <b>the</b> <b>clutch)</b> is a term used by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> achieve some movement of the car. It's called slipping because <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> plate will slip against the flywheel surface when such an action is performed. Slipping <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is known to be}} hard on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> surface due to the sliding friction created.|$|R
50|$|Making a sharp {{right hand}} turn will usually stop the noise. While {{the noise is}} occurring, in order to {{distinguish}} between the two noises, you can press lightly on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal without <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> and <b>the</b> noise will NOT go away or change. As a second diagnostic aid, while the vehicle is making the noise, shift to third gear and the noise will stop.|$|R
5000|$|On {{vehicles}} with a manual transmission, cruise control is less flexible because {{the act of}} depressing <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal and shifting gears usually disengages the cruise control. The [...] "resume" [...] feature has to be used each time after selecting the new gear and <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> Therefore, cruise control is of most benefit at motorway/highway speeds when top gear is used virtually all the time.|$|R
5000|$|A better {{method is}} to {{downshift}} to a lower gear that would spin the engine within its RPM limit, and use the throttle to [...] "Rev match" [...] the engine to the road speed before <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> fully. Effective engine braking is still achieved {{with little or no}} excessive clutch wear.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> appears {{outwardly}} {{similar to}} most other multi-plate clutches. A stack of plates is enclosed in a housing with a divided central shaft. Alternate plates are keyed {{to either the}} input or output shafts, through either the inner or outer housings. A pressure plate is arranged {{at one end of}} the stack so that an axial force may be applied, compressing the stack and causing it <b>to</b> transmit <b>the</b> drive. <b>Releasing</b> <b>the</b> pressure <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Riding <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> driver {{does not fully}} <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal. This results in <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> disc {{slipping}} against the flywheel and some engine power not being transferred to the drive train and wheels. While inefficient, most drivers routinely use this technique effectively when driving in reverse (as fully engaging the reverse gear results in velocity too great for the short distance traveled) or in stop-and-go traffic (as {{it is easier to}} control the throttle and acceleration at very slow speeds).|$|R
50|$|The right pedal applies iron-lined {{external}} bands on {{the rear}} brake drums through levers and horizontal shafts. The left pedal first <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> then when moved further the same pedal to ease the gear change applies the brake on the propellor shaft drum behind the gearbox. Steering is by rack and pinion. Wheels are of steel wire with tangent spokes.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Porter <b>released</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> {{and set out}} on her drive. She rarely had a settled {{route for}} these outings of hers, preferring to zigzag about New York, livening up the great city at random. She always drove herself and, having, like a good suffragist, a {{contempt}} for male prohibitions, took an honest pleasure in exceeding a man-made speed limit.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} way to push start a vehicle {{is to put}} the manual {{transmission}} in second gear typically, switching the ignition to on/run, depressing <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> and pushing <b>the</b> vehicle until it is at a speed of 5 to 10 mph or more, then quickly <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> engine rotate and fire, then quickly depressing <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> so it does not stall. This is done by one person pushing a lightweight automobile, pulling or being pushed by another vehicle or even rolling down a hill.|$|R
50|$|When {{the driver}} stops the vehicle on an incline where {{the nose of}} the car is {{sufficiently}} higher than the rear of the car, the system is engaged when the driver's foot is depressing the brake pedal, and then <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is fully depressed. Once set, the driver must keep <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal fully depressed but may remove the foot from the brake pedal. To disengage the system and move the car forward, the driver selects first gear, gently depresses the fuel pedal, and slowly <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal which at a point in its travel <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> braking system, allowing the car to proceed.|$|R
50|$|When the {{handbrake}} {{is applied}} the (otherwise fixed) {{end of the}} spring is moved forward by a cam which <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> and <b>the</b> car may stop without affecting the engine. Application of the footbrake has the same effect. This arrangement was deleted from the next model now the driver has control of the throttles and engine braking {{may be used to}} reduce the load on the brakes.|$|R
50|$|There is {{essentially}} {{no difference in}} efficiency between the technique of bypassing the throttle butterfly and operating the butterfly itself. The IAC allows the ECU to maintain minimum RPM irrespective of changes in engine load, {{sometimes referred to as}} anti-stall feature. Thus the driver can more easily move the car from stand-still by merely <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> (manual transmission) or the brake (automatic transmission) without having to simultaneously press the accelerator.|$|R
50|$|Jim and Nash {{abandon the}} patrol car and hike to a motel. While Jim is in the shower, Ryder abducts Nash. While Jim {{searches}} for her, Captain Esteridge takes him to two trucks with Nash tied between them. Ryder is {{at the wheel of}} one truck and threatens to tear Nash apart. Esteridge tells Jim that his men cannot shoot Ryder as his foot will slip off <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> which would cause the truck to roll and kill Nash. Jim enters the cab with Ryder, who gives him a pistol and tells him to shoot, but Jim is unable. Ryder, disappointed, <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> killing Nash.|$|R
50|$|Butterfly clutch - One of {{the most}} popular modern methods of {{attaching}} pins is <b>the</b> butterfly <b>clutch,</b> sometimes called a military <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> back of the pin has a small prong attached and when <b>the</b> butterfly <b>clutch</b> is squeezed and pulled up from the prong <b>the</b> pin is <b>released</b> from <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> Butterfly clutches may be made out of metal, plastic, or rubber.|$|R

50|$|This {{very small}} car {{originated}} as a fairground Dodgem and was electrically powered. In 1934, the designer Jack Shillan changed {{the engine to}} a 98 cc Villiers Midget single-cylinder engine and sold it for road use. The transmission was single speed and operated by a single pedal which opened the throttle on being pressed down and applied <b>the</b> brake when <b>released.</b> <b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> was automatic. There were no springs. Drive was {{to one of the}} rear wheels and the single brake operated on the other. It was said to be capable of reaching 15 mph (25 km/h). The body was open and had a single seat.|$|R

60|$|Sir George stepped in. The Vicomte, {{in whose}} fingers the wheel seemed {{scarcely}} to rest, so light and apparently careless was his touch, touched a lever by his side, <b>released</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch,</b> and swung <b>the</b> great car {{round the corner}} at a speed which made Duncombe grasp the sides. At a pace which seemed to him most ridiculous, they dashed into the Rue de Rivoli, and with another sharp turn pulled up before Maxim's. The Vicomte rose with a yawn {{as though he had}} just awoke from a refreshing dream. His servant slipped off his fur coat, and he descended to the pavement faultlessly dressed and quite unruffled. The commissionaire preceded them, hat in hand, to the door. A couple of waiters ushered them to the table which the Vicomte intimated by a gesture.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, the BAII F6 Typhoon was disqualified from Motor {{magazines}} annual Performance Car of the Year competition due to {{a series}} of clutch failures.

6000|$|The engine {{began to}} make a chinking sound, and the car lost pace. And then Mr. Britling saw a {{pleading}} little white board with the inscription [...] "Concealed Turning." [...] For the moment he thought a turning might be concealed anywhere. He threw out his clutch and clapped on his brake. Then he repented {{of what he had}} done. But the engine, after three Herculean throbs, ceased to work. Mr. Britling with a convulsive clutch at his steering wheel set the electric hooter snarling, while one foot <b>released</b> <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> again and <b>the</b> other, on the accelerator, sought in vain for help. Mr. Direck felt they were going back, back, in spite of all this vocalisation. He <b>clutched</b> at <b>the</b> emergency brake. But he was too late to avoid misfortune. With a feeling like sitting gently in butter, the car sank down sideways and stopped with two wheels in the ditch.|$|R
