In this thesis, pump and probe transient thermoreflectance methods are used to measure the <b>thermal</b> interface <b>conductance</b> between solid materials. Two experimental studies of <b>thermal</b> interface <b>conductance</b> are presented, each revealing the complexity of phonon interactions at interfaces which are inadequately captured by current models of phonon transmissivity. The first study considers interfaces of different metals with graphite, and finds that atomic-scale roughness at the interface could be appreciably influencing the heat transport due to the extreme anisotropy of graphite. The <b>thermal</b> interface <b>conductance</b> of graphite is found to be similar to that of diamond, suggesting that when estimating the <b>thermal</b> interface <b>conductance</b> between metal and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), a reasonable assumption may be that the conductance with the side walls of the MWCNTs is similar to the conductance with the ends of the MWCNTs. The second study considered aluminum on diamond interfaces where the diamond samples were functionalized to have different chemical surface terminations. The surface termination of the diamond is found to significantly influence the heat flow, with oxygenated diamond, which is hydrophilic, exhibiting four times higher <b>thermal</b> interface <b>conductance</b> than hydrogen-treated diamond, which is hydrophobic. Microstructure analysis determined that the Al film formed similarly, independent of diamond surface termination, suggesting that differences in interface bonding likely caused the observed difference in <b>thermal</b> interface <b>conductance,</b> a phenomenon which is not captured in current models of solid-solid phonon transmissivity. by Kimberlee Chiyoko Collins.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} the fluid flow and heat transfer that occurs during the spreading and solidification of a molten droplet on a substrate is crucial because of its potential applications in many industrial areas. In this research, thermal contact heat transfer in a rapid contact solidification process was studied. An interfacial temperature sensor, which has a junction thickness of only 1 -μm, was developed by utilizing micro-fabrication technique. A sudden falling experiment was conducted as a simulation of a rapid contact solidification process by employing the special sensor to record the rapid temperature changes at the substrate surface. A concise procedure was proposed to determine the interfacial <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance</b> from the temperature measurement. The <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance</b> during the rapid contact process of the molten metal (Indalloy- 158) with the copper substrate was determined. The influence of the initial state of the molten metal on the <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance</b> was investigated. A simple correlation for the <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance</b> during a rapid contact solidification process was developed. By introducing the simple correlation into the numerical simulation, for the first time, a non-constant <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance,</b> which varies with time and position, was used to simulate the spreading and solidification of a molten droplet impinging on a substrate.

These simulations could be used to find the optimum process conditions that yield the desired bump shapes, which should aid in the further development of this novel micro manufacturing approach...|$|R

It plays a significant role in heat transfer applications such as electronic packaging and nuclear reactors. This parameter also appears in fin-tube heat exchangers; however, it is often neglected in the performance calculations of heat exchangers. This thesis project explores the means by which the heat transfer performance of a finned tube heat exchanger may be enhanced. It includes experimental studies and finite element analysis investigating the effects of expansion bullets and coatings on the <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance.</b> An apparatus has been designed and fabricated for the experimental part of the work. A finite element model established the fintube configuration to be used in the design and manufacture of the apparatus. The apparatus was specially made for measuring <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance</b> directly in a finned-tube heat exchanger both in vacuum and in gaseous environment. The experiments were done on hexagon shaped specimens with a single fin connecting seven tubes. Sixteen type-T thermocouples have been used to measure temperatures at several locations on the specimen. A full-scale quarter-fin model was chosen for a second finite element analysis. The model simulates the actual specimen and predicts the temperatures. The finite element analyses have been used to validate the experimental results.

A mathematical model was developed to predict heat exchanger performance based on partial differential equations for coupled heat and water flow.

In addition, the effect of <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance</b> between the heat exchanger and adjacent soil was considered. A lumped model for predicting reduction of <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance</b> at the exchanger-soil interface was incorporated into the model which was based on soil shrinkage and air-gap <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance</b> data obtained in the laboratory. ^ Heat exchanger performance was predicted for three assumed heat and water flow cases; constant soil properties, thermally-induced water flow and thermally-induced water flow with <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance.</b> Results of the mathematical modeling efforts neglecting <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance</b> indicated that increasing dry density had a substantial impact on heat exchanger performance when thermally-induced liquid and vapor phase water was considered. For an initial water content of 0. 16 Mg/Mg dry basis, increasing dry density from 1. 40 to 1. 60 Mg/m 3 increased heat exchanger performance by about 83 percent after 48 hours of operation. Increasing initial water content from 0. 16 to 0. 20 Mg/Mg at a dry density of 1. 40 Mg/m 3 increased heat transfer by 29 percent after 48 hours. Adding <b>thermal</b> contact <b>conductance</b> effects to the model reduced heat exchanger performance by less than 11 percent for each water content-dry density combination.
