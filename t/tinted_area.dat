40|$|Through the {{evolution}} of technology both print and process have become more predictable and reliable. As a result, innovations {{in the press and}} plate coating technologies along with imaging software technologies have challenged the way we view print. With lithography being the predominant printing process, printers now have to find ways to differentiate themselves from others especially in the color reproduction arena. For years, traditional halftoning methods have reproduced original continuous tone images with success. Today, however, the once accepted rosette is now being challenged by a new technology that does away with conventional screen rulings and dot patterns. This new technology called Stochastic Screening, offers many benefits and is loudly touted by its champions. Tone reproduction whether it be through conventional screening methods or stochastic screening methods is influenced by all parameters in the printing process. In this study, the effects of inking on dot gain and print contrast were studied. A test form was developed to test the prediction that stochastically screened images will perform equally or better than conventionally screened images under normal and increased inking conditions. Evaluation of the test results shows that conventionally screened images actually performed better than stochastically screened images. Stochastic images actually experienced increased dot gain and loss of print contrast in the 48 % and 70 % <b>tint</b> <b>areas</b> under normal and increased inking conditions. Although stochastic images had less of a performance, the images appeared to have less variation throughout the run. At the height of implementation, it is not likely that stochastic screening will become the standard for industry because there are many unanswered questions that still surround this new technology. It is also obvious that implementation of this new technology is bound to be limited by the challenges of controlling a wide variety of equipment across industry, as well as the need to control the plating and printing processes themselves...|$|R

40|$|The {{pituitary}} gland is of primary importance in amphibian color change (Hogben, 1924) and its removal from the dogfish produces effects which {{are similar to}} those observed in the hypophysectomized frog (Lundstrom and Bard, 1932). In teleosts, however, evidence for any influence of this gland on color change is inconclusive. Certainly in Fundulus the activities of the melanophores, and probably of the xanthophores as well (Fries, 1931), are controlled mainly by the nerv ous system. Nevertheless, recent experiments have shown that other factors, probably humoral in nature, exert some control over the denervated melanophores (Smith, 1931; Parker, 1932) and xantho phores (Fries, 1931), enabling them to respond in an appropriate man ner to changes in background though much more slowly than do those pigment cells which remain connected with the nervous system. As Smith points out, these factors may play some part in the activities of innervated pigment cells as well, â€œ¿probablyâ€”furthering the action of the nervous system when the animal remains on the same back ground for a relatively long period. â€ • The nature of the hormone which produces these effects, however, is in doubt. Parker believes that neurohumoral substances are responsible for the changes in <b>tint</b> of denervated <b>areas</b> in Fundulus. Smith states that â€œ¿whilein Phoxi nus at least humoral factors exert an influence upon the behavior of the melanophores it is at the present moment impossible to enlarge upon this statement,â€ • but he suggests the possibility of adrenalin and pituitrin playing a part. Certainly extracts of the posterior lobe of the pituitary do produce definite changes in the pigment cells of both Fundulus and Phoxinus. Spaeth (1918) found that pituitrin produced a concentration of melanophore pigment when isolated scales of Fun dulus were immersed in it, and Wyman (1924) obtained similar results with injections of this drug. Hewer (1926) also described a concen tration of melanophore pigment and in addition a dispersion of xan thophore pigment following the injection of pituitrin into a minnow, although he is of the opinion that the {{pituitary gland}} plays no part in normal color change since the amount of pituitrin necessary to brin...|$|R
