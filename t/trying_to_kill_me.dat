[...] KTLK-AM in Los Angeles began carrying Miller's show in April 2005. Until the end of 2013, Miller's show was broadcast from the KTLK studios in Los Angeles, when the station's owner Clear Channel (now IHeart Radio), announced that it was changing formats from progressive talk to conservative talk. Miller and her business partner Ron Hartenbaum, the founder of WYD Media Management (often referred to by Miller as the [...] "owner of the show who is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me</b> for the insurance money"), decided they could not continue to rely on corporate broadcast entities for studio space, and Miller built a studio in the basement of her home at her own expense. The live program is now produced from Miller's house in Los Angeles from 6 am to 9 am Pacific Time weekdays.|$|E

Now to-day a Spaniard had wandered to Ditchingham, and when he learned my name had fallen upon me madly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me.</b> Was not this the man whom my mother feared, and was it right that I should leave him thus that I might go maying with my dear? I knew in my breast {{that it was not}} right, but I was so set upon my desire and so strongly did my heartstrings pull me towards her whose white robe now fluttered on the slope of the Park Hill, that I never heeded the warning.|$|E

60|$|But {{here it is}} that I {{must make}} my confession. When once flight commences, though it be ever so soldierly, panic follows hard upon it. Was it not so with the Guard at Waterloo? So it was that night with Etienne Gerard. After all, {{there was no one}} to note my bearing--no one save this accursed bull. If for a minute I forgot my dignity, who would be the wiser? Every moment the thunder of the hoofs and the horrible snorts of the monster drew nearer to my heels. Horror filled me at the thought of so ignoble a death. The brutal rage of the {{creature}} sent a chill to my heart. In an instant everything was forgotten. There were in the world but two creatures, the bull and I--he <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me,</b> I striving to escape. I put down my head and I ran--I ran for my life.|$|E

The Whigs, who strongly supported the Bank, were led by Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and Nicholas Biddle, the bank chairman.
