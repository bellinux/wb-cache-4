25|$|On 2 November 1962, Ladd {{was found}} lying {{unconscious}} {{in a pool}} of blood with a bullet wound near his heart, in what might have been an unsuccessful suicide attempt. The bullet penetrated Ladd's chest around the third and fourth rib, through the lungs and bounced off the rib cage. At the time, Ladd said he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a prowler, grabbed a gun, and tripped over, accidentally shooting himself. This was accepted by the police investigating.|$|E
25|$|Ali {{was strong}} in the early rounds of the fight, and {{staggered}} Frazier in the second round. Referee Tony Perez mistakenly <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover. However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali's head in round seven and driving him to the ropes {{at the end of}} round eight. The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters. Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier's dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was cornered, the latter a tactic that Frazier's camp complained of bitterly. Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision.|$|E
500|$|On 17 June, {{during a}} stop for repairs after the kayaks had been {{attacked}} by a walrus, Nansen <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> sounds of a dog barking, and of voices. [...] He went to investigate, {{and a few minutes}} later saw the figure of a man approaching. It was the British explorer Frederick Jackson, who was leading an expedition to Franz Josef Land and was camped at Cape Flora on the nearby Northbrook Island. The two were equally astonished by their encounter; after some awkward hesitation Jackson asked: [...] "You are Nansen, aren't you?", and received the reply [...] "Yes, I am Nansen." [...] Johansen was soon picked up, and the pair were taken to Cape Flora where, during the following weeks, they recuperated from their ordeal. Nansen later wrote that he could [...] "still scarcely grasp" [...] the sudden change of fortune; {{had it not been for}} the walrus attack that caused the delay, the two parties might have been unaware of each other's existence.|$|E
60|$|In {{the midst}} of such somber <b>thoughts,</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{footsteps}} approaching. <b>He</b> wriggled away into the shadow. An officer stopped {{where he had been}} working, half-stooped to examine the hawser, then changed his mind and straightened up. For a few minutes he stood there, gazing at the lights of the captured schooner, and then went forward again.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> an answer, {{but was not}} certain, {{and again}} dashed forward, almost as speedily {{as if he had}} but just started.|$|R
60|$|As {{though in}} instant answer to his <b>thoughts,</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the sudden {{sound of a}} voice so close beneath him that he stopped short in his {{downward}} climbing and stood as still as a mouse, with his heart in his mouth. A few inches more {{and he would have}} been discovered;--what would have happened then would have been no hard matter to foretell.|$|R
500|$|On 13 June {{walruses}} {{attacked and}} damaged the kayaks, causing another stop for repairs. On 17 June, as they {{prepared to leave}} again, Nansen <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a dog bark and went to investigate. He then heard voices, {{and a few minutes}} later encountered a human being. It was Frederick Jackson, who had organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land after being rejected by Nansen, and had based his headquarters at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. Jackson's own account records that his first reaction to this sudden meeting was to assume the figure to be a shipwrecked sailor, perhaps from the expedition's supply ship Windward which was due to call that summer. As he approached, Jackson saw [...] "a tall man, wearing a soft felt hat, loosely made, voluminous clothes and long shaggy hair and beard, all reeking with black grease". After a moment's awkward hesitation, Jackson recognised his visitor: [...] "You are Nansen, aren't you?", and received the reply [...] "Yes, I am Nansen." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} began {{during the}} afternoon of December 30, 1974, when Barbaro left his house with his mother's car. He told his brother, Chris, {{that he was going}} target shooting. Barbaro arrived at Olean High School at approximately 2:50p.m. After leaving his car, he entered the school building through an opened side entrance and proceeded to the third floor where he set off a coke bottle filled with gasoline and a wick. Unable to open the locked door to the student council room, Barbaro shot off the lock, entered the student council room, and tied the door shut. A 12-man custodial crew was doing routine maintenance {{in the basement of the}} school at this time. When they heard a fire alarm sound, the superintendent dispatched Earl Metcaff to see what the problem was at the 3rd floor. [...] He met Joe Kosidlo, the 3rd floor custodian, who asked him to vacate because he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> gun shots. [...] Mr. Metcaff did not listen and proceeded to where he heard the noise. Anthony Barbaro was then confronted by Earl Metcaff, seeing Metcalf through the glass window of the student council room, he opened his door shot and killed him. Barbaro then positioned himself in the student council room on the third floor of the school. There, he began shooting at people outside of the school.|$|E
2500|$|The {{absence of}} any other combatants had bought Serapis a {{considerable}} amount of time. Bonhomme Richard’s gun decks were now so badly damaged that most of the British shots were passing straight through without touching anything, and the great guns were almost completely silenced. There were almost as many fires to be extinguished as there were aboard Serapis, but on the other hand, the hold was filling with water because one of the pumps was in ruins. Commodore Jones was exhausted, and apparently slumped on the chicken coop for a brief rest. Somehow (according to his later memoirs), a rumour went around that he was dead or dying, and his gunner and carpenter, both wounded, hastily consulted with the master-at-arms. Together they decided, a little before 10pm, to surrender by striking the ship’s colours, but the flag had already been shot away, so their only option was to shout. Captain Pearson shouted back, asking whether the Americans had really struck their colours. Possibly his Lieutenant of Marines relayed this message. Certainly, Jones’s reply was firmly negative. Jones himself recalled shouting {{something along the lines of}} [...] "I have not yet thought of it, but I am determined to make you strike," [...] at which point, presumably, the surrendering officers realised he was still very much alive and returned to their duties. A much more dramatic version appeared in newspapers within days of the event, allegedly based on the testimony of an ex-crewman who <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> something like [...] "I may sink, but I’ll be damned if I strike", and witnessed the captain using his pistols to shoot the three officers who were attempting to surrender ...|$|E
60|$|George <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{had never}} <b>heard</b> such a futile, vapid remark.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jean has {{the best}} ears of any of us, your excellency," [...] said one man from beside the brass corner cannon. [...] "He <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> shots a few minutes ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently, at a hint {{from his}} lady, Foy {{turned down a}} side street, unobserved, as <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> till <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a mocking voice calling after them, [...] "Good-night, Red Bow, hope {{you will have a}} fine supper with your Leyden shopboy." ...|$|R
60|$|Godfrey <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> him {{lock the}} door behind him, but was not sure.|$|E
60|$|Just as Charlie's watch was over, he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a {{very faint}} splash {{in the water}} below. Two or three minutes later, he again <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the sound. He peered {{out of the window}} anxiously, but the night was dark, and he could see nothing. Listening intently, it seemed to him, several times, that he heard the same faint sound.|$|E
60|$|Another {{quarter of}} an hour went by and then Dick <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> voices. He {{strained}} his ears.|$|E
60|$|Leo {{stood in}} front of the Crab, and the half {{darkness}} allowed him a glimpse of that vast blue-black back, and the motionless eyes. Now and again <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> some one sobbing, but the noise was very faint.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> sat and <b>thought,</b> {{and while}} <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> we <b>heard</b> them all coming down-stairs.|$|R
6000|$|It {{had been}} Philip's first <b>thought</b> when <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> of the accident, [...] "Will Tulliver be lame? It {{will be very}} hard for him if he is." [...] And Tom's {{offences}} against himself were all washed out by that pity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you {{finished}} your letter?" [...] she asked. He <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> faint amusement in her tone, {{but not a}} trace of jealousy.|$|E
60|$|He <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> Barringford {{calling and}} started to answer. Then he pushed forward once more, hoping each moment to gain higher ground.|$|E
60|$|So {{he went on}} and on, till {{his head}} spun round with the heat, and he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> church-bells ringing a long way off.|$|E
6000|$|Ten minutes passed. Jimmy {{sprang from}} his chair. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> a footstep. <b>He</b> flung the door open. The passage was empty. He {{returned}} miserably to his chair. Of course {{she had not}} come back. Why should she? ...|$|R
60|$|Sammy {{looked as}} if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> hadn't <b>heard</b> right. Never before had he known Chatterer {{to admit that he}} was afraid, for you know Chatterer is a great boaster. It must be {{something}} very serious to frighten Chatterer like that.|$|R
60|$|How rare is the {{combination}} of beauty and intelligence! George <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had never <b>heard</b> such a clear-headed, well-expressed remark.|$|R
60|$|He {{entered the}} next room, {{closing the door}} {{carefully}} behind him. Richard <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> the clinking of glasses within, {{but he was not}} sure.|$|E
60|$|Just at this time, {{when the}} wind seemed to lull for an instant, Jonas <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a cry. He stopped his oxen to listen.|$|E
60|$|Whether Mr Seymour's {{conscience}} ached or not, cannot, of course, be discovered. But he {{had certainly}} <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a noise, {{and he had}} come to investigate.|$|E
60|$|In {{the stillness}} of the night <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a distant cry. But he was not sure that his ears had not deceived him. Far out he could see a faint light and, knowing that this marked the place where the ship was moored, he {{prepared}} to strike out for it.|$|R
60|$|The fact is, Unc' Billy was {{thinking}} of the time when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> the voice of an old friend of his from way down South, and he was beginning to suspect that he had been right, and that his old friend really was somewhere in the Green Forest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nuffin, nuffin, Sah! Ah'm {{just walking}} fo' mah health," [...] replied Unc' Billy over his shoulder, as he hurried on. You see he didn't {{like to tell}} any one what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had <b>heard,</b> for fear {{that it might not}} be true, and then they would laugh at him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} you have {{forgotten}} it,' said Mr. Bob Sawyer, glancing eagerly at the door, as he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> {{the noise of}} glasses jingling; 'very sorry.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Wetherell <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> him muttering, [...] "No, no," [...] {{and then}} he was startled by another voice in his ear. It was Jethro who was {{standing}} beside him.|$|E
60|$|Chet was not superstitious, or {{he might}} have <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a ghost. He knew {{there must be some}} {{rational}} reason for the unusual noise, and he resolved to investigate.|$|E
6000|$|This {{outbreak}} {{was almost}} complimentary, as if its meaning had been, [...] "That {{such a man}} as you should intercede!" [...] Captain Whalley let it pass by without flinching. One would have <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had <b>heard</b> nothing. <b>He</b> simply went on to state that he was personally interested in putting things straight between them. Personally [...] .|$|R
60|$|As for {{the ring}} Jacob Stuck {{had given to}} her, why, the next morning {{there were three of}} them, and the king <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had never <b>heard</b> tell of such a {{wonderful}} thing.|$|R
60|$|The {{next night}} the village retired to rest early. The boys sat talking together, {{for a long}} time, and then lay down to sleep. Presently, Will <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>heard</b> a noise and, looking up, saw in the {{moonlight}} a number of savages, stealthily approaching. They carried with them ladders; and intended, he had no doubt, to surprise the sleeping villagers. They were already close at hand.|$|R
