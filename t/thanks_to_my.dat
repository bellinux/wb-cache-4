500|$|The film {{is based}} on a legend, but it is given {{credence}} by at least two texts that assert Anarkali's existence during the historical period of the greatest monarch of the Mughal Empire, Emperor Akbar (1556–1605). One of the books states that in 1615 a marble tomb was built on Anarkali's grave in Lahore by Salim, when he had become Emperor Jehangir. On the tomb is a Persian inscription that reads: [...] "Ta Kiyamat shukr geom kardgate khwesh ra, Aah garman bez benaam roo-e yare khwesh ra", meaning in English: [...] "Ah! could I behold the face of my love once more, I would give <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> God until the day of resurrection." [...] The author of the stage play on which the film is based, Imtiaz Ali Taj, believed that the legend had no historical base, but historians have suggested that Anarkali may have been a painter, a dancer, or a courtesan, or one of Akbar's wives and the mother of Salim's half-brother Prince Daniyal. While an earlier film version of the story, Anarkali (1952), contained a disclaimer stating that the story had no foundation in history, Mughal-e-Azam made no such claim.|$|E

He cancelled his heavily advertised performance at the Reggae Sumfest in Jamaica that was scheduled the following Friday. In a statement the organizers said, [...] "Kelly's unforeseen and unavoidable health issues will prevent him from making a scheduled appearance on the music festival." [...] Johnny Gourzong, Sumfest Productions executive director, also commented, saying, [...] "We are truly going to miss his presence on the festival." [...] On July 20, 2011, in a press release, representatives for R. Kelly explained that he {{was rushed to}} the hospital to drain an abscess on one of his tonsils and [...] "will be laid up for an indefinite amount of time". Shortly after, Kelly tweeted fans [...] "I WILL BE BACK!" [...] he promised and [...] "I'd like to thank everybody for their love, concern and support." [...] On July 21, 2011, Kelly's spokesman, Allan Mayer, reported that Kelly was released from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago and is recuperating at home. It was not immediately clear when Kelly might be well enough to resume performing. On July 21, 2011, in a video message to fans, Kelly spoke out for the first time since throat surgery and reassured his fans that he's doing well. He said [...] "Yo what's up, y'all, it's your boy Kellz, fresh out the hospital. Just want to say <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> fans for supporting me.

[...] He believed that he may have pushed too hard at the wrong time in the race, [...] "it was just a case of keeping it on the racing line and hoping they'd battle it out behind me. Felipe's car was like a rocket at the end. Big <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> new team: to win in our fourth race, with no pre-season testing, is amazing." [...] Nasr spoke about car management and maintaining the pace levels with the leaders and believed he could have won in an alternative situation, [...] "But anyway, it’s still a good result. We came here to score big points and it’s quite good to go back to Europe knowing that we have a good car, a good team. It keeps getting better and better. I’m feeling quite confident." [...] Coletti believed his third-place finish contributed towards [...] "a good weekend" [...] for himself. He stated that entering the European leg of the season as the points leader had gave him additional motivation and hoped to be competing at the front of the field in Barcelona, [...] "We’re still a few points ahead – ten I think. But like I said, we need to score big points in Race 1 and I think that in Barcelona we’ll be in the front." ...|$|E
