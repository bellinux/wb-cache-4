40|$|Bakery {{products}} are important sources of nutrients in our diet. However, spoilage occurs shortly after baking. After microbial spoilage, the main spoilage problem is <b>staling.</b> Therefore, methods <b>to</b> control <b>staling</b> are {{of great importance}} to the bakery industry since staling results in millions of dollars annually in lost revenues. Initial studies using a one variable at a time approach showed that enzymes, guar, algin and pectin gums and {{high fructose corn syrup}} could delay staling and resulted in an organoleptically acceptable product. Subsequent optimization studies using a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) approach show the appropriate levels of enzyme (Novamyl), guar gum and HFCS resulted in bagels with a textural and sensorial shelf life of 6 weeks at ambient temperature. Furthermore, the cost of reformulating ($ sim$ 0. 5 cent/bagel) is minimal and could easily be recovered through reduced production costs, reduced losses due <b>to</b> <b>staling</b> and additional sales and market areas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} work, {{we presented}} a Typed Assembly Language (TAL). TAL is sufficiently expressive {{to serve as}} a target language for compilers of high-level languages such as ML. This work assumed such a compiler would perform a continuation-passing style transform and eliminate the control stack by heap-allocating activation records. However, most compilers are based on stack allocation. This paper presents STAL, an extension of TAL with stack constructs and stack types to support the stack allocation style. We show that STAL is sufficiently expressive to support languages such as Java, Pascal, and ML; constructs such as exceptions and displays; and optimizations such as tail call elimination and callee-saves registers. This paper also formalizes the typing connection between CPS-based compilation and stack-based compilation and illustrates how STAL can formally model calling conventions by specifying them as formal translations of source function types <b>to</b> <b>STAL</b> types...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years, {{the growth of the}} Internet and the World Wide Web on the part of {{students}} and faculty at institutions of higher education has coincided with the rapid expansion of online distance education programs. A 1998 survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (Lewis, Snow, Farris & Levine, 1999), estimated 54, 479 different distance education courses were offered with an enrollment of approximately 1, 661, 100 students. These figures represent an increase of over 100 % from the 1994 - 95 statistics. Of the 1, 680 institutions of higher education in the United States offering distance education courses in 1998, 87 % indicated they offered asynchronous, Internet-based online courses while 65 % offered two-way interactive video. Clearly, the use of the Internet and World Wide Web is changing the way higher education is provided in this country. Despite this remarkable growth, many institutions remain unable to embrace the opportunities created by online education and are in danger of falling behind this latest technology trend. Indeed the prospect of introducing online education to a campus can be daunting and legitimate concerns over costs, mission, and efficacy continue <b>to</b> <b>stal...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{we presented}} a Typed Assembly Language (TAL). TAL is sufficiently expressive {{to serve as}} a target language for compilers of high-level languages such as ML. Moreover, TAL’s type system is powerful enough to encode source-level abstractions such as closures and abstract data types, yet flexible enough to admit most traditional low-level optimizations. The compiler presented in our original work was based on a continuation-passing style (CPS) transform, which eliminated the need for a control stack by heap allocating activation records. However, modern architectures and most compilers are based on stack allocation of these records. This paper presents STAL, an extension of TAL with stack constructs and stack types to support the stack allocation style. We show that STAL is sufficiently expressive to support languages such as Java, Pascal, and ML; constructs such as exceptions and displays; and optimizations such as tail call elimination and callee-saves registers. This paper makes two additional contributions. First, it formalizes the typing connection between CPS-based compilation and stack-based compilation. The latter is seen as a continuationpassing style where continuation closures are unboxed by the caller and the continuation’s environment is placed on the stack. Second, it illustrates how STAL can formally model calling conventions by specifying them as formal translations of source function types <b>to</b> <b>STAL</b> types...|$|E
