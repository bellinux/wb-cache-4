They escape after Andrea rediscovers her {{shooting}} abilities, and the two subsequently begin an affair.

It is shown in Spectacular Spider-Man #250 that he has recovered, and he returns to his {{civilian}} life. Without the Green Goblin identity, Osborn would <b>then</b> <b>go</b> on to attack Spider-Man indirectly, through minions and via smear campaigns designed to portray him as a monster. However, Norman would still wear his Green Goblin costume in battle.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he thinks he knows everything, and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two <b>then</b> <b>go</b> on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan <b>then</b> <b>go</b> to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E

5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{family would}} have {{preferred}} him to have remained at Charterhouse for two more years and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> on to Cambridge University. They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling {{it would be wrong}} to prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E
5|$|A {{school day}} at the orphanage would start at 6:00a.m. with many morning chores to be completed, predominately cleaning. A mass would be held at 7:15a.m., and breakfast would follow. Boys at the orphanage would <b>then</b> <b>go</b> to school. All boys over 14 were given a {{religious}} education at the Brother's Cathedral School, whereas the younger boys attended the infants' school at the Convent. All boys were also trained in technical education. Before leaving, the orphanage trained the boys in all classes of agriculture. This was so the boys were well educated and had the knowledge to become sufficient farmers {{when they left the}} orphanage.|$|E

50|$|The riding {{was created}} {{prior to the}} 1967 {{election}} by combining the ridings of Woodbine and Beaches. The boundaries of the new riding were as follows: From the southwest point where Coxwell Avenue met Lake Ontario the boundary followed Coxwell north to Queen Street East. It <b>then</b> <b>went</b> west a short distance to Rhodes Avenue. It followed Rhodes Avenue north to Danforth Avenue. It <b>then</b> <b>went</b> back east along Danforth to Coxwell.

5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, <b>then</b> <b>go</b> back to secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E
5|$|Burnside's {{road system}} was {{completely}} bitumenised during the 1960s and 1970s through government-sponsored roadworks programmes. Plans were also laid out {{to replace the}} winding and dangerous Mount Barker Road. One of these proposals was the Burnside-Crafers Highway, which was strongly supported by council; it envisaged leaving Greenhill Road once reaching Hazelwood Park. It was then to pass through Hazelwood Park and Beaumont, wind around the hills of Waterfall Gully and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> over Eagle on the Hill to meet Crafers. The Burnside Council put much effort into this proposal, widening Linden Avenue (which runs north-west to south-east) {{in preparation for the}} highway. The proposal was eventually rejected in favour of upgrading Mount Barker Road and Linden Avenue remained a huge out-of-place road running through an otherwise peaceful suburb.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{were well}} beaten by Red Star Belgrade {{in the second}} round of the 1973–74 European Cup and lost out to Leeds in the League Championship, {{finishing}} second. In the third round of the FA Cup, Liverpool had to score a late equaliser to draw 2–2 at home against lowly Doncaster Rovers but recovered to win the replay and <b>then</b> <b>go</b> all the way to the final. In what proved to be Shankly's last competitive game in charge, Liverpool produced a superb second half performance to defeat Newcastle 3–0 at Wembley.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{can also}} be used to identify functionally important sites, such as binding sites, active sites, or sites corresponding to other key functions, by locating conserved domains. When looking at multiple sequence alignments, it is useful to consider different aspects of the sequences when comparing sequences. These aspects include identity, similarity, and homology. Identity means that the sequences have identical residues at their respective positions. On the other hand, similarity has to do with the sequences being compared having similar residues quantitatively. For example, in terms of nucleotide sequences, pyrimidines are considered similar to each other, as are purines. Similarity ultimately leads to homology, in that the more similar sequences are, the closer they are to being homologous. This similarity in sequences can <b>then</b> <b>go</b> on to help find common ancestry.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to <b>then</b> <b>go</b> on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E

5|$|Wes and Rui <b>then</b> <b>go</b> to Realgam Tower. All four {{administrators are}} there and ready to face Wes again. After doing so, he is granted access to the Colosseum {{at the top of}} the building. There, he is greeted by a large crowd. A Cipher man named Nascour tells Wes that he will have to face four trainers. After Wes defeats all four trainers, Nascour fights him. Once defeated, Nascour tries to leave, only to be {{interrupted}} by Es Cade. Es Cade reveals that he is really none other than Evice, the head of Cipher, and battles Wes. When Wes defeats him, Evice attempts to escape by helicopter, but the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh swoops in and blasts it out of the sky. Evice and Nascour are presumably arrested.|$|E
5|$|When Princip, Grabež, and Čabrinović reached Loznica on 29 May, Captain Prvanović summoned {{three of}} his revenue sergeants to discuss {{the best way to}} cross the border undetected.
