Her body was found with two shots in the head and with gunpowder burns, indicating that the shots were probably fired at close distance by her kidnappers. Her family, the Colombian government, and the OAS condemned <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> as the party responsible for the murder. <b>The</b> <b>FARC</b> blamed the Army for provoking the situation that led to her death.|$|E
25|$|Five {{days after}} the formal {{signature}} of the final agreement, <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> would provide the UN with the necessary information for the decommissioning. <b>The</b> <b>FARC</b> would contribute by different means, including the provision of information and the cleaning and decontamination of areas affected by landmines, improvised explosive devices, unexploded ordnances and explosive remnants of war.|$|E
25|$|Jacobo Arenas died on August 10, 1990, {{possibly}} due to cancer, {{but perhaps}} also due to diabetes or an ulcer, or even assassinated by a vindictive comrade (according to different versions). His death {{was considered a}} major blow to <b>the</b> <b>FARC,</b> as {{he was one of}} the persons responsible for transforming <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> from a small guerilla force to a belligerent rebel army.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>FARC's</b> Seventh Guerrilla Conference {{was held}} in 1982 under the {{guidance}} of Jacobo Arenas and Manuel Marulanda. The Conference added the term [...] "People's Army" [...] to the group, resulting in the new name being FARC-EP. The Seventh Guerrilla Conference was a turning point in <b>the</b> <b>FARC's</b> struggle, as it provided them the opportunity to fine-tune their policies and plans {{in order for them to}} build their desired socialist state in <b>the</b> future. <b>The</b> <b>FARC's</b> Conferences, as seen by Marxists and Leninists, can be interpreted as similar to the International conferences previously held in Europe with the participation Karl Marx, Fredrick Engels, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky.|$|R

25|$|In May 1964, {{as part of}} Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, a CIA backed {{program called}} Plan LAZO was initiated.

Many of the armed inhabitants of the enclaves escaped {{and two years later}} part of this group formed <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). <b>The</b> <b>FARC</b> became the oldest and largest revolutionary guerilla movement in the Western Hemisphere. Stokes and other critics believed that the U.S. government focused on the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> and other left-wing guerrilla movements, ignoring and even supporting other destabilizing elements in Colombian society.|$|E

25|$|The FARC's force {{strength}} is usually {{estimated to be}} at around 15,000 to 18,000 men and women, organized in more than 80 fronts. The exact number is publicly unknown, though allegedly not even <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> keeps a complete and comprehensive record of all its operatives due to geographical, operational and contextual difficulties. Since the 1980s, one of the long-term goals of <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> has been to increase its military manpower up to at least 30,000.|$|E
25|$|While discussions {{advanced}} on {{the first}} item on the agenda (integral rural development), the peace process faced its first major crisis {{at the end of}} January 2013 following the kidnapping of two police officers by <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> in the Valle del Cauca on January 25. The incident was followed by a FARC ambush which killed four soldiers in the Nariño Department on January 31, and the assassination of another three police officers in La Guajira Department on February 1. <b>The</b> <b>FARC</b> claimed that these actions were in retaliation of a military bombing which left 20 guerrillas dead, during the FARC's unilateral ceasefire (which came to an end on January 20). Government negotiators in Havana argued that such actions undermined the peace process. In bringing the war to the negotiating table, both sides broke their previous understanding not to let events of the conflict affect the process, and the dispute escalated into a war of words between the two parties. The government, pressed by former President Uribe's fiery opposition to the peace process, sternly warned <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> that it would respond in kind and would not be pressured into discussing a bilateral ceasefire (as demanded by <b>the</b> <b>FARC).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Until 2004, he was <b>the</b> <b>FARC's</b> 14th Front Commander. He is {{a member}} of the Estado Mayor and the second-in-command of the Southern Bloc of the FARC-EP.

Also according to the United States government, he ordered the round-up of more than 50 people for violating FARC cocaine policies and the murder of many of them. According to the US government, he participated in setting and implementing <b>the</b> <b>FARC’s</b> cocaine policies directing and controlling the production, manufacture, and distribution of hundreds of tons of cocaine to the United States and the world; the [...] "taxation" [...] of the drug trade in Colombia to raise funds for the FARC; and the murder of hundreds of people who violated or interfered with <b>the</b> <b>FARC’s</b> cocaine policies. <b>The</b> US Department of State offered a reward of up to US$2.5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction of him.|$|R

25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> {{rejected}} Uribe's new policies, {{the government}} unleashed a large-scale military, political and judicial offensive against the guerrillas, {{resulting in a}} drastic reduction of their military capacity, albeit {{at the cost of}} grave human rights violations by the armed forces ("false positives"). The State's offensive forced <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> to retreat to their hinterland, and achieved significant results such as securing the country's main roadways, a {{reduction in the number of}} kidnappings, a substantial drop in the homicide rate and the recovery of government authority in several regions of the country. Taken on the whole, these well-publicized results made Uribe extremely popular and granted him sufficient political capital to successfully seek congressional approval of a constitutional amendment allowing him to run for a second consecutive term in 2006. However, while the army and the police's operations recovered control of regions where the guerrillas had expanded their influence during the 1980s and 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> displayed a capacity to re-accommodate and reactivate themselves militarily in new strategic hinterland and border regions. <b>The</b> <b>FARC</b> showed their military resilience through terrorist attacks in urban environments (El Nogal Club bombing in 2003) and a counteroffensive in 2005.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2015, <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> {{suspended}} a truce after 26 of its {{fighters were}} killed in a government air and ground offensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{item was}} one of the most {{complicated}} for the two parties to find an agreement on. <b>The</b> <b>FARC,</b> which claimed that it's insurgency was justified and that they it was not militarily defeated, initially refused to submit to the laws and institutions of a political system which it opposed. On the other hand, the government had the obligation to design a transitional justice system which would be satisfactory to <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> (who sought restorative justice) but also in keeping with Colombia's international treaty obligations, notably the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Complicating issues further, both <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> and the government have historically refused to admit responsibility for crimes they have committed, with the guerrilla considering itself a victim of State oppression and the Colombian government considering itself to be the leader and defender of a democratic society.|$|E
50|$|Several of <b>the</b> <b>FARC's</b> critics believe that, {{despite the}} unjustifiable bloodshed, it is {{debatable}} whether such positions are entirely {{a consequence of}} the UP's failure. Some believe that, at least partially, their basis was part of <b>the</b> <b>FARC's</b> preexisting ideological and political strategies. In addition, members of the legal leftwing parties in modern Colombia, such as the Independent Democratic Pole, while they are still subject to targeted threats and assassinations for which they blame paramilitaries supported by individual members of the state's armed forces, have stated that the legal political struggle that the UP fought and ultimately died for should not be given up in favor of the use of arms, which only extends the cycle of violence.|$|R

25|$|The {{transformation}} from a guerrilla movement {{to a political}} party {{has been one of}} <b>the</b> <b>FARC's</b> main public aims since the beginning of negotiations.

25|$|In August 2012, former President Álvaro Uribe, who {{had become}} the leading critic of Santos' administration, affirmed that the {{government}} was negotiating with <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> in the Cuba; claims which were denied by defence minister Juan Carlos Pinzón and foreign minister María Ángela Holguín. However, on August 27, TeleSUR broke the news that the government and <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> {{were on the verge of}} announcing the signature of an agreement to begin formal peace negotiations, and President Santos later confirmed the information.|$|E
25|$|In early February, the {{government}} and <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> once again found themselves at odds, {{on the issue of}} the plebiscite. <b>The</b> <b>FARC,</b> by communiqué, argued that the plebiscite contravened the general agreement (from August 2012). In response, President Santos tweeted that the final agreement in Havana would be submitted to plebiscite, whether <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> liked it or not. In late February, the FARC's 'armed proselytism' during a 'political pedagogy' event (attended by Iván Marquez and other negotiators) in La Guajira stirred significant controversy. Since 2015, the FARC's negotiators had been authorized by {{the government}} to travel to Colombia to organize 'political pedagogy' events with their troops only, and till then all such activities had occurred without major problems. However, the presence of armed men mingling with the civilian population during this particular event in La Guajira rekindled fears about the use of weapons by the guerrilla during political events. President Santos notified the guerrilla that 'political pedagogy' events were suspended until further notice and issued an ultimatum that either a final agreement is signed on March 23 or it would be understood that <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> are not ready for peace. Semana considered the incident as a major blow to confidence and trust in the peace process, which came at a critical moment.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in July, {{a series}} of attacks by <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> hit {{civilian}} populations particularly badly - bombings destroying electric pylons left Buenaventura without electricity, bombings on roads and water conduits cut off municipalities in the Meta and Guaviare from running water or communication for several days, a grenade attack by <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> against a police officer killed his 3-year-old daughter while in the Putumayo the guerrilla forced tanker trucks to spill the crude oil they carried. President Santos warned <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> that they were playing with fire, and that negotiations could not continue forever under such actions. On their side, <b>the</b> <b>FARC</b> threatened to leave the negotiation table if the government continued killing its commanders. <b>The</b> <b>FARC</b> also escalated their rhetoric, with Pablo Catatumbo blaming the state {{for the bulk of}} the victims of the conflict and justifying kidnappings, while the FARC's leader Timochenko complained in a statement that the media was making excessive demands on the guerrilla to face their victims and seek forgiveness. Despite these incidents, in Havana negotiations continued moving forward, with the creation of an historical commission on the conflict and its victims, an agreement to being parallel discussions on the 'end of the conflict' item and the installation of a sub-commission on gender issues. In late September, President Santos announced at the United Nations General Assembly that the government had decided to make public the agreements reached up till that point in Havana - including the joint drafts of the partial agreements on comprehensive rural reform, illicit drugs and political participation. The government said it was a transparency measure to end speculation and rumours about the contents of the agreements with the guerrilla.|$|E
50|$|From April 20 to May 1, {{both parties}} met unofficially in El Caguan {{to discuss the}} {{paramilitary}} issue and <b>the</b> <b>FARC's</b> demands to expand {{the area of the}} demilitarized zone, which was due to expire on May 7, and to extend the timeframe.|$|R

25|$|After these developments, {{eventually}} many U.S. {{and other}} military experts considered that <b>the</b> <b>FARC's</b> Manuel Marulanda Vélez, as a veteran guerrilla fighter and as an efficient commander for four decades, was able to lead perhaps the most capable and dangerous Marxist guerrilla organization in the world.|$|R
