40|$|Despite {{research}} {{demonstrating the}} effectiveness of exposure therapy for pathological anxiety, this treatment is underutilized by clinicians. Anecdotal evidence and clinical experience suggest that therapists who possess reservations about exposure therapy tend to exclude clients from this treatment based on client characteristics believed to predict worse response. When exceptions are made based on characteristics that do not reliably predict poor outcomes, clients face the opportunity cost associated with investment in less effective treatments. The present investigation assessed therapists 2 ̆ 7 likelihood <b>of</b> excluding <b>clients</b> from <b>exposure</b> due to different client and therapist characteristics. Exposure therapists (N= 182) completed an online survey that included the Therapist Beliefs about Exposure Scale, Anxiety Sensitivity Index- 3, and the Broken Leg Exception Scale (BLES), a novel measure assessing the likelihood <b>of</b> excluding <b>clients</b> from <b>exposure</b> based on 25 different client characteristics. The BLES demonstrated good psychometric properties. Client characteristics most {{likely to result in}} exclusion from exposure therapy were comorbid psychosis, emotional fragility, and reluctance to participate in exposure. Greater likelihood <b>of</b> excluding <b>clients</b> from <b>exposure</b> was associated with higher therapist anxiety sensitivity and endorsement of negative beliefs about exposure therapy.

This {{descriptive}} {{study was designed}} to determine the percentages of negative cultures among all clients age 18 years and older presumptively treated with antibiotics for suspected chlamydia and/or gonorrhea infections according to the guidelines of the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention in the Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinic of the Palm Beach County Health Department (PBCHD). Background. At present it remains unclear what proportion of patients treated for chlamydial and/or gonococcal infections with antibiotics presumptive treatment in the PBCHDSTD clinic have negative cultures. By determining the extent of negative cultures in people treated by antibiotics for those diseases, we can recommend directions of further search for possible better testing and treatment strategies. Methods. Clinic logs were reviewed for a case series <b>of</b> all 1209 <b>clients</b> treated from November 1, 2007 to October 31, 2008. Culture results were retrieved from Department of Health’s Health Management System. Results. Of the 1209, 556 (46 %) were treated for chlamydia, 30 (2. 6 %) for gonorrhea, and 623 (51. 5 %) for both. The frequencies of negative cultures were 68 % overall, 70. 9 % for chlamydia, 86. 6 % for gonorrhea, and 65. 2 % for both. Conclusions. These descriptive data indicate that implementation of the CDC guidelines by the PBCHDSTD Clinic results in <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> a large majority <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> with negative cultures for chlamydia, gonorrhea, or both.

This retrospective study examined outcomes after participation in Cognitive Perceptual Motor Retraining (CPM) <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> with ABI and identified demographic and injury characteristics <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> that {{were associated with}} outcomes.

Furthermore, the institutional personnel ascribe the animals crucial, meaningful and important roles to the young client´s positive development. The respondents also ascribe the animals a defenceless and inferior role. All respondents in the study argue unanimously that the animals are of significant importance for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the young <b>clients.</b> Hence, the animal can act as a link between the young client and the institutional personnel.

Choice advocates claim that markets spark innovation, while institutional {{theory suggests that}} isomorphic forces will limit novel school forms. Using qualitative data from third sector private schools in Toronto, three hypotheses {{about the impact of}} markets on educa-tional organizations are examined: (a) they reverse tendencies toward iso-morphism as schools develop client niches; (b) they allow schools to weaken their formal structures; and (c) they force schools to more closely monitor their effectiveness. Substantial evidence exists for the first hypothesis, partial evidence for the second hypothesis, but little evidence for the third.

40|$|This {{research}} paper explores {{the use of}} drama therapy, integrated with concepts from Goffman's dramaturgical model, in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> with anorexia. The goal {{of this study is}} to illustrate the way in which drama therapy is effective in drawing out the true self/backstage <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> with anorexia. Goffman's dramaturgical model, which is a self-representation model, describes self-representation in terms of a front stage and a backstage and that a person will act according to the situation while there are other things taking place backstage, yet are not revealed (as cited in Moghaddam, 1998). Hence, these concepts of a front stage and backstage also parallel the true self and false self <b>of</b> the <b>client</b> with anorexia and the aim of drama therapy in this study is to draw the true self out onto the front stage. Thus, the core section of this paper lies in the third chapter which focuses on the use of drama therapy interventions (with narrative therapy psychodramatic and cognitive behavioral therapy influences), as a therapeutic method in bringing a true self forwards.

Included in the meta-analysis were 17 studies comprising a total <b>of</b> 2263 <b>clients,</b> 1291 men and 972 women, with a weighted mean age of 45. 44 years. The diagnoses of 86 % <b>of</b> the <b>clients</b> were within the psychotic spectrum while 14 % had other psychiatric diagnoses. There were six randomized controlled trials and eleven observa-tional studies. The studies spanned between 12 and 60 months, and 10 of them lasted 24 months. The results indicated a large effect-size for the ”grand total measure ” (Cohen´s d = 0. 80). The study comprised three outcome variables: Symp-toms, Functioning, and Well-being. With regard to Symptoms, a medium effect for both randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies was found, whereas Functioning showed large effects for both types of design. Concerning Well-being both large and medium effects were evident. The conclusions of the meta-analysis were that the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> with Resource Group Assertive Community Treatment yields positive effects for clients with psychoses and that the method may be <b>of</b> use for <b>clients</b> within the entire psychiatric spectrum...|$|R

For the first time, the goals and methods of harm reduction are incorporated into a multidimensional psychotherapeutic approach.

The focus is on reducing {{the damage done by}} drug use while respecting each client's needs, priorities, and life choices. A comprehensive clinical rationale is provided, and readers are taken step by step through assessment and treatment. Intervention strategies are described in depth, illustrated with extended case examples. Topics covered include addressing the difficulties with affect and trust that are often found in substance using persons, neurobiological aspects of addiction, and working with dual-and multi-diagnosis patients. Applications to consultation and training are also discussed.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} examines the prospective associations of religiousness/spirituality with {{depression and the}} extent to which various dimensions of forgiveness act as mediating mechanisms of these associations. Data are from a nationally representative sample of United States adults who were first interviewed in 1998 and reinterviewed six months later. Measures of religiousness/spirituality, forgiveness, and various sociodemographics were collected. Depression was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview administered by trained interviewers. Results showed that religiousness/spirituality, forgiveness of oneself and others, and feeling forgiven by God were associated, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with depressive status. After controlling for initial depressive status, only forgiveness of oneself and others remained statistically significant predictors of depression. Path analyses revealed that religiousness/spirituality conveyed protective effects, prospectively, on depression by way of an indirect path through forgiveness of others but not forgiveness of oneself. Hence, forgiveness of others acts as a mechanism of the salutary effect of religiousness/spirituality, but forgiveness of oneself is an independent predictor.
