60|$|As {{the sin of}} {{impurity}} was {{the reigning}} vice in India amongst the Portuguese, he applied himself, in a particular manner, to withdraw them from their voluptuous living. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> his proceeding was to insinuate himself into the favour, {{not only of the}} concubinarians, but of their mistresses; and he compassed this by the mildness of his aspect, by the obligingness of his words, and sometimes by good offices. Yet we cannot think that the conversions of sinners cost him only these addresses. Before he treated with them concerning the important business of their souls, he treated with God at the holy altars; but to render his prayers more efficacious, he joined them with all manner of austerities. Having notice that three Portuguese soldiers, belonging to the garrison of Amboyna, had lived for five years past in great debauchery, he got their good wills by his engaging carriage, and wrought so well, that these libertines, as wicked as they were, lodged him in their quarters during a whole Lent, so much they were charmed with his good humour. But while he appeared thus gay amongst them in his outward behaviour, for fear of giving them any disgust of his company, he underwent most rigorous penances to obtain the grace of their conversion, and used his body so unmercifully, that he was languishing for a month of those severities. When Xavier had reduced his penitents to that point at which he aimed, that is, when he had brought them to confession, they cost him not less pains than formerly. He always begged of God their perseverance with his tears; and frequently, when he had enjoined them some light penance, paid for them the remainder of their debts with bloody disciplining of his own body. But when he lighted on intractable and stubborn souls, he left them not off for their contumacy, but rather sought their good opinion; and, on occasion, shewed them a better countenance than usual, that thence they might be given to understand how ready he was for their reception.|$|E
