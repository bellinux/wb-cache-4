40|$|Building {{rehabilitation}} {{is essential}} to achieve the targets defined by the EPBD-recast regarding energy efficiency, reduction of carbon emissions and use of on-site renewable energy sources. To propose an effective building rehabilitation {{it is necessary to}} study the best combination of available options in terms of construction solutions, <b>technical</b> <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> (hot water, ventilation, heating, cooling and lighting), their cost, but also their impact on the thermal and acoustic comfort and indoor air quality of the building. Also, the definition of the cost-optimal level is essential, which is the minimum lifecycle cost (including investment costs, maintenance and operating costs, energy costs, earnings from energy produced and disposal costs) of each individual measure. In this work the multi-criteria decision analysis method ELECTRE III will be applied to balance all these aspects, during the design phase of a refurbishment project, in order to assist the design team on the selection of construction solutions and <b>technical</b> <b>building</b> <b>systems.</b> A simple case study is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in what concerns the definition of the energy performance requirements (e. g. thickness of insulation and efficiency of the heating system/air-conditioning system etc.), of a rehabilitation project. In this example several retrofit alternatives were studied, their implementation could lead to the reduction of the energy needs of the building from 13 % to 83 %. With this approach it was also possible to identify the alternative with the best global performance considering the investment costs, energy needs, indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and CO 2 emissions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Directive EPBD {{introduced}} Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) {{an energy}} policy tool.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a feasible model of architecture for the <b>technical</b> <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> (TBS) particularly suitable for Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs). NZEBs are buildings where the energetic consumption are optimized {{by means of}} solutions that drastically reduce both electric and thermal demand, while residual required energy has to be provided by local renewable generation.

The building (or a group of buildings) represents the natural limit of the aggregation of the electric systems, like in the heating systems. Present proposal is a full electric smart micro grid with heating and domestic hot water generated by a centralized electric heat pump system. The renewable energy is provided by a photovoltaic field. The authors suggest to control the whole electric demand of the building by exploiting its thermal inertia as an energy storage by forcing both local and central set points of heating and air conditioning systems and time shifting opportunities of smart appliances.

40|$|The {{energy policy}} {{approach}} is {{carrying out a}} long-time renewal process of the electric and in general energy framework. The energy spent in commercial, residential, and institutional buildings is a great amount (in EU is estimated about 40 % of total energy consumption and about 90 % in high-density urban areas) [1]. The general encouragement of the rational use of energy, also for residential users, introduced the new approach of the nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs) by the European energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD) [3]. NZEB means a building that has a very high energy performance, as determined in accordance with Annex I of Directive [3]. The nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, favoring energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby. Let us note that the major appliances (both white and brown goods) and other electric loads not fixed (equipment supplied by plugs) are not {{taken into account in}} the NZEB qualification. The EPBD requires all new buildings to be NZEBs by the end of 2020 (public buildings must be NZEBs by 2018). A building may reach the NZEB qualification through a complex of efficient <b>technical</b> <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> (TBSs), building automation control system (BACS), and renewable sources, besides a very high energy performance given by envelope insulation and other passive measures [4]. The TBSs that must be provided vary with the type of building, but will generally include a building electric service and power distribution system to serve the loads, a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, a domestic hot water (DHW) system, electronic safety and security systems, and a communication system (ICT). The extremely low amount of energy that NZEBs require (energy spent ES 2) comes mostly from renewable local sources (energy generated ERES) like: photovoltaic (PV), ground-source heat pumps (GSHP) or thermal solar systems...|$|E
40|$|For {{quite a long}} time, experts {{considered}} zero energy {{buildings or}} buildings {{that do not require}} a heating system (as the passive house was inappropriately described at the begin) to be landmarks in this development process. The vision of a building that produces more energy than it uses for running the <b>technical</b> <b>building</b> <b>systems</b> (and thus becomes an energy-generating unit itself) once belonged to a distant, perhaps even unattainable future. Undoubtedly, the development of the surplus energy house marks another quantum leap in the field of energy research to which Fraunhofer IBP research staff contributed their share, proving great commitment and initiative. In the meantime, IBP's Heat Technology team has extended its scope, now providing surplus energy building concepts not only for various residential buildings, school buildings and other educational buildings, but also for office buildings and even for existing buildings. Each of the 250 exciting pilot building projects the Heat Technology team has realized so far has taken the development a step further. Buildings functioning as energy providers create a scenario that opens up completely new ways of securing the energy supply. To ensure sustainable success, it takes both: detailed, fully developed concepts of building types and excellent quality of building construction. Equipped with these parameters, energy solutions for districts or even for entire cities can be tackled. Pilot projects need strong partners who pull together to ensure that such pilot schemes will have the necessary effectiveness. When it comes to setting and supporting sustainable trends in society, the challenge for policy is to initiate demonstration projects, to provide start-up financing, and to create the appropriate framework for change. The high relevance of these research projects is confirmed by the fact that emerging superior trends need to be analysed {{in the course of the}} project, that guiding principles have to be derived from these analyses, and that experience gained from the project has to be summarized in guidelines, for instance. The paper presents experiences made at various surplus energy buildings based on detailed measurement concept, which enables the IBP researchers to evaluate the design results obtained for different building concepts. The measurement configuration allows establishing a comprehensive balance of energy flows on a monthly basis, thus visualizing the performance of the installed plant components. In this way, users will keep informed on the current status of their energy balances. Besides, the air temperatures and CO 2 -levels measured in relevant spaces (like living rooms or bedrooms) are continuously recorded...|$|E
