The main question of this thesis is whether we can characterize the process of <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> revolution by <b>the</b> population development of this two countries, namely Japan on one side and Mexico on the other side. Firstly, the work is focused on the definition of {{the beginning and end of}} <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> revolution in developing countries and analysis of its process. In the following part, there is an explanation of <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> revolution in Japan and Mexico based on the analysis of mortality and fertility and changes in the age structure. In accordance with the given aim the analysis is not performed in the same time period, but in particular stages of <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> revolution.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> {{transition}} {{and its effect}} on economic growth using a cross-country data. We use a threshold regression model to verify the transition and to confirm whether <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> transitions are compressed or not in developing countries. We found out that in general, <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> transitions, including <b>the</b> decreasing birth and death rate, in developing countries start in an earlier development stage compared to <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> transitions in developed countries. These results suggest that the aging population and the decreasing working-age fraction in developing countries can also start in an earlier development stage than the experiences of developed countries and that <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> gift in developing countries can also be lost in an early stage. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{economic returns}} to <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> transition are high. As countries {{move from a}} steady state with high mortality and high fertility to an equilibrium with low mortality and fewer children, lower dependency ratios, higher investment in human and physical capital as well as increased female labor force participation contribute to economic growth. In this paper, we analyze <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> transition at <b>the</b> household level, investigating the distributional patterns {{of the economic and}} welfare benefits associated with <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> transition across socioeconomic groups within countries and over time. We find large differences in the effects of <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> transition across socioeconomic status (SES) groups {{in the early stages of}} <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> transition, but also substantial behavioral change across all groups during phases of rapid fertility decline, so that the long-run effects of <b>the</b> <b>demographic</b> transition on inequality remain ambiguous. 1 The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supported for this research provided by the William and Flor...|$|R

The korenizatsiia policy implemented in this era, which was to promote minority groups within the USSR, saw the numbers of Abkhaz increase: between 1922 and 1926, ethnic Abkhaz grew by roughly 8%, and constituted about 27.8% of the population; in this same time-frame, the number of ethnic Georgians fell from 42% to 36% (67,494).
