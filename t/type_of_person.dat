Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> who no longer exists.

Only analyses pertaining to institutionalization and costs were conducted for the last three sets of comparison groups. Except for the issue of institutionalization, {{quality of life}} impact analysis showed only a few more post-test differences than would be expected by chance (although the few post-test differences that were observed in each case favored less restrictive settings). This more general similarity of outcome is indeed provocative, suggesting that in many ways the applicants adapted similarly to these quite distinct programs. Cost analyses found that nursing home and geriatric day hospital care, the two most restrictive settings, were also the two most expensive interventions...|$|R

In October 1978, Morland got Representative Ronald V. Dellums to submit a series of questions about plutonium production to the Department of Energy (DOE), the successor to the AEC. The DOE responded by classifying the questions. In September and October 1978, the House Armed Services Committee held hearings on the proposed Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
