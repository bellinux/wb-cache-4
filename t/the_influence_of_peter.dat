2500|$|Hitchens {{joined the}} Labour Party in 1965, {{but along with}} the {{majority}} of the Labour students' organisation was expelled in 1967, because of what Hitchens called [...] "Prime Minister Harold Wilson's contemptible support for the war in Vietnam". Under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Sedgwick, who translated the writings of Russian revolutionary and Soviet dissident Victor Serge, Hitchens forged an ideological interest in Trotskyism and anti-Stalinist socialism. Shortly after he joined [...] "a small but growing post-Trotskyist Luxemburgist sect".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2001 {{interview}} with Reason, Hitchens said {{he became a}} Marxist and a Trotskyist in his teens, beliefs that further developed during his time at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1966, he was demonstrating in Trafalgar Square against the Vietnam War. In 1967, he joined the International Socialists while at Balliol College, Oxford. Under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Sedgwick, who translated the writings of Russian revolutionary and Soviet dissident Victor Serge, Hitchens forged an ideological interest in Trotskyist and anti-Stalinist socialism. Shortly after he joined [...] "a small but growing post-Trotskyist Luxemburgist sect". He became a socialist [...] "largely [...] {{the outcome of a}} study of history, taking sides... in the battles over industrialism and war and empire." [...] He was also drawn into the political left by his anger over the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, racism and [...] "oligarchy", including that of [...] "the unaccountable corporation." [...] He also said in the same {{interview with}} Reason that he could no longer say [...] "I am a socialist". Socialists, he claimed, had ceased to offer a positive alternative to the capitalist system.|$|E
5000|$|Around 2011, Lambiel {{also started}} coaching. [...] In 2014, he founded Skating School of Switzerland in Champéry. In an interview, he {{acknowledged}} <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Grütter and Jacques Gerschwiler as skating coaches. He formerly coached Paolo Bacchini. In 2016, {{he became a}} coach for Deniss Vasiļjevs.|$|E
50|$|Van den Hoecke, {{who studied}} under Juliaan Teniers, became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in 1603. His early works {{continue}} Mannerist tendencies {{that were still}} popular {{at the beginning of}} the seventeenth century, but later <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Paul Rubens and Caravaggism are noticeable in his paintings.|$|R
50|$|Two general epistles in the New Testament are {{ascribed}} to Peter, but modern scholars generally reject the Petrine authorship of both. The Gospel of Mark was traditionally thought to show <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter's</b> preaching and eyewitness memories. Several other books bearing his namethe Acts <b>of</b> <b>Peter,</b> Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Peter,</b> Preaching <b>of</b> <b>Peter,</b> Apocalypse <b>of</b> <b>Peter,</b> and Judgment <b>of</b> Peterare considered by Christian denominations as apocryphal, {{and are thus}} not included in their Bible canons.|$|R

5000|$|Erik Bach (born 5 January 1946) is a Danish {{composer}} and writer on music. He took his diploma in music theory and music {{history from the}} Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus.

50|$|For <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Péter</b> Pázmány he {{converted}} from Protestantism to Roman Catholicism and his descendants would {{study at the}} Jesuit University in Nagyszombat, founded by the Cardinal Pázmány. His wife was Sára Kánya de Budafalva. Probably, Mátyás Bél, the famous theologian and polymath was also their descendant.|$|E
5000|$|The verse {{is in the}} key of B minor, {{while the}} chorus is in the {{relative}} key of D major. Simon Cowe's lead guitar work betrays <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Green, while the song's instrumental coda - like Green's hit composition [...] "Man of the World" [...] - ends on a D major sixth chord.|$|E
5000|$|Fonte Avellana was at {{this time}} under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> St. <b>Peter</b> Damian, who {{promoted}} penitential self-mortification. It is through his vigorous embrace of this practice that Dominic Loricatus has become most well known, particularly through a mention by Edward Gibbon in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Vol. V, C. LVIII): ...|$|R
50|$|Although Sophia {{was always}} {{considerate}} towards Ivan, he neither sought nor received {{any role in}} government, and Sophia is never known to have consulted him on any important matter. However, she was anxious that every outward sign of respect and deference be paid to Ivan, which was a subtle way <b>of</b> undermining <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter's</b> faction in court. Thus, every wish or opinion expressed by Ivan deferred to, and his general prestige in court remained intact {{during the years of}} Sophia's regency. As Peter the Great grew up, he and his faction, led by his mother's Naryshkin family, contended with Regent Sophia for influence and power. Indeed, Sophia is even blamed for the murders <b>of</b> <b>Peter's</b> uncles on his mother Natalia Naryshkina's side of the family. Due to this and other situations, tension arose between the two groups of Tsar Alexis's children (born to his two wives).|$|R
50|$|In his Low German lyric and epic poems, which reflect <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> Johann <b>Peter</b> Hebel, Groth gives poetic {{expression}} {{to the country}} life of his northern home; and though his descriptions may not always reflect the peculiar characteristics of the peasantry of Holstein as faithfully as those of Fritz Reuter, yet Groth is a lyric poet of genuine inspiration.|$|R
50|$|It was Lord Bute, one of Heming’s most {{important}} patrons, who encouraged this significant new appointment. Heming {{was the first}} working goldsmith to hold this post since the early seventeenth century {{and the majority of}} pieces were made in his own workshop. The superb quality and refined delicacy of many of the items reflect <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Archambo.|$|E
5000|$|Arthur Duff was not {{interested}} in making grand statements in his music but preferred to explore what he termed [...] "the laneways and the miniature". The lack of a strong classical music tradition in Ireland led him, like many of his Irish contemporaries, to seek guidance from the great names in English music. <b>The</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Warlock and Frederick Delius, for instance, can be heard in his small output of orchestral compositions.|$|E

5000|$|Larry Hama said Steranko [...] "combined {{the figurative}} {{dynamism}} of Jack Kirby with modern design concepts. <b>The</b> graphic <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Max, Op Art and Andy Warhol were embedded {{into the design}} of the pages — and the pages were designed as a whole, not just as a series of panels. All this, executed in a crisp, hard-edged style, seething with drama and anatomical tension".|$|R
50|$|In this {{alternate}} reality, a young Ben Parker {{is working}} as a military policeman. He is assigned to security for Doctor Erskine, a scientist for the Captain America program. An assassination attempt on Erskine succeeds, killing Ben in the process. Later on, May still attempts to raise Peter on her own, but without <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> Ben, <b>Peter</b> grows up to be angry, cynical and mean-spirited, going {{on to become the}} Hulk of this reality when he sneaks onto the test site that Rick Jones sneaked onto in the original version of events.|$|R
2500|$|Under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> Father <b>Peter</b> Yorke (1864–1925), Walsh became {{interested}} in many aspects of Irish culture. Tomás Ó Fiaich later commented that Walsh was one of [...] "... a generation of students [...] which was collectively able, multi-talented, committed and independent-minded", many of whom went on to achieve great distinction in many aspects of Irish life. However, his participation in a controversy concerning 'compulsory Irish' at the National University led to him been denied ordination at Maynooth; the ceremony instead took place at All Hallow's College, Dublin, on 24 June 1909. He was also forbidden to return to pursue postgraduate studies.|$|R
50|$|Villalpando's {{early works}} attest to <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Paul Rubens; however, as his style {{continued}} to develop, he {{moved away from}} the extremes of vivid coloring and excessive robustness to a more measured style, using a broad palette and incorporating more of the New World painting traditions. In his later work he moved away from uniform luminosity, employing greater contrast and placing artificial light sources within his paintings to add a touch of drama. His work was much emulated.|$|E
50|$|Early works suggest <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Tchaikovsky. He wrote lyrical piano miniatures (suites, cycles, and albums), children's choruses and songs. One of his vocal cycles {{is called}} Basni v litsach (The Fables in Faces) after Ivan Krylov. He wrote also a stage work Krylov's Fables (c. 1900). His children's {{music is the}} most notable of all his works. He {{continued}} the Russian penchant for the whole tone scale, using it in the piece Les demons s'amusent, included into the melomimic suite Les Rêves (Dreams, 1899).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> I {{and debates}} over the {{function}} and form of literature as it related to the Russian language {{in the first half}} of the 18th century set a stylistic precedent for the writers during the reign of Catherine the Great in the second half of the century. However, the themes and scopes of the works these writers produced were often more poignant, political and controversial. Alexander Nikolayevich Radishchev, for example, shocked the Russian public with his depictions of the socio-economic condition of the serfs. Empress Catherine II condemned this portrayal, forcing Radishchev into exile in Siberia.|$|E
50|$|Schneider {{was also}} {{interested}} in using information technology to store and analyze ethnographic information. He served on the executive committee of the Human Relations Area Files between 1981 and 1984, {{at a time when}} the organization began moving its data into electronic format. As Edgar Wimans notes, <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> George <b>Peter</b> Murdock can be seen in Schneider's work, not only in his interest in ethnographic databases (a movement which Murdock pioneered), but in the way in which he developed general causal hypotheses explaining features of social structure. This facet of Schneider's thought is best exemplified in his 1979 Livestock and Equality in East Africa: The Economic Basis for Social Structure, where he maintains that a pastoral society's kinship system and its degree of egalitarianism are conditioned by the number of livestock per person.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painter <b>Peter</b> Paul Rubens on {{architecture}} {{was very}} important. With his book [...] "I Palazzi di Genova" [...] he introduced novel Italian {{models for the}} conception of profane buildings and decoration in the Southern Netherlands. The courtyard and portico of his own house in Antwerp (Rubenshuis) are good examples of his architectural activity. He also {{took part in the}} decoration of the Antwerp Jesuit Church (now Carolus Borromeuskerk) where he introduced a lavish Baroque decoration, integrating sculpture and painting in the architectural program.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century Pan became an {{increasingly}} common figure {{in literature and}} art. Patricia Merivale states that between 1890 and 1926 there was an [...] "astonishing resurgence {{of interest in the}} Pan motif". He appears in poetry, in novels and children's books, and is referenced in the name <b>of</b> the character <b>Peter</b> Pan. [...] In the Peter Pan stories, Peter represents a golden age of pre-civilisation in both the minds of very young children, before enculturation and education, and in the natural world outside <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> humans. <b>Peter</b> Pan’s character is both charming and selfish emphasizing our cultural confusion about whether human instincts are natural and good, or uncivilised and bad. J. M. Barrie describes Peter as ‘a betwixt and between’, part animal and part human, and uses this device to explore many issues of human and animal psychology within the Peter Pan stories.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} at Sudbury in Suffolk on 18 July 1820, the third son of William Wood Humphry, a barrister. He was educated at the grammar schools of Sudbury and Dedham, and in 1836 he was apprenticed to John Green Crosse, surgeon to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. In 1839 he left Norwich and entered {{as a student at}} St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, where he came under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Mere Latham, William Lawrence, and James Paget. He passed the first M.B. {{examination}} at the London University in 1840, obtaining the gold medal in anatomy and physiology; but did not present himself for the final examination.|$|E
50|$|The Union of Liberation (Russian: Союз Освобождения, English transliteration: Soyuz Osvobozhdeniya) was {{a liberal}} {{political}} group founded in St. Petersburg, Russia in January 1904 under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Struve, a former Marxist. Its goal was originally {{the replacement of}} the absolutism of the Tsar with a constitutional monarchy. Its other goals included an equal, secret and direct vote for all Russian citizens and the self-determination of different nationalities (such as the Poles) that lived in the Russian State. The origins of the Union of Liberation {{can be traced back to}} 1901 when Russian liberal exiles created a periodical call ed Liberation which included ideas such as a constitutional monarchy.|$|E
50|$|Baron Zsigmond {{had been}} in Polish king Stephen Báthory's royal court since 1583. He became a Royal Counselor in 1599. He {{converted}} to Catholicism under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Péter</b> Pázmány. He acquired huge lands by his marriages. He functioned as Lord Lieutenant (Count; comes) of Nógrád County between 1600 and 1621. He also served as Master of Cup-bearers from 1604 to 1607.In 1604, he offered peace to Stephen Bocskay, leader of the Bocskay's War of Independence, {{but he was not}} authorized by King Rudolf or Crown Prince Matthias, so his offer was rejected. In 1605 at Kassa (today: Košice, Slovakia), he negotiated unsuccessfully, along with György Thurzó and Benedek Pogrányi, with the envoys of Bocskay.|$|E
50|$|Under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> Jesuit priest <b>Peter</b> Canisius, Budinić {{abandoned}} the language {{he had been}} using in his 1582 work, and instead used a mixture of the Shtokavian Serbo-Croatian, Church Slavonic, Czech, and Polish languages. Budinić referred {{to the language of}} his work as Slavonic. Budinić then published translations of Canisius' work in 1583 (Summa nauk Kristjanski) in two versions, Cyrillic and Latin, and created a complex script based on Ijekavian Shtokavian pronunciation. The Latin script edition was published for clergy while Cyrillic script edition was published for population. Budinić published Cyrillic script edition with intention to sprad this kind of book among South Slavs who were adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church.|$|R
50|$|Universalism {{became a}} {{significant}} minority {{view in the}} 18th century, popularized by thinkers such as John Murray (the American, not the Scot). Universalism holds that Christ's death on the cross has entirely atoned for the sin of humanity; hence, God's wrath is or will be satisfied for all people. Conservative and liberal varieties of universalism then point in different directions. Pluralistic Unitarian Universalism asserts that many different religions all lead to God. Others teach that God's love is sufficient to cover for sins, thus embracing some form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moral <b>influence</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Abelard. For some universalists, justification either was accomplished {{once and for all}} in the crucifixion, or is altogether unnecessary.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} said [...] that the reason the Pope always faced the people when celebrating Mass in St Peter's was that early Christians faced eastward when praying and, due to the {{difficult}} terrain, the basilica was built with its apse to the west. Some have attributed this orientation in other early Roman churches to <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> Saint <b>Peter's.</b> However, <b>the</b> arrangement whereby the apse with the altar is at {{the west end of}} the church and the entrance on the east is found also in Roman churches contemporary with Saint Peter's (such as the original Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls) that were under no such constraints of terrain, and the same arrangement remained the usual one until the 6th century. In this early layout, the people were situated in the side aisles of the church, not in the central nave. While the priest faced both the altar and east throughout the Mass, the people would face the altar (from the sides) until the high point of the Mass, where they would then turn to face east along with the priest.|$|R
50|$|Compelled {{soon after}} {{to flee to}} Cracow, he found refuge with the Franciscan fathers in that city. After fifteen months of {{wandering}} he received his passport enabling him to leave for Paris in 1865. Here he fell under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Semenenko, Hieronim Kajsewicz, Aleksander Jelowicki, and Adam Mickiewicz, who dreamed of Poland's resurrection through the spiritual regeneration of the Poles. Going to Rome, he joined the newly founded Congregation of the Resurrection and soon after receiving the special blessing of Pope Pius IX set out for America (1866). After several years' labour in the Diocese of San Antonio, Texas, he was appointed pastor of St. Stanislaus parish, Chicago, in 1874, then comprising about 450 families.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} {{the son of a}} noble lawyer and historian, in Alzano Lombardo near Bergamo. His father died in the plague of 1528 and his mother died only three years later. At age 15 he entered the monastery of the Augustinian Order of Regular Canons, where he studied Aristotle, {{languages}} and divinity. After completing his studies, he went to Lucca, and there under <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Martyr Vermigli he opted for a theological career, being especially impressed by Vermigli's lectures on Romans. In addition to works of the Fathers, he became aware of Martin Bucer and Philipp Melanchthon, also read Martin Luther's writings and the Swiss reformers. John Calvin, however, had the greatest influence on him.|$|E
5000|$|After 1630, {{his palette}} {{lightened}} up considerably {{and the dark}} background was replaced by architectural motifs, clouds and landscape elements. The realistic facial expressions became more Classicist and he used more variations of colour. These changes reflected <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Paul Rubens with whom Seghers closely collaborated during the 1630s. [...] This influence went even so far that in his painting the Adoration of the Magi (1630, Church of Our Lady, Bruges) he adopted Rubens' composition for his treatment of the same subject. [...] It is with this style that he achieved his greatest success in his career. His most important and most characteristic works were painted between 1630 and 1640. Afterwards, he changed to a more gracious and elegant, but also less monumental style. His colours became weaker and the draperies more linear.|$|E
5000|$|... "Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] {{soon became}} one of the {{creative}} zeniths of the Silver Age, and one of comics' most groundbreaking, innovative and acclaimed features. Wrote Les Daniels, in his Comix: A History of Comic Books in America, [...] "Even the dullest of readers could sense that something new was happening. ... With each passing issue Steranko's efforts became more and more innovative. Entire pages would be devoted to photocollages of drawings that ignored panel boundaries and instead worked together on planes of depth. The first pages ... became incredible production numbers similar in design to the San Francisco rock concert poster of the period". Writer-artist Larry Hama, in an introduction to Nick Fury collection, said Steranko [...] "combined the figurative dynamism of Jack Kirby with modern design concepts", and recostumed Fury from suits and ties to [...] "a form-fitting bodysuit with numerous zippers and pockets, like a Wally Wood spacesuit revamped by Pierre Cardin. The women were clad in form-fitting black leather a la Emma Peel in the Avengers TV show. <b>The</b> graphic <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peter</b> Max, Op Art and Andy Warhol were embedded into the design of the pages - and the pages were designed as a whole, not just as a series of panels. All this, executed in a crisp, hard-edged style, seething with drama and anatomical tension." ...|$|R
50|$|Around {{the ages}} of 8-10, after having heard the exhortation of the preacher Fr. Domenico da Leonessa, she made a vow to meditate every Friday on the Passion of Christ. Information {{regarding}} her life is derived almost entirely from her own writings. This revelation of herself was brought about through <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> her confessor, <b>Peter</b> <b>of</b> Mogliano, provincial of the Friars Minor in the Marches (1490). Then from {{the ages of}} 18-21, she went through three years of deep spiritual struggles against the allurements of the world. Her father did all {{in his power to}} force his daughter into marriage, even to the extent of imprisoning her. But Camilla resisted his plans so firmly that after two years and a half he restored her to liberty, for fear, as he said, of drawing upon himself divine vengeance, and gave his consent to her becoming a nun.|$|R
