5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist {{campaign}} was also generally praised. According to IGN's McCaffrey, the game's story {{is superior to}} those of its predecessors: well-balanced and believable. He criticized Sam Fisher's new voice actor, who he thought failed to replicate Ironside's charm. Ben Reeves praised the story's plot <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> sympathetic characters. On the Joystiq blog, Xav De Matos liked the game's narrative urgency and engaging plot twists but criticized its rushed ending. Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com called the game forgettable and boring, with Fisher's new voice actor failing to bring personality to the character. Eurogamer Bramwell also criticized the game's lack of character development.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{expression}} of transcription factors <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia tissues and their relationship with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell proliferation. Methods: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia tissues (n= 67) and normal cervical tissues (n= 85) were collected, and the contents of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail as well as epithelialmesenchymal transition-related molecules and proliferation-related molecules in the tissues were detected. Results: <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail contents in CIN cervical tissues were lower than those in normal cervical tissues; Twist, Snail, PI 3 K, Akt, STAT 3, Vimentin, N-cadherin, Prdx 4, EZH 2 and STOML- 2 contents in CIN cervical tissues were higher than those in normal cervical tissues, and E-cadherin content was significantly lower than that in normal cervical tissues; E-cadherin content in CIN tissues with high expression of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail was significantly lower than that in CIN tissues with low expression of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail, and Vimentin, N-cadherin, Prdx 4, EZH 2 and STOML- 2 contents were higher than those in CIN tissues with low expression of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail. Conclusions: Transcription factors <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail expression increase and downstream signaling pathway function is enhanced in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia tissues; <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail can regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell proliferation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 {{expression}} in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and assesses {{the association of}} their expression with clinicopathological indicators. HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 protein expression in 129 PTCs, 61 nodular hyperplasia, and 118 normal thyroid tissue specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The protein expression levels of these three molecules were upregulated in PTCs. High protein expression of HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (P< 0. 001). Furthermore, HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 protein expression was correlated with one another. Concomitant high expression of these molecules had stronger correlation with LNM than did each alone (P= 0. 032 for HIF- 2 α/TWIST, P< 0. 001 for HIF- 2 α/CXCR 4, P= 0. 018 for TWIST/CXCR 4, and P< 0. 001 for HIF- 2 α/TWIST/CXCR 4). Additionally, HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 mRNA expression were assessed in 30 [*]PTCs, 10 nodular hyperplasia, and 10 normal thyroid tissue specimens using real-time RT-PCR. <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 mRNA expression levels were up-regulated in PTCs, and high mRNA expression of <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 was significantly correlated with LNM (P= 0. 005 and P= 0. 010, resp.). These results demonstrated that the evaluation of HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 expression in PTC {{may be useful in}} predicting the risk of LNM...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{correlation}} of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> YB- 1 gene expression in cervical cancer and precancerous tissue with cell invasion. Methods: Cervical cancer tissue, precancerous tissue and normal cervical tissue surgically removed in our hospital between May 2013 and April 2015 were collected; immunohistochemical staining kits were used to detect the positive protein expression rate of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> YB- 1 gene; fluorescence quantitative PCR kits were used to detect <b>Twist,</b> YB- 1 <b>and</b> invasion gene mRNA expression. Results: <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> YB- 1 mRNA expression and positive protein expression rate as well as USP 22, Rab 11, Rac 1 and ANXA 5 mRNA expression in cervical cancer tissue and precancerous tissue {{were significantly higher than}} those in normal cervical tissue, <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> YB- 1 mRNA expression and positive protein expression rate as well as USP 22, Rab 11, Rac 1 and ANXA 5 mRNA expression in cervical cancer tissue were significantly higher than those in precancerous tissue; USP 22, Rab 11, Rac 1 and ANXA 5 mRNA expression in cervical cancer tissue and precancerous tissue with positive <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> YB- 1 expression were significantly higher than those in cervical cancer tissue and precancerous tissue with negative <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> YB- 1 expression.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the immunoexpression of <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt proteins in oral leukoplakia (OL) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), correlating their expressions with the histological features of the lesions. Study design: Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on 10 normal oral epithelium, 30 OL and 20 OSCC formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Immunoperoxidase reactions for <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt proteins were applied on the specimens and the positivity of the reactions was calculated for 1000 epithelial cells. Results: Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post tests revealed a significant difference in <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt immunoexpression among normal oral mucosa, OL and OSCC. In addition, a significant positive correlation was found between <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt expressions according to the Pearson's correlation test. Conclusions: The results obtained in the current study suggest that <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt may participate of the multi-step process of oral carcinogenesis since its early stages. © Medicina Oral S.

5|$|Newton {{wrote the}} words from {{personal}} experience. He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path {{was formed by}} a variety of <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination. He was pressed (conscripted) into service in the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to God for mercy, a moment that marked his spiritual conversion. He continued his slave trading career until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying Christian theology.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the {{silvertip shark}} {{consists}} primarily of bony fishes, such as grouper, mackerel, tuna, escolars, lanternfish, flyingfish, wrasses, and soles. Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken. Larger sharks {{tend to be}} more sluggish and take more benthic prey. The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> turns. Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food. This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.|$|E
5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, he {{appeared}} in five episodes of the television series Rescue Me which earned him an Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. Since 2000 Fox has released three books, Lucky Man: A Memoir (2002), Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist (2009), and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Future: <b>Twists</b> <b>and</b> Turns and Lessons Learned (2010). Starting in 2010, Fox played a recurring role in the US drama The Good Wife as crafty attorney Louis Canning and earned Emmy nominations for three consecutive years. In 2011, Fox was featured as himself in the eighth season of the Larry David vehicle, Curb Your Enthusiasm. David's character (also himself) becomes a temporary resident of the New York City apartment building that Fox resides in and a conflict arises between the two, whereby David believes that Fox is using his condition (Parkinson's disease) as a manipulative tool. On August 20, 2012, NBC announced The Michael J. Fox Show, loosely based on his life. It was granted a 22-episode commitment from the network and premiered on NBC on September 26, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark {{exhibits}} {{a number of}} specializations to its mouth and pharynx for its parasitic lifestyle. The shark first secures itself to the body surface of its prey by closing its spiracles and retracting its basihyal (tongue) to create pressure {{lower than that of}} the surroundings; its suctorial lips ensure a tight seal. It then bites, using its narrow upper teeth as anchors while its razor sharp lower teeth slice into the prey. Finally, the shark <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> rotates its body to complete a circular cut, quite possibly aided by the initial forward momentum and subsequent struggles of its prey. The action of the lower teeth may also be assisted by back-and-forth vibrations of the jaw, a mechanism akin to that of an electric carving knife. This shark's ability to create strong suction into its mouth is likely also of utility in capturing smaller prey such as squid.|$|E
5|$|While {{the designs}} for the corps de logis were {{confined}} by the foundations of Harrison's earlier plan, the secondary wings and precincts were not. Abandoning completely Harrisons concept of bedrooms set in terraces beneath the corp de logis, Blore's assistant architect, Hunt, opted for the typical vast sprawling wings and servants' quarters of the 19th century English country house. These took {{full advantage of the}} gradients and topography of the site, and with their courtyards came to resemble a small medieval, fortified town of towers and high castellated walls. Nowhere is this more evident than the Shuvalov Passage, an enclosed carriage drive squeezed between the high walls of two wings, leading from the castellated Western Gatehouse to the forecourt before the northern facade. The passage, which <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> turn beneath high wall and towers and even passes under a bridge, resembles the street of a medieval town, rather than the approach to a country house.|$|E

40|$|The {{specific}} aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility, reproducibility and maturational changes of LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion variables by real-time 3 D speckle-tracking echocardiography (RT 3 DSTE) in children. A prospective study was conducted in 347 consecutive healthy subjects (181 males/ 156 females, mean age 7. 12 ± 5. 3 years, and range from birth to 18 -years) using RT 3 D echocardiography (3 DE). The LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion measurements were made off-line using TomTec software. Manual landmark selection and endocardial border editing were performed in 3 planes (apical " 2 "-, " 4 "-, and " 3 "- chamber views) and semi-automated tracking yielded LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion measurements. LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion analysis by RT 3 DSTE were feasible in 307 out of 347 subjects (88. 5 %). There was no correlation between rotation or <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> age, height, weight, BSA or heart rate, respectively. However, there was statistically significant, but very modest correlation between LV torsion and age (R 2 = 0. 036, P< 0. 001). The normal ranges were defined for rotation <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> in this cohort, and for torsion for each age group. The intra-observer and inter-observer variabilities for apical <b>and</b> basal rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion ranged from 7. 3 % ± 3. 8 % to 12. 3 % ± 8. 8 % and from 8. 8 % ± 4. 6 % to 15. 7 % ± 10. 1 %, respectively. We conclude that analysis of LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion by this new RT 3 D STE is feasible and reproducible in pediatric population. There is no maturational change in rotation <b>and</b> <b>twist,</b> but torsion decreases with age in this cohort. Further refinement is warranted to validate the utility of this new methodology in more sensitive and quantitative evaluation of congenital and acquired heart diseases in children...|$|R
