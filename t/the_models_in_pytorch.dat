30|$|To {{compare the}} {{computational}} performance of different SOCP-based ACOPF formulations, {{we have also}} implemented <b>the</b> ACOPF <b>models</b> <b>in</b> [13] and [28]. The results are listed in Tables  1 and  2. It is worth to mention that <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> reference [28] takes much longer time than our proposed SOC-ACOPF models for GAMS to generate <b>the</b> executable <b>model</b> format to <b>the</b> solver though the solver CPU time is short. <b>In</b> general, <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> [13] has <b>the</b> least number of constraints and requires less computational time. However, this model is not valid for mesh networks {{because there is no}} voltage phase angle constraint <b>in</b> this <b>model</b> (<b>the</b> results from <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> [13] are relaxed solutions for mesh networks). For <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> [28], MOSEK in GAMS cannot converge for the IEEE 57 -bus test case. These results show stronger robust performance of our SOC-ACOPF <b>models</b> compared with <b>the</b> other two convex ACOPF <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature.|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the precise value of M/F ratios that generate different types of tooth movements and compare the M/F ratios between <b>the</b> <b>models</b> with bracket and without bracket, as well as different directions (buccal-lingual and distal-mesial directions). A patient-specific canine has chosen as <b>the</b> <b>model</b> to study. For the same type of tooth movement, the value of M/F ratio is larger for <b>the</b> <b>model</b> without bracket than for <b>the</b> <b>model</b> with bracket. <b>In</b> additional, the displacement amplitude is lower for <b>the</b> <b>model</b> with bracket. This can be explained that <b>the</b> bracket <b>model</b> has larger area to sustain orthodontic force. By looking at the force system applied in different directions, one can notice that the displacements of the crown and the apex for <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> distal-mesial direction are far less than for <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> buccal-lingual direction. More M/F ratios are needed for <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> buccal-lingual direction (Figs.  4 and 5). There are principal results of two causes, in which there is a smaller contact area of the canine at the lingual side compared to the mesial side (Fig. 3) and the force system did not pass though the CRe when the force system applied to <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>in</b> buccal-lingual direction.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{present study}} sought to {{describe}} how to use <b>the</b> Business <b>Model</b> Generation <b>in</b> entrepreneurship classes, aiming to present the methodology used to apply <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom and students’ perceptions {{about the use of}} a practical model for learning. A review of the literature was about <b>the</b> <b>model</b> itself and its background and then described in the application of <b>the</b> Business <b>Model</b> Generation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discipline of entrepreneurship at the Faculdade de Economia e Administração, Universidade de São Paulo. Qualitative interviews were conducted with groups of students, in the total of fourteen, verifying that they approved the initiative and highlighted {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the application of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom. In addition, was presented the perception of teachers on the use of <b>the</b> <b>model.</b> This is a descriptive, qualitative study, considered as a teaching case. It may contribute to undergraduate teaching in the decision to use <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> a classroom, and promote the initiation of research on issues related to <b>the</b> <b>model,</b> since there are few academic efforts made in this direction...|$|R
