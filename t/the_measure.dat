5|$|As supervisor, Newsom gained public {{attention}} {{for his role}} in advocating reform of the city's Municipal Railway (Muni). He was one of two supervisors endorsed by Rescue Muni, a transit riders group, in his 1998 reelection. He sponsored Proposition B to require Muni and other city departments to develop detailed customer service plans. <b>The</b> <b>measure</b> passed with 56.6% of the vote. Newsom sponsored a ballot measure from Rescue Muni; a version of <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> was approved by voters in November 1999.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1824, the Senate {{voted to}} repeal the law that had {{established}} the Court of Appeals and {{to establish a new}} Court of Appeals with four justices. <b>The</b> <b>measure</b> came to the House floor on December 23. During the debate, Governor Desha personally lobbied legislators to support <b>the</b> <b>measure,</b> a blatant violation of the rules of the House. The next day <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> passed in the House by a vote of 5443. Governor Desha appointed pro-relief stalwart William T. Barry as Chief Justice, and three associate justices who were also Relief Party supporters.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus and Diodorus, the king, {{having taken}} <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> of the enemy, threw his best troops {{into a second}} assault the same day, the Immortals, an elite corps of 10,000 men. However, the Immortals fared {{no better than the}} Medes, and failed to make any headway against the Greeks. The Spartans {{apparently}} used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.|$|E

50|$|When <b>the</b> planimeter's <b>measuring</b> wheel moves {{perpendicular}} to its axis, it rolls, and this movement is recorded. When <b>the</b> <b>measuring</b> wheel moves parallel to its axis, the wheel skids without rolling, so this movement is ignored. That means <b>the</b> planimeter <b>measures</b> <b>the</b> distance that its measuring wheel travels, projected perpendicularly to <b>the</b> <b>measuring</b> wheel's axis of rotation. The {{area of the}} shape {{is proportional to the}} number of turns through which <b>the</b> <b>measuring</b> wheel rotates.|$|R
5|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} moderates in Congress {{to sign the}} bill, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> became law. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E
5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun was reelected to the Senate in 1845 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Daniel Elliott Huger. He soon became vocally opposed to the Mexican–American War. He believed that it would distort the national character by undermining republicanism in favor of empire and by bringing non-white persons into the country. (See §The evils of war and political parties.) When Congress declared war against Mexico on May 13, he abstained from voting on <b>the</b> <b>measure.</b> Calhoun also vigorously opposed the Wilmot Proviso, an 1846 proposal by Pennsylvania Representative David Wilmot to ban slavery in all newly acquired territories. The House of Representatives, through its Northern majority, passed the provision several times. However, the Senate, where non-slave and slave states had more equal representation, never passed <b>the</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|E

Later that year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals declared the Civil Rights Act unconstitutional, but a federal court soon overturned that decision. Stevenson backed Bourbon Democrats' appeal of that decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. By 1871, however, he had {{changed his mind and}} supported blacks' right to testify.
