5|$|After {{crossing}} The Bishops Avenue, the A1 becomes Lyttelton Road, {{which was}} laid out in 1931 {{as part of the}} residential development of the area, and runs east–west along the northern foot of Highgate Hill between Hampstead Garden Suburb and East Finchley. It is for the most part residential; on the northern side stands the Belvedere Court block of flats. Built with <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, the building is now Grade II Listed as an example of 1930s architecture.|$|E
5|$|By 18 March, Jourdan {{had formed}} his {{headquarters}} at Pfullendorf, on the heights above Ostrach. In {{front of him}} stood the largest part of his cavalry and half of his infantry. The center, including the 4th Regiment of Hussars, the 1st of Chasseurs à Cheval, and two squadrons of the 17th Dragoons, lay behind Ostrach, under command of General Klein. Jourdan distributed them in three columns, the strongest on the post road by Saulgau, another on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of Altshausen, and a third at the hamlet of Friedberg.|$|E
5|$|It is {{an ancient}} ecclesiastical parish in Greater London which lay in the {{historic}} county of Middlesex. The parish appears in the Domesday Book, {{some of the earliest}} settlements still exist today, designated as local heritage sites. The parish church, St Martin's, dates back to the 13th century and remains in use. The buildings at the northern end of Ruislip High Street form the core of the original village square and are now Grade II listed. It originally featured a central water pump which was moved out of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s as a result of increased traffic.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{the road}} {{go back to the}} 1930s, when a parkway was {{proposed}} between Camden and Atlantic City that was never built. Plans resurfaced for <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s when a group of officials led by State Senator Frank S. Farley pushed for a road to help the area economy. The New Jersey Expressway Authority was created in 1962 to be responsible for building an expressway. The Atlantic City Expressway was built between 1962 and 1965 at a total cost of $48.2 million. The South Jersey Transportation Authority assumed control of the road in 1991 from the New Jersey Expressway Authority.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid-18th century {{as part of the}} New Road, a bypass of Central London for coach traffic. It was named Pentonville Road after the new town of Pentonville, that encouraged manufacturing {{to move out of the}} city and into suburbia. Numerous factories and commercial premises became established on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th and 20th centuries, particularly after the arrival of London railways in the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|The roadway {{is part of}} the Forest Highway System that {{is funded}} and {{administered}} by the USFS and the Federal Highway Administration; the system was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. An earthen roadway was present through the area by 1936. In the beginning of 1937, the easternmost section around Point Iroquois was improved to a gravel road. Two years later, the westernmost section from Naomikong Point to the junction with M-123 was improved to gravel. The entire road surface was improved to gravel by 1945. Paving started on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1950s on the eastern end.|$|E

5|$|By 1951, {{the highway}} had been reconstructed {{generally}} along MT 87's present location, {{and it had}} been upgraded to an improved gravel road. In 1959, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> location of MT 87 was rapidly improved in order to serve as an alternate routing to U.S. Route 287. Portions of US 287 around Hebgen Lake collapsed and crumbled {{as a result of the}} 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake. After US 287 was fixed, the highway's importance decreased. In 1962, the portions of the highway from the southern terminus to present-day milepost 8.395 were reconstructed along the current location. In 1967, the rest of the highway was reconstructed along the present location. By 1987, the highway had been numbered as MT 87. The route had also been paved.|$|E
5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total that is also tied for second most all-time in NHL history.|$|E

5|$|For {{transportation}} on the bay, steamboats were commonplace between Corpus Christi and Ingleside {{during the}} 1930s. Native Americans used a route {{made up of}} a series of shallow oyster beds, dubbed Reef Road. The passage, which was about 18 to 24inches in depth, could be navigated on foot or horseback during low tides to travel across the opening of Nueces Bay into Corpus Christi Bay. White settlers discovered <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s, and it became a common way to pass from Portland to Corpus Christi via buggy, although its jagged course had to be marked with posts and horses would sometimes fall off the beds and drown. A wooden causeway connecting Portland and Corpus Christi was first constructed in 1915, but was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed by several storms. A permanent concrete bridge was erected in the 1950s, and a double lane was added in 1988. The approximately mile long structure is today known as the Nueces Bay Causeway.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sack, rumours reached the caliph that Theophilos was {{advancing}} to attack him. Mu'tasim set {{out with his}} army a day's march along <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of Dorylaion, but encountered {{no sign of a}} Byzantine attack. According to al-Tabari, Mu'tasim now pondered extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when news reached him of a conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas ibn al-Ma'mun. Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, leaving intact the fortresses around Amorium as well as Theophilos and his army in Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the home}} {{teams in the}} playoffs were decided based on a yearly rotation. From 1970 to 1974, the {{division}}al playoff round rotated which of the three division champions would not have home field advantage, with the wild-card teams and the teams they would face in the divisional playoff game would never have home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Starting in 1970, the divisional playoff games consisted of the AFC Central champions and the NFC West champions playing their games on the road. Then in 1971 it rotated to the AFC East champions and the NFC East champions playing their games on <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1972 divisional playoff games, the AFC West champions and the NFC Central champions were the visiting teams.

5|$|The rise of {{the motor}} vehicle era in the early 20th century saw the road gain {{prominence}} once more, and by 1939 the whole road had been sealed. Congestion at the Perth end of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s led to parallel roads Berwick Street and Shepparton Road being upgraded to provide bypasses. The entire Perth−Albany road was renamed Albany Highway on 2 October 1940, in recognition of its importance as an arterial traffic route. From the late 1970s, $49 million over ten years was spent on repairing Albany Highway, and the experience saw Main Roads develop a program of interventions to prevent costly road reconstruction. Since the 1990s Main Roads has been upgrading various portions along the length of Albany Highway, including widening sections to dual carriageways in Perth, and the construction of the Kenwick Link bypass.|$|E

Around 1931, a suffixed spur of NY48, New York State Route48A was designated as an alternate from Oswego to the town of Minetto. The route was deleted from the state highway system around 1940.|$|E
