40|$|Thanks to hemp, {{farming in}} certain Spanish {{enclaves}} was very dynamic {{in the late}} 18 th century. As well as giving rise to intensified relationships among its cultivators and the market, this textile plant required abundant cultural work and large-scale use of fertilisers, allowed the <b>traditional</b> <b>rotations</b> to be improved and its presence gave rise to increased yields of wheat and the other crops that followed it. When the crisis set in from the 1870 s onwards, some of the production areas replaced it slowly, being apparently unable {{to keep up the}} dynamism it had displayed before and went on giving their best irrigated land over to a "ruinous" product that prolonged their agony thanks to tariffs. Using the case of hemp as a source of data from which to draw new conclusions and make new judgements, in this paper we deal with issues such as the environmental factors conditioning agrarian change, the relation between farming methods and agricultural dynamism, the effects of tariffs on productive reorientation, or the stimuli and obstacles playing a role in the expansion of mechanisation...|$|R

40|$|Skew-corrected {{document}} {{images are}} necessary for subsequent downstream operations such as archiving, printing or improving OCR performance. Image rotation is a necessary and more expensive step in achieving skew correction of document images. Other applications of rotation include, image registration and orientation correction. <b>Traditional</b> image <b>rotation</b> algorithms [2 - 4] such as three-shear rotation [1] require three separable shears of the image. The embedded use of such techniques in scanners/printers presents technical challenges, since the memory available is limited and/or the document image is only available progressively in chunks of say 32 or 64 rows (swaths). <b>Traditional</b> image <b>rotation</b> algorithms require the entire image to be available before commencing the rotation operation. This paper presents an approach that allows image rotation using swaths of the image thus minimizing the overall memory requirement. We theoretically prove {{that the number of}} image swaths that are to be buffered is independent of the image size and depends only on the rotation angle. This approach enables rotation of any arbitrary sized image on memory constrained devices. The memory savings realized is at least 80 %, for an A 4 sized document image rotated 15 o. Our progressive approach demonstrates real-time image rotation and hence improves on the state-of-the-art approaches for reduction of rotation complexity [5 - 10].

The primary aim, a reduction of computational complexity, can easily be met- at comparable recognition accuracy, the computational effort required is reduced to 20 % or even less of the fully fledged iris code based scheme.

40|$|Clerkship {{education}} {{has been called a}} 'black box' because so little is known about what, how, and under which conditions students learn. Our aim was to develop a blueprint for education in ambulatory and inpatient settings, and in single encounters, <b>traditional</b> <b>rotations,</b> or longitudinal experiences. We identified 548 causal links between conditions, processes, and outcomes of clerkship education in 168 empirical papers published over 7 years and synthesised a theory of how students learn. They do so when they are given affective, pedagogic, and organisational support. Affective support comes from doctors' and many other health workers' interactions with students. Pedagogic support comes from informal interactions and modelling as well as doctors' teaching, supervision, and precepting. Organisational support comes from every tier of a curriculum. Core learning processes of observing, rehearsing, and contributing to authentic clinical activities take place within triadic relationships between students, patients, and practitioners. The phrase 'supported participation in practice' best describes the educational process. Much of the learning that results is too tacit, complex, contextualised, and individual to be defined as a set of competencies. We conclude that clerkship education takes place within relationships between students, patients, and doctors, supported by informal, individual, contextualised, and affective elements of the learned curriculum, alongside formal, standardised elements of the taught and assessed curriculum. This research provides a blueprint for designing and evaluating clerkship curricula as well as helping patients, students, and practitioners collaborate in educating tomorrow's doctors...|$|R

We first show that the traditional basis vector rotation rule can be expressed as a correction to the basis vector which is proportional to component vectors in the episode. With the latter form, some intermediate computations can be reused, leading to a computational load only linear to the input dimension and the subspace dimension, whereas naive implementation of the <b>traditional</b> <b>rotation</b> rule has a computational load quadratic to the input dimension. We then proceed to propose a batch-mode updating of the basis vectors. We show that the correction made to each basis vector is a linear combination of component vectors in the input episode. Computations can be further saved. Experiments show that the proposed methods preserve the ability to generate topologically ordered invariant-feature filters and that the learning procedure is largely boosted...|$|E

40|$|Switching {{activity}} {{is one of}} the most important factors in power dissipation. This paper studies the scheduling problem that minimizes both schedule length and switching activities for applications with loops. We show that to find a schedule that has the minimal switching activities among all minimum-latency schedules with or without resource constraints is NP-complete. Although the minimum latency scheduling problem is polynomial-time solvable if there is no resource constraints or only one function unit, the problem becomes NP-complete when considering switching activities as the second constraint. An algorithm, Power Reduction Rotation Scheduling (PRRS), is proposed. The algorithm attempts to minimize both switching activities and schedule length while performing scheduling and allocation simultaneously. The experimental results show that our algorithm produces effective schedules that give the switching activities 58. 5 % less compared to the <b>traditional</b> <b>rotation</b> scheduling on average. Our algorithm also shows better performance than the approach that considers scheduling and allocation at the separate phases. 1...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{restructuring}} of agricultural landscapes, {{due to the}} expansion of monocultures and the resulting elimination of non-crop habitat, is routinely blamed for rising populations of agricultural insect pests. However, landscape studies demonstrating a positive correlation between pest densities and the spatial extent of crop monocultures are rare. We test this hypothesis with a data set from 140 subsistence farms in the Andes and find the inverse correlation. Infestations by the Andean potato weevil (Premnotrypes spp.), the most important pest in Andean potato agriculture, decrease with increasing amounts of potato in the landscape. A statistical model predicts that aggregating potato fields may outperform the management of Andean potato weevils by IPM and chemical control. We speculate that the strong pest suppression generated by aggregating potato fields may partly explain why indigenous potato farmers cluster their potato fields under a <b>traditional</b> <b>rotation</b> system common in Andean agriculture (i. e., “sectoral fallow”). Our results suggest that some agricultural pests may also respond negatively {{to the expansion of}} monocultures, and that manipulating the spatial arrangement of host crops may offer an important tool for some IPM programs.

The IAU Working Group on Precession and the Equinox {{looked at}} sev-eral {{solutions}} for replacing the precession {{part of the}} IAU 2000 A precession–nutation model, which is not consistent with dynamical theory. These comparisons show that the (Capitaine et al., Astron. Astrophys., 412, 2003 a) precession theory, P 03, is both consis-tent with dynamical theory and the solution most compatible with the IAU 2000 A nuta-tion model. Thus, the working group recommends {{the adoption of the}} P 03 precession theory for use with the IAU 2000 A nutation. The two greatest sources of uncertainty in the precession theory are the rate of change of the Earth’s dynamical flattening, J 2, and the precession rates (i. e. the constants of integration used in deriving the precession). The combined uncertainties limit the accuracy in the precession theory to approximately 2 mas cent− 2. Given that there are difficulties with the traditional angles used to parameterize the precession, zA, ζA, and θA, the working group has decided that the choice of parame-ters should be left to the user. We provide a consistent set of parameters that may be used with either the <b>traditional</b> <b>rotation</b> matrix, or those rotation matrices described i...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} agroecosystems to provide food {{ultimately}} {{depends on the}} regulating and supporting ecosystem services that underpin their functioning, such as the regulation of soil quality, water quality, soil erosion, pests, and pollinators. However, there are trade-offs between provisioning and regulating or supporting services, whose nature at the farm and plot scales is poorly understood. We analyzed data at the farm level for two agroecosystems with contrasting objectives in central Mexico: one aimed at staple crop production for self-subsistence and local markets, the other directed to a cash crop for export markets. Bivariate and multivariate trade-offs were analyzed for different crop management strategies (conventional, organic, <b>traditional,</b> crop <b>rotation)</b> and their underpinning socioeconomic drivers. There was a clear trade-off between crop yield and soil quality in self-subsistence systems. However, other expected trade-offs between yields and soil quality did not always occur, likely because of the overall good soils {{of the region and}} the low to medium input profile of most farms. Trade-offs were highly dependent on farm-specific agricultural practices; organic, <b>traditional,</b> and <b>rotation</b> management systems generally showed smaller trade-offs between yield and soil quality, pest control, and biodiversity than did conventional management systems. Perceived drivers reported by farmers included increasing prices for cash crops, rising costs of inputs, and extreme climatic events (e. g., drought, hail, frost). Farmers did not identify the regulation of soil quality, water quality, soil erosion, pests, or pollinators as important constraints. Although acceptable yields could be maintained irrespective of key regulating and supporting services according to these perceptions, current levels of soil erosion and nutrient runoff are likely to have important negative effects at the watershed scale. Sustainability in both agroecosystems could be increased substantially by promoting alternative practices aimed at maintaining biodiversity, soil quality, and soil retention...|$|R
