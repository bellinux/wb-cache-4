50|$|The F89 {{featured}} a two-cylinder two-stroke engine of 684 cc with a stated output, at launch, of 23 bhp. A maximum speed of 100 km/h (62 mph) was claimed for the saloon (95 km/h / 59 mph for the 'Universal' estate). The engine was water-cooled, {{but there was}} no water pump. Cooling was by a convection-based <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>system.</b> The front wheels were connected to the engine by means of a three-speed manual gear box controlled via a dash-board mounted Krückstockschaltung lever similar to that familiar to later generations from its application in the Citroën 2CV and Renault 4. Towards the end of the production run a four-speed manual box was offered on the Meisterklasse.|$|E
5000|$|The T engine's {{cooling system}} {{reflected}} the T's simplicity design theme. The first few hundred Model Ts had a water pump, {{but it was}} eliminated early in production. Instead, Ford opted for a cheaper and more reliable thermosyphon system. Thermosyphon was a common engine-cooling method of the era. Hot water, being less dense, would {{rise to the top}} of the engine and up in{{to the top of the}} radiator, descending to the bottom as it cooled, and back into the engine. (This was the direction of water flow in most cars which did have water pumps, until the introduction of crossflow radiator designs.) The <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>system</b> was susceptible to overheating if worked heavily, but served well for most Model T usage.|$|E
50|$|Thermosiphons {{are used}} for watercooling {{internal}} computer components, most commonly the processor. While any suitable liquid can be used, water is the easiest liquid to use in <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>systems.</b> Unlike traditional watercooling <b>systems,</b> <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>systems</b> do not rely on a pump but on convection for the movement of heated water (which may become vapour) from the components upwards to a heat exchanger. There the water is cooled and {{is ready to be}} recirculated. The most commonly used heat exchanger is a radiator, where air is blown actively through a fan system to condense the vapour to a liquid. The liquid is recirculated through the system, thus repeating the process. No pump is required—the vaporization and condensation cycle is self-sustaining.|$|R

The novel trip received a great deal of publicity, as she had sought. The drive was a key event in the technical development of the automobile. The pioneering couple introduced several improvements after Bertha's experiences. She reported everything that had happened along the way and made important suggestions, such as the introduction of an additional gear for climbing hills and brake linings to improve brake-power. Her trip proved to the burgeoning automotive industry that test drives were essential to their business.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{performance}} of Flat plate Solar Water Heater deteriorates within five to {{twelve years of}} their installation due to factors related to manufacturing, operating conditions, lack of maintenance etc. Especially, problem due to scaling is significant as {{it is based on}} quality of water used. The remaining factors are system dependent and could be overcome by quality production. Software is developed by incorporating Hottel Whillier Bliss (H-W-B) equation to ascertain the effect of scaling on system efficiency in case of <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>system.</b> In case of clean <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>system,</b> the instantaneous efficiency calculated at 1000 W/m 2 radiation is 72 % and it drops to 46 % for 3. 7 mm scale thickness. The mass flow rate is reduced by 90 % for 3. 7 mm scale thickness. Whereas, the average temperature drop of water in the tank is not critical due to considerable heat content in water under severe scaled condition. But practically in case of major scale growth, some of the risers are likely to get blocked completely which leads to negligible temperature rise in the tank.

To determine if this goal is attainable and prioritize R&D for cold-climate SDWH, life-cycle analyses were done with hypothetical lower-cost components in glycol, drainback, and <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>systems.</b> Balance-of-system (BOS, everything but the collector) measures included replacing metal components with polymeric versions and system simplification. With all BOS measures in place, Csav could be reduced more than 50 % with a low-cost, selectively-coated, glazed polymeric collector, and slightly less than 50 % with either a conventional selective metal-glass or a non-selective glazed polymer collector.

40|$|This chapter compares and {{contrasts}} {{the system}} performance of two widely used {{solar thermal systems}} using testing and simulation programs. Solar thermal systems are used in many countries for heating domestically used water.

"Low-flow systems" achieve higher system performance than standard "high-flow systems. " To compare system performance, objective criteria must be defined. The preferred criteria are the fractional solar savings that represent the solar gain compared to a non-solar reference system. Simulation programs with different levels of sophistication are used to estimate the yearly solar gain of a particular system.

50|$|The {{figures are}} fairly similar between the above collectors, {{yielding}} some 4 kWh/day in a temperate climate and some 8 kWh/day in a tropical climate when using a collector with a 2 m2 absorber. In the temperate scenario this {{is sufficient to}} heat 200 litres of water by some 17 °C. In the tropical scenario the equivalent heating would be by some 33 °C. Many <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>systems</b> have comparable energy output to equivalent active systems. The efficiency of evacuated tube collectors is somewhat lower than for flat plate collectors because the absorbers are narrower than the tubes and the tubes have space between them, resulting in a significantly larger percentage of inactive overall collector area. Some methods of comparison calculate the efficiency of evacuated tube collectors based on the actual absorber area {{and not on the}} 'space occupied as has been done in the above table. Efficiency is reduced at higher temperatures.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a dual-function solar collector (DFSC) that can work as either water heater or air heater depending on seasonal requirement is investigated via both experimental and numerical approaches in this paper. The numerical results are well consistent with the experimental results. Daily efficiency of the <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>system</b> with DFSC is more than 55 % in water heating mode and the instantaneous air heating efficiency of the collector reaches 60 %. The effects of inner parameters on the thermal efficiency of the collector are analyzed by numerical simulations of the operation of DFSC in two working modes. It is found that {{the depths of the}} two air channels in DFSC have an optimal range suitable for both working modes.

40|$|The {{efficient}} cooling of servers in {{data center}} offers a unique challenge {{to reduce the}} worldwide energy consumption and liquid inventory of working fluid. Presently, single phase cooling techniques are widely used for CPU cooling in data centers. Such techniques are proving to be inefficient, as the heat flux generated in CPU cores is very high, limiting the clock speed of the processors. Also, single phase coolers require external pumping power adding cost to the system. The great potential of a <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>system</b> as a replacement of currently used cooling techniques is studied in the presented work. A thermosiphon loop using two-phase heat and mass transfer process uses latent heat of the working fluid. The latent heat is much more efficient than sensible heat improving the heat dissipation ability of the system. The <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>system</b> is a gravity driven loop thus reducing the power consumption {{and the cost of}} the system. However, the system performance is limited by Critical Heat Flux (CHF) and Heat Transfer Coefficients (HTC). An increase in CHF offers wide temperature operating range while the HTC defines the efficiency of the process. In the proposed design of the cooling solution, a manifold with a taper is employed over the heater surface to guide vapor away from the surface along the flow length. The incoming liquid flows over the heating surface unobstructed developing separate liquid-vapor pathways. Two taper angles, 3. 4 ᵒ and 6 ᵒ in the manifold are tested for the benchtop configuration of the thermosiphon loop. A heat transfer coefficient of 27. 3 kW/m 2 ᵒC and 33. 4 kW/m 2 ᵒC was achieved for 3. 4 ᵒ and 6 ᵒ taper angles respectively. The heat transfer performance was analyzed with HFE 7000 as the working fluid. The performance of the benchtop thermosiphon loop was evaluated for three liquid fill volumes resulting in three different liquid heads available in the thermosiphon loop. Based on the benchtop thermosiphon loop performance a new cooler was designed and built for CPU cooling in RIT’s data center. The performance of the new thermosiphon loop used in CPU cooling was compared with the air and water based coolers currently used in the data center. The maximum CPU temperature achieved for thermosiphon loop was 84. 4 ᵒC under the stress test. The maximum CPU temperatures for air based and water based coolers were 82. 6 ᵒC and 63. 4 ᵒC respectively under the stress test...|$|E

To achieve this, two commercial CFD software packages using an identical CFD mesh were first assessed against an experimental heat transfer test of the CNS. It was found that both numerical models were valid within the bounds of experimental uncertainty. After this, one CFD model was used to simulate the thermosiphon transient condition after the reactor is shut down. Two independent shutdown conditions of different decay-heat power profiles were simulated.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of custom ultrasonic instrumentation {{was motivated by}} the need for continuous real-time monitoring of possible leaks and mass flow measurement in the evaporative cooling systems of the ATLAS silicon trackers. The instruments use pairs of ultrasonic transducers transmitting sound bursts and measuring transit times in opposite directions. The gas flow rate is calculated from the difference in transit times, while the sound velocity is deduced from their average. The gas composition is then evaluated by comparison with a molar composition vs. sound velocity database, based on the direct dependence between sound velocity and component molar concentration in a gas mixture at a known temperature and pressure. The instrumentation has been developed in several geometries, with five instruments now integrated and in continuous operation within the ATLAS Detector Control System (DCS) and its finite state machine. One instrument monitors C(3) F(8) coolant leaks into the Pixel detector N(2) envelope with a molar resolution better than 2 ⋅  10 (−) (5), and has indicated a level of 0. 14 % when all the cooling loops of the recently re-installed Pixel detector are operational.

40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that the thermal {{utilization}} of solar energy is often - in spite of high possible energy savings - economically unattractive. The aim of this project therefore was the development of systems for use in equatorial regions, where aspects like a simple construction and inexpensive materials are of primary importance. Thermal losses from the aperture area should be minimized with new transparent insulation materials. Within the project different collector systems for domestic hot water were investigated as well as two solar cookers. Experiments were carried out with five prototypes of a so-called plastic bag collector. This essentially concerns a transparent plastic bag acting as a water storage (150 l) which lies on top of a horizontal, insulated absorber. The influence of different transparent cover foils on the systems' efficiency could be shown by determining the values of Eta (0. 47 - 0. 60) and the overall U-values (6. 0 - 7. 2 W / (qm K) for usual foils, 2. 2 W / (qm K) for transparent insulation). Comparative measurements with <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>systems</b> were included. With the emphasis on a high storage (heat) capacity together with a low overall U-value, a new concept of a solar cooker was developed and tested under the Freiburg weather conditions. The cooker consists of a massive storage with a transparently insulated, horizontal absorber. The choice of the materials to be used for the storage (sand, concrete) and for the opaque insulation (straw, coco fibres) depends on their actual local availability. The measured storage temperatures of two proto-types were between 100 and 110 degree C with a mean insolation of 6. 6 kWh/square meter and a mean ambient temperature of 21 degree C.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive study into the passive thermal management of high-voltage power electronics converters {{for use in}} augmented grid assets capable of performing power routing on the electricity grid. The work {{has focused on the}} thermal transport of single-phase closed <b>thermosiphon</b> <b>systems</b> incorporating a secondary parallel flow path for cooling an additional, typically smaller, thermal load associated with the power electronics converters. Dual-loop thermosiphon passive thermal management systems were incorporated into a grounded compact dynamic phase angle regulator (GCD-PAR) that aimed to facilitate power routing and reduce line losses on the power grid. The power router utilizes power electronics that reject heat to a planar area, or cold plate, which must be cooled by an entirely passive system to comply with the minimum 30 year mean time between failures (MTBF) consistent with grid reliability requirements. This design includes a secondary-loop cooling path that utilizes the cooling oil already present in the transformer to also cool the power router. An analytical multi-physics thermosiphon model is developed that couples existing fluid dynamic and heat transfer correlations to create a description of the steady state operation of a specific cylindrical 50 kVA transformer augmented with a thermosiphon.

The condenser consists {{of a set of}} roll-bonded vertically mounted fins among which air flows by either natural or forced convection. In order to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms that determine the performance of the condenser and to facilitate the further optimization of its industrial design, a multiscale approach is developed to reduce as much as possible the complexity of the simulation code while maintaining reasonable predictive accuracy. To this end, heat diffusion in the fins and its convective transport in air are modeled as 2 D processes while the flow of the two-phase coolant within the fins is modeled as a 1 D network of pipes. For the numerical solution of the resulting equations, a Dual Mixed-Finite Volume scheme with Exponential Fitting stabilization is used for 2 D heat diffusion and convection while a Primal Mixed Finite Element discretization method with upwind stabilization is used for the 1 D coolant flow.

40|$|A {{solar pond}} {{is a simple}} and {{low-cost}} solar collector with long-term thermal storage. It utilizes {{a large body of}} salinity gradient water to absorb radiation from the sun and stores it in the form of heat {{at the bottom of the}} pond with temperature between 70 - 90 oC. The pond consists of three different layers. The cold thin upper layer is known as the upper convective zone (UCZ) and consists of low salinity water and has temperature close to the local average ambient temperature. The second layer is the gradient layer known as the non-convective zone (NCZ), where salinity increases from the top of the NCZ to the bottom of the NCZ. The bottom layer or lower convective zone (LCZ) has homogenous high salinity water which absorbs and stores solar thermal energy which reaches the bottom of the pond. Conventionally, heat has been successfully extracted from the LCZ. This study concerns an attempt to extract the absorbed heat from the NCZ using external heat exchangers with the aim of enhancing the overall efficiency of the solar pond. External heat exchangers were fabricated and installed to extract heat from different levels in the NCZ. The process used a 12 V pump to withdraw hot brine from the NCZ and re-inject it to the same level. Cold brine from the UCZ was used as a cold heat transfer fluid to extract heat from each of the heat exchangers. The results show that by extracting heat from the NCZ, the thermal efficiency of a solar pond could potentially be improved to 50 % as compared with the conventional heat extraction method from the LCZ only. An adverse effect associated with active heat extraction from the NCZ was the development of instability in the salinity gradient layer. Optimisation of the technique for withdrawal and re-injection of the cooled brine into the NCZ is essential to overcome this issue. It needs to be addressed as a future study. The other part of the present study was the investigation of a semi-passive <b>thermosiphon</b> heat extraction <b>system</b> for heat removal from the NCZ or LCZ of a solar pond. The <b>thermosiphon</b> heat extraction <b>system</b> relies on buoyancy effects to remove heat by the effect of temperature difference. Theoretical governing equations have been developed based on principles of conservation of energy and mass. Theoretical analysis revealed great potential for this system to be implemented in solar ponds. Experimental results from a single <b>thermosiphon</b> heat extraction <b>system</b> have been presented for various cooling water mass flow rates. The experimental and theoretical performance estimates were compared and the results showed a good agreement. The experimental findings showed that a thermosiphon heat exchanger has the potential to minimize the use of pumps in heat extraction from solar ponds...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 A bench-scale <b>thermosiphon</b> {{reboiler}} <b>system</b> {{was constructed}} end used {{to investigate the}} scaling behavior of aqueous calcium sulfate under flow boiling conditions. Scaling data were collected at constant heat flux from eight experimental runs. Five different constant heat fluxes were used ranging from 45000 to 93000 Btu/hr. ft², in increments of approximately 12000 Btu/hr-ft². Scaling behavior was quantified by combining measured temperature and heat flux data to obtain corresponding local fouling factors. Fouling factors reflect changes in the overall heat transfer coefficient, and are proportional {{to the amount of}} accumulated scale. Plotting the fouling factors versus time showed that a typical plot was composed of three fouling periods. During an initial delay period the fouling factor remained constant, or increased relatively slowly. Following this period, the fouling factor increased much more rapidly, and did so linearly. During the final period, the fouling factor increased at a declining rate. During some experiments, portions of scale flaked off the heat transfer surface, causing discontinuities in the fouling curves. Delay periods following these flaking incidents were not generally observed. Though characterized by a consistent behavior pattern, the fouling data were not reproducible. To improve reproducibility in future studies, equipment and procedure modifications are suggested. Despite the scatter in the present data, {{there appears to be a}} relationship between heat flux and initial delay period...|$|R
40|$|To achieve {{at least}} 50 % {{reduction}} in cost of savings for residential {{solar water heaters}} (SWHs), polymer materials and manufacturing are being used, which also enable system redesign for parts reduction and easier installation. Two teams are bringing new low-cost systems to the market in FY 2007. Technical support at NREL for modeling and testing provided new models and test procedures for rating innovative integral-collector-storage (ICS) and <b>thermosiphon</b> (TS) <b>systems.</b> The pipe-freeze problem has been satisfactorily solved, enabling cold-climate TS systems. System analyses are under way for multi-function solar systems that affordably supply 100 % of water heating, space heating, and space cooling, potentially enabling cost-neutral zero energy homes. 1. Objectives The low-cost SWH task in the Solar Heating and Lighting Subprogram has the objective to reduce the levelized cost of saved energy (LCOE) from SWH by at least 50 %. 1 As in Ref. 1, research started with low-cost passive systems suitable for mild climates in FY 1999, with the focus changing in FY 2007 to cold climate SWH and multi-function systems doing water heating, space heating, and space cooling (consistent with change in FY 2007 program objective to support zero energy homes [ZEH]). The objectives for NREL support of the low-cost SWH task are to: • Contract management and technical guidance to industry teams. • Technical support to industry development teams, including modeling and testing. • Analyses supporting the FY 2007 shift in program objectives to develop cost-effective therma...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{hot water}} (SHW) {{systems have been}} {{installed}} commercially for over 30 years, yet few quantitative details are known about their reliability. This report describes a comprehensive analysis {{of all of the}} known major previous research and data regarding the reliability of SHW systems and components. Some important conclusions emerged. First, based on a detailed inspection of ten-year-old systems in Florida, about half of active systems can be expected to fail within a ten-year period. Second, valves were identified as the probable cause of a majority of active SHW failures. Third, passive integral and <b>thermosiphon</b> SHW <b>systems</b> have much lower failure rates than active ones, probably due to their simple design that employs few mechanical parts. Fourth, it is probable that the existing data about reliability do not reveal the full extent of fielded system failures because most of the data were based on trouble calls. Often an SHW system owner is not aware of a failure because the backup system silently continues to produce hot water. Thus, a repair event may not be generated in a timely manner, if at all. This final report for the project provides all of the pertinent details about this study, including the source of the data, the techniques to assure their quality before analysis, the organization of the data into perhaps the most comprehensive reliability database in existence, a detailed statistical analysis, and a list of recommendations for additional critical work. Important recommendations include the inclusion of an alarm on SHW systems to identify a failed system, the need for a scientifically designed study to collect high-quality reliability data that will lead to design improvements and lower costs, and accelerated testing of components that are identified as highly problematic...|$|R
