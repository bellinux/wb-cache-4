5000|$|Jesse Schedeen of IGN {{gave the}} episode a mixed review with his verdict stating [...] "Arrow faces a long, uphill battle {{this year as}} it tries to move forward from the {{incredibly}} disappointing Season 4 finale.

There was certainly plenty to enjoy <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>from</b> the stylish fight scenes to the dramatic performances from Stephen Amell and Paul Blackthorne.

Moreover, the people behind the group, Migrationwatch UK, were denounced as closet racists for even raising the subject.

A few weeks ago he visited me....He is a remarkable man. His influence at Cambridge on the best young men was very fine. His talents are of a high order....Is he insane? If so, there yet linger glimpses of wisdom in his memory. He is insane with God — diswitted in the contemplation of the holiness of Divinity. He distrusts intellect... Living, not thinking, he regards as the worship meet for the soul. This is mysticism in its highest form.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Schiff, {{president}} of Euro Pacific Capital, argued {{that if the}} bonds in the Bear Stearns funds were auctioned on the open market, much weaker values would be plainly revealed.

5000|$|Matt Fowler of IGN heavily {{praised the}} episode, {{awarding}} it 9.3/10, an [...] "amazing" [...] score. He especially praised the episode's final act, stating [...] "And just {{the spectacle of}} Dany climbing on top of Drogon, with care, and then soaring up and off into the sky was remarkable. It's funny that a huge moment for her as a Targaryen and the possible future leader of Westeros came right during {{one of her most}} bloody and spectacular failures as a Queen." [...] He summarized his review by saying [...] "GoT delivered another exciting (and unsettling) episode as Stannis made a big decision & Daenerys attended a tournament" [...] and labelled Stannis' decision a strong point of the episode. Charlotte Runcie of The Daily Telegraph also reviewed the episode favorably: [...] "Hurling Hollywood-level budgets behind a multi-season TV show paid rich rewards <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>from</b> the enormous Gladiator-style sweep of the crowded coliseum arena to thrillingly choreographed fights to the death before a huge, baying audience." [...] Runcie was also impressed with the Shireen sacrifice scene, calling it [...] "one of the most upsetting scenes" [...] in season 5.|$|E

50|$|Mrs. Hale, I would {{inform you}} that I am in good Health as I hope these lines will find you and all our {{children}} & all friends. We are in building forts and entrenchments {{as fast as we}} can on all the Large hills that are convenient near Bofton & Charlestowne in order to defend the Country as well as well as possible. We expect the Regulars out every day, but how soon we cannot tell. But we are ready for to give them battle if they come today. We have two Generals come <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>from</b> Virginia to take Command of our army (vis) General Washington Commander in Chief of our army & General Lee the third in command General Ward is the second in command. He was commander before Washington came. We think Washington & Lee are very able Generals indeed and think the army will be regulated very soon. I am very much Confined at present so that I can't hardly leave the army one minute. But am very well contented knowing that the Whole Salvation of our country under God depends on our industry and being faithful. Our men seem to be very anxious to go home; many of them to see their friends. But it is for want of consideration as it is a great damage to have our men dispersed over the country. But General Washington hath forbid any furloughs to be given at present. I Should be glad to come home if the circumstances of our army would admit, but at present it will not. It is insane for any one to pretend to go to defend their country and to be absent when most wanted. I am determined to make myself contented if I have to stay six months; as long as there is the least probability of gaining the victory. I think it is much better for to be confined a little while here, than for the whole country to be involved in utter ruin. The Regulars have had sum recruits come in lately. According to the best intelligence we can get from Bofton we killed in the Battle at Charlestowne of the Regular.|$|E
