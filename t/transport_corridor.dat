5|$|The Scottish Parliament {{voted to}} scrap tolls {{on the bridge}} from February 2008. The bridge was {{nearing the end of}} its life in the 2010s, and a {{parallel}} replacement was built. On 5September 2017 the bridge carried its final private cars, as the vast majority of traffic was transferred to the new Queensferry Crossing. Following a few weeks closure for repairs, the new role of the Forth Road Bridge will be as a public <b>transport</b> <b>corridor,</b> open only to buses, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians. At its peak, the Forth Road Bridge carried 65,000 vehicles per day (vpd), which is now expected to drop to only a few hundred following the opening of the Queensferry Crossing.|$|E

40|$|After half {{a century}} of {{corridor}} development in Europe, the corridor concept is well-established in the academic discourse on transportation. <b>Transport</b> <b>corridors</b> have also been common practice in European transport policy since the creation of a borderless Europe in the 1990 s. What is largely lacking in present-day research on European <b>transport</b> <b>corridors</b> is a consideration of a sectortranscendent and comprehensive spatial approach. We argue that adopting such an approach is beneficial to a valued analysis of European <b>transport</b> <b>corridors,</b> especially in the light of EU cohesion policy, agglomeration effects and place-based development. Also, negative external effects of persisting bottlenecks on welfare and quality of life in <b>transport</b> <b>corridors</b> should be better assessed and contextualised. This paper therefore suggests that policy can and should capitalise more on spatiality in corridors...|$|R

5|$|North West Coastal Highway {{was created}} in 1944 from {{existing}} roads and tracks through remote pastoral areas. However, it was a hazardous route that could be dusty in the dry season, and boggy or washed away in the wet season. Economic growth and development in northern Western Australia prompted initial improvement efforts in the late 1940s, and a sealed road was constructed from Geraldton to Carnarvon by 1962. The impact of cyclones and seasonal flooding resulted in a realignment inland of the Carnarvon to Port Hedland section, which was constructed and sealed between 1966 and 1973, and required thirty new bridges. Various upgrades {{have been carried out}} in sections across the length of the highway, including the Geraldton Southern <b>Transport</b> <b>Corridor</b> project which grade-separated the highway's junction with Brand Highway.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan's rapid {{economic}} growth during {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century led to saturation of highways, conventional rail, and air traffic systems in the western <b>transport</b> <b>corridor,</b> which threatened to impede further growth. The idea of a new high-speed rail line arose in the 1970s, and informal planning began in 1980. In 1987 the executive branch of Taiwan's government, the Executive Yuan, instructed the Ministry of Transportation to launch a feasibility study for a high-speed rail line in the western Taiwan corridor, which was completed in 1990. The study found that in a comparison of potential solutions to traffic problems in the corridor, a high-speed rail line would offer the highest transit volume, lowest land use, highest energy savings, and least pollution. In July 1990 the Preparation Office of High Speed Rail (POHSR) was established and a route was selected in 1991. Plans for the THSR were subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan in June 1992 and by Taiwan's legislature, the Legislative Yuan, in 1993.|$|E
