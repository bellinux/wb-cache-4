5|$|Shin Megami Tensei is a post-apocalyptic {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Atlus. Originally released for the Super Famicom in 1992 in Japan, it has been ported to multiple systems and eventually released in the West for iOS in 2014. It is the third game in the Megami Tensei series and {{the first in the}} central Shin Megami Tensei series. The gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies by <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} busy {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone {{that can be}} used to tap into localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys Rod and Todd into believing that God is <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The war, lasting under a fortnight, {{saw more}} than 90,000 Pakistani {{soldiers}} taken as {{prisoners of war}} (POWs), and it ended with the unconditional surrender of Pakistan's eastern half, resulting in the birth of Bangladesh as a new nation. Apart from the POWs, Pakistan lost six thousand men, while India lost two thousand. After the war, Manekshaw {{was known for his}} compassion towards the POWs. Singh recounts that in some cases he addressed POWs personally, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> privately with just his aide-de-camp in his company while they shared a cup of tea. He ensured that POWs were well treated by the Indian Army, making provisions for them to be supplied with the copies of the Quran, and allowing them to celebrate festivals, and to receive letters and parcels from their loved ones.|$|E

During that tour, the band met punk icon Richard Hell {{and opened a}} concert for him. Rollins later {{published}} his diaries from that tour in his book Get in the Van. As the front man, Rollins was a frequent target of violent audience members, and became known for fist-fights with audience members. Rollins developed a distinct showmanship on stage, where he could entertain an audience just by <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker by <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he {{knew where they were}} going to put their penalty in order to get in their heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who suffer}} from social anxiety {{disorder}} fear being judged by others in society. In particular, individuals with social anxiety are nervous {{in the presence of}} people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations. People {{who suffer from}} this disorder may behave a certain way or say something and then feel embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel uncomfortable meeting people they do not know, and act distant when they are with large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this disorder by avoiding eye contact, or blushing when someone is <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the {{ingredients}} are fictional, mixing them together creates nonfictional cocktails as well, {{such as the}} Piledriver or Blue Fairy. To add additional variety, patrons at the bar may ask for single, multiple, or one large drink; these drinks can be served either aged or with ice. Players must also pay attention to infer what patrons actually want, which may be {{different from what they}} order. For example, a character might be feeling depressed and ask for a sweet drink, though the player instead giving them a shot of alcohol to help them forget their troubles would have a better effect. Alternately, the player may {{be able to make a}} character happy by <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> instead of letting them feed on their alcoholism. At various points, the player can also tweak the customer's drink, such as adding Karmotrine to a cocktail that was previously non-alcoholic. In these ways, the player creates new scenarios as they advance in the game.|$|E
25|$|In Arab culture, {{showing the}} sole of one's shoe is {{considered}} an insult, and to throw a shoe and hit someone with it is considered an even greater insult. Shoes {{are considered to be}} dirty as they frequently touch the ground, and are associated with the lowest part of the body— the foot. As such, shoes are forbidden in mosques, and it is also considered unmannerly to cross the legs and display the soles of one's shoes to someone when <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> This insult was demonstrated in Iraq, first when Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled in 2003, Iraqis gathered around it and struck the statue with their shoes. Secondly, in 2008, United States President George W. Bush had a shoe thrown at him by a journalist as a statement against the war that was brought to Iraq and the lives that it has cost. More generally, shoe-throwing or shoeing, showing {{the sole of}} one's shoe or using shoes to insult are forms of protest {{in many parts of the}} world. Incidents where shoes were thrown at political figures have taken place in Australia, India, Ireland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and most notably the Arab world.|$|E

500|$|The {{multiplayer}} {{component of}} Journey {{was designed to}} facilitate cooperation between players without forcing it, and without allowing competition.

The plan was [...] "to create a game where people felt they are connected with each other, to show {{the positive side of}} humanity in them".

Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature.
