5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens <b>to</b> <b>criticize</b> their government.

Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
