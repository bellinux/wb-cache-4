5|$|A <b>terracotta</b> Nandi (the bull {{of the god}} Shiva – {{father of}} Murugan), head of a woman, <b>terracotta</b> lamps, {{potsherds}} and a shivalinga (aniconic symbol of Shiva) made of green stone {{are some of the}} important artefacts found at the site. The Nandi is the first one made of <b>terracotta</b> to be found. While most of the items unearthed belong to the Sangam period, artefacts of a later period including a Chola copper coin have also been found.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 2nd century in North Africa, a {{distinctive}} type of nozzle tube shape was developed in the tradition of the <b>terracotta</b> tube dome at the Hellenistic era baths of Morgantina, an idea that had been preserved in the use of interlocking <b>terracotta</b> pots for kiln roofs. This tube could be mass-produced on potter's wheels and interlocked to form a permanent centering for concrete domes, avoiding the use of wooden centering altogether. This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean.|$|E

40|$|Ancient Italic <b>terracottas</b> {{were painted}} {{before or after}} firing {{depending}} on their function, as suggested by previous analyses. However, concerning the votive <b>terracottas,</b> there {{seems to have been}} no anlayses carried out, suggesting either a fired or non fired paint. Methods and problems associated with an ongoing research on some votive <b>terracottas</b> from Tessennano in Southern Etruria are considered. A few preliminary results are considered as well...|$|R
40|$|Thin-section {{analysis}} of votive <b>terracottas</b> from the Etruscan sites Tessennano, Vulci, Tuscania and Tarquinia {{were made in}} order to help explaining the manufacturing process of votiv <b>terracottas,</b> with a focus on coice of raw material (clay and temper). The investigation of the material from these four sites has offered an opportunity to study Etruscan handicraft. The study has shown that e. g. that the votive heads from Tessennano have parallells in their raw material in <b>terracottas</b> found in all the other three sites...|$|R

5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{survival of}} the figure type, though interpretations and cult context shifted over the intervening centuries, is expressed by the cast <b>terracotta</b> funerary figure of the 1st century BCE, from Myrina {{on the coast of}} Mysia in Asia Minor, where it was excavated by the French School at Athens, 1883; the <b>terracotta</b> is conserved in the Musée du Louvre (illustrated left).|$|E
