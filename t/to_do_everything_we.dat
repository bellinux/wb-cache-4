Much is spoken about the influence of the brand and why it is important, but little is known about decisions related to developing a brand, especially for firms that have limited resources such as resort tourism operators.

Therefore, <b>we</b> explore how firms assess the critical elements of their brand by using an integrated approach.

40|$|The incentives-for-authors {{formulation}} of copyright’s purpose is so deeply ingrained in our discourse and our thought processes {{that it is}} astonishingly hard to avoid invoking, even when one is consciously trying not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Yet avoiding that formulation is exactly what <b>we</b> ought <b>to</b> be <b>doing.</b> <b>Everything</b> <b>we</b> know about creativity and creative processes suggests that copyright plays very little role in motivating creative work. In the contemporary information society, the purpose of copyright is to enable the provision of capital and organization so that creative work may be exploited. And the choice of copyright as a principal means of promoting cultural production has consequences for the content of culture as well. This reframing has four important consequences for debates about copyright law and policy. First, abandoning the incentives-for-authors story requires {{us to talk about}} cultural progress differently. The incentives-for-authors story has functioned as a smokescreen, enabling scholars, judges, and legislators to conflate economic and creative motivation. Severing the motivational link between creativity and economics requires us {{to come up with a}} better understanding of how cultural progress emerges, and a more accurate account of how the economic incentives that copyright provides affect progress more generally. Second, an account of copyright as incentives-for-capital suggests a different approach to conceptualizing the kind of “property” that copyright represents. Copyright scholars habitually compare copyright to property in land, a conceptual move that passes over an important stage in the evolution of economic activity and associated economic rights. There are important benefits to be gained from comparing post-industrial, information property to industrial, corporate property, and copyright law more explicitly to corporate law. Specifically, copyright law in the post-industrial era works to separate authorship from control of creative works so that a set of coordination and governance problems closely associated with information resources can be solved. Third, comparing copyright more explicitly to industrial, corporate property and legal regimes governing its use suggests some different ways of thinking and talking about problems of social welfare that so often bedevil regimes of property law. Fourth, comparing copyright more explicitly to industrial, corporate property foregrounds copyright law’s (largely unrealized) potential to function as a tool for ensuring accountability to the authors without whom the copyright system could not function...|$|R

Either extreme along the Time Management skill continuum can be problematic. On one hand, perfect Time Management skill do not make one a perfect student or employee. It is possible to excess time, such that one is so wrapped up in the minutiae that meaningful tasks are not accomplished. On the other hand, poor Time Management skill do not make one a stooge. Some brilliant peoples habitually are ‘a day late and a dollar short’. The main reason for managing time is just provide structure to one’s life and in turn, peace of mind. Managing time is just something one does for one’s own psyche, to make one’s days easier. It is important for a student to have effective strategies to manage his time to balance the conflicting demands of time for the study.

40|$|Government approves the {{publication}} of the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017 Minister for Health Simon Harris and Minister of State for Communities and the National Drugs Strategy, Catherine Byrne today (Tuesday) welcomed the Government’s decision to approve {{the publication}} of the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017. The Bill, which was approved by Cabinet at its meeting this morning, will allow the Minister for Health to issue a licence, with conditions, to operate a supervised injecting facility. This is a controlled environment where drug users may self-administer, by injection, drugs they have brought with them. Such facilities will provide access to clean, sterile injecting equipment and have trained staff on hand to provide emergency care {{in the event of an}} overdose, as well as advice on treatment and rehabilitation. They will also help alleviate the problems associated with injecting on the street, including drug-related litter. Minister Harris said that he is, “delighted to be bringing forward this important legislation that adopts a health-led approach to drugs-use by those in our society who have been marginalised as a result of their addictions. ” The provisions of the Bill would also: •Exempt authorised users from the offence of possession when in the facility, and with the permission of the licence holder; •It would provide an exemption for licensed providers whereby it is currently an offence to permit the preparation or possession of a controlled substance in premises; •It would enable the Minister to consult with the HSE, An Garda Síochána, or others on matters relating to a supervised injecting facility, and enable the Minister to make regulations relating to the operation of such facilities. It is important to note that possession of controlled drugs will continue to be an offence outside a supervised injecting facility. Possession for sale or supply will remain an offence both inside and outside a supervised injecting facility. Minister of State for Communities and the National Drugs Strategy, Catherine Byrne, who attended Cabinet today alongside Minister Harris, afterwards said that the facilities – the first of which will be run on a pilot basis – will be a safe harbour for chronic drug users. “They will provide a controlled place for people to inject, but will be much more than that – a place to rest, have a chat and access the services people need. I believe in a health-led and person-centred approach to the drug problem. For me this is all about people and looking after the most vulnerable and marginalised in our society. The human cost of public injecting is clear and keeps adding up – the lack of dignity, the effect it has on people’s health, wellbeing and safety. We know that these facilities are not the sole solution to the drugs problem and many other steps are needed, but I am committed <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> can <b>to</b> help those who need it most. ” The Bill does not establish a location for a supervised injecting facility, but a pilot facility is planned for Dublin city centre. The HSE have established a working group to gather data, consider possible options and to undertake consultation before any decision is made. Minister Harris added, “I know people have concerns about where this first pilot facility will be located, but I want to assure you that no decisions have been made. The HSE will be undertaking a process of consultation, including with local stakeholders and communities. Any decision on the location of the pilot facility will be informed by the outcome of this consultation process. ” ENDS Notes for Editors – about supervised injecting facilities •There is a recognised problem with street injecting in Ireland, particularly in Dublin city centre. This practice poses a significant health risk for the drug users and results in discarded needles which present a public health risk to others. •The establishment of supervised injecting facilities is proposed to help deal with these problems and the Programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate for them. •They are particularly effective in reaching out to chaotic drug users and marginalised groups, especially those who use drugs on the streets, or in other risky and unhygienic conditions. •Drug consumption rooms have been operating in Europe for 30 years, with the first drug consumption room opening in Switzerland in 1986. In October 2016 the first supervised injecting facility in France was opened in a suburb of Paris. •There are now almost 90 drug consumption rooms operating around the world. Evidence from these sites demonstrates: ◦ A reduction in fatal overdoses and transmission of blood borne diseases; ◦ A decrease in the incidence of public injecting; ◦ Significant reductions in drug related litter, and ◦ No increase in the use of drugs or of drug-related crime. •International evaluation studies have found an overall positive impact on the communities where these facilities are located. •These facilities provide a low threshold, point of contact for people who inject drugs enabling them to access health, support and drug treatment services, when they are ready <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.
