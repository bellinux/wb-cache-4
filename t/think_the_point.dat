6000|$|This sonnet Cyril {{declared}} {{would be}} quite unintelligible if we fancied that it was addressed to either the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of Southampton, {{both of whom were}} men of the highest position in England and fully entitled to be called [...] "great princes"; and he in corroboration of his view read me Sonnets CXXIV. and CXXV., in which Shakespeare tells us that his love is not [...] "the child of state," [...] that it [...] "suffers not in smiling pomp," [...] but is [...] "builded far from accident." [...] I listened with a good deal of interest, for I don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> had ever been made before; but what followed was still more curious, and seemed to me at the time to dispose entirely of Pembroke's claim. We know from Meres that the Sonnets had been written before 1598, and Sonnet CIV. informs us that Shakespeare's friendship for Mr. W. H. had been already in existence for three years. Now Lord Pembroke, who was born in 1580, did not come to London till he was eighteen years of age, that is to say till 1598, and Shakespeare's acquaintance with Mr. W. H. must have begun in 1594, or at the latest in 1595. Shakespeare, accordingly, could not have known Lord Pembroke till after the Sonnets had been written.|$|E

[...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of a good song is that to different people, it strikes a chord for whatever reason, and I can only be responsible for half of it," [...] said DeLonge.

In the Netherlands the government has ordered a wholesale restructuring as well as deep budget reductions. It’s a moment for <b>the</b> NPO to <b>think</b> again about what it is for. These are some notes from my talk to a symposium in Hilversum for Dutch public service media executives. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> I make about trying to turn threats into opportunities will apply to most public service media. [See the slides for this talk here...|$|R

5000|$|The speech stirred some controversy, {{with some}} {{reacting}} favorably to Holder's comments and others sharply criticizing them. Obama later clarified Holder's comments, saying that [...] "I think it's {{fair to say}} that if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language.... I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that he was making is that we're oftentimes uncomfortable with talking about race until there's some sort of racial flare-up or conflict, and that we could probably be more constructive in facing up to the painful legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination." ...|$|E

Just as you’re on the point of settling down with someone, you do have a bit of a panic It can be scary to commit to someone and shut off all your other options. I’m sure that many people have a last minute panic, get cold feet and do something rash, only later to regret it. I don’t think the character of David is a bad person, but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is that he didn’t really know what he wanted." ...|$|E

"I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> I {{made was}} that while I would prefer {{there to be}} a {{parliamentary}} framework for the RU486, I think it was, debate, if the actual issue was before Parliament I would probably vote for the distribution of the pill. People often say, oh no Steve's a conservative Catholic, but they won't ever find on my voting record something that backs that up. I voted against the Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation. I voted for some of the cloning debate. So I voted in, I like to consider the issues on their merits and I voted what some would characterise as conservatively and some would characterise as progressively on a number of issues." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although {{prostitution}} {{is widespread}} in Bolivia, the prostitutes are severely stigmatized by society, they are blamed {{for everything from}} broken homes to the rising HIV-infection rate. In 2007, in El Alto, hundreds of prostitutes were attacked, forced to strip and beaten by angry locals; several brothels were burnt. Citizens demanded that brothels and bars be located at least 3,200 feet away from schools. The municipal government responded by closing all brothels within 1,600 feet of schools, but took no action against those who had attacked the prostitutes. [...] "We are Bolivia's unloved," [...] said Yuly Perez, vice-president of ONAEM, the Bolivian sex workers' union, [...] "If we don't work, who's going to feed our kids?" [...] Another representative from the sex worker organization said that: [...] "People <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of our organization is to expand prostitution in Bolivia. In fact, we want the opposite. Our ideal world is one free of the economic desperation that forces women into this business." ...|$|E
40|$|I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of this {{exercise}} in counterfactual thinking is two-fold first, {{to recognize that}} not only have choices {{been made in the}} past that defined the character of what has happened and that different choices were possible and would have led to different outcomes, and, second, that we are currently making similar choices for the future. Today s choices obviously will have significant long-term consequences for space development. Decision-makers have an image of a desirable future when they make choices, but they also realize that the link between current choice and desired result is always uncertain. As the philosopher Yogi Berra is often quoted as having said, "making predictions is hard, especially when they are about the future. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{iconography}} of ancient art {{has to do}} with making propositions about what that art depicts. Stylistic studies, in contrast, make propositions about the sharedness of formal properties with other objects. These can be done separately. Although many iconographic analyses of ancient art proceed with little or no consideration of style, I argue that the two modes of analysis are interdependent. I offer a methodological case that stylistic analysis is logically prior to iconography study in the domain of ancient art. This observation argues for a distinctively staged approach to the {{iconography of}} ancient objects, one in which detailed stylistic study is a necessary prerequisite to success in determining the referents of representations. In this chapter, I wish to make what is really a fairly simple methodological point concerning the relationship between the iconography of ancient art and the study of style.

5000|$|Despite his operatic influences, Korula's songwriting for the NK Band verges {{closer to}} jazz, adult contemporary, funk, and blues. About {{the style of}} his music, which blends [...] "Afro-beats, Latin grooves, calypso, jazz", Korula has stated that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> turning <b>point</b> for me was visiting Africa in 1999.

30|$|I {{have a great}} nephew, {{very smart}} young man, who breezed through college and then he thought about {{where he wanted to}} go to {{business}} school, and he ended up going to Wharton. He ended up as any good, smart person going to Wharton would, in the finance industry. He ended up in Brazil making tons of money. He is now awakened to the fact that he really didn’t learn very much. He learned a lot about this sort of stuff, but he doesn’t know much about the fundamentals of life and he’s now in the business of hiring people. He says he doesn’t want to hire these people from Harvard or Wharton. They’re just like he was; they don’t have any interest in the knowledge and to me, he was sweet enough to say the Stanford students have an interest in knowledge, so we want to hire Stanford. I’m not sure how much of that was flattery and how much was real, but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is right, particularly if you’re talking about research, you want someone who’s driven by a desire for knowledge.|$|E

5000|$|Not entirely, no. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> first <b>point</b> to {{make about}} the Culture is, I'm just making it up as I go along. It doesn't exist and I don't delude myself that it does. It's just my take on it. I'm not {{convinced}} that humanity is capable of becoming the Culture because I <b>think</b> people in <b>the</b> Culture are just too nice - altering their genetic inheritance to make themselves relatively sane and rational and not the genocidal, murdering bastards that {{we seem to be}} half the time.|$|R
