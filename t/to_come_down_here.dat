I'm still excited to be an actor." ...|$|E
60|$|GERALD. When you've done that, William, ask Mr. Freer <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} {{he tells me}} so about four times a day, Lady Julia. And he {{particularly}} wants <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> next September." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's no {{more right}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> blustering <b>down</b> <b>here</b> into Governor Eden's {{province}} than I have <b>to</b> <b>come</b> aboard of your schooner here, Tom Burley, and {{to carry off}} two or three kegs of this prime Hollands for my own drinking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{could not}} bring myself <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down,</b> aunt. Twenty years make great changes, {{and it would have}} been horrible <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and found that you had all gone, and that I was friendless in the place where I had been brought up as a boy. I thought that, by my putting it into a local paper, someone who had known me would be sure to see it. Now let me hear about all the people that I knew." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{your brother}} {{back to the}} ballroom," [...] Peter Ruff directed. [...] "Make him dance--dance yourself. Don't give yourselves away by looking anxious. When the time is short--say at a quarter <b>to</b> two--he can <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and wait for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he did;--your papa told me so, and that's why {{he asked}} him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> again. He {{never would have}} done it without." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; I {{spent a week}} or {{two with}} him last fall. I found him stayin' with his tribe, and we started <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> together." ...|$|E
60|$|FAITH. I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here.</b> If I'm to go I {{want to go}} at once. And if I'm not, it's my evening out, please.|$|E
6000|$|... "Grandpapa {{does not}} like moving," [...] said Caroline, as she {{got up to leave}} the room after dinner; [...] "so perhaps, Sir Henry, you will allow me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> tea <b>here?</b> We always sit here of an evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he ain't <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{after her}} <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> I suppose. And as for lovers, ma'am, I'm {{told that the}} most of 'em have 'em up in London. But it don't mean much, only just idle talking and gallivanting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the good?" [...] {{he broke}} in, gloomily. [...] "You don't know what I wanted you <b>to</b> know. I <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> for <b>to</b> {{find out the}} man as once owned this,"--he pulled the lock of hair {{out of his pocket}} again--"and you can't help me. I didn't believe it when you first said so, but I do now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{carry the}} monkey home, an' get your supper, for you'll want <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> this evening, an' you won't have {{time if you}} don't go now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, why didn't you?" [...] demanded Sam with {{a strong}} sense of injury. [...] "I might have forgiven you then. But <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and find you singing...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, mother, I know him. Captain Bayley has {{had some}} {{business}} with him, and asked me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> to see him. You are to sit down until he comes." ...|$|E
60|$|Please {{to observe}} that the M. F. wears a large cloak and a slouched hat. This is important, because Browne will have him in the same number, {{and he has not}} changed his dress meanwhile. Mr. Haredale is {{supposed}} <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> on horseback, pell-mell; to be excited to the last degree. I think it will make a queer picturesque thing in your hands. I have told Chapman and Hall that you may like to have a block of a peculiar shape for it. One of them will be with you almost as soon as you receive this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{away from}} the Green Meadows and the Green Forest and stay away for a week," [...] replied Blacky the Crow. [...] "Go up to the far-away Old Pasture {{on the edge of}} the mountain, where Reddy and Granny Fox are living. Have Boomer the Nighthawk see you go to bed there, and then ask him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{straight}} <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and tell Peter Rabbit just where you are. Peter will tell every one else, for he can't keep his tongue still, and then they'll all know that it isn't you that screams in the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|Just {{then she}} heard another voice, a deep, {{beautiful}}, ringing voice, a voice that she loved. It {{was the voice of}} Veery the Thrush. [...] "Oh!" [...] cried little Mrs. Peter, and then held her breath so as not to miss one note of the beautiful song. Hardly had the song ended when she heard the familiar voice of Redeye the Vireo. Little Mrs. Peter clapped her hands happily. [...] "It must be a surprise party by my old friends and neighbors of the Old Pasture!" [...] she cried. [...] "How good of them <b>to</b> <b>come</b> way <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> and how glad I shall be to see them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why, Uncle, {{instead of}} giving time to Tippoo <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> should we not march up the passes, and compel {{him to keep his}} army up there to defend Seringapatam?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Violet," [...] he said, [...] "of course I {{have not}} forgotten. Only don't {{you see how}} unwise it is of you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here?</b> If she were to know----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Prevost {{does not}} {{understand}} the affair,' continued Lord Eskdale. 'Why I wished you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> Leander, was not to receive the applause of my cousin and his guests, but to form their taste.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The young Indian {{shook his}} head. [...] "Sam {{one side of}} the boat," [...] he said, [...] "Jerry and Hunting Dog the other. Boat went down that chute between those rocks above. Only just room for it. Jerry was knocked off by rock. Hunting Dog was near the stern, there was room for him. He caught Jerry's hunting-shirt, but could not hold on <b>to</b> boat. When <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> made jump at corner of rock. Could not hold on, but current swept him into eddy. Then swam here and held on, and kept calling. Knew his {{brothers}} would <b>come</b> <b>down</b> soon." ...|$|R
500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fifth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus commented, [...] "I think finally, finally after pulling this off Jimmie {{will get the}} respect that he deserves. Knowing what we had <b>to</b> do— <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and beat them— and we beat them." [...] Hamlin, the points leader before the race, described his disappointment by saying, [...] "I’m disappointed. Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances {{but we had a}} great year. We won the most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us." [...] Harvick, who finished third in points, stated: ...|$|R
5000|$|At 4:45 pm on Saturday, 7 January 1950, a man telephoned Cox's West Point classmate, Peter Hains. Hains {{was acting}} as Charge of Quarters in Cadet Company B-2 (part of the North Barracks) and {{answered}} incoming calls for company members. He later said the caller's [...] "tone was rough and patronizing, almost insulting." [...] After Hains {{told the man}} that Cox was not in his room, the man replied, [...] "Well, look, when he comes in, tell him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> the hotel. ... Just tell him George called - he'll know who I am. We knew each other in Germany. I'm just up here for a little while, and tell him I'd like to get him a bite to eat." [...] Hains later stated {{he could not be}} completely certain the name given was [...] "George", as he had answered many phone calls while on duty and that one had not seemed noteworthy at the time; Cox never referred to the man by name.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thought it {{was some}} one else, eh?" [...] he remarked. [...] "Well, it isn't, you see; it's me. There's no one else with a mind <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> this baking {{afternoon}} to fetch you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's {{a friend}} of Cynthia's. Cynthia asked me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> with her to see you. I came, to oblige her. And now, without a word of apology, she leaves me stranded. She has no manners whatever.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{and outside}} work among the voters will, to a certainty. I want you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> {{by and by}} and work privately among the rag-tag and bobtail. You shall spend money among them; I will furnish it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose father 'll have to {{take that}} bill up," [...] said Fanny, assenting. And so it was settled down there among them that the Molletts were to have the cold shoulder, and that they should in fact be turned out of the Kanturk Hotel as quickly as this could be done. [...] "Better a small loss at first, than a big one at last," [...] said Mrs. O'Dwyer, with much wisdom. [...] "They'll <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{mischief}} <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> as sure as my name's M'Carthy," [...] said the priest. [...] "And I'd be sorry your father should be mixed up in it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me <b>to</b> Petrograd. <b>Come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|R

6000|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. No; but {{you asked}} me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and talk to you; and you {{mentioned}} casually that if I didnt youd have nobody to talk about me to but Bentley. That was a threat, was it not? ...|$|E

50|$|In Malayandipattinam, mainly Hindus live. Kottur, however, {{has a big}} {{colony of}} Muslims at its {{northern}} part. The majority of the Muslims live in their Ghetto. A few of the Muslim families live in other parts. Kottur-Malayandipattinam is peaceful and different communities live harmoniously. A few Christians also live in Kottur-Malayandipattinam.The dominant castes are Chettiars, Kongu Vellalar Gounders (there are so many sub-castes among vellalars), hindu-Nadars and Boyars.

6000|$|... (Applause, and {{a general}} show of {{interest}} in the gentleman from Suffolk.) [...] "Naow, Mr. Speaker, I hain't ag'in' 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' It's a good play, and it's done an almighty lot of good. And I hain't sayin' nothin' ag'in' Alvy Hopkins nor his munificence. But I do know there's a sight of little bills on that desk that won't be passed if we don't set to-morrow night--little bills that are big bills for us farmers. That thar woodchuck bill, for one." [...] (Laughter.) [...] "My constituents want I should have that bill passed. We don't need a quorum for them bills, but we need time. Naow, Mr. Speaker, I say let all them that wants to go and see 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' go and see it, but let a few of us fellers that has woodchuck bills and other things that we've got <b>to</b> get through <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and pass 'em. You kin put 'em on the docket, and I guess if anything comes along that hain't jest right for everybody, somebody can challenge a quorum and bust up the session. That's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he began, when he {{had filled}} his pipe with great {{deliberation}} and got it fairly alight, [...] "this here yarn as I'm {{going to tell you}} ain't no gammon. Most of the tales which gets told on the beach <b>to</b> visitors as <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and wants <b>to</b> hear of sea adventures is just lies from beginning to end. Now, I ain't that sort, leastways, I shouldn't go to impose upon young gents like you as ha' had a real adventure of your own, and showed oncommon good pluck and coolness too. I don't say, mind ye, that every word is just gospel. My mates as ha' known me from a boy tells me that I've 'bellished the yarn since I first told it, and that all sorts of things have crept in which wasn't there first. That may be so. When a man tells a story a great many times, naturally he can't always tell it just the same, and he gets so mixed up atween what he told last and what he told first that he don't rightly know which was which when he wants to tell it just as it really happened. So if sometimes it appears to you that I'm steering rather wild, just you put a stopper on and bring me up all standing with a question." ...|$|R
