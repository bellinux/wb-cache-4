5|$|Directed by Peter Maris, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a cast of}} 25 actors, all performing {{in front of a}} blue screen. While most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, Phantasmagoria includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo-Gregorian chant performed by a 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed it was intended for adult audiences. The company willingly submitted it to a ratings system, and included a password-protected censoring option within the game to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> graphic content.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5|$|Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. During early 1944 {{the main thrust of}} deceptions in the Middle Eastern theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin (including its sub-plan Vendetta), which developed threats against Greece and Southern France, and Operation Royal Flush, which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey. On 14 June the Allies committed to a landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> threat to France, and it was decided a new plan (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion.|$|E

5|$|The film began {{development}} in 2004, and Dixon reworked Meehan and O'Donnell's {{first draft of}} the screenplay to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> musical's campiness. In 2005, Shankman agreed to direct the film. Composer/lyricist Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Wittman reworked their songs from the Broadway musical for the film's soundtrack, and also wrote four new songs for the film. Principal photography commenced in September 2006 and ended in December of that year; filming took place on locations in Toronto, Ontario and Hamilton, Ontario in Canada and on soundstages at Toronto's Showline Studios. Recording sessions for the film's songs and soundtrack took place in Los Angeles, California in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the book}} {{originally}} sold very slowly, {{it became a}} Publishers Weekly bestseller. The Fall of Reach {{would go on to}} sell more than 100,000 copies by 2003 and a million copies by December 2009. The novel's success convinced Microsoft and Del Ray to pen a three-novel publishing contract for novels based on Xbox games, including another Halo novel. The next entry in the Halo novel franchise would be 2003's , written by William C. Dietz. The more human Chief seen in the novel led Bungie to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> character model in Halo 2 to make him less an exaggerated robot and more a real person inside a suit.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 24s run, the series {{attracted}} significant criticism for its depictions of torture, {{as well as its}} negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation, with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly {{as a result of these}} discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting to overwhelm the storytelling.|$|E

50|$|Originally the CTA {{came into}} being in 1871 and further {{amendments}} were made in 1911, 1924 and 1944, which gradually <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> provisions of the Act.|$|R
5|$|On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE {{changed its}} name and {{corporate}} identity to Braathens. It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company's new logo. The re-branding {{was an attempt to}} create an international identity, and <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian national symbols that had been on the airplanes since 1946. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced: the 'Best' section, accounting for 70% of the planes capacity, received higher seat pitch, complimentary in-flight drinks, meals and newspapers, priority boarding and refundable tickets. The 'Back' section was for discount ticket holders, who received a no-frills service with a smaller seat pitch, and were located {{at the back of the}} aircraft behind a curtain. Best tickets became NOK300 more expensive, while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets. The scheme was, according to Erik G. Braathen, an attempt to differentiate between the full-fare customers, with whom Braathens was competing with SAS, and the low-fare customers, who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to-be established Color Air. The scheme as first introduced on the first 737-700 that was delivered.|$|E
5|$|Levine {{confirmed}} in March 2013 {{that the film}} has been officially cancelled. Levine stated that after Warner's Watchmen film in 2009 did not {{do as well as}} the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the BioShock film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this. In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew were about eight weeks from starting filming, with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was anticipating on releasing the film with an R-rating, when Universal approached him about changing the film's direction. Universal requested that he <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the R-rating, and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that expensive a film with the limited R-rating would be too much of a risk, and pulled him from the film. Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material. Universal then let Levine make the decision to end the project, which he did believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises {{they would have had to}} make.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the attempt}} to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> content, the Motion Picture Association of America deemed the film too violent to rate PG-13, so Gibson {{released}} it as unrated. The re-release showed for three weeks.|$|E

25|$|The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) told Lynch {{that the}} version of Wild at Heart {{screened}} at Cannes would receive an X rating in North America unless cuts were made, as the NC-17 was not in effect in 1990, {{at the time of}} the film's release. The director was contractually obligated to deliver an R-rated film. He made one change in the scene where a character shoots his own head off with a shotgun. Gun smoke was added to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> blood and hide the removal of the character's head from his body. Foreign prints were not affected. The Region 1 DVD and Blu-rays contain the toned-down version of the shotgun scene.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the first}} film, this entry rarely showed {{the use of}} the Turtles' weapons. They instead fight bare-fisted for much of the film, as part of an attempt to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{violence}} of the previous installment. The film was released on March 22, 1991, and received mixed to negative reviews from critics who felt it departed from the much darker tone of the original 1990 film, and was more light-hearted. Despite this, the film was financially successful, and became the 13th highest-grossing film domestically in the year of its release. The film is a tribute to Muppets creator Jim Henson, who died less than a year before this film's release. Henson's Creature Shop created the animatronic creature costumes for the film, like the first film.|$|E
25|$|Wes Craven {{began writing}} A Nightmare on Elm Street's {{screenplay}} around 1981, {{after he had}} finished production on Swamp Thing (1982). He pitched it to several studios, but {{each one of them}} rejected it for different reasons. The first studio to show interest was Walt Disney Productions, although they wanted Craven to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> content to make it suitable for children and pre-teens. Craven declined. Another early suitor was Paramount Pictures; however the studios passed on the project due to A Nightmare on Elm Streets similarity to Dreamscape (1984), a film they were producing at the time. Universal Studios also passed; Craven, who was in desperate personal and financial straits during this period, later framed their rejection letter on the wall of his office.|$|E

25|$|After the Children of God album, Gira professed himself tired {{with the}} band's fearsome {{reputation}} for noise, feeling that their audience now had expectations {{that he had}} no intention of fulfilling. He made a conscious decision to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> band's sound, introducing more acoustic elements and increasingly emphasizing Jarboe as a singer. The first results of this shift in direction were the two records recorded by Gira and Jarboe under the names Skin (in Europe) and World of Skin (in the US). The first, Blood, Women, Roses, featured Jarboe on lead vocals, and the second, Shame, Humility, Revenge, featured Gira on lead vocals. Both were recorded together in 1987, although Shame, Humility, Revenge was not released until 1988. These albums are full of slow, ethereal, melancholy, dirge-like songs, sounding like stripped down acoustic versions of the Children of God songs.|$|E
25|$|If the bowler bowls a {{ball that}} bounces and passes the batsman above head height. In some {{competitions}} the Laws of Cricket are modified by a playing regulation that any ball over head height is a Wide ball, but a second fast ball above shoulder height in an over is a No ball, e.g. in International T20 Cricket and IPLT20. But in International One-Day Cricket and in Test Cricket, TWO fast pitched short balls per over may pass over shoulder height before No ball is called, and again any ball over head height is a Wide. Thus competition rules may both <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> definition of 'dangerous and unfair' (a Wide is a lesser sanction than a No ball, and cannot be applied if the batsman hits, or is hit by, the delivery) and put definite limits on repetition, intended {{not only to}} protect the batsman but also to maintain a fair contest between bat and ball, preventing such bowling being used to limit the batsman's ability to score. There is presently some difference of opinion between the authorities that {{is evident in the}} differences between Law and regulation.|$|E
500|$|Fleming's {{comments}} on New York were so cutting {{that when the}} book {{was published in the}} US, the American publishers asked if he could <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wording.

The song [...] "Uravugal Thodarkathai" [...] was reused in the film Megha (2014). Ilaiyaraaja wanted Vannanilavan to write the lyrics for the song, since Vannanilavan had difficulties in writing the lyrics, he opted out. He was subsequently replaced with Gangai Amaran.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the factors}} that made gangster {{pictures}} so subversive was that, in the difficult economic times of the Depression, there already existed the viewpoint {{that the only way to}} get financial success was through crime. The Kansas City Times argued that although adults may not be particularly affected, these films were [...] "misleading, contaminating, and often demoralizing to children and youth." [...] Exacerbating the problem, some cinema theater owners advertised gangster pictures with a singular irresponsibility. Real-life murders were tied into promotions and [...] "theater lobbies displayed tommy guns and blackjacks". The situation reached such a nexus that the studios had to ask exhibitors to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> gimmickry in their promotions.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, Hergé {{began making}} various {{changes to the}} story for its re-publication. Aware of the {{controversy}} surrounding the anti-Semitic depiction of Blumenstein, he renamed the character [...] "Bohlwinkel", adopting this name from , a Brussels dialect term for a confectionery store. He later discovered that, by coincidence, Bohlwinkel was also a Jewish name. Trying to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> book's anti-American sentiment, he also changed the United States to a fictional South American nation called São Rico, replacing the U.S. flag flown by the Pearys crew {{with that of the}} fictional state. In 1959, Hergé made a new list of changes to be made to the artwork in The Shooting Star, which included altering Bohlwinkel's nose, but the changes were postponed and have never been made.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of these changes included <b>toning</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> high amount of violence, death, {{and the use of}} firearms in many adventures. Tintin's role was slightly downplayed and he scolded his dog Snowy less often than he did in the books.|$|R
5000|$|Owing to the MPAA's {{restrictions}} at the time, <b>the</b> film <b>toned</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> more provocative {{aspects of}} the novel, sometimes leaving much to the audience's imagination. The actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon, was 14 {{at the time of}} filming.|$|R
