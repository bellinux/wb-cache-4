The accurate treatment of hindered rotors for molecules having multi- ple internal rotors with potentials that are not independent of each other can be problematic and a simplified scheme is suggested to treat them.

40|$|Delocalization in {{conjugated}} π-electron {{systems is}} shown to be {{closely related to the}} topological concept of connectivity. A topological bond order is defined as a quantitative measure {{of the extent to which}} the subspace of a pair of adjacent atoms approximates a disconnected component of the molecular topological space. The agreement between this measure and molecular-orbital bond orders in the ordering of bond strengths within molecules is near perfect. There is also excellent quantitative agreement between these two measures of bond strength. Bond orders appear to be primarily determined by molecular topology. A new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>intramolecular</b> equivalence relation between bonds, called “coresiduality,” emerges from the topological analysis. Two bonds are coresidual if the residues remaining when each pair of adjacent atoms is excised from the molecule are isomorphic. Coresidual bonds have equal bond orders.

40|$|A {{mechanistic}} {{investigation is}} reported of aminolysis reactions of 2 -hydroxy- 5 -nitro-alpha-toluenesulfonic acid sultone (1) in aprotic solvents. The n-butylaminolysis of 1 in acetonitrile and in toluene requires {{two and three}} molecules of amine, respectively. In the latter solvent, general bases strongly catalyze the reaction, and their catalytic constants are well correlated by the hydrogen bonding parameter pKm. These results are interpreted by a multistep mechanism where each intermediate can be stabilized via hydrogen bonding by general bases. The mechanistic features depend on {{the stability of the}} intermediates and on the solvent characteristics. When diamines such as polyoxyethylenediamines H 2 NCH 2 (CH 2 OCH 2) nCH 2 NH 2 (2, n= 2; 3, n = 4; 4, n = 6) are used as nucleophiles for the reaction with sultone 1 in toluene, much higher reactivities are observed when compared to reactions of monoamines and alkylenediamines.

The function of Vav proteins co-evolved with tyrosine kinase pathways, probably to assure the optimal conversion of extracellular signals into intracellular responses coupled to the cytoskeleton and the transcriptome. To date, the best-known function of Vav proteins is their role as GDP/GTP exchange factors for Rho/Rac molecules. This activity is highly regulated during signal transduction by processes involving intramolecular interactions among several domains of Vav proteins. On one hand, the phosphorylation of Vav proteins on a specific tyrosine residue leads to a conformational change that allows the activation of the catalytic activity of Vav proteins. This mechanism of activation has been recently explained in structural terms and shown to involve the acidic and Dbl-homology domains of Vav. On the other hand, the activity of Vav proteins is affected by a second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>intramolecular</b> interaction occurring between the plekstrin-homology and the catalytic regions of Vav that is regulated by phospholipids.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} pieces of information available about a compound is the molecular structure, {{and one of the best}} methods for obtaining structural information for crystalline compound is to study the diffraction pattern obtained when the crystal interacts with an X-ray beam. The diffraction pattern can be analysed to give not only the molecular structure, but also information on the packing arrangements in the crystal, the 3 -Dimensional crystal structure. This information on the molecular structure and packing within the crystal allow the study of weak intra and intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds. In this project two different methods will be used to study hydrogen bonds. Firstly using a statistical approach, where one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>intramolecular</b> hydrogen bond (the N-H [...] . π bond between neighbouring residues on a peptide chain) is analysed using crystallographic data obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database. Secondly the diffraction data from a several very different compounds are solved and the resulting structures analysed in terms of molecular and crystal structure; how and why the molecules pack as they do in the crystal lattice, and influences of hydrogen bonds on this packing. The effect of changes in the molecular structure on the molecular packing and crystal structure is also considered by the analysis of diffraction data from several groups of compounds where there are small changes in molecular structure in going across the group.

Doxorubicin and daunorubicin members of this family are among the two most commonly used anticancer drugs. However, these compounds exhibit severe side effects like cardiotoxicity and multi-drug resistance. A promising approach towards the production of modified anthracyclines with improved toxicity profiles appears to be combinatorial biosynthesis, including the redesign of biosynthetic enzymes however, structural and mechanistic information of the biosynthetic enzymes {{is necessary for the}} redesigning approach. The main focus of this thesis is the structural and functional studies of several anthracycline biosynthetic enzymes. The crystal structures of two polyketide cyclases, SnoaL and AknH were determined to 1. 35 Å and 1. 9 Å respectively. These enzymes share very similar α+β structural folds and catalyze a novel <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>intramolecular</b> aldol condensation reaction using acid/base chemistry. Moreover, comparison of the cyclase structures, followed by site-directed mutagenesis provided insights into the structural basis of stereoselectivity of products in AknH. Several enzymes from aromatic polyketide biosynthetic pathways, including SnoaL/AknH provide illustrative examples of divergent evolution. The related enzymes usually share the same fold but contain different catalytic machineries to catalyze diverse reactions.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{properties}} of meta stable excitations such as triplet excitons occurring in light emitting conjugated polymers by means of subnanosecond time- resolved luminescence and transient absorption investigations. Triplet diffusion and energy relaxation within a prototypical conjugated polymer has been studied by observing the bimolecular annihilation delayed fluorescence dependent on temperature, excitation dose and concentration. The results are analyzed employing the concept of dispersive hopping in a Gaussian distribution of states. After pulsed excitation the triplet migration is initially dispersive accompanied by a rapid energy relaxation. The subsequent classical regime is described by a time-independent diffusion constant and a invariable average triplet energy. Further, it is clearly found that triplet hopping in conjugated polymers is both an intra- and interchain process. Both the singlet-to-triplet generation branching ratio and the recombination layer thickness in a working polyspirobifluorene device are determined by a relative comparison of the singlet and triplet densities after electrical and optical excitation. The singlet generation rate is a field independent universal constant, the value of which agrees with the quantum-statistical 1 : 3 limit. Evidence is provided that the charge carrier recombination does not occur homogeneously throughout the device. Instead a certain exciton generation layer exists which, for polyspirobifluorene, is about 6 nm thick. Also singlet excitons are quenched by charge carriers. The latter might be formed after triplet- triplet annihilation in a sequential process, which involves {{the formation of an}} intermediate geminate pair prior to the full charge carrier dissociation. Finally, a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>intramolecular</b> delayed fluorescence is observed in the nanosecond time domain in luminescent polymers and also found to occur in a large number of conjugated organic systems. This luminescence is isoenergetic to the prompt fluorescence and shows the same excitation energy dependence, but rapidly decays with an algebraic law. In dilute solutions the overall emission quantum yield is a fraction of a percent only. Since all potential origins, including geminate pairs and triplet-triplet- annihilation, cannot describe the experimental results, the existence of a novel type of indirect singlet excitation is proposed.

The basic thermodynamic principles that govern protein structural transitions and the interactions of the protein and/or peptide molecule with its (micro) environment will, therefore, be tackled. Protein stabilization is based upon dampening the molecular motions and, therefore, eliminating conformational transitions while the molecule {{is still in the}} native 3 D (folded) state. The 3 D structure of a protein molecule depends mostly on two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> interactions: <b>intramolecular</b> interactions between aminoacid moieties and intermolecular interactions with solute and/or solvent molecules present in its microenvironment. Stabilizing a biomolecule (aiming at preserving its function) involves dampening its molecular motions, and this can be achieved by reducing the chemical activity of the water present in its microenvironment, thus stabilizing both its structure and functionality. Recently, the simultaneous entrapment-stabilization of proteins and enzymes based on nanoencapsulation in a nanoemulsion (W/O/W) matrix with an hydrophilic core has started to gain momentum. Similarly to the stabilization mechanism of osmolytes, in nanoencapsulation the water activity is altered thus affecting the molecular motions of the proteins. Highlights will also be given to structural and functional stabilization of protein entities (viz. enzymes, (macro) peptides, (recombinant) proteins, and bacteriophages) by chemical methodologies. Modification of the biomolecules microenvironment via multipoint covalent attachment onto a solid surface followed by hydrophylic polymer coimmobilization, are some of the (latest) strategies that will be discussed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
