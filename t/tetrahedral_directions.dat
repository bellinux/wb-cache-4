40|$|Using first-principles methods, we {{predict the}} energy {{landscape}} and ferroelectric states of double perovskites {{of the form}} AA'BB'O_ 6 in which the atoms on both the A and B sites are arranged in rock-salt order. While we {{are not aware of}} compounds that occur naturally in this structure, we argue that they might be realizable by directed synthesis. The high-symmetry structure formed by this arrangement belongs to the tetrahedral F 4 ̅ 3 m space group. If a ferroelectric instability occurs, the energy landscape will tend to have minima with the polarization along <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>directions,</b> leading to a rhombohedral phase, or along Cartesian directions, leading to an orthorhombic phase. We find that the latter scenario applies to CaBaTiZrO_ 6 and KCaZrNbO_ 6, which are weakly ferroelectric, and the former one applies to PbSnTiZrO_ 6, which is strongly ferroelectric. The results are modeled with a fourth- or fifth-order Landau-Devonshire expansion, providing good agreement with the first-principles calculations. Computations of zone-center soft modes are also carried out in order to characterize the polar and octahedral-rotation instabilities in more detail. Prospects for synthesis of ferroelectric materials belonging to this class are discussed. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
30|$|To {{improve the}} spatial {{distribution}} of the set of vertices (which has a large impact {{on the effectiveness of}} such graph-based approaches), several techniques have been proposed, such as a modified version of Lloyd’s algorithm. Lloyd’s algorithm repeatedly moves vertices to the centroid of their Voronoi cell [23]. As the number of iterations increases, the Voronoi cells take the shape of perfect hexagons. In fact, it has been proven that Lloyd’s algorithm minimizes an energy functional equal to the sum of the moments of inertia of the Voronoi cells [24]. Lévy-Liu’s algorithm consists of minimizing higher order moments of inertia: the Voronoi cells then become squarely instead of hexagonal, which has the effect of aligning vertices in precise <b>directions.</b> <b>Tetrahedral</b> meshes smoothed by Lévy-Liu’s algorithm make excellent candidates for recombination. When used in conjunction with the graph method discussed above, Lévy-Liu’s algorithm can generate mixed meshes with high hexahedra percentages [24]. However, the method presented in this article is frontal, not iterative. The vertices are created layer by layer.|$|R
