50|$|For inelastic goods, {{because of}} the inverse nature of the {{relationship}} between price and quantity demanded (i.e., the law of demand), the two effects affect total revenue in opposite directions. But in determining whether to increase or decrease prices, a firm needs to know what the net effect will be. Elasticity provides the answer: <b>The</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> total revenue is approximately equal to <b>the</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> quantity demanded plus <b>the</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> price. (One <b>change</b> will be positive, the other negative.) <b>The</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> quantity is related to <b>the</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> price by elasticity: hence <b>the</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> revenue can be calculated by knowing the elasticity and <b>the</b> percentage <b>change</b> <b>in</b> price alone.|$|R
