The main objective {{of this paper is to}} explain the extensive use of countertrade both between countries and between firms within one country. In a simple game-theoretic model it is shown that countertrade may be a rational business strategy for firms with buying power, and that the impact on welfare is negative, even in the case where no firm exists. The model is consistent with the observations that countertrade occurs mainly in homogeneous goods industries, that trades are relatively balanced and that the practice is more widespread during recessions than during booms.

40|$|<b>Two-way</b> time <b>transfer</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{accurate}} time synchronization methods applied to spacecrafts and ground stations to carry out time transfer. As this method doesn’t require the knowledge of locations of two satellites in advance and it offsets the negative influence of transmission path and other additional delays, this method has boosted the time synchronization accuracy. However, in the process of time synchronization, this method demands that the aircrafts, who conduct time synchronization, could be relatively static. So it is mainly used in GEO satellites for satellite-ground <b>two-way</b> time <b>transfer.</b> Based on the establishment of mobile satellite mutual visual model, the simulation of satellite mutual visual time on mobile satellite, including IGSO (Inclined Geo Synchronous Orbit) satellite and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellite, has been conducted. The visual time and the variation range of IGSO-MEO link distance have been gained. The characteristics of the propagation delay of <b>two-way</b> time <b>transfer</b> signals between IGSO satellite and MEO satellite varying with inter satellite range were analyzed and the rule of inter satellite clock offset varying with inter satellite range obtained with this algorithm was deduced.

The system includes a 6. 1 meter Ku-band satellite earth station, two transportable earth stations each with a 1. 8 meter dish, and commercial modems designed for two-way timing. Elements of the facilities are described in this paper. High-accuracy timing with this equipment using the <b>two-way</b> time <b>transfer</b> technique via a geostationary satellite is d'iscussed. Phase stability measurements of ground facilities in various loop-around schemes using a satellite simulator have been performed in order to determine ultimate stability limits. Allan-variance stability plots are generated for sample times of 1 s to several days at various carrier-to-noise density (C/No) ratios. These plots are compared to theoretical limits obtained from the model of phase jitter given for the spread spectrum modem. The use of small transportable earth stations with full duplex capability provides for signal turn-around at a remote location with stationary satel-lites in common view with the NBS earth station. It is shown that the portability of the small earth stations readily allows a measurement of signal delays through the ground equipment including the orthomode transducer, feed, and other antenna-related items.
