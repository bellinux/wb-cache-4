5|$|After Einarr {{had settled}} in Orkney two of Harald Finehair's unruly sons, Halvdan Hålegg (English: Hálfdan Longlegs) and Gudrød Ljome (English: Gudrod <b>the</b> <b>Gleaming),</b> killed Einarr's father Rognvald by {{trapping}} him in his house and setting it alight. Gudrød took possession of Rognvald's lands while Hálfdan sailed westwards to Orkney and then displaced Einarr. The sagas say that King Harald, apparently appalled by his sons' actions, overthrew Gudrød and restored Rognvald's lands to his son, Thorir. From a base in Caithness on the Scottish mainland Einarr resisted Hálfdan's occupation of the islands. After winning a battle at sea, and a ruthless campaign on land, Einarr spied Hálfdan hiding on North Ronaldsay. The sagas claim that Hálfdan was captured, and sacrificed to Odin as a blood eagle.|$|E
25|$|Birgit Nilsson (17 May 1918 – 25 December 2005) was {{a celebrated}} Swedish {{dramatic}} soprano {{who specialized in}} operatic works of Wagner and Richard Strauss, though she sang the operas of many other composers, including Verdi and Puccini. Her voice was noted for its overwhelming force, bountiful reserves of power, and <b>the</b> <b>gleaming</b> brilliance and clarity in the upper register.|$|E
25|$|The {{light of}} Greece {{may be another}} {{important}} factor {{in the development of the}} particular character of ancient Greek architecture. The light is often extremely bright, with both the sky and the sea vividly blue. The clear light and sharp shadows give a precision to the details of landscape, pale rocky outcrops and seashore. This clarity is alternated with periods of haze that varies in colour to the light on it. In this characteristic environment, the ancient Greek architects constructed buildings that were marked by precision of detail. <b>The</b> <b>gleaming</b> marble surfaces were smooth, curved, fluted, or ornately sculpted to reflect the sun, cast graded shadows and change in colour with the ever-changing light of day.|$|E

[...] Connery's acting efforts were overlooked by this reviewer, who did say: [...] "There is some excellent bit-part playing by Mr. Bernard Lee and Mr. Harold Sakata: Mr. Gert Fröbe is astonishingly well cast in the difficult part of Goldfinger." [...] Donald Zec, writing for the Daily Mirror said of the film that [...] "Ken Adam's set designs are brilliant; the direction of Guy Hamilton tautly exciting; Connery is better than ever, and the titles superimposed on <b>the</b> <b>gleaming</b> body of the girl in gold are inspired." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{a couple}} of days after the station opened, there were some {{problems}} in and around the station, which multiple news outlets criticized. An escalator broke down on September 14, just a day after the station's opening. In an unrelated September 16 incident, a straphanger got injured while walking up another escalator at the 34th Street station. Earlier that day, the New York Post reported on signal problems in the brand-new tunnels around the station, while riders complained about the delays on Twitter and Reddit. A Wall Street Journal commentator remarked that [...] "it's only a matter of months (make that weeks) before <b>the</b> <b>gleaming</b> station ... is pockmarked with chewing-gum spots, urban scrawl and litter." [...] Overall, however, the station received positive acclaim during its first few days of service. In an article in several newspapers distributed by NYC Community Media, Lenore Skenazy writes that many riders have praised the station's design, its cleanliness, and its climate-controlled platforms, and noted herself that the station looked and felt [...] "as uplifting as a cathedral".|$|E
500|$|Hoskins {{begins his}} chapter on {{industrialisation}} with the remark [...] "England {{was still a}} peaceful agricultural country {{at the beginning of}} the seventeenth century." [...] He describes the early industrial landscape, water power and early mills, steam power and slums. He names transformative inventions such as Kay's flying shuttle of 1733 and Hargreaves's spinning jenny of 1767, and comments that Matthew Boulton opened his steam engine factory [...] "in the still unravished country" [...] outside Birmingham in 1765. He quotes a poem by Anna Seward lamenting the ravishing of Coalbrookdale, c. 1785, and one by Wordsworth from The Excursion. He is critical of the industrial slums and the smoke and dirt of the Staffordshire Potteries. He emphasises the rapid growth of industrial towns like Preston, and of new towns like Middlesbrough, which went from a single farm in 1830 to over 50,000 inhabitants in 1880. However he appreciates the mining landscapes of Cornwall, including <b>the</b> <b>gleaming</b> white china clay pits of St Austell and the abandoned tin mines of St Cleer, commenting that [...] "there is a point, as Arthur Young saw, when industrial ugliness becomes sublime".|$|E

500|$|According to {{an account}} {{published}} by H. A. Wise in 1847, Jean Baptiste Trudeau boasted {{of his own}} heroism, but also spoke in lurid detail of eating Jacob Donner, and claimed he had eaten a baby raw. Many years later, Trudeau met Eliza Donner Houghton and denied cannibalizing anyone, which he reiterated {{in an interview with}} a St. Louis newspaper in 1891, when he was 60 years old. Houghton and the other Donner children were fond of Trudeau, and he of them, in spite of their circumstances {{and the fact that he}} eventually left Tamsen Donner alone. Author George Stewart considers Trudeau's accounting to Wise more accurate than what he told Houghton in 1884, and asserted that he deserted the Donners. [...] Kristin Johnson, on the other hand, attributes Trudeau's interview with Wise to be a result of [...] "common adolescent desires to be the center of attention and to shock one's elders"; when older, he reconsidered his story, so as not to upset Houghton. Historians Joseph King and Jack Steed call Stewart's characterization of Trudeau's actions as desertion [...] "extravagant moralism", particularly because all members of the party were forced to make difficult choices. Ethan Rarick echoed this by writing, [...] "more than <b>the</b> <b>gleaming</b> heroism or sullied villainy, the Donner Party is a story of hard decisions that were neither heroic nor villainous".|$|E
500|$|Deborah Wilker from The Day {{commented that}} [...] "Madonna's got an almost rabid energy about her, which she {{maintains}} {{for the duration}} of 90 minutes. In fact she rarely leaves the stage—preferring to change costumes in a phone booth instead. Boy can she change. One minute she's a 50's teenager in a party dress, next she's playing a speak-easy chanteuse. It's almost difficult to believe that a career as young as Madonna's could contain so much popular material that on stage the star can barely get to half of it." [...] Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times reviewed the performance at Soldier Field stadium said that [...] "'Shine' seems like a dim possibility for her Soldier Field performance this month, because Madonna invariably takes the stage after dusk has turned to dark and brings back the sun again for the two hours that she played." [...] In another review, McCleese commented: [...] " [...] proceeded to show Soldier Field a few moves that would gain Walter Payton some yardage, while putting a whole new twist on the term 'backfield in motion'. The girl really knows how to cause a commotion." [...] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post felt that the tour [...] "would have played better to a full house at the Capital Centre or Merriweather Post Pavilion. But to her credit, Madonna performed last night as if the house was full, and the show is splendid pop theater. Madonna has described it as 'Broadway in a stadium', and with her nonstop dancing, costume changes, mini-dramas and dynamic pacing, it is sort of a 'Liza With an M.'" [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times reviewed the concert at Madison Square Garden in New York and felt that [...] "For all its effort and professionalism, the concert wasn't exactly moving; Madonna had to ask the audience to get up and dance twice. But as shallow, kitschy, pop entertainment—no big messages, no revelations, familiar sounds and images, plenty of catchy tunes—the show was easy to enjoy. [...] The tunes stick to her limited vocal range and usually use short phrases—the better to keep her from running out of breath as she dances across the stage. And her band knocked the songs out with solid precision, recreating <b>the</b> <b>gleaming</b> sound of her records.|$|E

2500|$|Nearing {{was born}} in Morris Run, Tioga County, Pennsylvania, {{the heart of the}} state's coal country. Nearing's grandfather, Winfield Scott Nearing, had arrived in Tioga County with his family in 1864, at the age of 35, when he {{accepted}} a job as a civil and mining engineer. Before {{the end of the year}} he had assumed full control of mining operations as the superintendent of the Morris Run Coal Company, a position of authority which he held for the remainder of his working life. An intense, driven man, Scott Nearing's grandfather studied science and nature, practiced gardening and carpentry, and regularly received crates of books from New York City, amassing a large personal library. In his memoirs written late in his life, Scott Nearing would recall his grandfather as one of the four most influential figures in his life. Nearing's upbringing was that of a young bourgeois, his mother employing a part-time tutor and two Polish servants to clean <b>the</b> <b>gleaming</b> white house atop a hill overlooking the town. Scott's brother recalled that the citizens of Morris Run had treated the handsome and intelligent Scott [...] "the way they would treat the heir to the nobleman....
