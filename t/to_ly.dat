25|$|From his Confucianist {{point of}} view, Ngô Sĩ Liên often made {{negative}} comments on historical figures who acted against {{the rule of}} Confucianism. For example, despite his obvious successful reign, the Emperor Lê Đại Hành was heavily criticized in Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư for his marriage with Dương Vân Nga who was the empress consort of his predecessor. One researcher even speculated that since Ngô Sĩ Liên had a bias against this emperor, he decided to attribute the famous poem Nam quốc sơn hà <b>to</b> <b>Lý</b> Thường Kiệt instead of Lê Đại Hành who was considered by several sources the proper author of the Nam quốc sơn hà. Other decisions of the rulers which did not follow the moral and political code of Confucianism were also criticized by Ngô Sĩ Liên such as the coronation of 6 empresses by Đinh Tiên Hoàng, the marriage of Lê Long Đĩnh with 4 empresses or Lý Thái Tổ's {{lack of interest in}} Confucianist classics study. Especially {{in the case of the}} Trần Dynasty, Ngô Sĩ Liên always made unfavourable remarks on the marriages between closely related members of the Trần clan. The only short period during the reign of the Trần Dynasty that Ngô Sĩ Liên praised was from the death of Trần Thái Tông in 1277 to the death of Trần Anh Tông in 1320 while the historian denounced many actions of the Trần rulers such as the ruthless purge of Trần Thủ Độ against Lý clan or the controversial marriage between Trần Thái Tông and the Princess Thuận Thiên.|$|E

25|$|Trần {{literature}} was considered superior <b>to</b> <b>Lý</b> literature in both quality and quantity. Initially, {{most members of}} the Trần clan were fishermen without any depth of knowledge. For example, Trần Thủ Độ, the founder of the Trần dynasty, was assessed in Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư as a man of superficial learning. After their usurpation of power from the Lý dynasty, however, Trần emperors and other princes and marquises always attached special importance to culture, especially literature. Two important schools of literature during the reign of the Trần dynasty were patriotic and Buddhist literature. To commemorate the victory of Đại Việt against the second Mongol invasion the grand chancellor Trần Quang Khải composed a poem, named Tụng giá hoàn kinh (Return to the capital), which was considered one of the finest examples of Vietnamese patriotic literature during the dynastic era. Patriotism in Trần {{literature was}} also represented by the proclamation Hịch tướng sĩ (Call of Soldiers), written by general Trần Quốc Tuấn, which was the most popular work of the hịch (appeal, call) form in Vietnamese literature. Besides members of the Trần clan, there were several mandarins and scholars who were well known for patriotic works such as Trương Hán Siêu, an eminent author of the phú form, or general Phạm Ngũ Lão with his famous poem Thuật hoài. As Buddhism was de facto the national religion of the Trần dynasty, there were many works of Trần literature that expressed the spirit of Buddhism and Zen, notably the works of the Emperor Trần Nhân Tông and other masters of Trúc Lâm School. Besides the literature created by the upper classes, folk narratives of myths, legends, and ghost stories were also collected in Việt Điện U Linh Tập by Lý Tế Xuyên and Lĩnh Nam chích quái by Trần Thế Pháp. These two collections held great value not only for folk culture but also for the early history of Vietnam.|$|E

When the now [...] "mentally weak and distracted ruler" [...] Yingzong—as Anderson describes him—received the report, he took no other action but to reassign Nùng Tông Đán with new honorific titles. The court took no action to resolve the problem, and Nùng Tông Đán later {{played a key role in}} the Song-Lý war of 1075–1077. The Song also gave official titles to other Vietnamese leaders despite their involvement in Nùng Trí Cao's rebellions and their pledged loyalty to Lưu Ký, the latter employed as a tribal official under King Lý Thánh Tông.|$|E

Although it was lost during the Fourth Chinese domination in Vietnam, the contents of the Đại Việt sử ký, including Lê Văn Hưu's comments about various events in the history of Vietnam, were used by other Vietnamese historians as a base for their works, notably the Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư by Ngô Sĩ Liên.|$|E

2500|$|Beside {{the concern}} for the {{identity}} of the country, Lê Văn Hưu also paid special importance to the ability in reigning the country of Vietnamese rulers from Ngô Quyền <b>to</b> <b>Lý</b> Anh Tông with his comments from a Confucianist standpoint. He criticized Lý Thái Tổ for having built many Buddhist pagodas instead of saving those resources for the country and his people. The coronation of Sùng Hiền hầu as Retired Emperor (...) of the Lý dynasty in 1129 by Lý Thần Tông was given a negative remark by Lê Văn Hưu for the lack of Confucianist hierarchy in the royal family because Thần Tông should have given the title to his predecessor Lý Nhân Tông instead of his biological father. However, Lê Văn Hưu's emphasis of Confucianism was much less than Ngô Sĩ Liên in his Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư which was an historical text almost purely based on a Confucianist point of view because the main interest of Lê Văn Hưu was always Vietnam's independence from and equality with its northern neighbour China. Therefore, Lê Văn Hưu's Đại Việt sử ký was considered an essential work in affirming an autonomous identity for Vietnam.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} month of 1129, the Emperor {{bestowed}} his real father and mother Marquis Sùng Hiền and Lady Đỗ thị on titles the Retired Emperor (Thái thượng hoàng) and the Empress Mother (Hoàng thái hậu) of the Lý Dynasty. The decision of Lý Thần Tông was met with criticism from Lê Văn Hưu because of its unorthodoxy according to the feudal tradition in which the Emperor should accept only one origin, in this case was the late Lý Nhân Tông and his empress. Lê Văn Hưu, together with Ngô Sĩ Liên, again criticized Lý Thần Tông for his order in {{the first month}} of 1130 that every daughter of the mandarins in the royal court had to be available for the emperor's selection of concubines and ones who were not chosen could only get married afterwards. Because of the young age of the emperor, Ngô Sĩ Liên and Lê Văn Hưu often pointed their criticisms <b>to</b> <b>Lý</b> Thần Tông's officials who were considered ( [...] by the historians [...] ) lacking ability and being flatterers. However, Lý Thần Tông was later considered in Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư a skilled ruler who was able to choose and use talented officials and hold the stability of the Lý Dynasty. On the other hand, the modern historian Trần Trọng Kim wrote in his Việt Nam sử lược that Đại Việt was able to witness a peaceful era during the reign of Lý Thần Tông thanks to some capable mandarins such as Trương Bá Ngọc, Lưu Khánh Đàm and Dương Anh Nhị and the policy of [...] "ngụ binh ư nông" [...] which meant conscripting farmers into the army for a period of six months and release them for the remaining six months so that they could resume their farming work and thus the agriculture of the country was not affected by military activities.|$|E

And thence also is the reason of the variations in the beards of wild Oats, and in those of Musk-grass seed, that their bodies, being exceeding small, those small variations which are made in the surfaces of all bodies, almost upon every change of Air, especially if the body be porous, do here become sensible, where the whole body is so small, that it is almost nothing but surface; for as in vegetable substances, I see no great reason to think, that the moisture of the Aire (that, sticking to a wreath'd beard, does make it untwist) should evaporate, or exhale away, any faster then the moisture of other bodies, but rather that the avolation from, or access of moisture to, the surfaces of bodies being much the same, those bodies become most sensible of it, which have the least proportion of body to their surface. So is it also with Animal substances; the dead body of an Ant, or such little creature, does almost instantly shrivel and dry, and your object shall be quite another thing, before you can half delineate it, which proceeds not from the extraordinary exhalation, but from the small proportion of body and juices, to the usual drying of bodies in the Air, especially if warm. For which inconvenience, where I could not otherwise remove it, I thought of this expedient.|$|E

Bifore myn entre into Scotland, I appointed Sir William Bulmer and Sir William Evers too be marshallis of th' army; Sir William Bulmer for the vangard, and Sir William Evers for the reregard. In the vangard I appointed my Lord of Westmoreland, as chief, with all the bushopricke, Sir William Bulmer, Sir William Evers, my Lord Dacre, with all his company; and with me remayned {{all the rest of the}} garnysons, and the Northumberland men. I was of counsaill with the marshallis at th' ordering of our lodgingg, and our campe was soo well envirowned with ordynance, carts, and dikes, that hard it was to entre or issue, but at certain places appointed for that purpos, and assigned the mooste commodious place of the saide campe for my Lord Dacre company, next the water, and next my Lord of Westmoreland.

All the experimental diets were formulated based on the Ideal Protein Concept. Experiment 1 evaluated the responses <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> and Met on live performance of young broiler chickens from 0 to 18 d of age. The mean amino acid ratios <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> suggested by literature values {{were used in the}} formulation based on the Ideal Protein Concept. Six levels of Lys and eight levels of supplemental Met were used in the diets resulting in a total of 48 experimental treatments. There were significant effects of Lys levels and added Met levels on feed intake (FI), body weight (BW) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P¡Ü 0. 05). Significant interactions were also observed between Lys and added Met in response to these parameters (P¡Ü 0. 05). There were differences in the estimated ratios of Met or total sulfur amino acids (TSAA) <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> required for optimizing FI, BW, and FCR for chicks fed different Lys levels. These results indicated that the optimal ratios of indispensable amino acids <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> may depend on dietary Lys level in the diet. Experiment 2 evaluated the response <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> and Met in diets on live performance of young broiler chickens during the grower period of 14 - 35 d. Experimental diets were designed similarly as the experiment 1 with six levels of Lys and eight levels of supplemental Met. Two consecutive trials using the same experimental diets were conducted with identical design. There were significant effects of dietary Lys levels on FI, BW and FCR (P¡Ü 0. 05), with optimal Lys level for FI, BW and FCR of 1. 20, 1. 10 and 1. 12, respectively. There were significant effects of added Met levels on BW and FCR (P¡Ü 0. 05). No significant interactions between Lys and Met were observed based on FI, BW and FCR. There were differences in the estimated ratios of Met or TSAA <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> required for optimizing FI, BW, and FCR for broiler chickens fed different Lys levels. Results {{of this study suggest that}} the response <b>to</b> variation in <b>Lys</b> level is independent of Met level and optimal ratio of Met or TSAA <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> varies with different dietary Lys level in the diets. Experiment 3 was conducted to evaluate the response <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> and Met in diets on live performance of broiler chickens during the finisher period of 35 - 49 d. Similar design as the previous two experiments was used with six levels of Lys and four levels of supplemental Met. There were significant effects of dietary Lys levels on body weight gain (BWG) and FCR, with optimal Lys level for BWG and FCR of 1. 01 and 1. 05, respectively. There was a significant effect of supplemental Met on FCR. No significant interactions were observed between Lys and supplemental Met for FI, BWG, and FCR. Increasing Lys level significantly improved dressing percentage and breast meat yield. There were differences in the estimated ratios of Met or TSAA <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> required for optimizing FI, BWG, and FCR for broiler chickens fed different Lys levels. Results of this study suggest that the response <b>to</b> variation in <b>Lys</b> level is independent of Met level in broiler finisher diets and that the ideal amino acid profile may depend on the Lys level in the diets. In conclusion, the ideal ratios of Met and TSAA <b>to</b> <b>Lys</b> based on the Ideal Protein Concept vary for broiler chickens fed different Lys level in the diets at each of the growing phases...|$|R
