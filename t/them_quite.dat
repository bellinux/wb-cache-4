5|$|Quolls {{are mostly}} carnivorous. The smaller quolls {{primarily}} eat insects, birds, frogs, lizards and fruit; the larger species eat birds, reptiles, and mammals, including echidnas and possums. The tiger quoll's diet {{is dominated by}} mammals such as brushtail possums, rabbits and hares. The exact mix is variable depending {{on the availability of}} prey after bushfires, and can include carrion or bandicoots when food is scarce. The other species of quoll have also been known to eat carrion. The paws and vibrissae of quolls allow them to reach into small burrows to find prey. Quolls hunt by stalking. Depending on the size of its prey, a quoll may leap or pounce on it. Quolls pin small prey down with their front paws while devouring it, and jump onto larger prey, sinking in their claws and closing their jaws around the neck. Quolls can obtain all the water they need from their food, making <b>them</b> <b>quite</b> adaptable during droughts or other periods of water shortage.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Accum's publications {{were written in}} English. They were executed in a style that made <b>them</b> <b>quite</b> accessible to the common man. Many scientific contributions were brought forth through his writings, which were influential in the popularization of chemistry during this era. In 1820, Accum published Treatise on Adulteration of Food, in which he denounced the use of chemical additives to food. This ground-breaking work {{marked the beginning of}} an awareness of need for food safety oversight. Accum {{was the first person to}} tackle the subject and to reach a wide audience through his activities. His book, controversial at the time, found a wide audience and sold well. However, it threatened established practices within the food processing industry, earning him many enemies among the London food manufacturers. Accum left England after a lawsuit was brought against him. He lived out the rest of his life as a teacher at an industrial institution in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The defence was {{supported}} by a strong artillery component that included 41 Breda Model 35 20mm antiaircraft guns; 85 47mm antitank guns; 26 Solothurn S-18/1000 anti-tank rifles; 41 Cannone da 65/17 modello 13 65mm infantry support guns; 147 Cannone da 75/32 modello 37 75mm and 77mm field guns; 76 Skoda 100 mm Model 1916 and Canon de 105 mle 1913 Schneider 105mm guns; and 27 120mm and Obice da 149/12 modello 14 149mm medium howitzers. The large number of different gun models, many of <b>them</b> <b>quite</b> old, created difficulties with the supply of spare parts. The older guns often had worn barrels, which caused problems with accuracy. Ammunition stocks were similarly old and perhaps as many as two-thirds of the fuses were out of date, resulting in excessive numbers of dud rounds. There were also multiple models of machine guns, with seven different types of ammunition in use. The Breda 30, the principal light machine gun, had a low rate of fire and a reputation for jamming. The Fiat-Revelli Modello 1914 was a bulky and complicated weapon that was also prone to stoppages. Some of these had been rebuilt as Fiat-Revelli Modello 1935s which, while an improvement, were still unreliable. The principal medium machine gun, the Breda M37, had its shortcomings, the main one being that it used 20-round strips of cartridges, which gave it a reduced rate of fire. Shortages of raw materials, coupled with the increased technological sophistication of modern weapons, led to production problems that frustrated efforts to supply the entire Italian Army with the best available equipment. The result was that the firepower of the Italian defenders was neither as great nor as effective as it should have been.|$|E

From 1933 to 1935 PWA spent $3.3billion with private companies to build 34,599 projects, many of <b>them</b> <b>quite</b> large.|$|E
25|$|Following {{from this}} kind of thought Munch thus {{considered}} a territorial defence of Denmark impossible, and illusions about this downright dangerous. All Denmark could hope for would be to maintain {{good relations with the}} great powers, Germany first and foremost among them, and to avoid confrontation at all cost.

25|$|The simple {{structure}} of polynomial functions makes <b>them</b> <b>quite</b> useful in analyzing general functions using polynomial approximations. An important example in calculus is Taylor's theorem, which roughly states that every differentiable function locally {{looks like a}} polynomial function, and the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, which states that every continuous function defined on a compact interval of the real axis can be approximated on the whole interval as closely as desired by a polynomial function.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Dutch dialect of Brussels (Brussels) {{is a form}} of Brabantic (the {{variant of}} Dutch spoken in the ancient Duchy of Brabant) with a significant number of loanwords from French, and still survives among a minority of inhabitants called Brusseleers, many of <b>them</b> <b>quite</b> bi- and multilingual, or educated in French and not writing in Dutch. Brussels and its suburbs have evolved from a Dutch-dialect-speaking town to a mainly French-speaking town. The ethnic and national self-identification of the inhabitants is quite different along ethnic lines.|$|E

25|$|The {{end of the}} {{campaign}} on the mainland meant the sole remaining objective was the island of Crete, which lay off Greece's southern coastline. During the Battle of Crete Richthofen's Ju 87s also played a significant role. The operation came close to disaster on the first day. Most of the airborne forces that landed by glider or parachute lost most of their radios, which meant Richthofen {{had to rely on}} aerial reconnaissance aircraft. The German parachute troops were pinned down on the island, on the Cretan airfields they were supposed to capture. The level of effort Richthofen directed at relieving the pressure on <b>them</b> <b>quite</b> possibly saved the German units from destruction.|$|E
25|$|Evans {{continued}} to use his Ojibwe orthography in his work in Ontario. As was common at the time, the orthography called for hyphens between the syllables of words, giving written Ojibwe a partially syllabic structure. However, his students appear to have had conceptual difficulties using the same alphabet for two different languages with very different sounds, and Evans himself found this approach awkward. Furthermore, the Ojibwe language was polysynthetic but had few distinct syllables, meaning that most words had {{a large number of}} syllables; this made <b>them</b> <b>quite</b> long when written with the Latin script. He began to experiment with creating a more syllabic script that he thought might be less awkward for his students to use.|$|E
