25|$|Stephen Hawking and {{co-author}} Leonard Mlodinow state in their book, The Grand Design, {{that it is}} reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God.

After a few days, he presented each bee {{with an array of}} several dishes, each on a different colored background. One of the colors was the same as that used during the initial trial, and the others were novel, unrewarded colors. Remarkably, after a single rial and several days without exposure to the rewarded color, bees correctly chose to explore the color used in the first trial more than fifty-percent of the time.|$|E

2500|$|Since winning {{his first}} Tour de France title in 2013, doubts over Froome's {{performances}} {{were raised by}} various experts, including former Festina coach Antoine Vayer. These allegations were based mainly on his sudden transformation from a relatively unknown rider to a Grand Tour winner, following his breakthrough performance in the 2011 Vuelta. After his dominant showing in the first mountain stage of 2015 Tour, the suspicions increased even further. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> Froome promised to undergo independent physiological testing soon after finishing the Tour. The test, arranged by Froome himself, took place shortly {{before the start of}} the Vuelta, on 17 August 2015, in the GlaxoSmithKline Human Performance lab in London. Several tests were carried to determine his maximum sustainable power for 20–40 minutes (threshold power), level of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and his peak power. Froome's peak power was measured at 525 W; his peak 20–40 minute power, at 419 W, corresponds to 79.8 percent of the maximum. At his current weight of [...] (of which 9.8% was body fat) at the time of test, this corresponds to a figures of 7.51 and 5.98 W/kg respectively. His maximum oxygen uptake was measured at 84.6 ml/kg/min.

He also released results from a previous test, carried out in 2007 while being part of the UCI development programme.
