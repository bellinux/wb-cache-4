A washout affected a 70 ft {{section of}} track bed on the Florida East Coast Railway in Port Salerno, halting three passenger trains for a combined 7.5 hours. Nearby, floodwaters stranded two Florida Motor Lines buses as water rose {{to cover the}} floors. Relief vehicles later transported passengers on their way. African-American communities in Stuart reported severe flooding as well, and torrential rains formed potholes in streets in West Palm Beach. The rains demonstrated that local communities could be stranded, causing funds to be expedited toward bridge repairs on the Loxahatchee River near Jupiter. As late as August 2, floodwaters remained 1.5 to 2 ft deep along Military Trail near West Palm Beach. Flooding in some areas was the worst since a hurricane in October 1924. Winds disrupted communications with small settlements, and Stuart was unreachable for many hours. Loose branches falling on power lines temporarily disrupted electricity in Palm Beach, where flooding affected low-lying ground. The effects {{were similar to those}} attending earlier storms. Sewers in West Palm Beach backed up, causing water to seep over Dixie Highway at several spots. The water also submerged an FEC railroad siding and was 1.5 ft deep at the east end of the Royal Park bridge. Several cars were stranded while attempting to navigate flooded streets. Despite inconveniences, residents made good humor of the elements: newspapers noted that a parrot lost shortly before the storm was spotted in a tree, uninjured, and returned to its owner.Inland, the storm caused no appreciable effects as it mostly crossed sparsely settled areas.

40|$|With the {{development}} of the inland waterway <b>transport,</b> ship <b>locks</b> become more and more important as infrastructure in waterway network. Currently, {{there are a lot of}} studies about the capacity of locks, but the impact of the chamber’s horizontal dimension on the passing time and the costs-benefits should be studied more.

Furthermore, the relationship between the horizontal dimension of chambers and costs-benefits is also found and suggestions are given to other locks with insufficient capacity. In the thesis, different scenarios are made at first, and then SIVAK (Simulation model for Waterways and Infrastructure) is used for simulations.

40|$|Inland {{waterways}} form {{a natural}} network infrastructure with capacity for more traffic. Transportation by ship is widely promoted {{as it is}} a reliable, efficient and environmental friendly way of <b>transport.</b> Nevertheless, <b>locks</b> managing the water level on waterways and within harbors sometimes constitute bottlenecks for transportation over water. The lockmaster’s problem concerns the optimal strategy for operating such a lock. In the lockmaster’s problem we are given a lock, a set of upstream-bound ships and another set of ships traveling in the opposite direction. We are given the arrival times of the ships and a constant lockage time; the goal is to minimize total waiting time of the ships. In this paper, a dynamic programming algorithm is proposed that solves the lockmaster’s problem in polynomial time. This algorithm {{can also be used to}} solve a single batching machine scheduling problem more efficiently than the current algorithms from the literature do. We extend the algorithm such that it can be applied in realistic settings, taking into account capacity, ship-dependent handling times, weights and water usage. In addition, we compare the performance of this new exact algorithm with the performance of some (straightforward) heuristics in a computational study. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this talk, we {{describe}} recent experimental progress in detecting the chiral anomaly in the Dirac semimetal Na_ 3 Bi {{in the presence}} of a magnetic field. The chiral anomaly, which plays a fundamental role in chiral gauge theories, was predicted to be observable in crystals by Nielsen and Ninomiya in 1983 [1]. Theoretical progress in identifying and investigating Dirac and Weyl semimetals has revived strong interest in this issue [2 - 6]. In the Dirac semimetal, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by a magnetic field B splits each Dirac node into two chiral Weyl nodes. If an electric field E is applied parallel to B, charge is predicted to flow between the Weyl nodes. We report the observation in the Dirac semimetal Na_ 3 Bi of a novel, negative and highly anisotropic magnetoresistance (MR). We show that the enhanced conductivity has the form of a narrowly defined plume that can be steered by the applied field. The novel MR is acutely sensitive to deviations of B from E, a feature incompatible with conventional <b>transport.</b> The <b>locking</b> of the current plume to the field appears to be a defining signature of the chiral anomaly.

For that purpose, I propose a way to integrate transport investment in the problem of the typical manufacturing firm in a New Economic Geography model consisting of two regions. The model implies that the relation between geography and growth depends crucially on population dispersion: Regions with low population density abstain from investment in <b>transport</b> infrastructure, which <b>locks</b> their growth path in an ’isolation trap’. For intermediate population density, regions will invest to improve trade freeness, but lose out on growth in order to sustain their transport capital.

We discuss in some details the dynamics of the central island that, like the current, presents strong dependence on the forcing AC field frequency. In presence of both a constant and a small oscillating bias voltage we analyze the transition from the static to self-oscillating solution. We then consider current fluctuations (full counting statistics) for periodic motion of the grain. We explicitly evaluate the current noise numerically and we find that it shows clear signatures of correlated <b>transport</b> at certain <b>locking</b> frequencies.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of three-dimensional (3 D) topological insulators opens {{a gateway to}} generate unusual phases and particles made of the helical surface electrons, proposing new applications using unusual spin nature. Demonstration of the helical electron transport is a crucial step to both physics and device applications of topological insulators. Topological insulator nanowires, of which spin-textured surface electrons form 1 D band manipulated by enclosed magnetic flux, offer a unique nanoscale platform to realize quantum <b>transport</b> of spin-momentum <b>locking</b> nature. Here, we report an observation of a topologically protected 1 D mode of surface electrons in topological insulator nanowires existing at only two values of half magnetic quantum flux (±h/ 2 e) due to a spin Berry's phase (π). The helical 1 D mode is robust against disorder but fragile against a perpendicular magnetic field breaking time-reversal-symmetry. This result demonstrates a device with robust and easily accessible 1 D helical electronic states from 3 D topological insulators, a unique nanoscale electronic system to study topological phenomena.

We derive an analytical expression for the current-voltage characteristic and find that at temperatures, T, below the the charging energy of a single junction, E_c, the dc <b>transport</b> is completely <b>locked</b> by Coulomb blockade effect at all voltages except for a discrete set of resonant ones. At T>E_c the combined action of disorder and temperature unlocks the charge transport, since the environment excitation spectrum becomes quasi-continuous according to a Landau-Hopf-like scenario of turbulence, and the conductivity acquires an Arrhenius-like thermal activation form. The transition from the localized to delocalized behaviour occurs at T=E_c which corresponds to the onset of turbulence in the spectral flow of environmental excitations with Reynolds number Re=(k_B T/E_c) = 1.

The disruption class of the disruptive pulses is available. In particular, the selected pulses belong to four classes (density limit/high radiated power, internal <b>transport</b> barrier, mode <b>lock</b> and h-mode/l-mode).

40|$|The {{study of}} {{electron}} transport in mesoscopic systems has recently {{turned to the}} observation of time dependent single electron e ects, where the electron <b>transport</b> is frequency <b>locked</b> to an external potential. Such devices are expected to {{form the basis of}} a standard of electric current, long sought after by the metrological community, to provide a representation of the ampere and to be compared with existing quantum standards of the volt and ohm. This thesis details new experimental investigations of one such system. The piezoelectric interaction between an acoustic wave travelling on the surface of a GaAs heterostructure and electrons in a quasi- 1 D sys- tem de ned therein generates a current which, under certain conditions, can be quantized in units of e f where e is the electron charge and f the surface acoustic wave frequency. The general conditions under which this single electron acoustoelectric effect is observable are studied, and experimental results presented which demonstrate that the e ffect represents a possible route towards a current standard. The precision of the e ffect is assessed in a variety of experimental situations and device geometries. Several ways to enhance the precision of the eff ect are presented. Firstly a weak counterpropagating SAW beam produces a dynamic tuning of the SAW potential. Observations of a quantized acoustoelectric current are then presented in novel etched-channel SAW devices which aff ord a more precise current by allowing better control over the channel geometry. The presently attainable precision of the technique is at the level of 10 's of ppm. Detailed measurements are presented of the single electron acoustoelectric e ffect in a magnetic fi eld applied perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron gas. Commensurability oscillations are observed for the interval of current between acoustoelectric current plateaux when the cyclotron diameter and SAW wavelength are comparable. The oscillations show a particular phase dependence which results in an oscillating plateau slope as a function of applied magnetic fi eld. Results are also presented from measurements of the interaction between a surface acoustic wave and open 1 D systems. Here the quantized current is not observed, but instead the behaviour of the measured current depends sensitively on the geometry of the channel. Two situations are possible in this regime. Interaction between the SAW and slow electrons in the uppermost 1 D subband within the channel produces an oscillatory acoustoelectric current as a function of subband occupancy. These oscillations are observed in all subbands of clean constrictions for the first time. Secondly, interaction between the SAW and electrons in the device leads causes a contribution to the acoustoelectric current which is proportional to the quantized channel conductance, this contribution dominating transport in certain device geometries...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the implantation of the nail and the system running, a cadaver study using both femora of four human cadavers was conducted. All experiments were approved and conducted {{in accordance with the}} guidelines of the Committee of Medical Ethics. Written informed consent from the donor was obtained prior to their inclusion in this study. Each cadaver was thoroughly checked, and none of the cadavers had a history of musculoskeletal disease that could have {{had an impact on the}} experiment. All cadavers were frozen to a temperature of − 18 ° Celsius exactly 48  h after death and defrosted for 24  h prior to the experiment. Implantation of the CDS was carried out in supine position using standard retrograde access though the knee joint. The femoral canal was reamed over a guide-wire to a diameter of 15.5  mm followed by temporary insertion of the nail. After removal of the nail, a bone defect was created via a medial approach in order to avoid major damage of the surrounding soft tissues of the femur. Forty-millimeter bone segments on the right femora and 60 -mm bone segments on the left femora were generated using a Gigli saw. The osteotomy was performed directly distal to the insertion of adductor brevis in such a way as to preserve as much of the periosteum as possible. The nail was then reinserted into the femoral canal across the bone segment to be <b>transported</b> and then <b>locked</b> proximally in an anteroposterior direction. Standard anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs were obtained to guide the nail to the correct position. Next, a 6.5 -mm lateral drill hole was generated on the bone segment followed by fixation of the bone segment on the threaded rod spindle. In order to perform distal locking of the nail, the femur had to be distracted on the side of the osteotomy as the tension force of the adherent soft tissues reduced the initial size of the bone defect. After the size of the bone defect was readjusted to a total length of 60  mm, distal locking was performed and the threaded rod was inserted into the nail. With the mechanism inserted into the nail, the traction wire was adjusted parallel to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and fixed to the tibial tuberosity using a cancellous bone screw (Fig.  6). At completion, the mechanism and the system were tested by flexing the knee joint. Radiographs were taken in AP and lateral direction in order to ensure correct bone segment transport (Fig.  7). Bone transport was then conducted in all eight femora until impingement of the bone segment at the docking site. In clinical application, the screw in the tibial tuberosity will be removed at the end of segment transport and the traction wire will be cut at the distal end of the nail leading to a retraction of the wire into the nail.|$|R
40|$|The {{growth in}} sea {{shipping}} trade of containerized cargo has surpassed {{the growth in}} world trade generally and world economic growth due {{to the introduction of}} the container during the 1950 s, and the volumes of containerized cargo are still growing rapidly. Most of the ports located in the Hamburg-Le Havre range are fighting for the vastly mounting amounts of containerized cargo. Short of seaport/terminal capacity for supporting the increasing container throughput to the hinterlands is under great pressure both on the short-term and long-term competition between the seaports, with respect to future growth. Several studies have been done according to port competition in Hamburg- Le Havre (HLH) region, for example, in the report ‘Dynamic Port Planning under Competition’ by W. A. Gerrits, a port competition theory and model according to maritime economic has been established to find out the key factors affect the competitiveness for both Rotterdam Port and Antwerp Port. In S. Minderhoud’s report ‘Model Competition for Container Linear Services between the Ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp’, similarly a completion model is built and some strategic suggestions on the policy side are given out. But both of these studies focus on the maritime side or look upon the hinterland part quite generally by applying a cost model. In this research also competition model is built up but having two models base on the transport cost and transport time respectively, and this study is mainly fasten on and go to detail the inland shipping side. The overall objective of this thesis is to build a competition model for inland shipping between the Ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, and analysis the effects of each model component with the model outputs, and then think it over how to improve Rotterdam or Antwerp’s competitiveness (i. e. market share) on inland shipping market. This model can also be used for policy makers to verify the correctness and effectiveness of decision-makings in regards to port or route strategies. The new model can be implemented to estimate container throughputs on each route in the specific study area and market share as regards the attractiveness for ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, both on the outgoing and incoming sides. When considering either the travel time or the travel cost on each route for a container, not only the time or costs elements on the inland side need to be included, but also consider some key elements with respect to the maritime seaports conditions. Different outputs can be analyzed in terms of changing some elements to reveal their impacts. Then the relative measures and strategies base on the sensitivity analysis can be planed for improving the market share for either of the two seaports in particular. For building models the methodology of ‘discrete choice model’ is used to model the containers assignment: the shipping companies choose the logistic chain and the associated port based on the utility on each chain. A main variable for the time utility is the generalized transport time and for the cost utility is the generalized transport cost on the specific route. In the time model, the following input elements are included: access time, sea vessel handling time, seaport dwelling time, inland barge handling time, free on-route <b>transport</b> time, <b>locking</b> time. The composing components of cost model, including the access cost, handling costs, seaport time costs (vessel handling, seaport dwelling time), on-route transport cost (incl. labor cost, materials cost, maintenance cost and fuel cost). In the scenarios study, four scenarios are formed, port expansion (scenario 1) and Albert canal improvement (scenario 4) are policy driven measures that are already under execution or under planning, port crane improvement (scenario 2) and using more large barges (scenario 3) are two scenarios base on trends that is going on right now and maintain this trends in the near future. Under each scenario, mostly three options are studied and compared like the ‘What If’ approach. For example, in scenario 1, option 1 will analysis the effects of expansion project Maasvlakte II at Rotterdam port and Antwerp does not expand, Rotterdam will gain more inland shipping market share (and option 2 is a situation Antwerp expands only), however, in option 3 if Antwerp port also does the port expansion with similar size or more, then what is the new balance is analyzed and compared with the current situation. In the end, the conclusions of the research and the limitations of research scope, model (data) and scenarios study are explained. And topics and improvements recommended for further potential studies in the field of inland shipping modeling are concluded as below, - To be a more extensive scope and more systematic study. More seaports and inland ports in the HLH range could be included and modeled, and further studies may also take the other transit goods (i. e. bulk, box) in to consideration. - Models to be more concise and better meeting with the real situation. More components like port dues, barge waiting time at seaport that would contribute to the total cost and time could be also included. Besides, more accurate data are required, especially for barge category compositions on each route, and also try to contain the smaller barges like categories I, II and III. Furthermore, using more recent years of throughputs on the four routes is advised. All these improvements can make the model more reliable trustworthiness. - In the scenarios study, due to the time limitation for this research, actually more measures or combinations of measures could be compared and looked into detail.

Taka sytuacja wystąpiła jednak w przypadku Hiszpanii generała Francisco Franco, która w okresie drugiej wojny światowej prowadziła skrajnie antysowiecką politykę. Moskwa była konsekwentnie traktowana przez Madryt jako niebezpieczeństwo nie tylko dla jego niezależności i dla władzy obozu narodowego, ale także dla dalszych losów europejskiej cywilizacji. Stanowisko to wynikało zarówno z ideowego antyko¬munizmu najważniejszych postaci hiszpańskiej sceny politycznej, jak i z silnego poczucia zagrożenia ze strony państwa Józefa Stalina oraz inspirowanego przez nie ruchu komunistycznego. Hiszpański antykomunizm wyraźnie utrudniał relacje z zachodnimi sojusznikami ZSRR, doprowadzając do wielu sporów w kontaktach z Wielką Brytanią czy Stanami Zjednoczonymi i przyczyniając się w końcu do izolacji międzynarodowej kraju Franco. Autor, biorąc pod uwagę te kwestie, podjął w prezentowanej książce próbę udzielenia odpowiedzi na pytanie, jakie motywy kierowały generałem Franco, by problem sowiecki podnosić tak często w relacjach z członkami Wielkiej Koalicji i tym samym doprowadzać do pewnego ochłodzenia w stosunkach z Waszyngtonem i Londynem. Czy była to tylko obawa przed ponowną próbą rozszerzenia na Hiszpanię wpływów sowieckich? Czy też Franco w ekspansji komunizmu widział nie tyle zagrożenie dla własnego kraju, ile dla całej Europy i problem ten traktował nie tylko w kategoriach partykularnych, ale i powszechnych? Czy nieprzejednany stosunek do Związku Sowieckiego wynikał jedynie z chłodnej politycznej analizy czy też zawierał w sobie pierwiastek irracjonalny, metafizyczny czy wręcz religijny?The chief goal of {{the book}} is to analyze the {{attitude}} of Spain towards the Soviet Union during World War II and to determine the role Moscow played in the policy of Madrid. The hereby work presents the policy assumptions, the methods of its realization, as well as the effects the Spanish actions in this field had on general Francisco Franco’s state and how they influenced its perception on the international arena. What was also analyzed was the evolution of top Spanish politicians’ views on the Soviet matter as, for instance, Madrid’s approach towards Joseph Stalin’s state in the years 1939 – 1941, when Moscow was in alliance with Berlin, differed from that as of after 22 nd June 1941 when the Germans began the ”Barbarossa” operation. What proved particularly difficult in presenting the role the Soviet Union played in Madrid’s policy {{is the fact that the}} countries did not have any diplomatic relations with each other, as a result of which their mutual relations were basically non-existent and the only example of direct confrontation of both entities was sending out a Spanish volunteer group, the so-called Blue Division, onto the Eastern front. Therefore, another {{goal of the}} work was to examine to what extent the conviction about the threat the Soviet Union posed influenced Madrid’s relations with other countries. Despite considerable geographic distance, the matters of the East were of fundamental importance to Franco’s Spain in the discussed period, which resulted both from the ideological anticommunism of the most important characters of the Spanish political scene and from the strong feeling of threat on the side of Joseph Stalin’s state and the communist movement it inspired. Views of the Spanish politicians, especially of Caudillo himself, on the issue of Bolshevism exerted strong influence on Madrid’s relations with the other countries and a similar approach to the Soviet Union frequently formed the foundation for cooperation. This was particularly relevant for the Central-Eastern European countries which, due to the geographic proximity, developed a strong anticommunist attitude. Consequently, a common train of thought developed between Spain and Poland (i. e. the government in London and the underground in the country), Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Finland and the Baltic states. It is also essential to determine the level of influence Madrid’s anti-Soviet policy had on the relation with the countries of the West. Similar views on this case represented by Spain and Germany, as well as Italy, additionally strengthened the already solid alliance (despite the refusal to join the war) with Berlin and Rome and supporting these countries in their war against Bolshevism after 1941 was also a convenient form of paying off the debt of gratitude from the period of 1936 – 1939. On the other hand, the Spanish anticommunism hindered the relations with the Soviet Union’s western allies, resulting in numerous disputes in contacts with Great Britain or the United States and contributing to the fi isolation of Caudillo’s state on the international scene. As my work is mostly of source character, due to the fact that so far no monography on a similar subject has been written in the world historiography, it was necessary to base it chiefly on archival materials. They were gathered as a result of a query I conducted in the archives in Madrid: Archivo del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores, Ar chivo de la Fundación Nacional Francisco Franco, Archivo de la Pres idencia del Gobierno and in Archivo General de la Administración located in Alcalá de Henares. I also used the private archives of Jaco bo Fitz-James Stuart, XVII Duke of Alba, the Spanish ambassador in London during World War II, as well as José María Doussinague, General Director of the Foreign Policy, author of Plan D analyzed in detail in the hereby work. The following sources had my particular attention among the documents gathered in the Spanish archives: –	reports of the Spanish diplomatic corps representatives in the countries that were interested in Madrid’s Eastern policy because of their geographic location (Finland, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey) or because of the role the Soviet Union played in their imperial policy (Great Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy); –	records of diplomatic talks of the representatives of the abovementioned countries in their post in Madrid with the Spanish foreign affairs ministers of the Chief of State himself; –	correspondence between the Spanish politicians, in which the issue of the Soviet Union was discussed; –	reports and memorandums on Madrid’s Eastern policy; –	scripts of presentation delivered during sessions of the Spanish Council of Ministers; –	military reports concerning the operations of the Blue Division on the Eastern front. The examined material confirmed my initial thesis that the issue of the Soviet Union was of particular importance to Spain’s foreign policy during World War II and the threat of communism expansion was treated extremely seriously by its politicians. Moreover, the documents’ value is additionally raised by the fact that they have never been examined by Polish historians and many of them have not yet been used by the Western researchers, even the Spanish ones, for whom the Eastern policy of Madrid seemed a far-fetched notion that did not arouse enough interest. Unfortunately the work of a historian examining the fortunes of Spain during World War II is not free from serious obstacles. The national archives are shockingly incomplete, which was the fruit of Franco’s authorities’ plundering activities, who were trying to remove documents that could possibly undermine the regime. This peculiar “silence of the archives” is most characteristic for the period of 1940 – 1942, when the Spanish diplomacy was run by Ramón Serrano Suñer, a politician with pro-German attitude, privately general Franco’s brother-in-law. The plundering he performed deprived historians of the material that would make it possible to answer numerous nagging questions and the minister’s private archives where the documents in question were most probably <b>transported,</b> nowadays remains <b>locked</b> for researchers. The archival material from later times is in a far better shape, even though the surprisingly limited number of stenographic records of conversations between the Spanish foreign affairs ministers and the German ambassadors in Madrid, is clearly visible. All of these difficulties have direct influence on the work of a researcher examining the fortunes of Spain in the years 1939 – 1945, often making it impossible to form audacious hypotheses and leaving him surrounded by speculation and doubts. The queries conducted in the other countries rendered far better results. Resources of The National Archives in London impress with their richness and easiness of access. The documents I examined in the capital of England allowed me to gather additional documents to support the thesis that the Soviet issues was treated as a priority by Spain during World War II and that they exerted strong influence on the relations between general Franco’s state and Great Britain, which considered the Soviet Union its ally after 22 nd June 1941. The documents found in Archives des Affaires étrangères in France and the Italian Archivio Storico del Ministero degli Affari Esteri made it possible to look at Spain’s anticommunist policy from the perspective of Paris and Rome. The materials found in The National Archives of Ireland in Dublin and Magyar Országos Levéltár in Budapest were far more modest. They, however, proved that these countries as well had anti-Soviet contacts. Equally important information were obtained through research conducted on basis of the American archives available online: Franklin Delano Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum and Hoover Institution Archives. The collections in the Stanford University are particularly important as they contain materials created by the Polish diplomatic authorities in Spain in the discussed period, which are missing from the Warsaw Archiwum Akt Nowych.
