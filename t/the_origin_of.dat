5|$|<b>The</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the endomembrane {{system is}} linked to <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> eukaryotes {{themselves}} and <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires {{the least amount of}} novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E
