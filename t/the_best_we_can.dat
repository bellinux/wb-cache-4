25|$|It is {{problematic}} to date ‘Common Celtic law’, and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> arrive at are rough estimates. It is quite apparent, by parallels existing between Celtic and other Indo-European laws {{that at least}} some of the legal principles that make up Common Celtic law must be very ancient, perhaps going back to the Early Bronze Age or even the Neolithic period. Others may have only developed much later, perhaps even only as a result of contacts with Mediterranean cultures (mainly Greeks and Romans) during the late Iron Age and Antiquity.|$|E
25|$|Karl Popper {{tried to}} {{establish}} a criterion of demarcation between science and metaphysics, but the speculative turn taken by certain developments in theoretical physics has contributed to muddle the issue again. Mosterín has been concerned {{with the question of}} the reliability of theories and claims. He makes a distinction between the standard core of a scientific discipline, that at a certain point in time should only include relatively reliable and empirically supported ideas, and the cloud of speculative hypotheses surrounding it. Part of the theoretical progress consists in the incorporation of newly tested hypotheses of the cloud to the standard core. In this connection, he has analyzed epistemic notions like detection and observation. Observation, but not detection, is accompanied by awareness. Detection is always mediated by technological instruments, but observation only sometimes (like glasses in vision). The signals received by detectors have to be transduced into types of energy accessible to our senses. Following the path open by Patrick Suppes, Mosterín has paid much attention to the structure of metric concepts, because of their indispensable mediating role at the interface between theory and observation where reliability is tested. He has also made contributions to the study of mathematical modeling and of the limits of the axiomatic method in the characterization of real-world structures. The real world is extremely complex, and sometimes <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do is to apply the method of theoretical science: to pick up in the set-theoretical universe a mathematical structure with some formal similarities with the situation we are interested in, {{and use it as a}} model of that parcel of the world. Together with Roberto Torretti, Mosterín has written a uniquely comprehensive encyclopedic dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.|$|E

500|$|Ritvo {{then moved}} Mucho Macho Man to Santa Anita Park {{almost two months}} before the Breeders' Cup races because she felt he [...] "thrived" [...] in California. It was a major {{commitment}} for the horse's team, as Ritvo, Green, Petro, Tapia and Lopez had to leave their home base in Florida, and Reeves had to cover the expenses. Dean Reeves said, [...] "Everybody has basically put their lives and their family second to the benefit and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do for Macho." [...] The horse's next race was the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. [...] Because both Smith and Prado had prior riding commitments, Ritvo and Green decided to contact Gary Stevens. Stevens' contribution to the human interest saga included a comeback in 2013 after having been forced to retire seven years earlier due to debilitating knee pain. He also had his own near-death experience, having survived a major riding accident in 2003. [...] In a twist of serendipity, Stevens' agent, Craig O'Brien, came by the barn to inquire about the horse's availability about the same time Ritvo and Green had decided to see if Stevens was available. Stevens later claimed to be unaware of his agent's machinations. Noting that Stevens had portrayed Seabiscuit's jockey George Woolf in the eponymous film, Ritvo later joked, [...] "I was in Hollywood. How could I not use a film star?" [...] In the course of the Awesome Again, Mucho Macho Man settled behind the leaders before making a bid on the final turn. The horse led by three lengths in the homestretch, and accelerated clear of the field to win easily by [...] lengths over Paynter. It was his first win in 2013 and his first Grade I stakes win. [...] The victory was also a [...] "win and you're in" [...] qualifying race for the Breeders' Cup Classic, which included a waiver of the $100,000 entry fee for the Classic.|$|E
500|$|On 13 December 2012, {{the group}} posted a lyric video of [...] "Change Your Life" [...] on their Vevo account. It was {{originally}} {{speculated that the}} music video would have visuals reflecting the theme of self-belief and overcoming self-doubt. On 15 January 2013, Jade Thirlwall told Robert Copsey of Digital Spy that the music video will showcase Little Mix's individual personalities, [...] "We always want our videos to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do," [...] Thirlwall explained. She also revealed that the video will be more mellow and real than the group's previous music videos. [...] "We're just chilling and portraying the song and performing it how it should be; there are no fireworks or backflips, it's just us delivering a great song," [...] Thirlwall added. Little Mix wanted to showcase who they are with the video by centering it more around themselves than in previous music videos. The official music video for [...] "Change Your Life" [...] was set to be released on 18 January 2013, but it premiered on Vevo on 31 January instead. It was filmed in two days. Scenes from the video were filmed at the Rhyl Pavilion Theatre in Rhyl when the group were performing a show there {{as part of their}} DNA Tour at the end of January in 2013. A spokesman for the theatre said, [...] "We are very proud to be featured as part of Little Mix's 'Change Your Life' video and feel it's a huge achievement for the Rhyl Pavilion". The video features cameos from Jade Thirlwall's mother, Norma Thirlwall, and Perrie Edwards' mother, Debbie Dufty. Norma Thirlwall said, [...] "After a while, everyone forgot the cameras were there, so it looks really natural". Following a product placement deal brokered by Starcom MediaVest's content division, Liquid Thread, the video also sees the Samsung Galaxy features exclusivity in its technology category. Andrew Wynd, head of media, corporate marketing for Samsung Electronics, opined, [...] "It has been fantastic to be able to seamlessly showcase some of [...] functionality in the Little Mix video."

500|$|The Guardians Andrew Pulver {{was less}} enthusiastic, calling the film {{a mix of}} [...] "wafer-thin psychodrama" [...] and [...] "plot-generator dialogue". Times Richard Corliss said the action was let down by [...] "inert" [...] drama, {{describing}} the film as [...] "45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome." [...] Justin Chang of Variety criticized it as loud and lacking the nuance and subtlety of del Toro's previous films. The New Yorkers Anthony Lane's verdict read as [...] "It is possible to applaud Pacific Rim for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered—long, loud, dark, and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Mike LaSalle reacted extremely negatively by stating [...] "If this is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{do in terms of}} movies—hoif something like this can speak to the soul of audiences—maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with… Director Guillermo del Toro, who gave us Pan's Labyrinth not too many years ago, used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker, despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer…Why go to the movies to look at somebody else's computer after looking at your own all week?… The actors can't make Pacific Rim any better. They can only relieve some of the pain." [...] Slant Magazines Ed Gonzalez, who said the film lacked poignancy, compared it to a video game: [...] "a stylish but programmatic ride toward an inevitable final boss battle". The Wraps Alonso Duralde criticized the choice to set most battles at night or during the rain, feeling it detracted from the action, and said the comic relief actors—Day, Gorman, and Perlman—stole the film from the less interesting leads. Jordan Hoffman of Film.com identified Hunnam as the weak link in the cast, calling him a [...] "charisma black hole". Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald was particularly critical of the film, awarding the action sequences [...] "five IQ points out of five" [...] as he described the film as an hour and twenty minutes of fight sequences vaguely connected by ten minutes of story.|$|E

2500|$|The {{legislature}} met {{in joint}} session as a constitutional convention on February 11, and after {{six hours of}} debate rejected two amendments, one proposed by House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and the other by Senate President Robert E. Travaglini. Both banned same-sex marriage, one made civil unions possible and the other established civil unions. Finneran commented: [...] "We are as divided as the nation on this. We are doing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can.</b> We are human beings. We struggle. Sometimes we come up short." [...] The convention met again {{the next day and}} defeated an amendment that defined marriage as the union {{of a man and a}} woman and disavowed any position on civil unions on a 103-94 vote that showed divisions in each party and Catholic legislators evenly divided. Ronald Crews of the Massachusetts Family Institute blamed Finneran's misreading of his own caucus for the failure of his own proposed language, a defeat in the convention's opening moments from which Crews found it impossible to recover.|$|E

2500|$|Now {{consider}} {{the example of}} a coin toss. Assuming the probability of heads {{is the same as the}} probability of tails, then the entropy of the coin toss is as high as it could be. This is because there is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if we have to choose, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do is predict that the coin will come up heads, and this prediction will be correct with probability 1/2. Such a coin toss has one bit of entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains one bit of information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, one binary-outcome with equiprobable values has a Shannon entropy of [...] bit. Similarly, one trit with equiprobable values contains [...] (about 1.58496) bits of information because it can have one of three values.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, {{the state}} of Connecticut enacted {{legislation}} preventing physical restraint or seclusion of special needs students except in limited situations, {{largely as a result}} of allegations of mistreatment of four special education students in Wilton High School and other Wilton schools in 2005. Jill Ely claimed that, without notifying her, the school forced her intellectually disabled son into a room at the high school that was held shut until he became completely quiet. She said that her son injured his arm trying to get out and once, she later learned, [...] "he was left crying and whimpering for almost the entire day." [...] An investigation by the Wilton Bulletin in 2006 found that the high school [...] "safe room" [...] had never been inspected by the fire marshall and lacked a Building Department certificate of occupancy.
