5|$|On 10 March 1941, with Operation Barbarossa looming, Felix was {{amended to}} Operation Felix-Heinrich, whereby German <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> be {{withdrawn}} from the USSR to capture Gibraltar. As a result of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco's intransigence, the operation was postponed, modified, and ultimately abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 8 August the Georgian 4th Brigade from Vaziani Military Base {{advanced}} on the left flank of Tskhinvali; the 3rd Brigade advanced on the right flank. The aim of the flank operations was to advance northward after capturing key positions. The Georgian <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> take the Gupta bridge and the road to the Roki Tunnel, barring the Russian troops from moving southward.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{intended}} {{that his}} cavalry, comprising mainly medium Hispanic cavalry and Numidian light horse, and positioned on the flanks, would defeat the weaker Roman cavalry and swing around {{to attack the}} Roman infantry from the rear as it pressed upon Hannibal's weakened center. His veteran African <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> then press in from the flanks at the crucial moment, and encircle the overextended Romans.|$|E
50|$|This {{position}} allowed Scott {{to carry}} out a close reconnaissance of the Turkish positions using field glasses {{and he was able to}} plan his assault. One <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> move to a position 1 mi north-west of the well. Another <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> move around to the south-west of the well. A third <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> position itself to the south of the well, While the fourth <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> carry out a frontal assault, supported by a machine-gun section, from their present position. Four men of the assault troop were detached to protect the engineers and another four for the machine-gun section.|$|R
25|$|Though the LCA {{had been}} {{designed}} around the most common likely load, a British infantry platoon, the original war establishment of a commando (a headquarters and 10 troops) was formed without reference to this fact. Early in 1941, each Commando unit's establishment was changed to consist of a Headquarters and six <b>troops.</b> Each <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> fit into two LCA.|$|R

5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} {{plans for the}} {{reorganization}} of the Belgian Army after the liberation, known as the Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The plan called {{for the formation of}} two brigades of infantry, six battalions of fusiliers, logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside Allied troops during an invasion of Germany. In the longer term, these <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> form the core of a new division around which more troops could be raised.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{established}} {{a close relationship}} with the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, and was probably the second most-powerful person in the country after the prime minister, although many Australians resented MacArthur as a foreign general who had been imposed upon them. MacArthur had little confidence in Brett's abilities as commander of Allied Air Forces, and in August 1942 selected Major General George C. Kenney to replace him. Kenney's application of air power in support of Blamey's <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> prove crucial.|$|E
5|$|The 38th, {{along with}} the 45th Holding, the 47th Infantry (Reserve) and the 48th Infantry (Reserve) Division, were used to {{complete}} the training of new army recruits. At the division, the soldiers were given five weeks of further training at the section, platoon and company level, before undertaking a final three-day exercise. <b>Troops</b> <b>would</b> then be ready to be sent overseas to join other formations.|$|E
50|$|C Troop was to land first, clear {{obstacles}} {{and establish a}} beachhead; B <b>Troop</b> <b>would</b> pass through C Troop, head inland and execute their tasks. The return journey {{would be in the}} LCAs.|$|R
5|$|In February 1941 the Commandos were reorganized in {{accordance}} with a new war establishment. Each Commando unit now consisted of a Headquarters and six troops (instead of the previous 10). Each <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the 'Glen' type landing ship and one unit in the 'Dutch' type landing ship. The motor transport issued to each commando consisted of one car for the commanding officer, 12 motorcycles (six with sidecars), two 15 hundredweight (cwt) trucks, and one 3-ton truck. These vehicles were only provided for administration and training and were not intended to accompany the men on operations.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Baden-Powell's {{drawing of}} a Patrol Leader's pennant: [...] "Each patrol leader has a small white flag on his staff {{with the head of}} his patrol animal shown in red cloth {{stitched}} on to it on both sides. Thus the 'Wolves' of the 1st London <b>Troop</b> <b>would</b> have the flag shown below".|$|R
5|$|The killings {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile {{for as long as}} the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|The massive thrust {{through the}} Allied centre was {{conducted}} by 16,000 troops of Soult's IV Corps. IV Corps' position was cloaked by dense mist during the early stage of the battle; in fact how long the mist lasted was vital to Napoleon's plan: Soult's <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> become uncovered if the mist dissipated too soon, but if it lingered too long, Napoleon {{would be unable to}} determine when the Allied troops had evacuated Pratzen Heights, preventing him from timing his attack properly.|$|E
5|$|While the Carthaginians were in {{the process}} of {{defeating}} the cavalry, the masses of infantry on both sides advanced towards each other in the center of the field. The wind from the east blew dust in the Romans' faces and obscured their vision. While the wind was not a major factor, the dust that both armies created would have been potentially debilitating to sight. Although it made seeing difficult, <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> still have been able to see others in the vicinity. The dust, however, was not the only psychological factor involved in battle. Because of the somewhat distant battle location, both sides were forced to fight on little sleep. Another Roman disadvantage was thirst caused by Hannibal's attack on the Roman encampment during the previous day. Furthermore, the massive number of <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> have led to an overwhelming amount of background noise. All of these psychological factors made battle especially difficult for the infantrymen.|$|E
50|$|It {{was thought}} that Schneider's Aegidienberg-based force now {{comprised}} about 4000 armed men. Using factory sirens and alarm bells, the local <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> be mobilised the minute separatist forces were reported or even merely rumoured to have appeared. Panic was apparent as people rushed around trying to move to safety their cattle and other chattels.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it--that's it; {{there was}} just one troop on 'em, and not a man more! Mad Anthony said a <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> answer, arter we had put the red-skins up out of their ambushes, or any other bushes; and so it did. I must {{acknowledge}} that I think more of the Scriptur's than ever, since Parson Amen read to me that varse." ...|$|R
5|$|While {{all this}} was going on, a {{decision}} was made to concentrate the commandos and Independent Companies into five large 1,000 man battalions, each of two companies. No. 4 Commando was renamed the No. 1 Company of the 3rd Special Service Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Lister. No. 2 Company was formed by the re-designation of No. 7 Commando. This new formation proved to be too large and unwieldy in practice. Within three months, the Special Service Battalions were disbanded and the original commando units reformed but on a smaller scale with six troops instead of the original ten. Each <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the 'Glen' type landing ship and one unit in the 'Dutch' type landing ship.|$|R
5|$|A {{conference was}} held that {{afternoon}} at the U.S. 2nd Division command post, attended by leaders of the U.S. Eighth Army, 2nd Division, and 1st Provisional Marine Brigade. A decision was reached that the Marines would attack west at 08:00 on 3 September astride the Yongsan–Naktong River road, and U.S. Army <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> attack northwest above the Marines and attempt to re-establish contact with the U.S. 23rd Infantry, while the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion with remnants of the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry, and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank, or south, of the Marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division.|$|E
5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of naval attacks, {{it was decided that}} ground forces were {{necessary}} to eliminate the Turkish mobile artillery and allow minesweepers to clear the waters for larger vessels. The British Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Lord Kitchener, appointed General Sir Ian Hamilton to command the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF) that was to carry out the mission. The MEF consisted of Birdwood's ANZAC, British 29th Division, British Royal Naval Division and the French Corps expéditionnaire d'Orient. Some 40,000 Russian <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> participate in the capture or occupation of Constantinople.|$|E

2500|$|The Bass Lake lone troop Scout {{camp was}} a single camp on a small (approximately [...] wide) lake on the Owasippe reservation. A single <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> take over the entire camp, usually for a two-week period, {{preparing}} all their own food and overseeing {{all aspects of the}} camp life. While active in the 1950s and 1960s, Camp Bass Lake is no longer in use.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, C (Crazy Horse) <b>Troop</b> <b>would</b> deploy to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba {{to assist}} the Joint Detention Group in {{securing}} the strategic site. This would be {{the second time that}} 3rd Cavalry troopers deployed to Guantanamo Bay, the first time was in 1898 during the Spanish-American War. While serving simultaneously in Afghanistan, the Sinai Peninsula, Guantanamo Bay, and Fort Hood, the sun never set on the 3rd Cavalry Regiment.|$|R
5|$|Anderson {{left the}} Centralia area on September 27, pursued {{for the first}} time by Union forces {{equipped}} with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines that the Union <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the attacks, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.|$|E
5|$|As the Allies {{advanced}} towards Borneo, {{additional units}} were dispatched from Japan {{during the second}} half of 1944 and the 37th Army was established in September to coordinate the island's defence. In December 1944, Japanese staff officers deduced that it was likely that Australian <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> be landed at strategic points on the east and west coasts of Borneo in about March the next year (by which time they also expected United States forces to have liberated the Philippines). Accordingly, several Japanese units stationed in north-east Borneo were ordered to march to the western side of Borneo. This movement proceeded slowly, owing to the distances involved and disruptions caused by Allied air attacks.|$|E
5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{suggestion}} of Brigadier John Anquetil Norman, the King declared that the Riding <b>Troop</b> <b>would</b> be known as 'The King's Troop'. The King enacted his proclamation on 24 October 1947 by amending the page on the visitors' book by striking out the word [...] "Riding" [...] and inserting [...] "King's". On her accession, Queen Elizabeth II declared that the name 'The King's Troop' would remain in honour of her father.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1942, the 999th Light Afrika Division {{was formed}} from {{civilian}} criminals and prison inmates {{who had been}} deemed [...] "unfit for military service". They were encouraged to volunteer on the promise that all past crimes would be wiped out by exemplary bravery in combat. However anyone who refused to join the Bewährungstruppe (probation <b>troop)</b> <b>would</b> stay in prison without rights to parole or be sent to a concentration camp.|$|R
50|$|In August 1940, Zeila was {{captured}} by advancing Italian <b>troops.</b> It <b>would</b> remain under their occupation for over six months.|$|R
5|$|During {{the whole}} {{existence}} of the Byzantine Empire, the garrison {{of the city was}} quite small: the imperial guards and the small city watch (the pedatoura or kerketon) under the urban prefect were the only permanent armed force available. Any threat to the city would {{have to be dealt with}} by the field armies in the provinces, before it could approach the city itself. In times of need, such as the earthquake of 447 or the raids by the Avars in the early 7th century, the general population, organized in the guilds and the hippodrome factions, would be conscripted and armed, or additional <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> be brought in from the provincial armies.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their arrival}} at Port Moresby, the 16th Brigade {{along with the}} 25th Brigade, {{prepared}} to relieve the forces on the Kokoda Track. With the Australians having finally halted the Japanese advance, the fresh <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> be tasked with launching a counterattack to drive the Japanese back to Buna in the north. Consequently, throughout October, November and into December, the 2/3rd Battalion took part in three major actions: Eora Creek (22–28 October), Oivi (5–12 November), and an action on the Sanananda Track (21 November– 19 December).|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the Conservative Party {{returned}} {{to power in}} Britain, {{under the leadership of}} Winston Churchill. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the empire, with the base at the Suez Canal allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. However, Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser's new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in 1952, and the following year it was agreed that British <b>troops</b> <b>would</b> withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow. Sudan was granted independence on 1 January 1956.|$|E
50|$|The {{members of}} the Nobles would gather before dawn on Christmas Day, dressed up in costumes, such as garb of doctors, nurses, teachers, ministers, pastors, farmers, fishermen, prostitutes, pastors, drivers, cowboys, sailors, angels, or even the white colonial masters. The idea was to imitate the various town professions and parody the Europeans. The <b>troop</b> <b>would</b> then parade {{through the streets of}} Winneba, backed by adaha music, and would {{continue}} all day into the evening.|$|R
