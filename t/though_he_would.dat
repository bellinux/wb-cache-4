5|$|Before 1937–38 he {{had scored}} 43 goals in four seasons, and full-backs began to mark him more tightly; {{because of this}} he decided to drop deeper to collect the ball and aim to play {{pinpoint}} crosses as opposed to going for glory himself. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never again score more than six goals in a season, this made him more an effective team player and a greater threat to the opposition.|$|E
5|$|Director Greg Beeman {{attempted}} {{to create a}} visual theme among the characters that would parallel the approaching storm. The episode would mark the departure of Eric Johnson as Whitney Fordman, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> return as a special guest in seasons two and four. Although the Smallville finale pulled in just {{over half of the}} viewership attained by the pilot episode, it was still favorably received by critics. It was also nominated for two awards.|$|E
5|$|Jesse Grant {{moved to}} Point Pleasant in 1820 and found {{work as a}} foreman in a tannery. He soon met his future wife, Hannah, and the two were married on June 24, 1821. Ten months later Hannah gave birth to their first child, a son. At a family {{gathering}} several weeks later the boy's name, Ulysses, was drawn from ballots placed in a hat. Wanting to honor his father-in-law, Jesse declared the boy to be Hiram Ulysses, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> always refer to him as Ulysses.|$|E

He shrank from trusting {{himself in}} government keeping, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be safe in it. <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go by Tadoussac; and the landlord found a carriole driver, {{with a tough}} little Canadian horse, who agreed to go the whole way to Chicoutimi with him.|$|R

50|$|Fatah renominated Abbas {{as their}} {{candidate}} for the next presidential elections in early June 2008, although reports in December suggested that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not run for a second term.

5|$|Seattle {{was unable}} to repeat their successes in the 2014 season. The season started successfully, with several key wins that saw the team {{at the top of}} the Western Conference by June. During a 2015 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup match against the Portland Timbers on June 16, however, Obafemi Martins left the game with a groin injury and Clint Dempsey was {{suspended}} after tearing a referee's pocketbook, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be called away for the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Jackets {{began the}} year with the worst start in {{franchise}} history and the worst by any team in an NHL season in 19 years. After an 11–25–5 start, Head Coach Scott Arniel was fired and replaced by Assistant Coach Todd Richards. The poor season prompted several personnel changes including the trade of All-Star forward Jeff Carter, who was acquired with much fanfare during the off-season. With the prospect of another rebuild looming the Blue Jackets' captain and best player, Rick Nash, requested to be traded, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> remain with the team for the entire season.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the first}} series (2006), Rhys is {{initially}} unaware of Gwen's vocation as a Torchwood agent, believing {{her to work}} in generic special forces. Gwen's relationship with Rhys languishes while she is unable to communicate fully with him, {{but in the early}} part of series two (2008) he discovers the truth, and from thereon in their relationship is revitalised; the two enter a marriage based on honesty later in the series. In the third series (2009) Rhys becomes directly involved in assisting the Torchwood team in lieu of a fourth team member. In the show's fourth series— a 2011 BBC/Starz co-production— Rhys again finds himself having to assist Torchwood, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rather live a domestic life with Gwen and their daughter Anwen.|$|E

5|$|When {{thinking}} {{of how to}} end the first season, two things were clear to Alfred Gough and Miles Millar: the final episode would have the school prom, {{and there would be}} tornadoes. Although Jeph Loeb's Superman For All Seasons, which inspired Gough and Millar when they created the show, contains an event where a tornado hits Smallville, the pair insist that the tornado idea came from a story they overheard on the radio about a tornado that hit a high school during their prom night. The episode would mark the departure of Eric Johnson as series star Whitney Fordman, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> return as a special guest in seasons two and four.|$|E
5|$|After this turmoil, Severus faced no more {{internal}} threats for {{the rest}} of his reign, and the reign of his successor Caracalla passed uninterrupted for a while until he was murdered by Macrinus, who proclaimed himself emperor. Despite Macrinus having his position ratified by the Roman senate, the troops of Varius Avitus declared him to be emperor instead, and the two met in battle at the Battle of Antioch in 218 AD, in which Macrinus was defeated. However, Avitus himself, after taking the imperial name Elagabalus, was murdered shortly afterwards and Alexander Severus was proclaimed emperor by both the Praetorian Guard and the senate who, after a short reign, was murdered in turn. His murderers were working on behalf of the army who were unhappy with their lot under his rule and who raised in his place Maximinus Thrax. However, just as he had been raised by the army, Maximinus was also brought down by them and despite winning the Battle of Carthage against the senate's newly proclaimed Gordian II, he too was murdered when it appeared to his forces as <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be able to best the next senatorial candidate for the throne, Gordian III.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the two and}} a {{half year}} world tour in support of the albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II, Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash {{returned}} to Los Angeles. He soon sold his home, the Walnut House, and moved to Mulholland Drive. He built a small home studio, nicknamed The Snakepit, over his garage and began working on demos for songs he had written during the tour. Slash worked on the demos with Guns N' Roses bandmate and drummer Matt Sorum. They were later joined by guitarist Gilby Clarke and Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez, jamming and recording most nights. Slash played the demos for Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose who rejected the material, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> later want to use them for the next Guns N' Roses album. They had recorded twelve songs by 1994, the same year that Guns N' Roses went on hiatus.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food <b>though,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
5|$|In November 1947, {{he made a}} {{surprise}} move to Third Division South club Notts County for a British record transfer fee of £20,000. He helped the club to win promotion as champions in 1949–50, before {{he moved on to}} Brentford in March 1952 for a club record £16,000. In January 1953, Brentford appointed him player-manager, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only remain in charge for nine months. He joined Arsenal as a player in November 1953 for £10,000, where he saw out the remainder of his playing career. He had a promising start to his managerial career by leading Kettering Town to the Southern League title in 1956–57, but then only had two more seasons as manager, getting relegated with Notts County in 1957–58 and then relegated with Kettering Town in 1963–64. During the 1970s he struggled with debt and related legal problems, which were reported in the media {{as an example of a}} celebrated person having fallen from grace.|$|E

5|$|Patton {{continued}} playing polo and sailing in this time. After sailing back to Los Angeles {{for extended}} leave in 1937, he was kicked by {{a horse and}} fractured his leg. Patton developed phlebitis from the injury, which nearly killed him. The incident almost forced Patton out of active service, but a six-month administrative assignment in the Academic Department at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley helped him to recover. Patton was promoted to colonel on July 24, 1938 and given command of the 5th Cavalry at Fort Clark, Texas, for six months, a post he relished, but he was reassigned to Fort Myer again in December as commander of the 3rd Cavalry. There, he met Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, who {{was so impressed with}} him that Marshall considered Patton a prime candidate for promotion to general. In peacetime, <b>though,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> remain a colonel to remain eligible to command a regiment.|$|E
5|$|The first match began under a {{cloud of}} Grace-inspired {{controversy}} on Thursday, 20 June at The Oval, where Gloucestershire were beaten by 16 runs. Surrey made 150 (Grace 4–43) and 136 (Grace 6–70), but Gloucestershire's response was 111 (Grace 40) and 159 (Grace 31). This was a fine all-round performance by Grace, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have been happy with two more innings under 50, and it serves to illustrate just how much Gloucestershire depended on him. The next match at Hove began the following Monday, 24 June, and Gloucestershire won by an innings and 67 runs after losing the toss and being asked to field. Sussex were all out for 93 (Grace 0–21) and 71 (Grace 4–13); in between, Gloucestershire made 231 despite Grace scoring a duck. His brothers did the batting in this one, Fred scoring 71 and E. M. 53.|$|E
5|$|<b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{later become}} indelibly {{associated}} with Stoke City, Matthews grew up supporting that club's local rivals Port Vale. His father {{wanted him to}} follow in his footsteps and become a boxer, but Stanley decided {{at the age of}} 13 {{that he wanted to be}} a footballer. After a rigorous training session that made Matthews vomit, his mother, Elizabeth, stood firm and made Jack realise that his son, who had one more year at school, should follow his passion of football. His father conceded that should he be picked for England Schoolboys then he could continue his footballing career; around this time his school football master picked Matthews as an outside-right, rather than as his then-preferred position of centre-half. Matthews played for England Schoolboys against Wales in 1929, in front of around 20,000 spectators at Dean Court, Bournemouth.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} Raw, during Batista's celebratory speech, The Legacy attacked Batista, and injured him in storyline. This storyline {{was used to}} cover a real injury Batista had sustained. Orton's rematch that night, intended to be used despite Batista's absence, The following week, a match was held to determine the new WWE Champion between Orton, Triple H, John Cena and The Big Show, which Orton won. At The Bash pay-per-view, signs of dissention between DiBiase and Orton appeared when DiBiase argued with Orton backstage. Despite this, DiBiase and Rhodes both helped Orton retain his WWE Championship later that night against Triple H. This tension was later expanded upon when DiBiase's father booked Orton and DiBiase in a match on Raw {{while he was in}} charge; Orton won the match but the team showed solidarity later in the same evening by interfering in a WWE Championship contender match between Triple H and Cena, leading to it being ruled a no contest. This made the subsequent match at Night of Champions a triple threat contest. Similar tensions arose briefly in the group late in August when Rhodes' father, Dusty, booked Orton and Rhodes in a match on Raw. It quickly {{turned out to be a}} ruse with Dusty's intention to allow The Legacy to attack Cena, who was special guest referee. Despite the four standing tall together, Orton quickly gave an RKO to Dusty which angered Rhodes <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fall in line.|$|E
