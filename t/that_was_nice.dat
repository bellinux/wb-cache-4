2500|$|Josh Brolin {{discussed}} the Coens' directing style in an interview, {{saying that the}} brothers [...] "only really say {{what needs to be}} said. They don't sit there as directors and manipulate you and go into page after page to try to get you to a certain place. They may come in and say one word or two words, so <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to be around in order to feed the other thing. 'What should I do right now? I'll just watch Ethan go humming to himself and pacing. Maybe that's what I should do, too.|$|E
2500|$|While Andy Travis {{received}} {{his name and}} some personality elements from a cousin of creator Hugh Wilson, he was based primarily on innovative program director Mikel Herrington, who also was {{the inspiration for the}} character Jeff Dugan in the 1978 film FM, written by Ezra Sacks who had worked at KMET. Dr. Johnny Fever was based on a DJ named [...] "Skinny" [...] Bobby Harper at WQXI/790 in Atlanta, Georgia (in 1968). WKRP writer Bill Dial worked with Harper at WQXI, which is considered Dial's inspiration for the show. Coincidentally, Harper had previously worked at Cincinnati AM Top 40 powerhouse WSAI in 1964, before moving to 11 other stations, including seven in Atlanta. In 1997, Bobby Harper told WSB's Condace Pressley, [...] "He went on record as pointing out which ones, including myself, that he based the characters on. [...] was a nice little thing. You know? <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice.</b> I appreciated that." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{you came}} to see me at once. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> of you. You're the very person I wanted to see.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} it so all through life, Paul," [...] he replied. [...] "The things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>nice</b> <b>are</b> rarely good for us. And what do you read now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is, too. It 's all {{lined with}} gween silk, and <b>that</b> <b>'s</b> <b>nicer</b> than old wed cloth," [...] cried Maud, ruffling up like an insulted chicken.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think. It's the law,--just {{the same}} as it was at Mrs. Jennett's. Everything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> does spoil your hand. I'm glad you see so clearly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nettie {{laughed a}} little, almost scornfully. “Now, I don’t know if <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> of you. If you only meant to punish Mr. Palliser it wasn’t.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, boss!" [...] said he, [...] "sponges don't eat people! <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> and sof' {{to tread}} on. A sight better than cuttin' yer {{foot on a}} piece o' coral." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hugh, {{from his}} face, might have feared a still greater complication; so he made, {{as he would}} {{probably}} have said, a jolly lot of this. [...] "Ah, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> of you. And natural. That's all right!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I'd better {{keep the}} plume, as I haven't {{anything}} else <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice,</b> and I'm afraid Emma wouldn't {{like me to}} lend it," [...] added Annette, who <b>was</b> disappointed <b>that</b> Mabel <b>was</b> {{not to be the}} Beauty.|$|R
50|$|Friendly Flynne - Flynne the fox {{tries to}} prove <b>that</b> she <b>is</b> <b>nice.</b>|$|R
60|$|LADY MARY (divinely). Indeed, I often do. Would <b>that</b> I <b>were</b> <b>nicer</b> to everybody.|$|R
6000|$|LADY CICELY. Well, {{what was}} he to do? He wasn't in love with Sir Howard; and he WAS in love with me. So he {{naturally}} offered to swop Sir Howard for me. Don't you think <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> of him, Captain Kearney? ...|$|E
60|$|How pale {{the light}} was at the window! But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice.</b> The fire rose and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was {{the noise of the}} waves. Or the waves were talking among {{themselves}} as they rose and fell.|$|E
60|$|As {{the party}} {{went down the}} great {{staircase}} of Gaunt House, the morning had risen stark and clear over the black trees of the square; the skies were tinged with pink; and the cheeks {{of some of the}} people at the ball,--ah, how ghastly they looked! That admirable and devoted Major above all,--who had been for hours by Lady Clavering's side, ministering to her and feeding her body with everything <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice,</b> and her ear with everything that was sweet and flattering,--oh! what an object he was! The rings round his eyes were of the colour of bistre; those orbs themselves were like the plovers' eggs whereof Lady Clavering and Blanche had each tasted; the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes; and a silver stubble, like an elderly morning dew was glittering on his chin, and alongside the dyed whiskers now limp and out of curl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes he is;--at any rate, if {{you like}} to have him. And of course you will like. Why should you not? He <b>is</b> {{everything}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> and good;--and now he is to be the owner of all the property. What I want to tell you is this; I do not begrudge it to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but he wouldn't care if I were cultivated, Ha is {{like all}} the rest. He would like to joke and laugh. Well, I think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice,</b> too, and I wish I could do it. But I never could, and now I can't try. I suppose he wonders what makes me such a dead weight on you all." ...|$|R
60|$|BELLO: (Satirically) By day {{you will}} souse and bat our smelling underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned {{up and a}} dishclout tied to your tail. Won't <b>that</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice?</b> (He places a ruby ring on her finger) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.|$|R
6000|$|There was one {{wonderful}} little fellow, too, who peeped {{out of the}} top of a {{house built}} of round bricks. He had two big wheels, and one little one, all over teeth, spinning round and round like the wheels in a thrashing-machine; and Tom stood and stared at him, to see {{what he was going to}} make with his machinery. And what do you think he was doing? Brick-making. With his two big wheels he swept together all the mud which floated in the water: all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> in it he put into his stomach and ate; and all the mud he put into the little wheel on his breast, which really was a round hole set with teeth; and there he spun it into a neat hard round brick; and then he took it and stuck it on the top of his house- wall, and set to work to make another. Now was not he a clever little fellow? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it's {{certainly}} carriage exercise," [...] Verrian {{admitted in}} the same spirit, {{if it was a}} drolling spirit. He could not help being amused by the situation in which they had been brought together, through the vigorous promptitude of Miss Macroyd in making the victoria her own, and the easy indifference of Mrs. Westangle as to how they should get to her house. If he had been alone he might have felt the indifference as a slight, but as it was he felt it rather a favor. If Miss Shirley was feeling it a slight, she was too secret or too sweet to let it be known, and he thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> of her. Still, he believed he might recognize the fact without deepening a possible hurt of hers, and he added, with no apparent relevance, [...] "If Mrs. Westangle was not looking for us on this train, she will find that it is the unexpected which happens." ...|$|E
60|$|As soon as Mrs. Lander {{could make}} her way to her state-room, she got into her berth, and began to take the {{different}} remedies for sea-sickness which she had brought with her. Mrs. Milray said <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice,</b> and that now she and Clementina could have a good time. But before {{it came to that}} she had taken pity on a number of lonely young men whom she found on board. She cheered them up by walking round the ship with them; but if any of them continued dull in spite of this, she dropped him, and took another; and before she had been two days out she had gone through with nearly all the lonely young men on the list of cabin passengers. She introduced some of them to Clementina, but at such times as she had them in charge; {{and for the most part}} she left her to Milray. Once, as the girl sat beside him in her steamer-chair, Mrs. Milray shed a wrap on his knees in whirring by on the arm of one of her young men, with some laughed and shouted charge about it.|$|E
60|$|RAINA (touched). <b>That</b> <b>is</b> very <b>nice</b> of you. I see <b>that</b> you <b>are</b> a gentleman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>that</b> would <b>be</b> <b>nice,</b> Dave. But still {{a person}} can't be {{traveling}} all the time," [...] and Jessie's face clouded a trifle.|$|R
50|$|English Translation : My {{heart is}} aching in your love. They <b>are</b> saying <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> ghazal. Your lover, your insult, your poet, your Will.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the time}} came I went down to canvass, and spent, I think, the most wretched {{fortnight}} of my manhood. In the first place, I was subject to a bitter tyranny from grinding vulgar tyrants. They were doing what they could, or {{said that they were}} doing so, to secure me a seat in Parliament, and I was to be in their hands, at any rate, the period of my candidature. On one day both of us, Mr. Maxwell and I, wanted to go out hunting. We proposed to ourselves but the one holiday during this period of intense labour; but I was assured, as was he also, by a publican who was working for us, that if we committed such a crime he and all Beverley would desert us. From morning to evening every day I was taken round the lanes and by-ways of that uninteresting town, canvassing every voter, exposed to the rain, up to my knees in slush, and utterly unable to assume that air of triumphant joy with which a jolly, successful candidate should he invested. At night, every night I had to speak somewhere,--which was bad; and to listen to the speaking of others,--which was much worse. When, on one Sunday, I proposed to go to the Minster Church, I was told that was quite useless, as the Church party were all certain to support Sir Henry! [...] "Indeed," [...] said the publican, my tyrant, [...] "he goes there in a kind of official profession, and you had better not allow yourself to be seen in the same place." [...] So I stayed away and omitted my prayers. No Church of England church in Beverley would on such an occasion have welcomed a Liberal candidate. I felt myself {{to be a kind of}} pariah in the borough, to whom was opposed all that was pretty, and all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice,</b> and all that was--ostensibly--good.|$|E
6000|$|Imagine an old, white, timbered cottage with a {{thatched}} roof, and {{no single}} line about it quite straight. A cottage crazy with age, buried {{up to the}} thatch in sweetbrier, creepers, honeysuckle, and perched high above crossroads. A cottage almost unapproachable for beehives and their bees--an insect for which Clara had an aversion. Imagine on the rough, pebbled approach {{to the door of}} this cottage (and Clara had on thin shoes) a peculiar cradle with a dark-eyed baby that was staring placidly at two bees sleeping on a coverlet made of a rough linen such as Clara had never before seen. Imagine an absolutely naked little girl of three, sitting in a tub of sunlight in the very doorway. Clara had turned swiftly and closed the wicket gate between the pebbled pathway and the mossed steps that led down to where her coachman and her footman were sitting very still, as was the habit of those people. She had perceived at once that she was making no common call. Then, with real courage she had advanced, and, looking down at the little girl with a fearful smile, had tickled the door with the handle of her green parasol. A woman younger than herself, a girl, indeed, appeared in a low doorway. She had often told Stanley since that she would never forget her first sight (she had not yet had another) of Tod's wife. A brown face and black hair, fiery gray eyes, eyes all light, under black lashes, and [...] "such a strange smile;" [...] bare, brown, shapely arms and neck in a shirt of the same rough, creamy linen, and, from under a bright blue skirt, bare, brown, shapely ankles and feet! A voice so soft and deadly that, as Clara said: [...] "What with her eyes, it really gave me the shivers. And, my dear," [...] she had pursued, [...] "white-washed walls, bare brick floors, not a picture, not a curtain, not even a fire-iron. Clean--oh, horribly! They must be the most awful cranks. The only thing I must say <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> was the smell. Sweetbrier, and honey, coffee, and baked apples--really delicious. I must try what I can do with it. But that woman--girl, I suppose she is--stumped me. I'm sure she'd have cut my head off if I'd attempted to open my mouth on ordinary topics. The children were rather ducks; but imagine leaving them about like that amongst the bees. 'Kirsteen!' She looked it. Never again! And Tod I didn't see at all; I suppose he was mooning about amongst his creatures." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{speaking}} of the [...] "Newcomes," [...] one is reminded that its illustrious author was himself a [...] "Punch" [...] artist, and {{would probably have been}} a designer alone, had it not been decreed [...] "that he should paint in colours which will never crack and never need restoration." [...] Everyone knows the story of the rejected illustrator of [...] "Pickwick," [...] whom that and other rebuffs drove permanently to letters. To his death, however, he clung fondly to his pencil. In technique he never attained to certainty or strength, and his genius was too quick and creative--perhaps also too desultory--for finished work, while he was always indifferent to costume and accessory. But many of his sketches for [...] "Vanity Fair," [...] for [...] "Pendennis," [...] for [...] "The Virginians," [...] for [...] "The Rose and the Ring," [...] the Christmas books, and the posthumously published [...] "Orphan of Pimlico," [...] have a vigour of impromptu, and a happy suggestiveness which is better than correct drawing. Often the realisation is almost photographic. Look, for example, at the portrait in [...] "Pendennis" [...] of the dilapidated Major as he crawls downstairs in the dawn after the ball at Gaunt House, and then listen to the inimitable context: [...] "That admirable and devoted Major above all,--who had been for hours by Lady Clavering's side ministering to her and feeding her body with everything <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice,</b> and her ear with everything that was sweet and flattering--oh! what an object he was! The rings round his eyes were of the colour of bistre; those orbs themselves were like the plovers' eggs whereof Lady Clavering and Blanche had each tasted; the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes; and a silver stubble, like an elderly morning dew, was glittering on his chin, and alongside the dyed whiskers, now limp and out of curl." [...] A good deal of this--that fine touch in italics especially--could not possibly be rendered in black and white, and yet how much is indicated, and how thoroughly the whole is felt! One turns to the woodcut from the words, and back again to the words from the woodcut with ever-increasing gratification. Then again, Thackeray's little initial letters are charmingly arch and playful. They seem to throw a shy side-light upon the text, giving, as it were, an additional and confidential hint of the working of the author's mind. To those who, with the present writer, love every tiny scratch and quirk and flourish of the Master's hand, these small but priceless memorials are far beyond the frigid appraising of academics and schools of art.|$|E
30|$|Matt: So with {{my partner}} teacher, we {{collaborate}} around {{other aspects of}} the students, academics or lives, more whole-child stuff. I set up an excellent student work bulletin board in which I was putting up examples of excellent work … and so <b>that’s</b> <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> to see some of their work and get a better whole picture of who they are as a student.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now don't. I {{know how}} it is. I know I'm horribly pretty, and I've been a wonder always for keeping the house going, and doing for them all, and so you fancy me {{everything}} charming, but I do so wish you could really know, as my brothers do, how it takes out of one all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> and sweet, and that people like.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't believe it--don't {{believe a}} word of it," [...] said Mr. Campbell impolitely. [...] "You'll do things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>nice</b> and interesting. You'll get up concerts, and chase people about for autographs and give money your parents give you and that doesn't cost you either time or labour. But you wouldn't do {{anything}} you disliked for the heathen children--you wouldn't make any real sacrifice for them--catch you!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Whedon stated: [...] "The origin comic, though I {{have issues}} with it, CAN pretty much be {{accepted}} as canonical.
