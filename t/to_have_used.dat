5|$|Above the {{entrance}} to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by John Henry Newman. Whately is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> the space as a larder and Newman is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> it for his private prayers — when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Four hundred {{prints were}} sold, {{so many that}} the negatives wore out twice, {{requiring}} the film to be re-shot each time. Two professional actors were paid to appear, and the film is cited as the first film <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> paid actors. The style of shooting and editing would {{bridge the gap between}} the styles of directors Edwin Stanton Porter and D. W. Griffith, and prints have been preserved in both the United States and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Goodwin's sixth book, Team of Rivals {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{and won the}} 2006 Lincoln Prize and the inaugural Book Prize for American History of the New-York Historical Society. US President Barack Obama cited {{it as one of}} his favorite books and was said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> it as a model for constructing his own cabinet. In 2012, a Steven Spielberg film based on the book was released to critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Jarno Trulli {{started the}} race from pole position, but {{eventually}} retired. The race was initially won by championship leader Lucas di Grassi. After di Grassi's car was found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> a modified front wing, the victory was handed to second-placed Jérôme d'Ambrosio. As {{a result of}} the race, Nelson Piquet, Jr. took the lead in the drivers' championship.|$|E

5|$|Police, who {{normally}} {{are not known}} to carry fire extinguishers on duty, appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> almost 25 pieces of fire-fighting equipment on hand {{on the day of}} the self-immolations. The nearest building is 10 minutes away and footage shows that only two police vehicles were at the scene. The flames were put out in less than a minute's time.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative easing {{was widely}} {{used as a}} {{response}} to the financial crises that began in 2007, especially by the United States and the United Kingdom, and, to a lesser extent, the Eurozone.

5|$|Some dinosaurs {{are known}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> gizzard stones like modern birds.

When found in association with fossils, gizzard stones are called gastroliths.|$|E
5|$|The Diolkos {{remained}} reportedly {{in regular}} service {{until at least}} {{the middle of the}} 1st centuryAD, after which no more written references appear. Possibly the trackway was put out of use by Nero's abortive canal works in 67AD. Much later transports of warships across the Isthmus in the late 9th century and around 1150 are assumed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> a route other than the Diolkos due to the extensive time lag.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges wore heavy armor, such as Sugarloaf helms, {{and scale}} armor (made of iron, bronze, horn or horse hoof). They used long two-handed lances called Contus, which they wielded from horses, whom they barded. Their {{military}} was exclusively {{made up of}} cavalry.

5|$|The station had a news cinema (later {{a cartoon}} cinema) {{that showed a}} {{continuous}} programme. The cinema was designed by Alastair Macdonald, son of the Prime Minister Ramsay, and was in operation from 1933 until being demolished in 1981.

5|$|The use of M85S cluster bombs by the Georgians and RBK 250 cluster bombs by the Russians {{resulted}} in civilian casualties. Georgia was reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> cluster munitions twice to hit civilians fleeing via the main escape road and admitted using cluster bombs against Russian troops {{and near the}} Roki Tunnel. Russia denied using cluster bombs.|$|E
5|$|With {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union, Russia {{inherited}} most of its military arsenal including its large complement of MRLs. In recent history, they have been used by Russian forces during the First and Second Chechen Wars and by Armenian and Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh War.

5|$|A {{total of}} 628 CTMS tanks were {{ordered by the}} Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. Of these, a small number were {{delivered}} to Java, {{just in time to}} see combat in the Dutch East Indies campaign following the Japanese invasion in early 1942. 149 from this order were diverted to Australia where they were used for training. 600 CTLS-4TACs and 4TAYs were delivered to China under Lend-Lease after Pearl Harbor. After the war, the Indonesian Army is reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> several captured Dutch vehicles, with the type remaining in Indonesian service until 1949 amidst the Indonesian National Revolution.|$|E
5|$|A {{very similar}} archway {{is found in}} Dieric Bouts's c. 1445 Mary Altarpiece, {{including}} spandrels with warriors. Art historians are unsure which was painted earlier– Christus's Nativity or Bouts's altarpiece. Equally, van der Weyden's arched triptychs were executed {{at roughly the same}} period, but art historians are more certain Rogier's archivolt design set the precedent. Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden, Christus appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> the device to encompass a single scene, incorporating all the main characters within the arch, instead of a linked series of scenes with separate archways.|$|E
5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E
