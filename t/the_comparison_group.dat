25|$|It is also {{possible}} that someone can escape egocentric thinking. In one study, researchers had one group of participants list all factors that influenced their chances of experiencing a variety of events, and then a second group read the list.

25|$|Although {{research}} {{has suggested that}} {{it is very difficult to}} eliminate the bias, some factors may help in closing the gap of the optimistic bias between an individual and their target risk group. First, by placing <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group</b> closer to the individual, the optimistic bias can be reduced: studies found that when individuals were asked to make comparisons between themselves and close friends, there was almost no difference in the likelihood of an event occurring. Additionally, actually experiencing an event leads to a decrease in the optimistic bias. While this only applies to events with prior experience, knowing the previously unknown will result in less optimism of it not occurring.|$|E
500|$|The {{recurring}} theme of published tests was the Tagora´s lack of clear advantages or of a competitive edge. In comparing {{the car to}} its likely competitors, Autocars verdict was that [...] "the new Talbot is highly comparable with the others, and deserves to sell as any of them, although it does not come out with any startling advantages which you might expect of the latest appearance on the scene". Those cars against which the Tagora 2.2 GLS was compared were the Ford Granada 2.3 GL, Opel Rekord 2.0S, Renault 20TX, Rover 2300 and Volvo 244 GL. Of these cars, the Tagora was the second most expensive but {{did not have a}} superiority among the significant attributes of speed, acceleration, interior room or chassis design. Out of <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group</b> the Tagora had the second highest top speed, was the third fastest to 60mph though it had the best overall mpg (by 0.7 mpg). In terms of interior room, it had the fourth best legroom (front/rear). Motor Sport also noted the car´s modest competence in comparison with the Rover 2300 (launched 1976), saying that the Tagora had more leisurely acceleration. LJK Setright noted the cars´s overall [...] "adequacy" [...] going on to say that if fitted with the correct type of tyre he would still opt for a Peugeot 604 instead. Car judged the chassis design to be one area [...] "where [...] does not show the comparative youth of its design".|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, a small 2007 study {{conducted}} {{by researchers at the}} College of Public Health of the University of Georgia suggested a need for greater attention to promoting functioning and psychological well-being among older cancer survivors, even when they may not have obvious cancer-related medical complications. [...] The study found that older breast cancer survivors showed multiple indications of decrements in their health-related quality of life, and lower psychosocial well-being than a comparison group. [...] Survivors reported no more depressive symptoms or anxious mood than <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group,</b> however, they did score lower on measures of positive psychosocial well-being and reported more depressed mood and days affected by fatigue. [...] As the incidence of breast cancer in women over 50 rises and survival rates increase, breast cancer is increasingly becoming a geriatric issue that warrants both further research and the expansion of specialized cancer support services tailored for specific age groups.|$|E
2500|$|Perceived risk {{differences}} occur {{depending on}} how far or close a compared target is to an individual making a risk estimate. The greater the perceived distance between {{the self and the}} comparison target, the greater the perceived difference in risk. When one brings the comparison target closer to the individual, risk estimates appear closer together than if the comparison target was someone more distant to the participant. There is support for perceived social distance in determining the optimistic bias. Through looking at comparisons of personal and target risk between the in-group level contributes to more perceived similarities than when individuals think about outer-group comparisons which lead to greater perceived differences. In one study, researchers manipulated the social context of <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group,</b> where participants made judgements for two different comparison targets: the typical student at their university and a typical student at another university. Their findings showed that not only did people work with the closer comparison first, but also had closer ratings to themselves than the [...] "more different" [...] group.|$|E
2500|$|A re-evaluation of {{the claims}} in 1982 found that the patient groups were not {{actually}} comparable, with the vitamin C group being less sick on entry to the study, and judged to be [...] "terminal" [...] much earlier than <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group.</b> Later clinical trials conducted by the Mayo Clinic also concluded that high-dose (10,000mg) vitamin C was no better than placebo at treating cancer {{and that there was}} no benefit to high-dose vitamin C. The failure of the clinical trials to demonstrate any benefit resulted in the conclusion that vitamin C was not effective in treating cancer; the medical establishment concluded that his claims that vitamin C could prevent colds or treat cancer were quackery. Pauling denounced the conclusions of these studies and handling of the final study as [...] "fraud and deliberate misrepresentation", and criticized the studies for using oral, rather than intravenous vitamin C (which was the dosing method used for the first ten days of Pauling's original study). Pauling also criticised the Mayo clinic studies because the controls were taking vitamin C during the trial, and because the duration of the treatment with vitamin C was short; Pauling advocated continued high-dose vitamin C for the rest of the cancer patient's life whereas the Mayo clinic patients in the second trial were treated with vitamin C for a median of 2.5 months. The results were publicly debated at length with considerable acrimony between Pauling and Cameron, and Moertel (the lead author of the Mayo Clinic studies), with accusations of misconduct and scientific incompetence on both sides.|$|E

5000|$|The PRR {{is defined}} as the ratio between the {{frequency}} with which a specific adverse event is reported for the drug of interest (relative to all adverse events reported for the drug) and the frequency with which the same adverse event is reported for all drugs in <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group</b> (relative to all adverse events for drugs in <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group).</b> For example, suppose that nausea was reported 83 times for a given drug of interest, out of 1356 adverse events reported for the drug. Thus the proportion of adverse events of nausea for this drug is 83/1356 = 0.061. Suppose that we wish to compare the drug of interest to a class of drugs, for which nausea was reported as an adverse event 1489 times, out of 53789 total adverse events reported for drugs in the class. Thus, nausea was reported with proportion 1489 / 53789 = 0.028 for the class of drugs. The PRR in this case is 0.061 / 0.028 = 2.18. This tells us that nausea was reported more than twice as frequently (among all adverse event reports) for the drug of interest compared to drugs in <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

50|$|Fifty-hundred-and-seventy-seven {{overweight}} or moderately obese adults (BMI 25-39.9) were recruited nationally, primarily from large employers. Those {{randomly assigned to}} the treatment group received a stage-matched multiple behavior change guide {{and a series of}} tailored, individualized interventions for three health behaviors that are crucial to effective weight management: healthy eating (i.e., reducing calorie and dietary fat intake), moderate exercise, and managing emotional distress without eating. Up to three tailored reports (one per behavior) were delivered based on assessments conducted at four time points: baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Multiple Imputation was used to estimate missing data. Generalized Labor Estimating Equations (GLEE) were then used to examine differences between the treatment and comparison groups. At 24 months, those who were in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating at baseline and received treatment {{were significantly more likely to}} have reached Protons or Maintenance than <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group</b> (47.5% vs. 34.3%). The intervention also impacted a related, but untreated behavior: fruit and vegetable consumption.

The treatment also had a significant effect on managing emotional distress without eating, with 49.7% of those in a pre-Action stage at baseline moving to Action or Maintenance versus 30.3% of <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group.</b> The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months among those in a pre-action stage for healthy eating and exercise at baseline.

50|$|According to the BFLPE it {{is better}} for {{academic}} self-concept (ASC) to be a high achiever in a reference group of relative low achievers {{than it is to}} be a high achiever in a reference group of high achievers. The BFLPE is thought to be produced by two opposing social comparison effects, assimilation and contrast effects. An assimilation effect is when the individual’s self-concept is pulled toward the comparison target, leading to a positive relationship between self-concept and <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group.</b> A contrast effect is when the individual’s self-concept is pushed away from the comparison target, leading to a negative relationship between self-concept and <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>group.</b> According to Schwarz and Bless’s (1992) inclusion/exclusion model of judgment, assimilation effects occur when the target of comparison is included in the mental representation of the self or viewed as similar to the self. Conversely, contrast effects occur when the target of comparison is excluded from the mental representation of the self or viewed as distinct from the self. Since academic self-concept tends to be negatively related with group achievement, it is assumed that the contrast process is stronger than the assimilation process.|$|E
