5|$|During {{the first}} six decades of the republic, between 1923 and 1983, Turkey {{generally}} adhered to a quasi-statist approach with strict government planning of <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> government-imposed limitations over foreign trade, flow of foreign currency, foreign direct investment and private sector participation in certain fields (such as broadcasting, telecommunications, energy, mining, etc.). However, in 1983, Prime Minister Turgut Özal initiated a series of reforms designed to shift the economy from a statist, insulated system to a more private-sector, market-based model.|$|E

During his term, every province was provided with at least one upper-secondary school. He also became involved in frequent school migrations due to both the war and changing policy.|$|E

5|$|Cheney's most {{immediate}} issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate to cut <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup {{at the height}} of the Cold War. As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics. Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine (1) the {{relationship}} between the roles of <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> managemen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> implementation of government accounting standards; (2) the effects of the roles of local government apparatus in planning <b>and</b> controlling <b>the</b> <b>budgets</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> implementation of government accounting standards on the quality of financial information; and (3) the effect of the roles of the apparatus in planning <b>and</b> controlling <b>the</b> <b>budgets,</b> <b>the</b> implementation of government accounting standards, the quality of financial information on the performance of local governments’sub organizations.

5|$|During {{his tenure}} on Why Don't You?, Davies oversaw the {{production}} of a story that took place in Loch Ness. The story was the precursor for his first freelance children's project: Dark Season. The show, originally called The Adventuresome Three, would feature the Why Don't You? characters in a purely dramatic setting that was influenced by his childhood. He submitted the script {{to the head of the}} BBC's Children's department, Anna Home, and Granada Television. Both companies were interested in producing the show with minor changes: Granada wished to produce it as one six-part serial, as opposed to Davies' plan of two three-part serials; and Home was interested in accepting the show on the condition it included a new cast of characters. He accepted Home's offer, and the show was allocated <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> timeslot of Maid Marian and her Merry Men, which had been put on hiatus the year before.|$|E
5|$|In August 1982, after Mexico had {{announced}} {{its inability to}} service its debt, Argentina approached the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for ﬁnancial assistance, as it too was in serious difficulties. While developments looked positive for a while, an IMF staff team visiting Buenos Aires in August 1983 discovered a variety of problems, particularly a loss of control over wages affecting both <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> external competitiveness, and the program failed. With the peso quickly losing value to inflation, the new Argentine peso argentino was introduced in 1983, with 10,000 old pesos exchanged for each new peso.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament has 20 Standing Committees {{consisting}} of 25 to 71 MEPs each (reflecting the political make-up {{of the whole}} Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to {{be presented to the}} plenary. The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> <b>and</b> urged the Parliament to reject it.|$|E

50|$|The {{accounting}} department {{is responsible for}} <b>the</b> forecasting of <b>budgets</b> <b>and</b> cost performance reports. The difference between the estimated and actual figures is defined as variance.To understand {{the cause of the}} difference, managers need to investigate the questions how the variance differs from last period and what are the causes for not reaching the estimated figures.Analysers consider two types of variances: adverse variance and favourable variance. Adverse variance “exists when the difference between <b>the</b> <b>budgeted</b> <b>and</b> actual figure leads to a lower than expected profit”. Favourable variance “exists when the difference between <b>the</b> <b>budgeted</b> <b>and</b> actual figure leads to a higher than expected profit”. Rather than considering all variances, managers establish criteria to determine which variances are significant to focus on. Management by exception focuses mainly on large adverse variances, to find the areas of business, which deviates from predetermined standards in a negative way.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is quite}} surprising, in a sense, given the {{partisan}} {{nature of the}} Congress. It is not necessarily that these partisans have embraced nonpartisanship as a positive end in itself, however. Rather, <b>the</b> <b>Budget</b> Committees (<b>and</b> especially their leadership and staff) have recognized that a weak CBO (one {{that does not have}} a reputation for objective analysis, and whose conclusions are viewed as partisan) is not in their interest. A weak CBO weakens <b>the</b> <b>Budget</b> Committees, <b>and</b> indeed weakens Congress as a whole in its inevitable battles with <b>the</b> executive over <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> economic policy.|$|R
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> should not be voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill {{would have to be}} approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the Cold War, the {{probability}} of a ground invasion of Switzerland ended, substantially changing Swiss military doctrine and resulting in reduction of both <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> the size of the Swiss Armed Forces. In Armed Forces Reform 95, and its supporting program Defense Guidelines 95, the Air Force retained its basic structure and organization, but became a totally independent service, now called the Swiss Air Force, on 1January 1996. For the first time since its inception, subordination of the counter-air role to the ground support mission ended, and defense of domestic airspace was made its highest priority and primary task.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 2003 over state Attorney General Ben Chandler. Early in his term, Fletcher achieved some savings {{to the state}} by reorganizing the executive branch. He proposed an overhaul to the state tax code in 2004, {{but was unable to}} get it passed through the General Assembly. When Republicans in the state senate insisted on tying the reforms to the state budget, the legislature adjourned without passing either, and the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by Fletcher until 2005, when both <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> the reforms were passed. Later in 2005, Attorney General Greg Stumbo, the state's highest-ranking Democrat, launched an investigation into whether the Fletcher administration's hiring practices violated the state's merit system. A grand jury returned several indictments against members of Fletcher's staff, and eventually against Fletcher himself. Fletcher issued pardons for anyone on his staff implicated in the investigation, but did not pardon himself. Though the investigation was ended by an agreement between Fletcher and Stumbo in late 2006, it continued to overshadow Fletcher's re-election bid in 2007. After turning back a challenge in the Republican primary by former Congresswoman Anne Northup, Fletcher lost the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear. After his term as governor, he returned to the medical field as founder and CEO of Alton Healthcare. He is married and has two grown children.|$|E
