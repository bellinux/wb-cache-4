25|$|Hundreds {{of slaves}} {{stood on the}} shore and, when the small boats put out to get them, they all wanted to get in at once. After the boats were filled to {{capacity}} and beyond, <b>the</b> <b>throng</b> of escaping slaves still ashore {{held on to the}} boats to prevent them from leaving, putting the boats in danger of capsizing. Oarsmen tried beating them on their hands, but the slaves would not let go. The small boats made several trips back and forth to load those who wanted to leave.|$|E
25|$|That year in October, Farrakhan {{convened a}} broad {{coalition}} {{of what he}} and his supporters claim to have been one-million men in Washington, D.C., for the Million Man March. The count however fell far below the hoped-for numbers. The National Park Service estimated that approximately 440,000 were in attendance. Farrakhan threatened to sue the National Park Service because of the low estimate from the Park Police. Farrakhan and other speakers called for black men to renew their commitments to their families and communities. The event was organized by {{a wide variety of}} civil rights and religious organizations and drew men and their sons from across the United States of America. While Farrakhan was the keynote speaker, many distinguished African American intellectuals addressed <b>the</b> <b>throng</b> including: Maya Angelou; Rosa Parks; Martin Luther King III, Cornel West, Jesse Jackson and Benjamin Chavis. In 2005, together with other prominent African Americans such as the New Black Panther Party leader Malik Zulu Shabazz, the activist Al Sharpton, Addis Daniel and others, Farrakhan marked the 10th anniversary of the Million Man March by holding a second gathering, the Millions More Movement, October 14–17 in Washington D.C.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the close}} of a September day in the year 1864, a crowd of {{students}} was collected on the Bowdoin campus near the Thorndike oak. Each class was not only represented, but present almost in its entirety; still, as the college at that time bore upon its rolls only about a hundred names, the reader is not to imagine the assembly as one of remarkable proportions. The several classes, without being grouped as separate bodies, were in a measure distinct, as if their members were drawn together by community of sentiment or interest. The center, of <b>the</b> <b>throng</b> was composed mainly of Sophomores who, to the melody of tin horns, devil's fiddles and watchmen's rattles, {{from time to time}} added vocal effects scarcely less loud and discordant. Next to them stood the open-eyed Freshmen, eagerly appreciative of the novelty of the scene; while most of the upper-class men were ranged along the outer edge or a little apart, and were endeavoring to preserve looks and attitudes of aloofness and indifference. The object of attraction appeared to be a tall, spare man who was standing upon a rude plank-and-barrel rostrum, and, whenever the uproar would permit, launching his remarks in a violent manner at the bystanders. He was apparently some sixty years of age. His head was uncovered, showing his hair thin and streaked with gray. His face was smooth except for a stubbly two days' growth of beard, and was wrinkled and browned by exposure to the weather. Beside him upon the platform rested a dilapidated silk hat which, as well as his suit of rusty black, looked as if it might have been discarded some years before by its former owner. They were not, however, incongruous {{with the rest of his}} attire, since both his dickey above and his shirt below his black stock bore the same signs of poverty and neglect.|$|E
500|$|In response, W. W. Scranton (along with First Sergeant Bartholomew, as Captain Ripple {{was out of}} town) led an {{assembly}} of his own employees and the Citizens' Corps. The Mayor confronted the crowd and urged them to halt, but {{was struck by a}} man, knocked down, and badly injured. Cries went up from the crowd, [...] "The Mayor is killed!" [...] He escaped however, aided by Father Dunn, who was carried away by <b>the</b> <b>throng.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lismore {{is part of}} {{the ancient}} {{district}} of Lorne and is said to lie [...] "in the cockpit" [...] of this territory. In the modern day it {{is at the heart of}} the Lynn of Lorn National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland. The views from Barr Mòr, the island's highest point, are superlative. Although only of modest size, from there [...] "the skyscape is vast and made so not by its emptiness, but by <b>the</b> <b>throng</b> of high and pointed hills lifting out of the glittering seas and islands. Nowhere else on the Highland coast can you enjoy a view of the mountainous mainland to equal this one." ...|$|E

500|$|Joseph {{arrived in}} New York on July 7, 1888, and later that month preached his inaugural Sabbath sermon at Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. The speech {{attracted}} a huge crowd, with over 1,500 men {{crowded into the}} sanctuary, and thousands more outside. The police had to call extra reinforcements to control <b>the</b> <b>throng,</b> and to escort Joseph into the synagogue. Though he had been chosen, in part, for his [...] "fabulous skills as an orator", his speaking style and sermons, which had been so beloved in Europe, did not impress New York audiences. According to Abraham Cahan, [...] "ome of {{the very people who}} drank in his words thirstily in Vilna left the synagogue {{in the middle of his}} sermon here." ...|$|E
500|$|Eventually mounted policemen {{were brought}} in to try to clear the crowds from the pitch, {{including}} PC George Scorey, who was mounted on a horse named [...] "Billie" [...] (some sources spell the name [...] "Billy"). PC Scorey had not actually been on duty that day but answered a call for emergency assistance as <b>the</b> <b>throng</b> of spectators in the stadium grew. [...] Billie the horse was actually grey, but appeared white in the primitive black and white newsreel footage of the era. Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, other horses were also involved, but the [...] "white" [...] horse, as the most visible in the news footage, became the defining image of the day. [...] Officials later stated that the match {{would never have been}} able to start without the actions of PC Scorey.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. {{minister}} in Brazil reported that his birth was heralded [...] "by rockets and artillery, and {{was followed by}} a grand fetê day at court... and by illuminations and displays of various sorts and public rejoicings". As was customary within the House of Braganza, Afonso's birth was a formal event attended by the imperial court. PedroII immediately presented the newborn baby to <b>the</b> <b>throng</b> gathered in the palace, announcing [...] "Gentlemen, it is a prince whom God..."—here he was overcome with emotion and was unable to continue. The birth of a much needed male heir—thus regarded by contemporaries—was met with joy throughout the empire. Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then Baron and later Duke of Caxias) wrote to his father: [...] "No one was happier than I with the news [...] ".|$|E

500|$|The {{first plane}} to land was an L-4 Piper Cub at 0940 6 September, {{bringing}} with it Colonel Murray C. Woodbury, {{the commander of}} the U.S. Army's 871st Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion. Three transports followed, nearly running down some of <b>the</b> <b>throng</b> working on the strip. Another 40 aircraft followed in the afternoon, many containing American and Australian engineers. The 871st followed the next day with its small air-portable bulldozers and graders. They located a site for a new airstrip, which became known as No. 1, the existing one becoming No. 2. The site proved to be an excellent one; an old, dry riverbed with soil largely composed of gravel. A gravel base and steel plank was laid to accommodate the fighters based at Tsili Tsili that were in danger of bogging down when the weather deteriorated. By the end of October there were four airstrips at Nadzab, one of which was [...] long and sealed with bitumen.|$|E
500|$|Thousands {{of people}} had {{gathered}} {{in front of the}} Stonewall, which had opened again, choking Christopher Street until the crowd spilled into adjoining blocks. <b>The</b> <b>throng</b> surrounded buses and cars, harassing the occupants unless they either admitted they were gay or indicated their support for the demonstrators. Sylvia Rivera saw a friend of hers jump on a nearby car trying to drive through; the crowd rocked the car back and forth, terrifying its occupants. Another of Rivera's friends, Marsha P. Johnson, an African-American street queen, climbed a lamppost and dropped a heavy bag onto the hood of a police car, shattering the windshield. As on the previous evening, fires were started in garbage cans throughout the neighborhood. More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Precincts, but after 2:00a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick lines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators, whom the majority of witnesses described as [...] "sissies" [...] or [...] "swishes", the crowd surged to recapture them. Street battling ensued again until 4:00a.m.|$|E
500|$|Reports of the {{assassination}} spread quickly; in his history of the times, Arthur Bryant records the crude delight with which the news was received by hungry workers who had received nothing but woe from Perceval's government. In his prison cell, Cobbett understood their feelings; the shooting had [...] "ridded them of one whom they looked upon as the leader among those whom they thought totally bent on the destruction of their liberties". The scenes outside the Palace of Westminster as [...] Bellingham was taken out for transfer to Newgate were consistent with this mood; Samuel Romilly, the law reformer and MP for Wareham, heard from the assembled crowd [...] "the most savage expressions of joy and exultation... accompanied with regret that others, and particularly the attorney general, had not shared the same fate". <b>The</b> <b>throng</b> surged around the hackney coach carrying Bellingham; many tried to shake his hand, others mounted the coach-box {{and had to be}} beaten off with whips. He was hustled back into the building, and kept there until the disorder had died down sufficiently for him to be moved, with a full military escort.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{academics}} {{have pointed}} to more prosaic causes of the 2011 riots, citing the carnivalesque atmospheres created through the usual uses of urban space. For example, researchers from the University of Birmingham noted that ‘another sound could be heard above the mêlée, that of laughter. Above the bark of police dogs, and behind the masked and hooded faces of <b>the</b> <b>throng,</b> were smiles, laughter, and shrieks of joy.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|Frederici {{stayed home}} with their four {{children}} in North Platte, while he stayed outside the home, hunting, scouting, and building up his acting career in the Wild West show. As Cody began to travel more frequently and to places farther from home, problems over infidelity, real or imagined, began to arise. These concerns grew so great that in 1893, Frederici showed up at his hotel room in Chicago unannounced and was led to [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Cody's suite." [...] Cody mentions in his autobiography that he was [...] "embarrassed by <b>the</b> <b>throng</b> of beautiful ladies" [...] who surrounded him both in the cast and in the audiences, and this trend continued as he became involved {{with more and more}} actresses who were not afraid to show their attraction to him in front of an audience.|$|E
2500|$|The Cane Ridge {{congregation}} urged Stone {{to organize}} a similar event there and in August 1801 the observance there dwarfed those of Logan County, {{with as many as}} 20,000 in attendance. [...] Similar observances in the area also sprang up attracting large crowds to bring the total number of attendees to 100,000 {{by the end of the}} year. [...] The instances of so-called “bodily exercises” became more widespread and dramatic as among the other manifestations of revival fervor, people increasingly exhibited “the jerks”—convulsive or rhythmical motions of the body that continued involuntarily despite attempts to calm them. [...] The noise of the revival could be heard for miles, with many among <b>the</b> <b>throng</b> coming as observers of the spectacle rather than as participants. [...] Because of its size, religious enthusiasm, and widespread national reporting, Cane Ridge came to epitomize the way people understood the Kentucky revivals. [...] But the revivals also continued in the Cumberland region in 1801, increasing in both number and fervor.|$|E
