Inter-vehicle as V 2 V communication is unstable due to high-mobility {{vehicles on the}} roadway. Road-side stations (RSUs) are deployed on the roadside to assist vehicles in Internet connection and obtaining key-related materials. Most key materials for VANETs are mainly to safeguard the propagation information. A reliable propagation of traffic-related information is essential, so that vehicles can travel safely and keep the traffic flowing freely over the roadway. It is a challenge that a vehicle authenticates the incoming <b>traffic</b> <b>notifications</b> of vehicles {{next to each other}} using ad hoc key cryptography. Multi-hop routing in V 2 I mode is hard to achieve directly and timely significant traffic propagation between any two neighboring vehicles. In addition, the deployment of RSUs on each roadside to cover all moving vehicles is impossible. Real-time safety applications always achieve the purpose of accident avoidance and cooperative driving in VANETs. The data propagation in the V 2 V mode without a propagation schedule will induce the problems of communication collision and broadcast storms.|$|E

40|$|Opportunistic {{networks}} (OppNets) are human-centric mobile ad-hoc networks, {{in which}} neither the topology nor the participating nodes are known in advance. Routing is dynamically planned following the store-carry-and-forward paradigm, which {{takes advantage of}} people mobility. This widens the range of communication and supports indirect end-to-end data delivery. But due to individuals’ mobility, OppNets are characterized by frequent communication disruptions and uncertain data delivery. Hence, these networks are mostly used for exchanging small messages like disaster alarms or <b>traffic</b> <b>notifications.</b> Other scenarios that require the exchange of larger data (e. g. video) are still challenging due to the characteristics {{of this kind of}} networks. However, there are still multimedia sharing scenarios where a user might need switching from infrastructural communications to an ad-hoc alternative. Examples are the cases of 1) absence of infrastructural networks in far rural areas, 2) high costs due to roaming or limited data volumes or 3) undesirable censorship by third parties while exchanging sensitive content. Consequently, we target in this thesis a video dissemination scheme in OppNets. For the video delivery problem in the sparse opportunistic networks, we propose a solution with the objective of reducing the video playout delay, so that enabling the recipient to play the video content as soon as possible even if at a low quality. Furthermore, the received video reaches later a higher quality level, ensuring a better viewing experience. The proposed solution encloses three contributions. The first one is given by granulating the videos at the source node into smaller parts, and associating them with unequal redundancy degrees. This is technically based on using the Scalable Video Coding (SVC), which encodes a video into several layers of unequal importance for viewing the content at different quality levels. Layers are routed using the Spray-and-Wait routing protocol, with different redundancy factors for the different layers depending on their importance degree. In this context as well, a video viewing QoE metric is proposed, which takes the values of the perceived video quality, delivery delay and network overhead into consideration, and on a scalable basis. Second, we take advantage of the small units of the Network Abstraction Layer (NAL), which compose SVC layers. NAL units are packetized together under specific size constraints to optimize granularity. Packets sizes are tuned in an adaptive way, with regard to the dynamic network conditions. Each node is enabled to record a history of environmental information regarding the contacts and forwarding opportunities, and use this history to predict future opportunities and optimize the sizes accordingly. Lastly, the receiver (destination) node is pushed into action by reacting to missing data parts in a composite "backward" loss concealment mechanism. So, the receiver asks first for the missing data from other nodes in the network in the form of request-response. Then, since the transmission is concerned with video content, video frame loss error concealment techniques are also exploited at the receiver side. Consequently, we propose to combine the two techniques in the loss concealment mechanism, which is enabled then to react to missing data parts. To study the feasibility and the applicability of the proposed solutions, simulation-driven experiments are performed, and statistical results are collected and analyzed. Consequently, we have got promising results that show the applicability of video dissemination in opportunistic delay tolerant networks, and open the door for a range of possible future works...|$|E

30|$|The {{human body}} {{communication}} (HBC) is {{a technology that}} enables short range data communication using the human body as a medium, like an electrical wire. Thus it removes {{the need for a}} traditional antenna. HBC may be used as a type of data communication in body area network (BAN), while the devices are being in contact with body. One of important issues in BAN is an emergency alarm because it may be closely related to human life. For emergency data communication, the most critical factor is the time constraint. IEEE 802.15. 6 specifies that the emergency alarm for the BAN must be notified in less than 1 [*]sec and must provide prioritization mechanisms for emergency <b>traffic</b> and <b>notification.</b> As one type of BAN, the HBC must follow this recommendation, too. Existing emergency handling methods in BAN are based on the carrier sensing capability on radio frequencies to detect the status of channels. However, PHY protocol in HBC does not provide the carrier sensing. So the previous methods are not well suitable for HBC directly. Additionally, in the environment that the emergency rate is very low, the allocation of dedicated slot(s) for emergency in each superframe is very wasteful. In this work, we proposed specific emergency handling operation for human body communication's medium access control (HBC-MAC) protocol to meet the emergency requirements for BAN. We also showed the optimal number of emergency slots for the various combinations of beacon intervals and emergency rates.|$|R

Thus, we study four different scenarios. In Scenario 1, called RELOAD-dedicated, all the PNs are part of a RELOAD overlay and dedicated ICE-negotiated connections are used for CoAP observation relationships. In Scenario 2, called RELOAD-tunnel, no dedicated connections are set up for CoAP observation relationships. Instead, all notifications from sensors to observers are tunneled across the RELOAD overlay in the payload of RELOAD messages. In Scenario 3, called C/S-dedicated, there is no RELOAD overlay. Instead, a star topology in which all PNs communicate with a central server is used. However, there is still a P 2 P aspect present as dedicated CoAP observation relationships are established in a P 2 P manner directly between the sensors and their observers.

Our dissemination framework is taking into consideration very specific information only available in vehicular networks: the geographical data produced by the navigation system. With its aid, a vehicle's mobility patterns become predictable. This information is exploited to efficiently deliver the content where it is needed. Furthermore, we use the navigation system to automatically filter information which might be relevant to the vehicles. Our framework has been designed and implemented in. NET C# and Microsoft MapPoint. It was tested using a small number of vehicles in the area of Cambridge, UK. Moreover, to prove the correctness of our protocols, we further evaluated it in a large-scale network simulation over a number of realistic vehicular trace-based scenarios. Finally, we built a test-case application aiming to prove that vehicles can gain from such a framework. In this application every vehicle collects and disseminates road traffic information. Vehicles that receive this information can individually evaluate the traffic conditions and take an alternative route, if needed. To evaluate this approach, we collaborated with UCLA's Network Research Lab (NRL), to build a simulator that combines network and dynamic mobility emulation simultaneously. When our dissemination framework is used, the drivers can considerably reduce their trip-times. ...|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity data is {{characterized}} by its cross-disciplinary character, the extremely broad range of data types and structures, and the plethora of different data sources providing resources for the same piece of information in a heterogeneous way. Since the web inception two decades ago, there are multiple initiatives to connect, aggregate, share, and publish biodiversity data, and to establish data and work flows in order to analyze them. The European program LifeWatch aims at establishing a distributed network of nodes implementing virtual research environment in Europe to facilitate the work of biodiversity researchers and managers. LifeWatchGreece {{is one of these}} nodes where a portal was developed offering access to a suite of virtual laboratories and e-services. Despite its strict definition in information technology, in practice "portal" is a fairly broad term that embraces many web architectures. In the biodiversity domain, the term "portal" is usually used to indicate either a web site that provides access to a single or an aggregation of data repositories (like: [URL] [URL] [URL] a web site that gathers information about various online biodiversity tools (like [URL] [URL] or a web site that just gathers information and news about the biodiversity domain (like [URL] LifeWatchGreece's portal takes the concept of a portal a step further. In strict IT terms, LifeWatchGreece's portal is partly a portal, partly a platform and partly an aggregator. It includes a number of biodiversity-related web tools integrated into a centrally-controlled software ecosystem. This ecosystem includes subsystems for access control, <b>traffic</b> monitoring, user <b>notifications</b> and web tool management. These subsystems are shared to all the web tools that have been integrated to the portal and thereby are part of this ecosystem. These web tools do not consist in external and completely independent web applications as it happens in most other portals. A quite obvious (to the user) indication of this is the Single-Sign-On (SSO) functionality for all tools and the common user interface wrapper that most of these tools use. Another example of a less obvious functionality is the common user profile that is shared and can be utilized by all tools (e. g user's timezone) ...|$|R
