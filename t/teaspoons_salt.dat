To complement the tube well profiles, the monitors visited each household that owned the monitored tube wells and asked about the number of family members, the monthly household income, and the amount of salt added while eating three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) as well as added while cooking. The households were asked how much they consumed salt during a onetime survey period of three consecutive days, from Wednesday to Friday, to include both weekdays (Wednesday and Thursday) and a weekend day (Friday). Salt for cooking was measured in teaspoons, and for consistency in measurement the monitors carried the same <b>teaspoon</b> for reference. <b>Salt</b> added while eating was measured in pinches. All the households used unrefined salt (Khola labon) for both cooking salt and table salt. The weight of one <b>teaspoon</b> <b>salt</b> measured with an electronic scale was equivalent to 6 – 8  g. To convert the salt amounts into grams, 7  g was counted as one <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>salt</b> and 0.6  g was counted as one pinch of salt.

40|$|The {{flavor and}} texture of the final meat, poultry, or game product depends on how the meat is handled {{following}} slaughter. If you slaughter your own meat, contact your county Extension educator for information. Use only meat from healthy, disease-free animals. The meat should be chilled without delay to 40 degrees F (or lower to prevent spoilage. To hold longer than a few days, freeze at 0 degrees F or lower until canning time. Rinse poultry thoroughly in cold water and drain. Handle meat rapidly and keep everything that touches the meat clean. Debone red meats. Trim off all gristle, bruised spots, and excess fat before canning. Any fat left on the meat may affect sealing. Meat, poultry, and game are low-acid foods and must be processed in a pressure canner at 10 to 15 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi) for safety. See Tables 1, 2, and 3 for processing times for all meat types and stock. Meat can be packed either raw or cooked. Pack meat loosely into clean canning jars. Keep precooked meat hot while packing and cover with boiling liquid. Salt adds flavor, but is not necessary for preservation. When ready to serve, boil canned meat and poultry 10 minutes before you taste it—even if it looks and smells all right. If {{this is your first}} time canning, it is suggested that you read “Canning Basics ” for instructions on filling and processing recommendations. Poultry, Rabbit, or Squirrel Choose freshly killed and dressed, healthy animals. Large chickens are more flavorful than fryers. Dressed poultry should be chilled for 6 to 12 hours before canning. Dressed rabbits or squirrels should be soaked 1 hour in water containing 1 tablespoon of salt per quart, then rinsed. Remove excess fat. Cut the poultry, rabbit, or squirrel into suitable sizes for canning. Can with or without bones. Hot Pack Boil, steam, or bake meat until about two-thirds done.

40|$|It {{has been}} said that two people can sleep in thesame bed but have {{different}} dreams. The samephenomenon is sometimes seen when the same data are observed by two people who come to opposite conclusions as to their meaning. A case in point is the contrast in evaluating the implications of the INTERSALT study, 1 as voiced by two figures well known in international research on hypertension. Dr. Simpson of New Zealand writes as follows: " [...] . the INTERSALT data on the slope of blood pressure with age in relation to sodium intake are unique and more encouraging to the idea that salt is important. " 2 But Dr. Swales of England has written: "Salt has only small importance in hypertension. " 3 Two words have been italicized in this latter quotation, "small " and "hypertension, " since they provide a clue that helps explain what I judge to be an erroneous interpreta-tion of INTERSALT and of the whole issue of salt and blood pressure. The error arises from the impos-ing of a strictly clinical approach when the question under study is about implications for the population. Patients and Populations A clinician, observing a patient in his or her office, will note that the blood pressure may change 2, 3, 5, or even 10 mm Hg from one measurement to the next. The clinician will, understandably, call such differences small in magnitude and unimportant for health. But is it appropriate to look at findings on populations, such as in the INTERSALT study, 1 in the same way? The INTERSALT data indicate that if a population, on average, had a daily sodium intake lower by 100 mmol (about 1 <b>teaspoon</b> <b>salt),</b> average population systolic blood pressure would be lower by 2 - 3 mm Hg (Table 1). If other relevant aspects of lifestyle were improved in the population (higher potassium intake so that the sodium/potassium ratio was 1 instead of 3 as observed in INTERSALT, average weight lower by about 6 kg [13 lb], and excess alcohol avoided), then population average systolic pressure could be lower by at least 5 mm Hg. Is this difference really small when applied not to the vari-ations of blood pressure of a patient but to a poten-tially lower average blood pressure in a population...|$|R
50|$|Salt water {{mouth wash}} {{is made by}} {{dissolving}} 0.5-1 <b>teaspoon</b> of table <b>salt</b> into a cup of water, which is as hot as possible without causing discomfort in the mouth. Saline has a mechanical cleansing action and an antiseptic action {{as it is a}} hypertonic solution in relation to bacteria, which undergo lysis. The heat of the solution produces a therapeutic increase in blood flow (hyperemia) to the surgical site, promoting healing. Hot salt water mouthwashes also encourage the draining of pus from dental abscesses. Conversely, if heat is applied {{on the side of the}} face (e.g., hot water bottle) rather than inside the mouth, it may cause a dental abscess to drain extra-orally, which is later associated with an area of fibrosis on the face (see cutaneous sinus of dental origin). Gargling with salt water is said to reduce the symptoms of a sore throat.|$|R
40|$|Health experts {{recommend}} widespread reduction in salt/sodium, along with adequate intakes of foods high potassium, to prevent hypertension {{and reduce the}} risk of heart disease. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and other expert groups recommend that adults and children reduce their sodium intake to less than 2, 300 milligrams of sodium a day (1 <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>salt</b> has about 2, 400 milligrams of sodium). Further reductions to 1, 500 milligrams or less per day are recommended for older adults (51 and older), African Americans of any age, and individuals with high blood pressure, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended a combination of food product reformulation, labeling improvements and education to help Americans reduce their sodium intakes. Stricter regulations of sodium content for foods served in restaurants and processed foods from grocery stores have not been forthcoming, but some companies have announced voluntary steps to reduce sodium in foods and menu items as part of a voluntary collaboration known as that National Salt Reduction Initiative (NSRI) which is coordinated by the New York City Health Department.

Design: A cross sectional school-based study was conducted on children aged between 8 - 11 year in two rural and two urban areas of Kabul. Patients and Methods: Four hundred children were enrolled for the study and were examined for clinical and sub-clinical iodine deficiency. Children {{were also asked to}} bring a <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>salt</b> from their homes which was tested by rapid iodine spot test to determine the type of salt used. Results: About 12 % of the children had grade-I goiter. The prevalence of goiter was higher in rural children (16. 5 %) than that of the urban children (7. 5 %). Similarly, {{the prevalence of}} goiter was higher in girls (15. 2 %) than in the boys (10. 5 %). The prevalence of sub-clinical iodine deficiency assessed by urinary iodine levels revealed that 68. 3 % of the children had mild to severe iodine deficiency.

Similarly, girls had higher prevalence of sub-clinical iodine deficiency (73. 2 %) than boys (66. 4 %).
