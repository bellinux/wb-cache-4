An Automated Dental Office Management System is an integrated system of programs for in-office use by a single dentist, or collectively by a small dental group. The system combines and interrelates the various business operations of a dental practice. A general information program maintains patient records and history and includes a recall procedure for automatically notifying patients {{when they should be}} reseen in the office. An appointment scheduling program maintains the total office's appointment schedule and schedules appointments by choice of day, time or first availability. A daily <b>transaction</b> <b>journal</b> is maintained by a patient accounting program which provides all services required for patient billing. (See more in text. ...|$|E

40|$|Understanding and {{learning}} accounting {{should be done}} in a systematic, gradual, perseverant and precision way, because accounting consists of complex concept, analysis and skills. Accounting should be studied systematically because it has the sequential inter-related material i. e. started from the identification of the account name of an existing transaction which {{can be seen in the}} <b>transaction,</b> <b>journal,</b> general ledger, balance sheet, adjustment, work sheets, preparation of financial statements, closing entry, posting adjustment and closing journals to ledgers, trial balance after closing, and  ended with the journal inverting. To obtain the optimal learning achievement of accounting, accounting students must study thoroughly about the concepts of accounting, as well as trying to understand the relationships among the concepts of accounting, because accounting concepts are related to each other. This research would test the use of maps concept as an alternative media to learn the basic concepts, especially on accounting classification account. The population was also the subject of this research,  they were the 1 st semester students  of S 1 Accounting Program, Economics Faculty, UNNES in the academic year of  2010 / 2011. There were 2 classes, the first class was the control class and second class was the experimental class. The control class used the conventional methods in the learning process on the other hand; the experiment class used maps concept in the learning process. The results showed that in experimental class which used maps concept as the media to learn the accounting classification of accounts proved to be more effective than the control class that did not use maps concept as the media in the learning process.  </em...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a bibliometric assessment of Canadian {{institutions in the}} discipline of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from 1996 to 2006. The paper {{is a first step}} in identifying the top institutions over a 10 -year period in Canada. The rankings are calculated using three metrics: (1) simple count of papers, (2) journal impact factors, and (3) journal impact factor of each institution normalized by its faculty size. The venues/journals considered are 71 flagship IEEE <b>Transaction</b> <b>journals</b> in different areas of ECE which are perceived as the most prestigious venues in the discipline. Using the three metrics, the top-ranked institutions are identified as: the University of Waterloo (by two metrics), and Queen’s University’s (by one metric). Our study also reveals other interesting results, such as: (1) Researchers from the universities of Waterloo and Toronto, combined, authored about a third of all the Canadian papers published in the IEEE <b>Transaction</b> <b>journals</b> during the time period under study (691 of 2, 540 papers). (2) Canadian provinces have different levels of ECE research productivity and efficiency, and (3) ECE ranking of the Canadian institutions has similarities and differences versus a recently-published software engineering ranking of the same institutions. While this study is in the context of Canadian ECE institutions, our approach can be easily adapted to rank the institutions of any other nation and/or in any other discipline. </p...|$|R
