5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days' notice.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} co-written by Nanase Ohkawa and Junichi Fujisaku, who also {{worked on the}} series. According to Fujisaku, the {{narrative}} of The Last Dark focused on Saya both seeking revenge and searching for purpose after discovering she was being used by cruel humans. The process of writing The Last Dark ran parallel to Blood-C, and as Ohkawa was preoccupied with the series, Fujisaku put together a basic story and script draft which he expanded and adjusted based on Shiotani's desires for the movie. When Ohkawa, she and Fujisaku together worked to write and polish the final script. Saya's relationships with others despite her non-human status formed {{a key part of}} the movie's themes. According to Ohkawa, one of her main issues was keeping the storytelling as <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> possible within the movie's planned runtime, meaning that some elements of Saya's backstory needed to be cut. While the series took place in a fictional location, the movie used the real-world location of Tokyo, so Ohkawa took extra care to insert realistic details into the script. She found it difficult accommodating the wishes of both Shiotani and Fujisaku's ideas alongside her own in the script.|$|E

25|$|Materials {{are limited}} to ductile {{materials}} because the threads are cold formed. However, this increases the thread's yield strength, surface finish, hardness, and wear resistance. Also, materials with good deformation characteristics are necessary for rolling; these materials include softer (more ductile) metals and exclude brittle materials, such as cast iron. Tolerances are typically ±0.001in. (±0.025mm), but tolerances as <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> ±0.0006in (±0.015mm) are achievable. Surface finishes range from 6 to 32 micro-inches.|$|E

25|$|With the NBA {{struggling}} {{financially and}} down to just 8 teams Nationals owner during the 1954–55 season, Danny Biasone suggested the league {{limit the amount of}} time taken for a shot thus speeding up a game that often ended with long periods of teams just holding the ball and playing keep away. Biasone and Nats general manager Leo Ferris calculated a 24-second shot clock would allow at least 30 shots per quarter speeding up the game and increasing scoring. The Shot Clock was an instant success as scoring was up 14 points per game league wide. In the first season of the shot clock the Nats would take first place in the East with a 43–29 record. After a first round bye the Nats would beat the Boston Celtics in 4 games to reach the NBA Finals for the 2nd straight season. In the finals the Nats would get off to a fast start, led by forward Dolph Schayes, taking the first 2 games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons. However, as the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all 3 games to take a 3–2 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nats kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109–104 to force a 7th game at home. Game 7 would be as <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nats a 92–91 lead in the final seconds. King would then steal the inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals.|$|E

25|$|Thursday {{qualifying}} {{was held}} in similar weather conditions to practice, but {{was interrupted by a}} brief shower of rain close {{to the end of the}} session. Alesi carried his form over from free practice, nudging the crash barriers lining the circuit on more than one occasion to set a provisional pole position time of 1:23.754. Berger was also impressive, power-sliding through Casino Square, to the delight of the crowd, on his way to the third-fastest time, although he complained that Alesi had held him up on what he thought would have been his quickest lap of the session. The form of the Ferraris came as something of a surprise, as the 41T2's unique V12 engine configuration theoretically produced less torque than its rivals, a disadvantage on a circuit as <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> Monaco. Alesi said that he believed the results of the session were due to the extreme effort that he and Berger were putting into their driving overcoming any deficiencies with the car. The Ferraris were split by Schumacher, who felt that the rain shower had prevented him from fulfilling his potential, as he did not complete his full quota of 12laps as a result of the track conditions becoming slower. His teammate, Herbert, took provisional sixthplace. Of the Williams drivers, Hill was fourth, but Coulthard admitted that he was still learning the track on his way to 11th, 2.8seconds slower than Alesi's best. Häkkinen continued McLaren's promising form with a provisional fifthplace, but was fined $10,000 for ignoring yellow flags during the season. Blundell was back in eighth after crashing into the barriers in the closing minutes of the session.|$|E

500|$|One of the Englishmen {{who came}} to the area was Charles Gadsden of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire.

500|$|Most of the {{arrangements}} were developed through extensive jamming, with Cox's and Miles' playing influencing Hendrix's ideas. [...] According to biographer Keith Shadwick, Cox explained in later interviews, [...] "the process {{was based on}} building up rhythm patterns and that each pattern dictated the shape and character of {{a portion of a}} song in which it appeared". [...] Record producer Alan Douglas witnessed the approach during a jam at the Record Plant and saw it as inefficient. On the other hand, Shadwick feels that it was necessary: [...] "it seemed the only way available, especially as neither Cox nor Miles, in particular, were exactly swift on the musical uptake". [...] Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray noted, [...] "Cox's funky, uncluttered bass style would give Hendrix's new music a more solid, less frenetic underpinning [...] [...] In every way, Cox's function would be to provide the steadiness Hendrix so urgently required". [...] Soft Machine drummer Robert Wyatt described Miles' style as [...] "pleasantly messy... He wasn't as <b>tight</b> <b>as</b> a Stax drummer ... his rolls would clatter about a bit". [...] However, his often described [...] "fatback grooves" [...] lay down a solid rhythmic foundation and the combination of Cox and Miles adds a [...] "heavy, rolling fluidity which brings out a very different dimension in Hendrix's playing".|$|E

He commented that the group's [...] "yearning anthemic reach" [...] and [...] "obvious, slinky pop charm" [...] are replaced with [...] "darker corners, more disruptive interjections, more moodiness". Paul Du Noyer of Q gave Zooropa a score of four-out-of-five stars, finding a [...] "freewheeling feel of going with the flow" [...] throughout the album and calling it [...] "rootless and loose, restless and unsettled".

30|$|In this article, {{tight oil}} and gas {{accumulation}} refers to that occurring in low-permeability reservoirs that are not source rocks or shale, which primarily includes petroleum accumulations in tight sandstone and tight carbonate reservoirs. Accordingly, such reservoirs are known <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> reservoirs. Two models were proposed to interpret hydrocarbon accumulations in such <b>tight</b> reservoirs <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> sandstones, which are: (1) the deep-basin or basin-centered gas model, {{also known as the}} continuous accumulation model; and (2) the conventional trap-controlled accumulation model. Recently, Zhao et al. (2012 a, 2013, 2016 a) proposed a new model termed quasi-continuous accumulation and demonstrated that tight {{oil and gas}} are dominated by quasi-continuous accumulation, while discontinuous (conventional trap-controlled) accumulations are of subordinate importance. Zhao et al. (2016 a) also argued that the so-called continuous (basin-centered) accumulations actually do not exist in non-source-rock <b>tight</b> reservoirs such <b>as</b> <b>tight</b> sandstones. Hence, two types of hydrocarbon accumulations can be caused in tight petroleum systems, namely the quasi-continuous accumulation and discontinuous accumulation.|$|R
