50|$|When {{engineering}} is undertaken using a SIM {{it can be}} stored in a digital format whereby a 1:1 mapping is undertaken. Operations such as <b>test,</b> <b>calibration,</b> inspection, repair, minor change and isolation can be defined and scheduled within the SIM. The SIM data can also be conveniently exported and input into other third party asset management applications to comply with the owners' asset management strategy. In addition, the SIM can act as a training tool, which can be used regularly to assist operators to become familiar with the design.|$|E

Although extensive pre-installation laboratory tests were conducted, they were generic in nature. Unfortunately the degree of gage-rock contact has a strong influence on gage sensitivity and cannot be predicted before installation. This report discusses the results of removing a cylindrical section of rock and gages as a unit through overcoring and the subsequent post test calibrations of the stressmeters in the laboratory. With {{the assumption that the}} gage-rock contact was not disturbed by the overcoring, the results from these calibrations compensate for varying gage-rock contact.

50|$|ISO/IEC 17025 General {{requirements}} for the competence of <b>testing</b> and <b>calibration</b> laboratories is the main ISO standard used by <b>testing</b> and <b>calibration</b> laboratories. In most major countries, ISO/IEC 17025 is the standard for which most labs must hold accreditation {{in order to be}} deemed technically competent. In many cases, suppliers and regulatory authorities will not accept <b>test</b> or <b>calibration</b> results from a lab that is not accredited. Originally known as ISO/IEC Guide 25, ISO/IEC 17025 was initially issued by the International Organization for Standardization in 1999. There are many commonalities with the ISO 9000 standard, but ISO/IEC 17025 is more specific in {{requirements for}} competence, and applies directly to those organizations that produce <b>testing</b> and <b>calibration</b> results. Since its initial release, a second release was made in 2005 after it was agreed that it needed to have its quality system words more closely aligned with the 2000 version of ISO 9001.|$|R

40|$|This paper briefly {{describes}} {{efforts at}} determining buckling loads of slender concrete-filled tube beam-columns. Although utilizing state-of-the-art equipment and controllers, unexpected difficulties were encountered on extracting buckling loads for the specimens due to (a) frictional {{forces in the}} actuators, (b) large initial bidirectional imperfections, (c) initial stresses due to construction and (d) correlating data from different sensors. In addition, the complex load histories used required {{that all of these}} phenomena be carefully accounted for in all the simulation studies. Successful extraction of buckling loads required that behavior of the loading system be characterized through integration of data from different sensors and simulations using stiffness and displacements obtained directly from the <b>test.</b> <b>Calibration</b> of advanced simulation tools well into the late stages of the load history have also been preliminary documented...|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} amount of geoscientific and reservoir engineering data have been collected from the Zunil geothermal field since 1973.

40|$|Shot peening is an {{effective}} method of improving fatigue performance of machine parts in the industry by producing a thin surface layer of compressive residual stresses that prevents crack initiation and retards crack growth during service. Nondestructive evaluation of the prevailing compressive residual stresses in the shallow subsurface layer is realized by the critically refracted longitudinal (Lcr) waves. This paper presents experimental data obtained on SMAT (surface mechanical attrition treatment) steel alloy S 355 sample. Comparative travel-time shows that there are statistically significant differences in treated and untreated specimen. With knowledge of the acoustoelastic constants which are obtained by a <b>test</b> <b>calibration,</b> the experimental data indicates that compressive residual stresses are distributed near subsurface (hundreds of micron). These stress {{results show that the}} Lcr technique is efficient for evaluation of residual stresses after the surface treatment...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} {{automatically}} calibrating force balances is provided. The invention uses a reference balance {{aligned with the}} balance being calibrated to provide superior accuracy while minimizing {{the time required to}} complete the calibration. The reference balance and the test balance are rigidly attached together with closely aligned moment centers. Loads placed on the system equally effect each balance, and the differences in the readings of the two balances can be used to generate the calibration matrix for the test balance. Since the accuracy of the <b>test</b> <b>calibration</b> is determined by the accuracy of the reference balance and current technology allows for reference balances to be calibrated to within +/- 0. 05 % the entire system has an accuracy of +/- 0. 2 %. The entire apparatus is relatively small and can be mounted on a movable base for easy transport between test locations. The system can also accept a wide variety of reference balances, thus allowing calibration under diverse load and size requirements...|$|E
