5000|$|One such {{example is}} the People's Republic of China, which issues the non-passport Chinese <b>Travel</b> <b>Document</b> to its {{nationals}} under certain circumstances.

Under other circumstances such as a Chinese citizen studying or working abroad, the Chinese embassies or consulates will issue passports if requested.
