5|$|The 2006 FIFA World Cup {{qualification}} process and 2005 UNCAF Nations Cup (hosted in Guatemala) were both huge disasters for El Salvador. In the former {{they received a}} by to the second round where they inched past Bermuda 4–3 on aggregate (2–1, 2–2). In the third round they were drawn into a home–and–away round–robin group with Jamaica, Panama, and the United States. El Salvador finished last in the group with just 4 points from 6 games. In the 2005 UNCAF Nations Cup they failed to advance past the first round after losing against Panama 0–1 and Costa Rica 1–2. <b>This</b> <b>mean</b> they also failed {{to qualify for the}} 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup. They were coached by Carlos Cavagnaro.|$|E

25|$|The Swedish law {{protected}} {{women from}} the authority of their husbands by transferring the authority to their male relatives. A wife's property and land also could not {{be taken by the}} husband without her family's consent but neither could the wife. <b>This</b> <b>mean</b> a woman could not transfer her property to her husband without her family or kinsman's consent either. In Swedish law, women would also only get half that of her brother in inheritance. Despite these legal issues, Sweden was largely ahead and much superior in their treatment towards women than most European countries.|$|E

At first it had been believed that {{this would not be}} a serious problem, and that it could be addressed by developing a calibration table for each site. But even the very first tests demonstrated that the calibration changed with wavelength. <b>This</b> <b>mean</b> that they would either have to make multiple calibration tables, one for each wavelength, or that if a single table of corrections for different bearings was desired, the antennas would have to be moved vertically as the wavelength was changed.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea is that}} if each spin is {{connected}} to {{a large number of}} spins, only the average ratio of + spins to − spins is important, since the fluctuations about <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> will be small. The mean field H is the average fraction of spins which are + minus the average fraction of spins which are−. The energy cost of flipping a single spin in the mean field H is ±2JNH. It is convenient to redefine J to absorb the factor N, so that the limit N → ∞ is smooth. In terms of the new J, the energy cost for flipping a spin is ±2JH.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} metals in their solid state {{helps to explain}} the unusually high {{electrical}} conductivity of copper. In a copper atom, the outermost 4s energy zone, or conduction band, is only half filled, so many electrons are able to carry electric current. When an electric field is applied to a copper wire, the conduction of electrons accelerates towards the electropositive end, thereby creating a current. These electrons encounter resistance to their passage by colliding with impurity atoms, vacancies, lattice ions, and imperfections. The average distance travelled between collisions, defined as the “mean free path,” is inversely proportional to the resistivity of the metal. What is unique about copper is its long mean free path (approximately 100 atomic spacings at room temperature). <b>This</b> <b>mean</b> free path increases rapidly as copper is chilled.|$|E

25|$|Direct rule {{deliberately}} removed traditional {{power structures}} {{in order to}} implement uniformity across a region. The desire for regional homogeneity was {{the driving force behind}} the French colonial doctrine of Assimilation. The French style of colonialism stemmed from the idea that the French Republic was a symbol of universal equality. As part of a civilizing mission, the European principles of equality were translated into legislation abroad. For the French colonies, <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> the enforcement of the French penal code, the right to send a representative to parliament, and imposition of tariff laws as a form of economic assimilation. Requiring natives to assimilate in these and other ways, created an ubiquitous, European-style identity that made no attempt to protect native identities. Indigenous people living in colonized societies were obliged to obey European laws and customs or be deemed “uncivilized” and denied access to any European rights.|$|E
25|$|On 10 January 2013, the Viterbo court {{decided to}} {{transfer}} the case for judgement directly to the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court ruled on 20 June 2013, that the Chamber of Deputies decree having extended Berlusconi's immunity beyond what was provided for by the constitution, was a case with conflict of powers and should be disregarded. <b>This</b> <b>mean</b> that Berlusconi does not enjoy any special immunity protection for his spoken words during election campaigns, and that a court case now shall be held by the constitutional court, to decide {{the merits of the}} case. Before the case against Berlusconi can begin, the Italian Chamber of Deputies however shall be called for trial to defend and explain the reasons for passing their unconstitutional law from 2010. The court hearing against the Chamber of Deputies took place on 8 July 2014, where the constitutional court was asked to deem the concerned Chamber of Deputies decree to be unconstitutional and annul it, by the Court of Rome and the Viterbo court. On 18 July 2014, the Constitutional Court indeed ruled the decree to be unconstitutional and annulled it; meaning that the civil court proceedings against Berlusconi now can continue.|$|E

[...] She is impatient in getting what she wants, for example snapping at a judge to [...] "hurry up" [...] as he read a verdict. [...] She frequently announces that she is uninterested in proceedings that don't affect her personally. As her co-counsel questions a witness in court, Ling objects to the judge, [...] "I'm bored!

At this time the horizontal protection was revised after full-scale trials revealed that a [...] bomb would penetrate both a [...] upper deck and a [...] middle deck to burst on the main armor deck. So the middle deck was thickened to [...] with the lower deck intended to catch any splinters penetrating the armor deck. <b>This</b> <b>mean</b> that the main belt had to be extended upwards to meet the main armor deck at a significant penalty in weight. The Defense Committee approved the sketch design on 13 July 1939, but the detailed design was not approved until 12 April 1940, after construction had already begun {{on the first two}} ships.|$|E

500|$|As well as {{the scale}} of the response, critics {{questioned}} the criteria against which patients were selected for evacuation. At first the UK was challenged over its decision to include only children in the transports while tens of thousands of adults remained wounded in the city. Sylvana Foa, spokesperson for the UNHCR, commented that Sarajevo should not be regarded as a [...] "supermarket" [...] of photogenic potential refugees, asking [...] "Does <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> Britain only wants to help children? Maybe it only wants children under six, or blond children, or blue-eyed children?" [...] Patrick Peillod, head of the United Nations medical evacuation committee, said that the UK had treated Bosnian children [...] "like animals in a zoo" [...] and was trying to pick and choose evacuees to suit a public relations agenda. When the government revised its approach and included adults on flights out of the city, claims were made that wounded combatants had been among those taken to the UK, Sweden, and Italy, and that patients had paid bribes {{to be included in the}} transports.|$|E

The Sunday Mirrors Ian Hyland rated the song {{nine out of}} ten stars and described it as [...] "ure class from the ever-smiling teens". According to AllMusic's Dean Carlson, [...] "Soul Sound" [...] is a representation that [...] "the jitters of youth are [...] though tempered by shrewd ambition and a clever and unpredictable production aesthetic". John Mulvey of NME stated that while the song lacked the quality of the trio's debut single [...] "Overload", it [...] "is pretty good nevertheless". He elaborated, [...] "the best thing about Sugababes is how they sound like they really can't be arsed with anything, let alone any of this pop star business [...] Enough with the dance routines and shit-eating grins – does <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> total lack of enthusiasm's the way forward for teen pop?" [...] Stylus Magazine writer Scott Plagenhoef described the single as [...] "marvelous lilting [...] hopeful", while Stephen Robinson from Hot Press was less favourable and criticised the song's pop-rock experimentation, which according to him [...] "doesn't work quite so well". Neil Western of the South China Morning Post felt that [...] "Soul Sound", along with the album's title track, [...] "lack sparkle".|$|E
500|$|Under {{the heading}} [...] "Transcendental Mediocrity", Jim Miller of Rolling Stone called Dark Horse a [...] "disastrous album" [...] {{to match the}} [...] "disastrous tour", and a [...] "shoddy piece of work". According to Miller, the musicians were [...] "merely {{competent}} studio pros" [...] and Harrison's guitar playing was [...] "rudimentary". In contrast with the praise that the same publication had lavished on Harrison for Living in the Material World the year before, Rolling Stones reviewer described Dark Horse as a [...] "chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver new 'LP product'", and stated: [...] "In plain point of fact, George Harrison {{has never been a}} great artist... the question becomes whether he will ever again become a competent entertainer." [...] The NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Harrison's songwriting, production and vocals, particularly on two tracks dealing with his troubled personal life, [...] "Simply Shady" [...] and [...] "So Sad". Woffinden concluded: [...] "I find Dark Horse the product of a complete egoist – no one, you see, is in my tree – someone whose universe is confined to himself. And his guru... I'll repeat that this album is totally colourless. Just stuff and nonsense." [...] Writing in The Village Voice in January 1975, Robert Christgau bemoaned the album's [...] "transubstantiations" [...] and particularly derided the lyrics to [...] "Māya Love", [...] "in which 'window-pane' becomes 'window brain.' Can <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> that pain (pane, get it?) is the same as brain? For all this hoarse dork knows ..." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What does <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E
