25|$|Much of {{the puzzle}} has been {{resolved}} through mathematical modeling and additional experiments. In particular, starting in 1989, Gunduz Caginalp and collaborators modeled the trading with two concepts that are generally missing in classical economics and finance. First, they assumed that supply and demand of an asset depended not only on valuation, but on {{factors such as the}} price trend. Second, they assumed that the available cash and asset are finite (as they are in the laboratory). This is contrary to the “infinite arbitrage” that is generally assumed to exist, and to eliminate deviations from fundamental value. Utilizing these assumptions together with differential equations, they predicted the following: (a) The bubble would be larger if there was initial undervaluation. Initially, “value-based” traders would buy the undervalued asset creating an uptrend, which would then attract the “momentum” traders and a bubble would be created. (b) When the initial ratio of cash <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> value in a given experiment was increased, they predicted that the bubble would be larger.|$|E

The study used cross sectional data that contained information from 403 MFIs in 73 countries. Multivariate regression analysis was applied {{in order to get}} the results. Cost of funds and return on assets were used as measures for the performance of MFIs, and debt to equity and debt <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> were used as measures for the capital structure, in addition to 10 control variables. The findings of the study indicate that most of the MFIs are highly leveraged, they use approximately four times more debt financing than equity. Further the regression results revealed that total debt <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> and short term debt <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> have a positive and significant effect on cost of funds. Long term debt <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> also has a positive impact on cost of funds, but the relationship was not significant. Total debt <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> and long term debt <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> have a negative and significant effect on return on assets. Short term debt <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> also has a negative effect on return on assets, but the relationship was not significant.

500|$|In May 2002, {{the club}} was rebranded York City Soccer Club as part of Batchelor's plan to market it in the United States. Persimmon, which had bought 10% of the shares in BCH, {{submitted}} planning applications for 93 homes {{on the site of}} Bootham Crescent, and Batchelor spoke of building York a new stadium at Clifton Moor. The club entered a creditors' voluntary agreement in November 2002, and the York Evening Press said York had been [...] "plunged into the darkest, coldest days of its history". The club went into administration in December 2002, and was given five weeks to find a buyer or face bankruptcy. The ST donated £92,000 to give the club a temporary reprieve. The ST took control over the club in March 2003 after the Inland Revenue accepted an offer of £100,000 as payment for £160,000 owed in tax. Steve Beck became the new chairman. Batchelor had diverted almost all of the £400,000 Persimmon sponsorship money away from York to his racing team, and his promise of having ST members on the board never materialised. He left the club with a profit of £120,000 and admitted <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> stripping during his time as owner. Despite the off-field problems, York pushed for promotion in 2002–03 and were in an automatic promotion place by late March 2003. They won none of their last six matches and finished the season in 10th place.|$|E

2500|$|In weak-form efficiency, future prices {{cannot be}} {{predicted}} by analyzing prices from the past. Excess returns cannot be earned {{in the long}} run by using investment strategies based on historical share prices or other historical data. Technical analysis techniques {{will not be able to}} consistently produce excess returns, though some forms of fundamental analysis may still provide excess returns. Share prices exhibit no serial dependencies, meaning that there are no [...] "patterns" [...] <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> prices. This implies that future price movements are determined entirely by information not contained in the price series. Hence, prices must follow a random walk. This 'soft' EMH does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants not be able to systematically profit from market 'inefficiencies'. However, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e., non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock markets to trend over time periods of weeks or longer and that, moreover, there is a positive correlation between degree of trending and length of time period ...|$|E
60|$|Now little Bellamy had, {{after much}} anxious thought, just {{about this time}} come to a bold determination--namely, <b>to</b> <b>asset</b> his marital {{authority}} over Mrs. Bellamy. Indeed, his self-pride was much injured by the treatment he received at his wife's hands, for {{it seemed to him}} that he was utterly ignored in his own house. In fact, it would not be too much to say that he was an entire nonentity. He had married Mrs. Bellamy for love, or rather from fascination, though she had nothing in the world--married her in a fortnight from the time that George had first introduced him. When he had walked out of church with his beautiful bride, he had thought himself the luckiest man in London, whereas now he could not but feel that matrimony had not fulfilled his expectations. In the first place, Love's young dream--he was barely thirty--came to a rude awakening, for, once married, it was impossible --though he had, in common with the majority of little men, a tolerably good opinion of himself--but that he should perceive that his wife did not care one brass farthing about him. To his soft advances she was as cold as a marble statue, the lovely eyes never grew tender for him. Indeed, he found that she was worse than a statue, for statues cannot indulge in bitter mockery and contemptuous comments, and Mrs. Bellamy could, and, what is more, frequently did.|$|E
40|$|Banks are {{important}} {{cells in the}} economy as they have a significant role by maintaining and encouraging the development of economic sectors. They refocus the resources {{from those who have}} surplus to those which have a deficit. Therefore, as any other enterprises, performance is highly desirable for banks and, then, it is crucial to discover what the main factors that influence this objective are. So, this paper analyzes the microeconomic factors affecting bank’s financial performance focusing on 11 entities for the period between 2003 and 2013. The performance is measured by return on assets. The independent variables used are bank’s size, financial leverage,loans <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> ratio, deposits <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> ratio, number of employees, liquidity, net result and monetary policy rate. The results show that bank’s size, loans <b>to</b> <b>assets</b> ratio and liquidity have not a significant impact on performance.

40|$|Motivated by {{the former}} {{researchers}} who focus only {{on one of the}} factor related to intangible investments, this study analyzes factors related to intangible investments. This study investigates wether cash, equity, expense and income are related to intangible investments. The reasons why the issue becomes a crucial matter are: First, recent accounting and finance literature say that intangible assets are a firm value creator and increasingly becoming the major drivers of firm value and performance. Second, current financial statements provide very little information about these assets. Even worse, much of the information that is provided is partial, inconsistent, and confusing. Third, intangible assets empirical studies in Indonesia are still very limited. Using sample from manufacture firms listed at the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) over 2003 - 2007, the result indicates that generally cash, equity, expense and income are positively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets.</b> These findings have twelve main concerns: First, unexpected cash are positively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> but statistically insignificant. Second, the increasing unexpected cash are negatively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically insignificant. Third, the decreasing unexpected cash are negatively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically insignificant. Fourth, unexpected equity are positively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically significant. Fifth, the increasing unexpected equity are positively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically significant. Sixth, the decreasing unexpected equity are positively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> but statistically insignificant. Seventh, unexpected expense are positively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically significant. Eighth, the increasing unexpected expense are positively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically significant. Ninth, the decreasing unexpected expense are positively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> but statistically insignificant. Tenth, unexpected income are positively related <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> but statistically insignificant.
