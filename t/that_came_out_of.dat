5|$|Columbia Pictures {{executive}} Amy Pascal suggested Angelina Jolie to Noyce, who {{had often}} spoken to Jolie {{in the past}} about a desire to create a female spy franchise. Pascal even invited Jolie for a Bond girl role, but the actress playfully replied that she {{was more interested in}} playing James Bond himself instead. Jolie was sent Salts script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura went to visit Jolie at her home in France to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer Brian Helgeland helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.|$|E
5|$|MDSHA has {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} east–west corridor between the MD 28–MD 97 intersection at Norbeck and the I-95–MD 198 interchange, a corridor that forms the most direct route from Laurel to Rockville. Plans for the MD 198 portion of the corridor call for expanding the route to a four-lane divided highway from MD 650 to US 29 and widening the highway to six lanes from the Montgomery–Prince George's County line to west of I-95. The proposals also include adding a center turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also {{conducted a study}} concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed improvements are associated with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred alternative <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the study was to expand MD 198 from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing dumbbell interchange.|$|E

Because of the CMP suggesting {{that this type of}} interchange should be used to alleviate bottlenecks in the MPO area, KYTC chose to use a DDI design for the Harrodsburg Road and New Circle interchange. A public meeting was held on March 29, 2011 at Southern Hills United Methodist Church. This is the first Diverging Diamond Interchange (now called Double Crossover Diamond or DCD) in the state of Kentucky.|$|E

Not long after he began to talk to the authorities Mannoia's mother, aunt and one of his sisters were murdered in their Bagheria home as revenge, it being a common tactic by the Mafia to kill the relatives of the pentiti to discourage others from similar cooperation with authorities.|$|E
25|$|Riot grrrl is an {{underground}} feminist punk movement that {{originated in the}} early 1990s in Washington state (particularly Olympia) and the greater Pacific Northwest. It also had origins in Washington, D.C. It is a subcultural movement that combines feminist consciousness and punk style and politics. It {{is often associated with}} third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, Miró {{joined the}} Surrealist group. The already {{symbolic}} and poetic nature of Miró’s work, {{as well as}} the dualities and contradictions inherent to it, fit well within the context of dream-like automatism espoused by the group. Much of Miró’s work lost the cluttered chaotic lack of focus that had defined his work thus far, and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided. This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Miró referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as “x” in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris. The paintings <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this period were eventually dubbed Miró’s dream paintings.|$|E
25|$|The best-documented {{creations of}} new {{species in the}} {{laboratory}} were performed in the late 1980s. William Rice and G.W. Salt bred fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, using a maze with three different choices of habitat, such as light/dark and wet/dry. Each generation was placed into the maze, and the groups of flies <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> two of the eight exits were set apart to breed {{with each other in}} their respective groups. After thirty-five generations, the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences: they mated only within the areas they preferred, and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas. The history of such attempts is described in Rice and Hostert (1993).|$|E
25|$|During his civil {{engineering}} days, Cauchy {{once had been}} briefly in charge of repairing {{a few of the}} Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying Mister Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838. Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. The only good <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this episode was Cauchy's promotion to Baron, a title by which Cauchy set great store. In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years in exile.|$|E

25|$|Later the Pretoria Minute {{represented}} {{another step}} towards resolution where agreements at Groote Schuur were reconsolidated and steps towards {{setting up an}} interim government and drafting a new constitution were established as well as suspension of the military wing of the ANC – the Umkhonto we Sizwe. This step helped end much of the violence within South Africa. Another agreement <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Pretoria Minute was that both parties would try and raise awareness that {{a new way of}} governance was being created for South Africa, and that further violence would only hinder this process. However, violence still continued in Kwazulu-Natal, which violated the trust between Mandela and de Klerk. Moreover, internal disputes in the ANC prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached.|$|E
25|$|Whalers and sealers {{had been}} visiting the South Australian coast since 1802 and by 1819 {{there was a}} {{permanent}} camp on Karta, Kangaroo Island. Many of these men were escaped convicts, sealers, whalers who had brought Tasmanian Aboriginal women with them but they also raided the mainland for women, particularly Ramindjeri. Originally the most heavily populated area in Australia, a smallpox epidemic had travelled down the River Murray before colonisation, possibly killing {{a majority of the}} Ngarrindjeri. Funeral rites and cultural practices were disrupted, family groups merged and land use became altered. Songs from the time tell of the smallpox <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Southern Cross in the east with a loud noise like a bright flash. In 1830 the first exploratory expedition reached the Ngarrindjeri lands and Charles Sturt noted that the people were already familiar with firearms.|$|E
25|$|According to UN {{estimates}} {{that are not}} based on any household survey access to an improved water source in Lebanon is universal. The UN figures on water access may not give an accurate picture of the real situation: A representative survey {{carried out by the}} World Bank in 2008 estimated that the average connection rate to the public water network was 80%, varying from 96% in Beirut to 55% in the North. These figures are similar to those <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a 2004 Household Living Conditions Survey carried out by the Lebanese Central Administration of Statistics. Even considering that improved water sources include protected wells and springs in addition to piped water connections, it is unlikely that water access in Lebanon is universal. For example, many urban households that are not connected to the network rely on water bought from tanker trucks.|$|E

25|$|On August 1, 1828, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Barney Griffin, who had {{travelled}} from Syracuse to the Village of Sackets Harbor several days earlier, ended up dying in the Jefferson County Poor House. Orville went over to investigate. Upon searching Griffin's clothes, he found the cash sum of two hundred and twenty-two dollars and fifteen cents - more than enough money for Griffin to pay for a hotel. Hungerford put an advertisement in the a paper to see if a relative would claim the money. No one did. He then turned the money over to the County Treasurer for use of the Poor House, deducting a dollar for the advertisement money <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his own pocket.

25|$|During the Vietnam War the RAE {{maintained}} {{a force of}} about 1,000 personnel in South Vietnam where they served {{as part of the}} 1st Australian Task Force. Following {{the end of the war}} the size of the Australian Army was decreased in line with the abolition of the national service scheme and as a consequence of this and a number of lessons <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the deployment to Vietnam the RAE underwent a series of changes. One of the most significant changes came in 1972 and was the decision to establish full regimental sized engineer units, as opposed to squadron or company sized units. These units were initially known as Field Regiments, but have subsequently become known as Combat Engineer Regiments. As a part of this restructuring the RAE was reorganised to raise one regiment for each brigade and the Corps lost its responsibility for maintaining water transport and engineering stores.|$|E
25|$|Another {{influential}} Greek {{writer and}} intellectual was Adamantios Korais {{who witnessed the}} French Revolution.

When Korais was a young adult he moved to Paris to continue his studies. He eventually graduated from the Montpellier School of Medicine and spent {{the remainder of his}} life in Paris. He would often have political and philosophical debates with Thomas Jefferson. While in Paris he was a witness to the French Revolution and saw the democracy <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. He spent a lot of his time convincing wealthy Greeks to build schools and libraries to further the education of Greeks. He believed that a furthering in education would be necessary for the general welfare and prosperity of the people of Greece, as well as the country. Korais' ultimate goal was a democratic Greece much like the Golden Age of Pericles but he died {{before the end of the}} revolution.|$|E
