He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

Two flat, rectangular MLI panel configurations, one incorporating a butt joint, were tested. The insulation panels consisted of 15 double-aluminized Mylar radiation shields separated by double silk net spacers. The test {{results indicated that the}} rate which the condensable gas concentration at the edge or at the butt joint of an MLI panel was reduced was a significant factor in the total <b>time</b> required <b>to</b> reduce the condensable gas concentration within the panel to less than 1 percent.

Many continued to decry the USSR's liberal rulings, while others saw women's rights as necessary towards staying relevant. While Soviets were ideologically interested in Women's Rights, local instability prevented bold policies or implementation. [...] 1924 ushered in a limited campaign against the veil. In accordance with the Soviet pro-nationality policy, the TASSR was split into five republics: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The Soviets also took this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> the Jadids from government, either through execution or exile. Soviet rule encouraged {{the founding of the}} anti-veiling Women's Division, or Zhenotdel. Few married women joined as their immediate community strongly condemned unveiling. Consequently, its workers were usually Jadid educated women or widows.|$|E

In 2, when selecting an empress for Emperor Ping, Grand Empress Dowager Wang initially ordered that girls from the Wang clan be excluded, but Wang Mang immediately mobilized a mass of petitioners to surround the palace, urging her to make his daughter empress. Grand Empress Dowager Wang relented and selected Wang Mang's daughter to be Emperor Ping's empress, and she was created as such in 4.|$|R
5000|$|Cbob {{was also}} one of the founders of the University of Georgia School of Law, and served on the first Georgia code {{commission}} of 1858 and drafted what became the private and penal law portions of the Georgia Code of 1861, which was the first successfully enacted attempt at a comprehensive codification of the common law anywhere in the United States. It is the ancestor of today's Official Code of Georgia Annotated. Simultaneously, the Northern law reformer David Dudley Field II was independently working in the same ambitious direction of trying to codify all of the common law into a coherent civil code, but Field's proposed civil code was not actually enacted until 1866 in Dakota Territory, was belatedly enacted in 1872 in California, and was repeatedly rejected several times by his home state of New York and never enacted in that state. Unlike Field's largely race-neutral code, the original Georgia Code was strongly biased in favor of slavery and white supremacy, and even contained a presumption that blacks were prima facie slaves until proven otherwise. [...] Georgia ultimately kept the Code after the Civil War but revised it in 1867 and many more <b>times</b> since, <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> the racism and pro-slavery bias inherent in the original text.|$|R
5000|$|S/SL (split/splitless) injector; {{a sample}} is {{introduced}} into a heated small chamber via a syringe through a septum - the heat facilitates volatilization {{of the sample}} and sample matrix. The carrier gas then either sweeps the entirety (splitless mode) or a portion (split mode) of the sample into the column. In split mode, {{a part of the}} sample/carrier gas mixture in the injection chamber is exhausted through the split vent. Split injection is preferred when working with samples with high analyte concentrations (>0.1%) whereas splitless injection is best suited for trace analysis with low amounts of analytes (<0.01%). In splitless mode the split valve opens after a pre-set amount of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> heavier elements that would otherwise contaminate the system. This pre-set (splitless) time should be optimized, the shorter time (e.g., 0.2 min) ensures less tailing but loss in response, the longer time (2 min) increases tailing but also signal.|$|E
40|$|As {{the number}} of NUMA system 2 ̆ 7 s cache {{coherency}} protocols based on the IEEE Std. 1596 - 1992, Standard for Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) Specification increases, {{it is important to}} review this complex protocol to determine if the protocol can be enhanced in any way. This research provides two realizable extensions to the standard SCI cache protocol. Both of these extensions lie in the basic confines of the SCI architectures. The first extension is a simplification to the SCI protocol in the area of prepending to a sharing list. Depending if the cache line is marked 2 ̆ 2 Fresh 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Gone 2 ̆ 2, the flow of events is distinctly different. The guaranteed forward progress extension is a simplification to the SCI protocol in this area; making the act of prepending to an existing sharing list independent of whether the line is in the 2 ̆ 2 Fresh 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Gone 2 ̆ 2 state. In addition, this extension eliminates the need for SCI command, as well as distributes the resource requirements of supplying data of a shared line equally among all nodes of the sharing list. The second extension addresses the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> (or invalidate) an SCI sharing list. This extension provides a realizable solution that allows the node being invalidated to acknowledge the request prior to the completion of the invalidation while maintaining the memory consistency model of the processors of the system. The resulting cache protocol was developed and implemented for Sequent Computer System Inc. NUMA-Q system. The cache protocol was run on systems ranging from eight to sixty four processors and provided between 7...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{mobile phones}} data is deleted once, it cannot be retrieved. In this project {{we try to}} develop a new {{application}} “Rebin ” for avoiding this situation. on the Windows desktop recycle bin represents a directory where deleted files are temporarily stored. This enables one to retrieve files that he may have accidentally deleted. From <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time,</b> it helps <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> the recycle bin to free up space on the hard disk. It can also be configured Windows so that it doesn't use the recycle bin at all, but then it won't be able to retrieve accidentally deleted files. By default, Microsoft Windows 95 and above uses 10 % of available disk space to save any deleted files in case any file is accidentally deleted it can be recovered from the Recycle Bin. Below is additional information about how to view deleted files, manage the Recycle Bin, and empty the Recycle Bin. The recycle bin is modeled after the Macintosh trash can, which {{has been part of the}} Mac GUI since its inception. If any file has been deleted, it is automatically moved to the Recycle Bin. Users can identify if files are in the Recycle Bin by looking at the Recycle Bin icon. By default, the icon will look like the icon to the right, an empty Recycle Bin. When files have been deleted, the Recycle Bin will be full of trash...|$|R

40|$|Ionization {{chambers}} {{are widely}} used for measuring tritium in the gas phase. Recently, however, it has been perceived that the contamination of the chamber wall due to the adsorption of tritium significantly impairs {{the reliability of the}} ionization chambers when they are used for measuring tritium at high concentrations. As a first step to overcome this difficulty, we studied the contamination of ionization chambers with tritium gas (HT) and/or tritiated water vapor (HTO) by using different component materials (Cu, Ni-plated, and Au-plated chambers). In case of the Cu chamber, the concentration of tritium gas in the chamber decreased exponentially with <b>time</b> due <b>to</b> <b>purge</b> by fresh air to a certain level. Then, the decrease rate slowed down drastically (the memory effect). This is caused by adsorption of tritiated water {{on the surface of the}} material; the tritiated water being formed in the chamber due to exchange reaction with water vapor. In case of the Ni-plated chamber, the memory effect was also observed; however, this is not due to the adsorbed tritiated water. Instead, it is thought to due to adsorbed tritium such as T(a) or HT(a). With respect to the Au-plated chamber, no memory effect took place when it was exposed to tritium gas (HT). On the other hand, when the chambers were exposed to tritiated water vapor, all showed a large memory effect. It was clarified that the memory effect principally arose from the physically adsorbed tritiated water. In conclusion, the Au-plated chamber is most preferable for measuring tritium gas. However, the memory effect due to the adsorption of tritiated water vapor is as large as that for the other two. Therefore, it is necessary to develop suitable decontamination methods for the contamination will have to be avoided by the selection of more suitable materials...|$|R
