25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. <b>Thermogravimetry</b> is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E
50|$|The Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry is a peer-reviewed {{scientific}} journal {{published by}} Springer Science+Business Media {{in cooperation with}} Akadémiai Kiadó. Formerly this journal was known as Journal of Thermal Analysis. It publishes papers covering all aspects of calorimetry, thermal analysis, and experimental thermodynamics. Some of the subjects covered are <b>thermogravimetry,</b> differential scanning calorimetry of all types, derivative <b>thermogravimetry,</b> thermal conductivity, thermomechanical analysis, and the theory and instrumentation for thermal analysis and calorimetry.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} TG {{focuses on}} {{various aspects of}} ANALYSIS of materials; the other facet of <b>thermogravimetry</b> is studying SYNTHESIS, e.g. using a thermobalance to monitor the making of materials. The industrial processes of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), chemical vapor infiltration (CVI), metallurgical carburization, synthesis of carbon-carbon composites can greatly benefit from modeling them with large-sample TG instruments.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thermogravimetry</b> (also {{known by}} the acronym [...] "TG"; {{alternative}} spellings include thermo-gravimetry and thermogravimmetry) is a branch of physical chemistry, materials research, and thermal analysis. It is based on continuous recording of mass changes of a sample of material, {{as a function of}} a combination of temperature with time, and additionally of pressure and gas composition.|$|E
5000|$|A {{microbalance}} is {{an instrument}} {{capable of making}} precise measurements of weight of objects of relatively small mass: {{of the order of}} a million parts of a gram. In comparison, a standard analytical balance is 100 times less sensitive; i.e. it is limited in precision to 0.1 milligrams. Microbalances are generally used in a laboratory as standalone instruments but are also incorporated into other instruments, such as <b>thermogravimetry,</b> sorption/desorption systems ...|$|E
50|$|By {{coupling}} {{the thermal}} analysis instrument, e. g. TGA (<b>thermogravimetry)</b> or DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), with a fast Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS) {{the detection of}} gas separation and identification of the separated components are possible in exact time correlation with the other thermal analysis signals. DSC/TGA-QMS or TGA-QMS yields information on the composition (mass numbers of elements and molecules) of the evolved gases. It allows fast and easy interpretation of atomic/inorganic vapors and standard gases like H2, H2O, CO2, etc. Fragmentation, interpretation of organic molecules is sometimes difficult.|$|E
50|$|Simultaneous thermal {{analysis}} (STA) generally {{refers to the}} simultaneous application of <b>thermogravimetry</b> (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to {{one and the same}} sample in a single instrument. The test conditions are perfectly identical for the TGA and DSC signals (same atmosphere, gas flow rate, vapor pressure of the sample, heating rate, thermal contact to the sample crucible and sensor, radiation effect, etc.). The information gathered can even be enhanced by coupling the STA instrument to an Evolved Gas Analyzer (EGA) like Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) or mass spectrometry (MS).|$|E

50|$|Equilibrium vapor {{pressure}} {{can be defined}} as the pressure reached when a condensed phase is in equilibrium with its own vapor. In the case of an equilibrium solid, such as a crystal, this {{can be defined as}} the pressure when the rate of sublimation of a solid matches the rate of deposition of its vapor phase. For most solids this pressure is very low, but some notable exceptions are naphthalene, dry ice (the {{vapor pressure}} of dry ice is 5.73 MPa (831 psi, 56.5 atm) at 20 degrees Celsius, which causes most sealed containers to rupture), and ice. All solid materials have a vapor pressure. However, due to their often extremely low values, measurement can be rather difficult. Typical techniques include the use of <b>thermogravimetry</b> and gas transpiration.|$|E
5000|$|Loss on {{ignition}} {{is a test}} used in inorganic analytical chemistry, {{particularly in}} the analysis of minerals. It consists of strongly heating ("igniting") a sample of the material at a specified temperature, allowing volatile substances to escape, until its mass ceases to change. This may be done in air, or in some other reactive or inert atmosphere. The simple test typically consists of placing a few grams of the material in a tared, pre-ignited crucible and determining its mass, placing it in a temperature-controlled furnace for a set time, cooling it in a controlled (e.g. water-free, CO2-free) atmosphere, and redetermining the mass. The process may be repeated to show that mass-change is complete. A variant of the test in which mass-change is continually monitored as temperature is changed, is <b>thermogravimetry.</b>|$|E
