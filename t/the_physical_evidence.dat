5|$|The {{only known}} {{contemporary}} depictions of prominent Tudor era vessels like the Henry Grace à Dieu and the Mary Rose {{are contained in}} the Anthony Roll. As the Mary Rose sank by accident in 1545 and was successfully salvaged in 1982, comparison between {{the information in the}} Roll and <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of the Mary Rose has provided new insights into the study of the naval history of the period.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully {{is called}} before FBI {{assistant}} director Walter Skinner, who {{is accompanied by}} the Smoking Man. Despite {{the success of the}} X-Files investigations, Skinner criticizes their unconventionalism and wants both Scully and Fox Mulder to do by-the-book work. The agents attend a release hearing for Tooms, where Monte claims that Tooms' attack on Scully was due to being falsely accused of murder. Mulder tries to point out <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of Tooms' physiology and crimes but is ignored by the hearing's panel. Tooms is released into the care of an elderly couple and is ordered to continue his treatment with Dr. Monte.|$|E
5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} pointed that the loose trial rules, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidences,</b> are not {{presented}} or declined {{due to lack of}} witnesses. Furthermore, Sharia law allows defendants to reject signed confessions.|$|R

40|$|Personal {{identification}} was {{the major}} task of forensic doctors in Thailand’s Tsunami.

A disaster Identification team should be set up to handle the problems and plan for the future...|$|R
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of the {{original}} papers, the poems were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this {{is the belief that}} all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised to build up the church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E

5|$|The Burzahom {{archaeological site}} {{is located in}} the Kashmir Valley of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Archaeological {{excavations}} have revealed four phases of cultural significance between 3000 BC and 1000 BC. Periods I and II represent the Neolithic era; Period IlI the Megalithic era (of massive stone menhirs and wheel turned red pottery); and Period IV relates to the early Historical Period (Post-megalithic period). The findings, recorded in stratified cultural deposits representing prehistoric human activity in Kashmir, are based on detailed investigations that cover all aspects of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of the site, including the ancient flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of flight}} {{recorder}} {{data for the}} last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was a major factor in its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence.</b> As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, {{and moves to}} the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith {{persistently}} contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders, and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides contact names of other police departments in other counties where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is profiled in the Chronicle, and he allows himself to be interviewed on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children with her. Graysmith acquires more information that points to Allen as the Zodiac, and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence,</b> such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, {{working with}} {{agents in the}} FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a {{psychological}} profile of the unidentified bomber which described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence with connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 {{in favor of an}} alternative theory developed by FBI analysts concentrating on <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the bomber suspect was characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic. A 1-800 hotline was set up by the UNABOM Task Force to take any calls related to the Unabomber investigation, with a $1million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.|$|E
5|$|In the meanwhile, her father's {{fishing boat}} is {{taken away by}} creditors. He sinks {{into a state of}} sadness and begins to drink away their savings. On one occasion, Vanaja’s {{superior}} intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> of the child will be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will grow up to be an upper caste boy.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> {{allows a}} general {{reconstruction}} of how Lindow Man was killed, although some details are debated, {{but it does}} not explain why he was killed. In North West England, there is little evidence for religious or ritual activity in the Iron Age period. What evidence does survive is usually in the form of artefacts recovered from peat bogs. Late Iron Age burials in the region often took the form of a crouched inhumation, sometimes with personal ornaments. Although dated to the mid-1st centuryAD, the type of burial of Lindow Man was more common in the pre-historic period. In {{the latter half of the}} 20thcentury, scholars widely believed that bog bodies demonstrating injuries to the neck or head area were examples of ritual sacrifice. Bog bodies were associated with Germanic and Celtic cultures, specifically relating to head worship.|$|E

25|$|The {{trouble with}} this account is that Gigantopithecus {{was not a}} hominin and maybe not even a crown group hominoid; yet <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>evidence</b> implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with {{buttocks}} and a long, stout, permanently adducted hallux. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that Gigantopithecus would have evolved these uniquely hominin traits in parallel.|$|E
