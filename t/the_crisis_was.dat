5|$|After the Spartan threat {{had been}} removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea {{to crush the}} revolt there. He then punished the landowners of Chalcis, who lost their properties. The {{residents}} of Histiaea, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. <b>The</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446–445BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt {{to win over the}} other state's allies.|$|E

Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said that the party {{had no interest in}} removing De la Rúa from power, because he was so unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E

5|$|A global {{strategy}} to stem <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> released in 2005 {{in the form}} of the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E

5|$|Groves {{instituted a}} series of reforms.

He ordered his contractors to hire whatever special equipment they needed and to pay premium prices if necessary to guarantee quick delivery. Instead of allowing construction of camps to proceed in whatever order the contractors saw fit, Groves laid down priorities for completion of camp facilities, so that the troops could begin moving in even while construction was still under way. By mid-December, the worst of <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> over. Over half a million men had been mobilized and essential accommodations and facilities for two million men were 95 per cent complete.

Though initially deployed to the Indian Ocean for possible action in Egypt and the surrounding region, <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> ultimately resolved. During this cruise, 3rd Battalion—designated Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 3/3 – visited Brunei Bay, Bombay, Karachi, and Singapore, before returning to Japan. In December 1956, the entire 3rd Marine Regiment was deployed off of Indonesia because of civil strife in that country. In 1958, 3rd Battalion was alerted for possible deployment to Lebanon, but its transports were turned back in the Indian Ocean to Okinawa. Four years later, in 1962, the battalion deployed on the USS Bayfield to the Chinese coast to guard the Taiwanese islands of Quemoy Matsu.|$|E

5|$|Juárez Celman's {{administration}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in the ratio of debt to GDP {{toward the end of his}} tenure and an increasing weakness in the fiscal situation. The Baring Brothers merchant bank had developed a close and profitable association with Argentina, and when Celman's government was unable to meet its payments to the House of Baring, a financial crisis ensued. Argentina defaulted and suffered bank runs as the Baring Brothers faced failure. <b>The</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> caused by the lack of co-ordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which ultimately led to the collapse of the banking system. The financial crisis of 1890 left the government with no funds for its immigration subsidies programme, and it was abolished in 1891. Loans to Argentina were severely curtailed, and imports had to be cut sharply. Exports were less affected, but the value of Argentine exports did not surpass the 1889 peak until 1898.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May, Stjepan Mesić, a Croat, was {{scheduled}} to be the chairman of the rotating presidency of Yugoslavia. Serbia, aided by Kosovo, Montenegro, and Vojvodina, whose presidency votes were at that time under Serbian control, blocked the appointment, which was otherwise seen as largely ceremonial. This maneuver technically left Yugoslavia without a head of state and without a commander-in-chief. Two days later, a repeated attempt to vote on the issue failed. Ante Marković, prime minister of Yugoslavia at the time, proposed appointing a panel which would wield presidential powers. It was not immediately clear who the panel members would be, apart from defense minister Veljko Kadijević, nor who would fill position of JNA commander-in-chief. The move was quickly rejected by Croatia as unconstitutional. <b>The</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> resolved after a six-week stalemate, and Mesić was elected president — the first non-communist to become Yugoslav head of state in decades.|$|E
5|$|The Quebra Quilo riots were {{suspected}} of being condoned by priests, and together with the arrest of the bishops, {{drew attention to the}} Imperial government having become embroiled in a no-win dispute. The crisis would only be smoothed over by the replacement of the Cabinet in September 1875 and the Emperor's reluctant grant of a full amnesty to the bishops. Historian Heitor Lyra blamed Rio Branco and his Cabinet, both bishops and, primarily, PedroII for the ordeal. All parties involved revealed a lack of tact, and their intransigence only caused harm—mostly to the monarchy itself. The main consequence of <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> that the clergy no longer saw any benefit in upholding PedroII. Although they abandoned the Emperor, most eagerly awaited the accession of his eldest daughter and heir Isabel because of her Ultramontane views.|$|E

5|$|It was {{believed}} that the King would be succeeded by his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of William of Orange, Stadtholder of the Netherlands, but when in 1688, James produced a male heir, James Francis Edward Stuart, {{it was clear that}} his policies would outlive him. An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40,000 men on 5 November. In Edinburgh there were rumours of Orange plots and on 10 December the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, the Earl of Perth, quit the capital for Drummond Castle, planning an abortive escape to Ireland (he was later captured as he embarked for France). As rioters approached Holyrood Abbey they were fired on by soldiers, resulting in some deaths. The city guard was called out, but the Abbey was stormed by a large mob. The Catholic furnishings placed there when it was restored as a chapel for James were torn down and the tombs of the Stuart kings desecrated. A crowd of students burnt the Pope in effigy and took down the heads of executed Covenanters that were hanging above the city gates. <b>The</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> resolved when James fled from England on 23 December, leading to an almost bloodless revolution. Although there had been no significant Scottish involvement in the coup, most members of the Scottish Privy Council went to London to offer their services to William. On 7 January 1689, they asked William to take over the responsibilities of government.|$|E
5|$|Lavagna {{proposed}} to slow {{economic growth and}} control inflation. Kirchner rejected this, promoting wage increases to reduce economic inequality and extending unemployment insurance {{and other types of}} social welfare. Public services such as public transportation, electricity, gas and water supply were subsidized and kept at low prices. Food industries were subsidied as well. The subsidies eventually expanded to several uncommon areas. This increased the economic activity, but also increased inflation and reduced the private investment in those areas. Unable to control inflation, the government influenced the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina, which under-reported it, as well as poverty (which was calculated with the inflation figures). The superpowers law, sanctioned during <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> <b>was</b> prorrogated and eventually made permanent in 2006; this law allowed the president to rearrange the budget with supervision from the Congress. Kirchner sought to win over the Argentine Workers' Central Union and leaders of more moderate piquetero factions to reduce the chances of strikes and protests. He nevertheless continued to oppose hard-line elements of the piquetero movement, such as that of Raúl Castells. Kirchner's policy helped to fragment the piqueteros, with some declaring their allegiance to him and others continuing to oppose him. Their usual system of protest (blocking streets) made them highly unpopular. However, Kirchner refused to suppress the piquetero demonstrations to avoid the risk of further violence.|$|E
5|$|Loyal to {{the concept}} of the British Empire, Bruce envisaged {{strengthening}} it through mutual economic development, greater political cooperation, and common policies on defence, trade and foreign affairs. His first trip abroad as prime minister was for the 1923 Imperial Conference in London. Bruce put forward a wide range of proposals for stronger cooperation between Great Britain and her dominions {{in a wide range of}} areas, particularly in the areas of trade, defence and the formulation of a common foreign policy. He particularly desired a greater role for the dominions in imperial affairs, including a collective decision-making body for common questions of defence and foreign affairs. He took exception to a lack of involvement in foreign policy decisions made by Britain that would have significant ramifications for Australia. In 1922, in what became known as the Chanak Crisis, British brinkmanship over Turkey's aggressive manoeuvres to redefine its border with Greece had escalated to the point where the British cabinet had threatened war against Turkey. This threat included military participation of dominions in an intervention, though no dominion government had been informed of the developments in Turkey. Although a diplomatic end to <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> eventually found, dominion leaders were angered at having almost been committed to a military conflict without any consultation.|$|E
