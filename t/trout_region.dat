Restocking measures which were carried out during the past tenth of years for S. salar, S. trutta and A. anguilla might also have and direct (species affected) or an indirect impact (predator) on the river rhine fish populations [15, 31, 32]. Nevertheless, the number of both S. trutta fario and S. trutta trutta has decreased over the past 34 years and are absent nowadays.

40|$|Brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis {{and other}} {{salmonids}} in Appalachia typically inhabit headwater watersheds, where food resources may limit growth. We monitored the feeding trends of a brook trout population in central Appalachia {{over the course}} of 2 years to determine variation in feeding intensity and important prey items. One terrestrial beetle family, Scarabaeidae, provided a disproportionate amount of energy during the only time of year when brook trout were feeding substantially above maintenance ration. Scarab beetles contributed 39. 6 % of all energy consumed during May and June of both years, though the number of fish with one or more scarabaeids present in the stomach varied by month (22. 2 - 51. 7 %). The species composition of scarab beetles consumed suggested that four species are of particular importance.

40|$|The {{glucocorticoid}} (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) of extant jawed vertebrates emerged after {{duplication of}} an ancestral corticosteroid receptor. The ancestral corticosteroid receptor resembled extant MRs in hormone selectivity, {{and the different}} ligand specificity of extant GRs is a secondary derived characteristic. An additional characteristic that distinguishes the mammalian GR from the MR is the cellular distribution pattern {{in the absence of}} hormone: the naïve GR resides in the cytoplasm, whereas the naïve MR is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Our results show, by the use of green fluorescent protein-tagged fusion proteins, that the GRs [rainbow trout (rt) GR 1 and rtGR 2] from a lower vertebrate, the teleost fish, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) resemble mammalian MR rather than GR in their subcellular localization pattern. The addition of cortisol caused the remaining cytoplasmic rtGR 1 and rtGR 2 to migrate to the nucleus. The speed of nuclear localization was cortisol concentration dependent, with rtGR 2 being more sensitive than rtGR 1, mimicking the transactivational properties of the receptors in which the cortisol EC 50 value is an order of magnitude lower for rtGR 2. By the use of chimera constructs between the trout GRs and the rat GR C 656 G, we show that the E domain of the trout receptors are not involved in the nucleocytoplasmic localization of naïve trout GRs, but the A/B domain, especially if linked to the corresponding <b>trout</b> CD <b>region,</b> plays a pivotal role in the cellular distribution pattern. This is unrelated to the difference in the trout GRs transactivation sensitivity, which is determined by the receptor’s E-domains...|$|R

Rainbow trout piwi-like (rtili), rainbow trout scp 3 (rt-scp 3), and rainbow trout shippo 1 (rt-shippo 1) were identified as molecular markers for spermatogonia, spermato-cytes, and spermatids, respectively. The testicular cells were separated into five fractions (A–E) by flow cytometry (FCM) according to their GFP intensities. Based on the molecular markers, fractions A and B were found to contain spermatogo-nia, while fractions C and D contained spermatocytes, and fraction E contained spermatids. We also classified the sper-matogonia into type A, which contained spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), and type B, which did not. As none of the molecular markers tested could distinguish between the two types of spermatogonia, we subjected them to a transplantation assay. The results indicated that cells with strong GFP fluorescence (fraction A) colonized the recipient gonads, while cells with weaker GFP fluorescence (fraction B) did not. As only SSCs could colonize the recipient gonads, this indicated that fraction A and fraction B contained mainly type A and type B spermatogonia, respectively. These findings confirmed that our system could identify and isolate various populations of testicular cells from rainbow trout using a combination of GFP-dependent FCM and a transplantation assay. flow cytometry, GFP, spermatogenesis, spermatogonial transplantation, vas...|$|R
40|$|The brown trout, Salmo trutta, {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the Laurentian Great Lakes in 1887 from European broodstocks to found a recreational salmonid fishery; however, the origins of these progenitor lineages remain largely unknown. <b>Trout</b> from these <b>regions</b> are very specialized to their native habitats and matching North American stocks to similar watersheds may help increase survivability by introducing the stock to a more appropriate environment. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the European origins of brown trout found in the Great Lakes. We analyzed 144 brown trout from ten watersheds across Michigan and Wisconsin and identified their strain assignment according to the MIDNR classification using their mtDNA ND- 1 sequences. European progenitor lineages occurring within these strain assignments were then identified using the first 309 base pairs of the mtDNA control region. Nine ND- 1 haplotypes were found in the four most recently stocked strains. A total of four different European lineages were identified by 5 SNPs in the mtDNA control region in the 144 brown trout samples. One unique control region haplotype which has not been described was observed and a phylogeny was constructed with known sequences. We found that the Sturgeon River strain largely shares the same progenitor lineage as Gilchrist Creek.

6000|$|For instance,--on one occasion, Larry and Bunco were deputed to {{fish for}} trout, while our hero and the trapper went after deer. The place {{selected}} by the anglers was a clear quiet pool in a small but deep rivulet, which flowed down the gentle slope of a wooded hill. The distant surroundings no doubt were wild enough, but the immediate spot to which we refer {{might have been a}} scene in bonnie Scotland, and would have gladdened the heart of a painter as being his beau ideal, perhaps, of a [...] "quiet nook." [...] The day was quiet too; the little birds, apparently, were very happy, and the sun was very bright--so bright that it shone through the mirror-like surface of the pool right down to the bottom, and there revealed several large fat trout, which were teazed and tempted and even exhorted to meet their fate, by the earnest Larry. The converse on the occasion, too, was quiet and peaceful. It was what we may style a lazy sort of day, and the anglers felt lazy, and so did the fish, for, although they saw the baits which were held temptingly before their noses, they refused to bite. <b>Trout</b> in those <b>regions</b> are not timid. We speak from personal experience. They saw Larry and Bunco sitting astride the trunk of a fallen tree, with their toes in the water, bending earnestly over the pool, just as distinctly as these worthies saw the fish; but they cared not a drop of water for them! Larry, therefore, sought to beguile the time and entertain his friend by giving him glowing accounts of men and manners in the Green Isle. So this pleasant peaceful day passed by, and Pat's heart had reached a state of sweet tranquillity, when, happening to bend a little too far over the pool, in order to see a peculiarly large trout which was looking at him, he lost his balance and fell into it, head first, with a heavy plunge, which scattered its occupants right and left! Bunco chuckled immensely as he assisted to haul him out, and even ventured to chaff him a little.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We have {{previously}} identified associations between {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class I and resistance towards bacterial and viral pathogens in Atlantic salmon. To evaluate if only MHC or also closely linked genes contributed to the observed resistance we ventured into sequencing of the duplicated MHC class I regions of Atlantic salmon. Results Nine BACs covering more than 500 kb of the two duplicated MHC class I regions of Atlantic salmon were sequenced and the gene organizations characterized. Both regions contained the proteasome components PSMB 8, PSMB 9, PSMB 9 -like and PSMB 10 {{in addition to the}} transporter for antigen processing TAP 2, as well as genes for KIFC 1, ZBTB 22, DAXX, TAPBP, BRD 2, COL 11 A 2, RXRB and SLC 39 A 7. The IA region contained the recently reported MHC class I Sasa-ULA locus residing approximately 50 kb upstream of the major Sasa-UBA locus. The duplicated class IB region contained an MHC class I locus resembling the rainbow trout UCA locus, but although transcribed it was a pseudogene. No other MHC class I-like genes were detected in the two duplicated regions. Two allelic BACs spanning the UBA locus had 99. 2 % identity over 125 kb, while the IA region showed 82. 5 % identity over 136 kb to the IB region. The Atlantic salmon IB region had an insert of 220 kb in comparison to the IA region containing three chitin synthase genes. Conclusion We have characterized the gene organization of more than 500 kb of the two duplicated MHC class I regions in Atlantic salmon. Although Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout are closely related, the gene organization of their IB region has undergone extensive gene rearrangements. The Atlantic salmon has only one class I UCA pseudogene in the IB <b>region</b> while <b>trout</b> contains the four MHC UCA, UDA, UEA and UFA class I loci. The large differences in gene content and most likely function of the salmon and <b>trout</b> class IB <b>region</b> clearly argues that sequencing of salmon will not necessarily provide information relevant for trout and vice versa. </p...|$|R
40|$|Polymorphic {{microsatellite}} DNA loci {{were used}} here in three studies, one on Salmo salar and two on S. trutta. In {{the case of}} S. salar, the survival of native fish and non-natives from a nearby catchment, and their hybrids, were compared in a freshwater common garden experiment and subsequently in ocean ranching, with parental assignment utilising microsatellites. Overall survival of non-natives was 35 % of natives. This differential survival was mainly in the oceanic phase. These results imply a genetic basis and suggest local adaptation can occur in salmonids across relatively small geographic distances which may {{have important implications for}} the management of salmon populations. In the first case study with S trutta, the species was investigated throughout its spread as an invasive in Newfoundland, eastern Canada. Genetic investigation confirmed historical records that the majority of introductions were from a Scottish hatchery and provided a clear example of the structure of two expanding waves of spread along coasts, probably by natural straying of anadromous individuals, to the north and south of the point of human introduction. This study showed a clearer example of the genetic anatomy of an invasion than in previous studies with brown trout, and may have implications for the management of invasive species in general. Finally, the genetics of anadromous S. trutta from the Waterville catchment in south western Ireland were studied. Two significantly different population groupings, from tributaries in geographically distinct locations entering the largest lake in the catchment, were identified. These results were then used to assign very large rod caught sea trout individuals (so called “specimen” sea <b>trout)</b> back to <b>region</b> of origin, in a Genetic Stock Identification exercise. This suggested that the majority of these large sea trout originated from one of the two tributary groups. These results are relevant for the understanding of sea trout population dynamics and for the future management of this and other sea trout producing catchments. This thesis has demonstrated new insights into the population structuring of salmonids both between and within catchments. While these chapters look at the existence and scale of genetic variation from different angles, it might be concluded that the overarching message from this thesis should be to highlight the importance of maintaining genetic diversity in salmonid populations as vital for their long-term productivity and resilience...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{predicting}} regions susceptible to invasion by alien aquatic animals were developed for southern Africa (excluding Zimbabwe and Mozambique). In the "traditional" (data-poor) approach, distributions of {{three categories of}} alien "indicator" species (warm mesothermal, cold stenothermal and eurytopic) were compared to seven existing biogeographical models of distribution patterns of various animals in southern Africa. On {{the basis of these}} comparisons a synthesis model was developed which divided southern Africa into seven regions characterised by their susceptibility to invasion by alien aquatic animals with particular habitat requirements. - In the "data-rich," geographic information systems (GIS) approach, the distribution of trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Salmo trutta) in selected "sampled regions" was related to elevation (as a surrogate of water temperature) and median annual rainfall (MAR) (as a surrogate of water availability). Using concentration analysis, optimum conditions for <b>trout</b> were identified. <b>Regions</b> within a larger "predictive area" which satisfied these conditions, were plotted as a digital map using the IDRISI package. Using this method seven models of potential trout distribution were generated for the following regions: northern Natal (two); southern Natal/Lesotho/Transkei (three), eastern Cape (two) and western Cape (two). Since two of the models were used to refine the methods, only five models were considered for the final assessment. In a modification of the GIS method, another model of potential trout distribution, based on mean monthly July minimum air temperature and MAR parameters, was developed for the region bounded by 29 °- 34 °S and 26 °- 32 °E. This model showed marked similarities to another model, developed for the region bounded by 29 °- 32 °S and 26 °- 32 °E, which was based on elevation and MAR parameters. The validity of the models developed was assessed by independent experts. Of the six models considered, four received favourable judgements, one was equivocal and one was judged to be poor. Based on these assessments it was concluded that the GIS method has credibility and could be used to develop a "data-rich" model of the susceptibility of southern Africa to invasion by alien aquatic animals. This method represents an alternative to the bioclimatic matching approach developed by scientists in Australia. The GIS method has a number of advantages over the "traditional" method: it is more amenable to testing, has greater flexibility, stores more information, produces images of a finer resolution, and can be easily updated. The traditional method has the advantage of being less expensive and requiring a less extensive database. ...|$|R
40|$|The major aim of {{this thesis}} project was to {{determine}} the variables that most explain the elevated mercury concentrations in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a predatory aquatic fish species in some lakes in northwestern Canada. High mercury concentrations in lake <b>trout</b> in other <b>regions</b> have been associated with the biological features of the fish and various chemical and physical aspects of their aquatic ecosystems. Data including lake trout age, length, weight, and stable isotope values, water chemistry, latitude, and lake and watershed area were collected, compiled and then included in statistical analyses of the factors affecting mercury concentration in the muscle of lake trout from a series of lakes from the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) in the Northwest Territories (NT), Canada. These results are reported in Chapter 2. Fish age and lake surface area were the most important variables affecting mercury concentrations. However mercury concentration in muscle also was significantly (p < 0. 05) related to: fish length, weight, and &# 948; 13 C; watershed area to lake area ratio; and to total mercury concentration in zooplankton and water. These variables were run through best subsets analyses and multiple regressions {{in order to determine the}} regression equation most efficiently capable of predicting mercury concentration in lake trout in unstudied lakes in the MRB region. The resulting equation was: log Hg = 0. 698 – (0. 0156 × latitude) + (0. 0031 × age) + (0. 000535 × length) – (0. 245 × log lake area) + (0. 00675 × watershed area/lake area ratio), r 2 = 0. 73 Small lakes located in the southern NT and dominated by large and/or old lake trout are most likely to have lake trout whose mean mercury concentrations exceed 0. 5 &# 956;g/g; the guideline for the commercial sale of fish. Latitude may be linked to mean annual temperature (and variables such as duration of ice cover, summer water temperature) while fish age and length may be related in part to fishing pressures and growth rates on these lake populations. In chapter 3, a more in-depth study was undertaken to investigate of role of feeding and relative tropic level in the bioaccumulation of mercury in lake trout. This was accomplished by comparing MRB lake trout population characteristics with those from a series of lakes in northern Alberta and Saskatchewan (NAS). The two population groups were compared with respect to size, age, growth rates, and mercury concentrations. In addition, trophic and mercury biomagnification relationships, as inferred from stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, for the two lake trout populations were compared. Lake trout from the NT exhibited significantly higher mercury concentrations than those from the NAS lakes (p < 0. 001). Mercury concentrations in biota (including lake trout, forage fish, benthic invertebrates and zooplankton) were positively and significantly correlated to &# 948; 15 N values in all lakes in both of the study areas (p < 0. 001). Mercury biomagnification in the NT lakes, as estimated from the slope of &# 948; 15 N versus mercury concentration, was lower than in the NAS lakes. Thus, mercury biomagnifies more slowly in NT lake trout, but because of their greater mean age, reaches higher values than in NAS lakes. Northwest Territory lake trout generally exhibited more negative &# 948; 13 C values, indicating more pelagic feeding habits than in NAS lakes: higher mercury concentrations previously have been associated with more pelagic feeding. Finally, the relationship between mercury levels and growth rates in lake trout was investigated by comparing NAS and NT lake trout populations. These results are reported in chapter 4. Lake trout from the NT lakes grew at a slower rate (10. 4 mm per year) than those from the NAS lakes (35. 1 mm per year). Log mercury concentration was inversely correlated (p < 0. 001) with growth rate for both lake trout populations; however, growth rate explained more of the variation in mercury level in the NT lakes than in the NAS lakes (NT, r 2 = 0. 11, p < 0. 001; NAS, r 2 = 0. 03, p = 0. 024). However, the correlation between mercury concentration and growth rate in the NAS study area improved when Reindeer Lake, possibly affected by anthropogenic inputs, was removed from the analyses (r = 0. 13, p = 0. 001). Therefore, lower mercury levels in lake trout are associated with higher growth rates through growth dilution. The higher mercury concentrations in NT lake trout are due not only to the old age of the fish, but to slower growth rates as well...|$|R
