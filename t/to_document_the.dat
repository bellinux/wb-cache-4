5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1860, Rossier was in Shanghai, and it {{is likely}} that he visited the city in an attempt to gain {{permission}} to accompany the Anglo-French military expedition that had already arrived in northern China and thereby fulfill his commission <b>to</b> <b>document</b> <b>the</b> Second Opium War. If so, he was unsuccessful; both forces had already hired photographers <b>to</b> <b>document</b> <b>the</b> mission. The British forces were accompanied by the photographers Felice Beato and John Papillon, and the French by Antoine Fauchery, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Pin, and possibly also by Louis Legrand. Although Rossier failed even to embark on the mission he had been hired to document, he remained in East Asia for some time longer.|$|E

5|$|Living River Siam (Thai: โครงการแม่น้ำเพื่อชีวิต; {{formerly}} South East Asia Rivers Network, or SEARIN) is a Thai {{non-governmental organization}} (NGO) which analyzes {{the impact of}} Thailand's various dam projects and coordinates the research of indigenous peoples to give Thai villagers the power <b>to</b> <b>document</b> <b>the</b> influence of local rivers and dams. Founded in 1999, it gained prominence during the Pak Mun Dam study period in 2001, when it developed a method for instructing villagers on how <b>to</b> <b>document</b> <b>the</b> effects of the dammed river on their lives. When the Thai government proposed other dam sites, Living River Siam took its research methods to the villages surrounding those sites as well. Today, the organization works with other NGOs in Southeast Asia to counter government-sponsored research that encourages dam construction.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became {{a faculty member at}} various universities, and spent most of his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins <b>to</b> <b>document</b> <b>the</b> contributions of genetics and the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field of psychiatric genetics.|$|E
5|$|Another epic film, On My Honor, was {{conceived}} and begun by Cecil B. DeMille.

The screenplay, by Jesse Lasky, Jr., focused on Baden-Powell, Burnham and other pioneers who were {{to have a major}} influence on Scouting. After DeMille's death, associate producer Henry Wilcoxon continued to work on the film until 1962, hiring Sydney Box to assist with the script. Starting in 2001, producers Jerry Molen and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille's project, using an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky and Box.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Francisco Layna Serrano {{of nearby}} Ruguilla {{had for years}} tried to save the monastery but had failed to {{interest}} {{the government in the}} expensive preservation proposal. Realizing that this was his last chance <b>to</b> <b>document</b> <b>the</b> place as its stones were being removed, he wrote a monograph of its history and included a site plan of the layout of buildings, written from memory. As a result of his efforts, on June 3, 1931, Santa María de Óvila was listed as a National Monument of Spain, or Bien de Interés Cultural (Cultural Property). Layna Serrano published his monograph in 1932. In 1933, the monastery's historic cartulary was brought to the University of Madrid and published; the original was archived at the University of Oviedo.|$|E

The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were fired. The POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet NKVD until 1947. In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR.

5|$|Harold Innis {{wrote his}} PhD thesis {{on the history}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR).

Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt <b>to</b> <b>document</b> <b>the</b> railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E
5|$|Having {{believed}} {{that they would be}} participating in Russian's television programme for an entire year, most contestants had given up their homes, jobs and partners—most had to find new employment and some were forced to move in with their parents. Russian went into hiding and was unable to be reached by his victims. On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film and told them about the hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme <b>to</b> <b>document</b> <b>the</b> story of the con and how the participants were now trying to get their lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 Tange and the {{architectural}} journalist and critic Noboru Kawazoe {{were invited to}} attend {{the reconstruction of the}} Ise Shrine.

The ceremony coincided {{with the end of the}} American Occupation and it seemed to symbolise a new start in Japanese architecture. In 1965 when Tange and Kawazoe published the book Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture, he likened the building to a modernist structure: an honest expression of materials, a functional design and prefabricated elements.|$|E

The Sumatran Tiger Project (STP) was initiated in June 1995 {{in and around}} the Way Kambas National Park in order to ensure the long-term viability of wild Sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations. By August 1999, the teams of the STP had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in Lampung Province, of which only 15 these were intact enough to contain tigers. In the framework of the STP a community-based conservation programme was initiated <b>to</b> <b>document</b> <b>the</b> tiger-human dimension in the park in order to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions.|$|E

5|$|In February 1858 Felice Beato {{arrived in}} Calcutta and began {{travelling}} throughout Northern India <b>to</b> <b>document</b> <b>the</b> {{aftermath of the}} Indian Rebellion of 1857.

He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862.|$|E
