5|$|Capybaras are farmed {{for meat}} and skins in South America. The meat is {{considered}} unsuitable {{to eat in}} some areas, while in other areas it is considered {{an important source of}} protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation to allow it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>eaten</b> while other meats are generally forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis {{within the}} genus Leioproctus exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of {{many species of}} Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers, but {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators.

5|$|Fruit and vegetables, {{particularly}} leafy vegetables, {{have been}} implicated in nearly half the gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in the United States. These foods are commonly eaten raw and may become contaminated during their preparation by an infected food handler.

5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>eaten</b> in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E

5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus that also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Particular species recorded on P.levis include the longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons. Weighing 1700mg (0.60oz), the fruit are adapted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>eaten</b> by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs and other large birds. The flowers of P.levis are self-incompatible—that is, they are unable to fertilise themselves and require outcrossing to another plant.|$|E

After his escape he encounters Rider, who has been pegged out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>eaten</b> by crabs; they had ignored her and she managed to escape.|$|E

5|$|Parents of Amador Valley {{students}} {{became involved}} with student activities. In 1927, Pleasanton mothers decided to start a school lunch program {{to provide students with}} a better environment for learning. Parents donated pots and pans, and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>eaten</b> at new tables and benches. The tables and benches were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus. This project {{led to the formation of}} a Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) chapter at Amador Valley in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>eaten</b> in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E

5|$|Andromeda {{is one of}} the 48 constellations {{listed by}} the 2nd-century Greco-Roman {{astronomer}} Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the celestial equator, it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained to a rock <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>eaten</b> by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It {{is one of the}} largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees. This is over 1,400 times the size of the full moon, 55% of the size of the largest constellation, Hydra, and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, Crux.|$|E

The survivors escape in the chopper as the nuclear bomb detonates over the City Hall, catching the chopper in the blast wave and forcing it to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela during the crash and is impaled on a metal pole, killing her.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Ramsay Plane Food is a {{restaurant}} owned by chef Gordon Ramsay and located within Terminal 5 of Heathrow Airport, London.

Ramsay said that he aimed to keep the menu lean without the use of heavy sauces, and menus are also offered for quick dining as well as takeaway cool boxes which contain a three course meal <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>eaten</b> on a plane.|$|E

50|$|Talo {{was used}} as bread in Basque houses (originally in Gipuzkoa), and the remainings were mixed with milk making {{something}} similar <b>to</b> soup, which <b>was</b> <b>eaten</b> for dinner.
