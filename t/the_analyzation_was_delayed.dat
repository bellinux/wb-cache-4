Many concepts which Varèse translated into musical thought were not solely musical. They were also represented in twentieth century painting, architecture, poetry, science, mathematics, and technology. An understanding of Varèse's works required a redefined approach for listening. The pursuit of this study is, therefore, relevant and justified. This document is organized in four chapters. The first chapter will examine Varèse's personal development through an overview of important influences in his life, and his aesthetic philosophies. Chapter 2 will demonstrate how Varèse's own statements helped determine the approach for <b>the</b> author's <b>analyzations.</b> Chapters 3 and 4 deal directly with <b>the</b> <b>analyzations</b> of Intégrales and Déserts.

50|$|Prediction and {{monitoring}} {{are important for}} the study of CSTs and their effects. However, factors that determine the origin and fate of cross-species transmission events remain unclear for the majority of human pathogens. This has resulted in the use of different statistical models for <b>the</b> <b>analyzation</b> of CST. Some of these include risk-analysis models, single rate dated tip (SRDT) models, and phylogenetic diffusion models. The study of the genomes of pathogens involved in CST events is very useful in determining their origin and fate. This is because a pathogens genetic diversity and mutation rate are key factors in determining if it is able to transmit across multiple hosts. This makes it important for the genomes of transmission species to be partially or completely sequenced. A change in genomic structure could cause a pathogen that has narrow host range to become capable of exploiting a wider host range. Genetic distance between different species, geographical range, and other interaction barriers will also influence cross-species transmission.|$|R
