40|$|Pearl millet is {{a source}} of both food grains for humans and dry fodder for their {{ruminant}} livestock in the semi-arid and arid tropics of Asia and Africa. Recently, pearl millet has occupied large areas during summer season in India and is also in great demand in central Asian countries for cultivation as forage crop, but very few cultivar options are available to farmers for this ecology. The objective of this study was to: 1) identify sources of higher stover yield and fodder quality traits, 2) initiate their utilization in breeding programs; and 3) identify OPVs and hybrids with higher stover yield and fodder quality. A set of 242 pearl millets from a minicore collection was evaluated for stover linked traits during summer and rainy seasons of 2013 at ICRISAT, Patancheru. Based on 2 -season evaluation, about 10 % best (21 accessions) having high fresh stover yield (23 to 38 tons ha- 1) and dry stover yield (8 to 13 tons ha– 1) at 85 – 90 days after planting were selected and further evaluated in the rainy season of 2014 along with checks at 6 locations in India. The dry stover yield of check OPVs varied from 15 – 21 tons ha– 1, and in check hybrids from 16 tons (DFMH 30) to 19. 7 tons ha– 1 (Nutrifeed). IP 22269 had highest dry stover yield (19 tons ha– 1), followed by IP 20577 (18 tons ha– 1) and IP 20409 (16. 6 tons ha– 1) and total of 11 accessions had dry stover yield of > 14 tons ha– 1. These accessions were also evaluated at ICRISAT during rainy season of 2014 along with earlier identified OPVs/germplasm accessions and top-cross hybrids. The identified 21 accessions had a wide range of stover nitrogen content (0. 88 to 1. 24 %), in vitro digestibility (39. 8 to 45. 4 %), and metabolizable energy (ME) (5. 3 to 6. 4 MJ·kg– 1). Twenty of these identified accessions had in vitro digestibility of > 40 %; and IP 14294 had highest in vitro digestibility (45. 4 %) along with highest ME (6. 4 MJ·kg– 1). These identified accessions were subjected to inbreeding yielding about 270 early generation inbreds (S 1 s-S 3 s), which will further be used for deriving breeding lines for the development of new hybrids and OPVs with high stover yield and fodder quality.

In order to increase the competitiveness of B. rapa, significant increases in seed yield must be achieved. The development of hybrid cultivars of B. rapa could {{provide the basis for}} high yield. The objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of B. rapa doubled haploid (DH) lines and their potential use as parents in hybrid cultivars. A total of 162 DH lines, derived from five B. rapa breeding populations were evaluated in field tests at Saskatoon. Bud pollination was used to obtain selfed seed for evaluation of the DH lines. Sixteen <b>top</b> <b>cross</b> and 27 polycross progenies and 45 single <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> were evaluated in the field to measure combining ability of DH lines. Many B. rapa DH lines were chlorophyll deficient as a result of expression of recessive alleles, a classical inbreeding phenomenon. Average seed and biological yield and number of seeds/pod of DH lines were only 24, 48, 46 % of their donor populations, indicating severe inbreeding depression. Inbreeding greatly extended days to flowering. However, seed weight, pod length and days to mature were less severely affected than other traits measured. Several DH lines equaled their donor population in plant weight and height at specific stages of growth, however, on average the overall growth and development of the DH lines was slower than their respective donor populations. One DH line (BC- 3015) equaled the seed and biomass yields of its donor population, suggesting that dominance deviation not overdominance was the genetic basis of high yield in B. rapa. It is suggested that chlorophyll deficient, late flowering DH plants could be discarded on the basis of greenhouse performance. <b>Top</b> <b>cross</b> and polycross procedures were equally effective in ranking DH lines for general combining ability (GCA). The <b>top</b> <b>cross</b> method of predicting GCA is the preferred method since it will allow the use of a weak, recessive tester which will not mask dominant alleles present in DH lines. Hybridity of <b>top</b> <b>cross</b> seed was high as measured by the erucic acid marker. The single cross procedure identified heterotic combinations which were different from those identified in the <b>top</b> <b>cross</b> and polycross methods. It was concluded that this difference was caused by the differential effects of male parents used to determine GCA. One single <b>cross</b> <b>hybrid</b> yielded significantly more seed than the check cultivar Tobin (130 %).

Cluster analysis divided theinbreds into two clusters that were confirmed by principalcoordinate analysis. Two promising QPM hybrids that arecrossed from different heterotic group were found. Theestimated value of simple correlations (r) of GDs with thegain yield of single <b>cross</b> <b>hybrid</b> was negatif (- 0. 07). There isa need to conduct more field trials to obtain more accuratecorrelations, particularly in a practical utility for predictingmaize hybrid performance for grain yield...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The {{success of}} a plant {{breeding}} program depends upon the availability of useable genetic diversity. Such diversity may be enhanced {{depending on the type}} of hybridization strategy employed. Segregating progenies resulting from F 2 populations, a double <b>cross,</b> and a <b>top</b> <b>cross</b> were compared for the amount of useable genetic diversity associated with six traits in durum wheat. The parental lines were three winter selections, H 7092 - 11, H 7092 - 52, and WD 5, and two spring cultivars, WPB 881 and Altar 84. Traits evaluated were (1) plant height, (2) days to maturity, (3) harvest index, (4) kernel weight, (5) grain yield, and (6) pigment content. Analysis of the population mean values suggested the superiority of the F 1 <b>top</b> <b>cross</b> for plant height, kernel weight, and grain yield. The F 1 <b>top</b> <b>cross</b> progeny also had the highest genetic variability for grain yield. F 2 population of the cross Altar 84 I H 7092 - 52 gave the highest mean values for days to maturity and harvest index, and showed the highest genetic diversity for traits other than grain yield. The only population showing detectable genetic variance for pigment content was the F 2 progeny of the single cross WPB 881 / H 7092 - 11. When genetic diversity was detected, the double cross was approximately intermediate between the two F 2 populations from which it was derived. Transgressive segregation was more frequent in the <b>top</b> <b>cross</b> population for grain yield, kernel weight, and plant height. No associations between grain yield and the other traits were noted for the F 2 population of the single cross Altar 84 I H 7092 - 52 and the <b>top</b> <b>cross</b> population. For the second F 2 population (WPB 881 / H 7092 - 11) and the double cross population, grain yield was found to be associated with harvest index and plant height. The only consistent relationship across all segregating generations was a negative correlation between plant height and harvest index. Based on the genetic diversity and the transgressive segregation observed, <b>top</b> <b>crossing</b> appears to be the more promising in improving grain yield in the experimental material investigated. For specific traits other than grain yield, it would appear that single crosses would be a more productive approach, however progress would depend on the specific parental combination. The double cross was inferior to the other crossing strategies for the traits measured...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the genetic}} variability, {{heritability}} and genetic advance of traits in any plant population {{is an important}} pre-requisite for selection program. This {{study was designed to}} assess the magnitude of genetic variability, heritability and genetic advance of traits in top-cross and three-way cross maize (Zea mays L) hybrids evaluated at three locations in South-Western Nigeria. The trial consisted of ten genotypes each of top-cross and three-way <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> arranged in randomized complete block design with three replications. Data on grain yield and other desirable traits across the three locations were used to estimate the genetic variability parameters, heritability and genetic advance (GA). Highly significant (P ≤ 0. 01) differences were detected within each hybrid class for all the traits. Traits evaluated in this study exhibited different levels of variability, heritability and genetic advance between the two hybrid classes. Low to moderate phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) and genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) were recorded. Also, low to very high heritability and low to high GA values were recorded for all the traits measured in the top-cross hybrids, whereas the three-way <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> exhibited low to moderately high heritability estimates and low to moderate GA values. Grain yield and field weight showed moderate GCV, moderately high heritability and high GA values in top-cross hybrids. These characters exhibited moderate GCV but low heritability and GA values in three-way hybrids. More characters in top-cross hybrids revealed sufficient amount of variability than in three-way <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids,</b> thus offer scope for genetic improvement through selection.

The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|R

40|$|Maize grain {{production}} may {{be increased}} by growing varieties that utilize the available nutrients in the soil efficiently. High grain yield of maize could be achieved when hybrid variety was planted under the optimal rate of fertilization. However, application of fertilizer on agricultural land in large quantities {{have a negative impact}} on the environment. Therefore, maize variety that is able to use fertilizer efficiently is needed, which would be reducing the environmental impact from a high fertilization and also helping farmers who are less able to provide optimal fertilizer rate or those who are growing maize under the marginal land. Maize genotypes developed by diallel mating and their parents were tested under nested design, three replications on two levels of nitrogen fertilization (low and optimal N level, as nested factor). The full diallel <b>crosses</b> (<b>hybrids</b> and reciprocals) derived from five inbred lines were tested using Griffing method I. Result indicated that H 3, H 7 and H 9 hybrids were adaptable to low N. Inbred G 2 and G 5 were suitable for optimal N fertilization condition, and their single <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> using H 7 as parent was suitable for the low N fertilization condition. Inbred G 4 was suitable for low N condition and inbred G 5 was suitable for the optimal N condition. Single <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> of H 10 was as parent suitable for N optimal condition. It was shown that maize hybrids suitable for low or optimal N fertilizations could be generated from either pairs of inbreds adaptif under low N or optimal N conditions. Inbred lines adapted to certain N fertilization may not necessarily produced hybrid adapted to the same N level of environment...|$|R
