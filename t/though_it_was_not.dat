First-edition copies of his earlier works have become collector's items. His novel Testosterone was adapted to a film of the same name, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a financial success. Two other books have been optioned for films, but they have not been produced.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia, Serbia ceased using many of the awards and decorations {{established}} during the communist period, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> until 2010 that the Serbian Government officially reinstated the Order of Karađorđe's Star as Serbia's highest decoration. During the Cold War, it had been awarded by the Karađorđević family in exile. The first person to receive it following its reinstatement as a state order was the tennis player Novak Djokovic, in February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and {{is found in}} many zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> identified until 1923, by Coster and Hevesy, making it the last stable element to be discovered. Hafnium is named after Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.|$|E

In the 1950s and 1960s, it was extended {{east to the}} Quebec border and west to the newly opened Highway17 over Lake Superior. The highway reached its maximum length in 1967, and remained unchanged until 1997, when a section through Timmins {{was transferred to the}} responsibility of that city.|$|E

5|$|The pub ceased {{trading in}} 1921 and the {{building}} was sold to restaurateurs J. Lyons and Co. It was adapted as the flagship site of the business, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> technically a standard Lyons Corners House. The restaurant remained popular, and could accommodate up to 300 people, as did Lyons Corner Houses across London throughout the 1920s and 30s, but fell out of favour as fast food began to become popular in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Wark's final {{full season}} at Portman Road, 1982–83, {{had seen him}} record the highest league goals tally of his career. He scored 20 goals in 42 league games, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough to prevent Ipswich from {{slipping}} to ninth place in the final table – their lowest position since finishing 18th in 1978.|$|E
5|$|According to Muslim biographies, Muhammed, having {{received}} intelligence that Byzantine forces were concentrating in northern Arabia with alleged intentions of invading Arabia, led a Muslim army north to Tabouk in present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia, {{with the intention}} of pre-emptively engaging the Byzantine army; the news, however, proved to be false. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a battle in the typical sense, nevertheless the event represented the first Arab attack on the Byzantines. It did not, however, lead immediately to a military confrontation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the money}} was duly raised and the bronze cast of the statue was finally {{completed}} in 1856, a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years. The original idea had been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition. This prompted opposition, as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry's newly completed Palace of Westminster. Various other locations to display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached {{that it would be}} placed in Old Palace Yard, Marochetti's preferred location. It was installed in October 1860, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> until March 1867 that it was finally completed with the addition of bronze bas-reliefs {{on either side of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Saran {{made her}} Malayalam debut with Pokkiri Raja, {{in which she}} {{appeared}} opposite Mammootty and Prithviraj. The film was declared a super hit in the first week, breaking the record in Malayalam cinema for opening week gross income, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> received well critically. It was said of Saran that {{all she had to}} do was look pretty. She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she stole the show with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|E
5|$|In March 1927, Hawks {{signed a}} new one-year, three-picture {{contract}} with Fox and {{was assigned to}} direct Fazil, based on the play L'Insoumise by Pierre Frondaie. Hawks again worked with Seton Miller on the script about a Middle Eastern prince who has {{an affair with a}} Parisienne showgirl and cast Charles Farrell as the prince and Greta Nissen as Fabienne. Hawks went both over schedule and over budget on the film, which began a rift between him and Sol Wurtzel that would eventually lead to Hawks leaving Fox. The film was finished in August 1927, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> released until June 1928.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, San Sebastian Church has {{encountered}} threats to its structural integrity. The steel structure has been beset by rust and corrosion due to sea breezes from nearby Manila Bay. State funding was accorded {{to the church}} through the National Historical Institute which undertook restoration in 1982. The Recollect community has likewise expended funds for the church's maintenance and restoration. In 1998, it {{was placed on the}} biennial watchlist of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> retained in the subsequent watchlists.|$|E
5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (<b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) {{and the size}} of its luggage compartment (572 litres). But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E
5|$|It {{was placed}} on the Top Ten lists of several critics, with Roger Ebert giving it four stars, and listed it as 2005's eighth best film. The film {{received}} four Academy Award nominations, for Visual Effects, Sound Mixing (Christopher Boyes, Michael Semanick, Michael Hedges, Hammond Peek), Sound Editing, and Production Design, winning all but the last. Entertainment Weekly called the depiction of Kong the most convincing computer-generated character in film in 2005. Some criticized the film for retaining racist stereotypes that had been present in the 1933 film, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> suggested that Jackson had done this intentionally.|$|E

5|$|The Brooksville Tunnel is {{the most}} {{difficult}} work of the kind, I have seen any record of: at the Western entrance, the pressure of the big slides actually causes the bottom to surge up, as is sometime the case in coal mines; in view of the sliding tendency and immense pressure of this ground, it will be advisable to enter on that side with an invested arch to prevent a collapse...This work is vastly more difficult than the Greenwood Tunnel was, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not,</b> by any means, an easy safe job.|$|E
5|$|The South Pavilions were {{designed}} by architect Renzo Piano of Renzo Piano Building Workshop. Piano designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing, which is across Monroe Street from the South Pavilions and opened in 2009. The facades of the South Pavilions are limestone and glass in order to complement the Modern Wing, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> completed until several years after the pavilions were finished. Piano also designed the Nichols Bridgeway, which connects Millennium Park and the Art Institute, and is next to the Southwest Pavilion.|$|E
5|$|The {{elaborate}} {{style of}} European monarchies left a favorable impression on Kalākaua. Construction on Iolani Palace {{had begun in}} 1879, and was ongoing when Kalākaua was touring the world, with an appropriation from the legislature of $80,000. Even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> fully completed until December 1882, the King was living there prior to his departure on his world tour. The influence of European palaces {{was reflected in the}} interior design and expensive furnishings. The final cost was $343,595. Immediately upon completion, the King invited all 120 members of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie to the palace for a lodge meeting.|$|E
