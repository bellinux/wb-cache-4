As a campaign issue, Edwards focused on Illinois' dire financial situation, blaming Sloo and Hubbard and other legislators for it. Edwards won 49.5percent of the vote to Sloo's 46percent, with the rest going to Hubbard.|$|E
5|$|Parry's {{opportunity}} to study music {{came in the form}} of a temporary closure of the iron works where he was employed. Parry had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> become friendly with three fellow workers who were also musicians. During rest periods, the three often would sing. Parry listened with interest at first, later joining in. One of the men started a music sight-reading class while the iron works was closed; Parry joined this class and became a fine sight-reader. His interest in harmony made him want to study that also. One of his other co-workers agreed to take Parry as a pupil. Young Parry was unable to read or write at the time he began harmony studies. The teacher patiently blended reading lessons with principles of harmony, and Parry quickly became skilled at both; the teacher often found it hard to keep up with his pupil. During this time, Parry also learned to play the harmonium.|$|E

25|$|Gustave Eiffel's {{career was}} {{facilitated}} by the Industrial Revolution. For a variety {{of economic and political}} reasons, this had been slow to make an impact in France, and Eiffel had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> be working at a time of rapid industrial development in France. Eiffel's importance as an engineer was twofold. Firstly he was ready to adopt innovative techniques first used by others, such as his use of compressed-air caissons and hollow cast-iron piers, and secondly he was a pioneer in his insistence on basing all engineering decisions on thorough calculation of the forces involved, combining this analytical approach with an insistence on a high standard of accuracy in drawing and manufacture.|$|E

25|$|In late October, {{elements}} of the newly renamed 4th Ukrainian Front reached the three traditional entrances to the Crimea: the Perekop Isthmus, the Chongar Narrows and the Arabat Spit. The German and Romanian forces of German 17th Army scrambled to cover these gateways, {{and were able to}} block further Soviet advances. However, in doing so they left the south shore of the Sivash unprotected. Lt. Col. P.E. Kuznetsov, chief of intelligence of 10th Rifle Corps, was tasked by his superiors to find usable fords across the shallow sea. Kuznetsov took a scouting party of 30 men, and had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> find a local fisherman who identified a crossing site from the mainland to Cape Dzhangar. Three of the scouts crossed the 2km-wide stretch of water, which was only ankle-deep. The next morning, November 1, the entire party made its way over, and then signaled to the Corps to begin crossing. Major P.F. Kaymakova led his battalion of the 1168th Rifle Regiment over first, {{with the rest of the}} 346th crossing soon after, followed by the 216th and 257th Rifle Divisions. A few heavy weapons, including some 45mm antitank guns, were brought over on shallow-draft pontoons, but mostly the men were limited to what they could carry. There were no Axis troops within 5km of the crossing site, and although it was mostly carried out in broad daylight, it was hours before the enemy was aware of the crossing. Before they could react the bridgehead was expanded to a size they could only hope to contain, but without tanks or heavy weapons 10th Corps could not break through the screening forces rushed in by 17th Army. A pontoon bridge was not completed until December 9, by which time the Axis line had been reinforced by the German 336th Infantry Division. The position remained in a stalemate until April, 1944.|$|E

[...] His zeal for science had been stirred at Cambridge by reading Herschel's book on philosophy of science, which had guided his theorising during the voyage.

[...] and opening a way for bold speculation on [...] "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others."

500|$|At midnight, the French ships {{crossed the}} bows of the convoy and by morning were [...] to windward, to the south.

Retaining their formation, the combined batteries of the Indiamen and Blenheim dissuaded Linois from the pressing the attack and he veered off at [...] distance, holding position {{for the rest of}} the day before turning southwards at 21:00 and disappearing. Troubridge wanted to pursue in Blenheim, but was dissuaded by the presence of Belle Poule, which could attack the convoy while the ships of the line were engaged. He expressed confidence however that he would have been successful in any engagement and wrote [...] "I trust I shall yet have <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fortune</b> <b>to</b> fall in with him when unencumber'd with convoy". Linois's withdrawal was prudent: his mainmast had been struck during the brief cannonade and was at risk of collapse if the engagement continued. Losses among the crew were light, Marengo suffering eight men wounded and Belle Poule none. British casualties were slightly heavier, a passenger on Blenheim named Mr. Cook was killed by langrage shot and a sailor was killed on the Indiaman Ganges by a roundshot. No British ships suffered anything more than superficial damage in the combat, and the convoy continued its journey uninterrupted, arriving at Madras on 23 August.|$|E
