The O.T.O. also held a memorial service—with attendees including Helen and Sara—at which Smith led the Gnostic Mass.|$|E
5|$|In St. Paul, Minnesota, {{a funeral}} is held {{for a young}} girl named Jennifer Soames. The {{ceremony}} is observed by Donnie Pfaster, the eerie assistant director for <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home.</b> Later that night, as the girl's body is being stored for burial the following day, Pfaster's boss finds him cutting off the corpse's hair. Pfaster is promptly fired.|$|E
30|$|Based on this logic, <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> hardly {{seem to have}} {{referred}} to the same consumers in these two contexts, as neither the buyers of discount funerals could be termed as “value-affiliated,” nor could the “conservative” consumers conceive discount funerals to be appropriate. However, with such narrative inflections, <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> could rationalize <b>the</b> established pattern and eliminate any need for questioning their strategic premises.|$|R

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after his death, a legal battle arose over Banks' estate and the {{disposition}} of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth {{said that he had}} amended his will in October without her knowledge. The new will left all of Banks' assets to his longtime caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his will. A Chicago funeral home sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> costs.|$|E
5|$|When Locke {{leaves the}} island to bring the {{survivors}} back to the island, Ben tracks him down. He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, {{but the only way}} to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob. As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob. Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him - and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.|$|E

30|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> seemed {{unable to}} trace the {{customers}} who did not return, they could only obtain feedback from those customers who did return. However, their feedback hardly seemed to disconfirm strategic premises because “there is hardly anyone who says, ‘I did not like what we did 20  years ago’” (Expert 8). Because customers in <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> industry in Berlin “hardly ever complain {{but it is possible}} that they will never return” (Expert 13), it seemed hardly possible for negative feedback to reach <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>homes.</b> Such tapered market feedback appeared to minimize doubts about the timeliness of strategic premises.|$|R
25|$|The Funeral Rule {{does not}} prevent <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> from {{charging}} a mark-up on cash advance items, nor does it require <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> to disclose {{the amount of the}} charge, rebate, commission or discount.|$|E

30|$|The {{complexity}} of the provided service seemed to require a direct and personal contact with customers in time-consuming counseling appointments. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> could leverage their counseling competence to achieve quasi-permanent customer retention because “those who return after 5  years often {{want to talk to}} the same advisor, particularly because they had revealed many intimate details” (Expert 1). Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> predominantly defined themselves by referring to their counseling competence—“the noblest task” (Expert 4)—because it reproduced reliable results over time consistent with the very definition of a competence (Schreyögg and Kliesch-Eberl 2007).|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1968, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of ambulance services in Nova Scotia were based out of <b>funeral</b> <b>homes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> had been <b>the</b> only service available twenty-four hours day with vehicles capable of transporting patients in a horizontal position.|$|R

25|$|Since {{receiving}} Dr. Morse's {{opinion that}} his daughter had died from pancreatitis, Robinson had been consulting doctors on the matter, who had advised him {{that this was an}} unlikely cause of death. On the morning of Friday, March 21, the day of Joan Robinson Hill's funeral, Ash Robinson visited the office of Assistant District Attorney I. D. McMaster, where he accused John Hill of killing his wife, telling McMaster of the circumstances surrounding her death and autopsy. McMaster asked Harris County Medical Examiner Joseph Jachimczyk to go to <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> to examine the body before the funeral. Jachimczyk ordered Morse to hand over blood and urine specimens taken from Robinson Hill. He then drove to <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> to view the body.|$|E

25|$|Texas {{state law}} at the time {{required}} an autopsy, before any embalming or burial could take place, for anyone {{who died in a}} hospital within twenty-four hours of admission. Dr. Bertinot spoke to John Hill about the legal need for an autopsy. Hill asked Jim Oates to call a local funeral home to claim Robinson Hill's body. Less than four hours after her death, <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> removed Robinson Hill's body from the hospital.|$|E

30|$|To {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} {{description of the}} identified mechanisms that stabilize strategic premises, I structure the case description {{in line with the}} analytical steps that were necessary to explore these mechanisms. Thus, at the outset, I describe the path in which <b>the</b> incumbent <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> in Berlin were trapped, how the organizations entered a severe crisis, and how they reacted to the crisis (Koch 2008, 2011). Then, I reconstruct the underlying strategic premises that entrenched <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> homes’ strategic activities and led to the pathological reproduction of the path. Last, I describe how <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> stabilized these strategic premises despite the ongoing crisis.|$|R

25|$|One {{fatality}} {{has been}} reported in extreme Southeast Texas related to Ike. It was {{as a result of a}} generator fire when power was out. Despite official assurances that this was the only Ike-related death in the area, rumors spread that large numbers of people died during the storm. This was fueled by the presence of refrigerated trailers outside a Beaumont funeral home. <b>The</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> had lost electrical service and was using the trailers to store bodies of people who died of natural causes until burials could be arranged.|$|E
