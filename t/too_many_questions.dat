However, patient Jan Morris wrote that Burou did not bother too much with diagnosis or previous treatment. Burou later confirmed {{that he did not}} ask his patients <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions,</b> but sought to fulfil their wishes, and that he did restrict his services to male-to-female (MTF) transsexuals with a distinct “feminine” appearance or character. He refused his services to minors even if they had parental consent, because he felt “the operation is definitive and irreversible and one… could not risk making a mistake.” His international patients were often admitted the afternoon they arrived at the clinic, and were prepared for surgery as soon as that evening or the next morning.|$|E
25|$|There are {{echoes of}} Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, and other {{historical}} and biographical writers {{from the ancient}} world. The most frequent intertexts are the Homeric epics. The novel is told in a linear manner; after a brief first person introduction by Chariton, the narrator uses the third person. Much {{of the novel is}} told in direct speech, revealing the importance of oratory and rhetorical display (as in the presentation before the King of Persia) and perhaps as well the influence of New Comedy. Dramatic monologues are also used to reveal the conflicted states of the characters' emotions and fears (what should Callirhoe do, given that she is pregnant and alone?). The novel also has some amusing insights into ancient culture (for instance, the pirates decide to sell Callirhoe in Miletus rather than in the equally wealthy Athens, because they considered Athenians to be litigious busybodies who would ask <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions).</b>|$|E

500|$|With {{respect to}} Jon Snow's resurrection, Jeremy Egner of The New York Times wrote {{that it was}} [...] "a mostly {{perfunctory}} resolution." [...] He said [...] "Jon Snow's assassination was astonishing immediately when it happened but, upon further consideration, seemed destined to be overturned on magical appeal. There were <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> (his parentage) and teased confrontations (the White Walkers) that would be left unresolved, and the show's entire Wall story line would be left with a bastard-sized hole in the middle." [...] Egner also referred to the previous plot in the show involving Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, and speculated what it could mean in regards to Jon Snow's personality being changed, or becoming less of his former self, as with Dondarrion. Sarah Larson of The New Yorker also reviewed the episode positively, saying, [...] "Last night's episode, still catching us up on all the characters while continuing to move its armies of plot lines forward, was full of fratricide, patricide, head-crushing, infanticide, trompe-l'oeil eyeballs, eunuch jokes, and glorious returns." ...|$|E
500|$|Piper's 2010 {{appearance}} in The End of Time, Tennant's final {{story as a}} series regular, was leaked by the press in May 2009 when Piper was seen photographed on location with Coduri and Tennant. Though Davies had intended the serial to end with the Tenth Doctor visiting his former companions, he struggled with how to include Rose. An initial idea was for Rose to appear with her part-human Doctor in the parallel universe, where both would sense the original Tenth Doctor regenerating. However, Davies felt this would raise <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> about {{their lives in the}} parallel universe. Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat, felt that Davies ended Rose's story in the perfect way by choosing to take it {{back to the beginning of}} her acquaintance with the Doctor. [...] Piper's return for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary episode was confirmed in March 2013. Moffat wished to include Piper in the episode because he felt that she symbolised the rebirth of Doctor Who. As he did not feel comfortable adding to Davies' story arc, he chose instead to re-introduce her Bad Wolf persona. During the episode Piper's character has dialogue solely with John Hurt's War Doctor, and is unseen by the other characters, including the Tenth Doctor. Reviewers noted similarities between the characterisation of Bad Wolf Rose and that of a plot device used by Charles Dickens in his 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. Ted B. Kissell, a journalist for The Atlantic likened the War Doctor to Ebenezer Scrooge and dubbed Rose the [...] "Ghost of Doctors Yet to Come".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly mixed. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a grade of B-, calling it [...] "offbeat and cute". Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club was mixed, writing that [...] "the {{handling of the}} rape case left a bad taste in my mouth" [...] and that the resolution was [...] "a bit fuzzy". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a 6/10, noting [...] "Overall, this episode focused on a very interesting concept, but the execution of that concept is so hopelessly convoluted that it’s lost in the shuffle. However, using the disturbing and abusive atmosphere of a nursing home as a setting provides chills without the addition of sinister spirits, so on a gut level, the episode works well." [...] Sarah Stegall awarded the episode three stars out of five and noted [...] "could have gotten five [...] out of five", but that the episode's lack of closure {{and the presence of}} <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> left unresolved caused it to be less than one of [...] "the best episodes". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a largely critical review and rated it one star out of five. The two referred to the entry as [...] "the idiot's version" [...] of the earlier episode [...] "One Breath". Shearman and Pearson derided the handling of the rape, noting that [...] "there's a sour atmosphere to the whole proceedings", pointing out that [...] "only Scully shows the slightest concern that a woman's been sexually assaulted." [...] However, the two called the ghost effects [...] "eerie", but concluded that the scripting was [...] "very stupid".|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} after the sale, Edwards asked Connelly if he would accept the card for his auction. Connelly consented and took the card across the country to {{prospective}} buyers. Meanwhile, HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel decided to cover the progress of Cobb and Edwards' struggles with the card. Connelly met a card dealer in New York City, Mike Mangasarian, who was sent on behalf of a prominent collector to check the card out. Mr. Mangasarian said the card seemed authentic and stated he would attend the auction for the card later on if the card could be taken out of the thick lucite holder for a closer examination. A promise was made that this could be done the day of the auction in Binghamton, NY. After the auction and by not bidding on the card Mr. Mangasarian revealed to HBO that he felt the back of the card was indeed real but in his opinion the front was not. He explained that all T-206's have dark brown letters printed for the team and players name and this one was in black. Additionally, he stated that he was not comfortable with the print process exhibited on the card front. Meanwhile, a number of card collectors who doubted the card contacted eBay and demanded that the card's listing on the website be removed. eBay officials finally pulled the plug the day before the actual Connelly auction was to begin. As a result, a number of previously interested collectors decided not to bid for the card at the auction the next day. As Connelly pointed out, the collectors chose not to make bids because [...] "hen eBay pulled the card ... it raised <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> about its authenticity." ...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} compare {{questions}} {{generated from the}} knowledge base, mined from the web, and collected from textbooks, we first examined {{the coverage of the}} human-generated questions (the latter two categories) by the questions generated from the knowledge base. As expected, the machine-generated questions had a much higher coverage of shallow human questions than deep human questions. This is not a surprise because each question generation schema used with the knowledge base only accessed a small number of knowledge base relationship. We tried generating complex question schema using seed questions to infer the pattern of knowledge base relationships for the schema. This turned out to be too sensitive to the details of the knowledge base. Some seed <b>questions</b> generated far <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>question</b> schemas for a human author to check, and other seed questions generated too few candidates. Therefore, when questions are generated from a knowledge base, it seems that a practical method is to have a human write the constraints for generation.|$|R

[...] In her review for The New York Times, Caryn James claimed that the film had [...] "at least four endings," [...] and [...] "by the time the last ending of this two-and-a-quarter-hour film comes along, the effect is like getting off a demon roller coaster that has kept racing several laps after you were ready to get off." [...] Chris Dafoe, in his review for The Globe and Mail, wrote, [...] "At its best, The Abyss offers a harrowing, thrilling journey through inky waters and high tension.

2500|$|Eurogamer Wesley Yin-Poole {{observed}} that following No Man's Sky problematic release, developers {{appear to be}} [...] "keeping their cards close to their chests for fear of failing to deliver on a promise that never should have slipped {{out in the first}} place"; as an example, he stated that Rare's Sea of Thieves, whereas having only been promoted through obscure videos that left <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> to potential players in its earlier stages, has started an [...] "Insider" [...] programme in December 2016 to provide limited alpha-testing access and more concrete gameplay videos. Similarly, Compulsion Games, who premiered their game We Happy Few at PAX East 2015 to similar hype as No Man's Sky, worked to backtrack on perceived expectations of their game after seeing what had happened to No Man's Sky at its launch. Specifically, Compulsion, a small developer, found that many were treating their title as a AAA release, and wanted to be clear what the game was to be, deciding to use the early access approach to provide transparency.|$|E
2500|$|By far {{the most}} criticized have been episodes four and five for their shift away from the {{realistic}} style of Rebirth and the first few episodes, to the [...] "traditional mythology well known to longtime Kombat fans". Tancharoen also acknowledged the audience split that the [...] "Kitana & Mileena" [...] episodes created, stating that theirs was a story {{that could not be}} told in a realistic environment, and that Warner Bros. [...] "wanted to make sure this web series tied into some of the story lines of the Mortal Kombat canon." [...] Unlike episode four, IGN criticized the use of animation this time, stating it cost the episode its energy and created a glut of continuity errors. Cheaper make-up, costume effects, and set design due to budgetary constraints, and a short running time were among the other criticisms. Upon the release of the Raiden-themed episode six, Houston Press suggested that Tancharoen was forced to steer episodes four and five into the traditional Mortal Kombat mystique by Warner Bros. to test how fans would react. Episode six, according to the reviewer, was the studio allowing Tancharoen to return to his own style, finally delivering [...] "cinematic greatness" [...] and [...] "the best [...] he's done so far. Possibly even better than the original Mortal Kombat: Rebirth". Film School Rejects bemoaned the series' expectation that its viewers be knowledgeable about the franchise's history, explaining that without previous knowledge of the games, the viewer is left with <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>questions</b> that may never be answered.|$|E
