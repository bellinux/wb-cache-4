25|$|The {{progress}} of the trial—which had many aspects of guerrilla theater—was covered on <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> <b>news</b> and made Kunstler the best-known lawyer in the country, and something of a folk hero. After much deadlock, the jury acquitted all seven on the conspiracy charge, but convicted five of violating the anti-riot provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The Seventh Circuit overturned all the convictions on November 21, 1972 due to Hoffman's refusal to let defense lawyers question the prospective jurors on racial and cultural biases; the Justice Department did not retry the case.|$|E

500|$|On June 6, 1990, {{before a}} Yankees–Red Sox game at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Bucky Dent as their manager, making Fenway Park {{the scene of}} his worst moment as manager, {{although}} he had his greatest moment as a player there. Red Sox fans felt retribution as Dent was fired on their field, while players on the Yankees, including former Red Sox catcher Rick Cerone and Mattingly felt Dent {{was used as a}} scapegoat. Dan Shaughnessy criticized Steinbrenner for firing Dent in Boston and said he should [...] "have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore" [...] to fire Dent. He said that [...] "if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George's jettisons. But it happened in Boston and <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> <b>news</b> had its hook." [...] He also said that [...] "the firing was only special because...it's the first time a Yankee manager...was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> <b>news</b> for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E

2500|$|DIVA-TV, {{an acronym}} for “Damned Interfering Video Activist Television," [...] was an {{affinity}} group within ACT UP that videotaped and documented AIDS activism. Its founding members are Catherine Gund, Ray Navarro, Ellen Spiro, Gregg Bordowitz, Robert Beck, Costa Pappas, Jean Carlomusto, Rob Kurilla, George Plagianos. One of their early works is “Like a Prayer” (1991), documenting the 1989 ACT UP protests at St. Patrick's Cathedral against New York Cardinal O'Connor’s position on AIDS and contraception. In the video, Ray Navarro, an ACT UP/DIVA TV activist, serves as the narrator, dressed up as Jesus.

2500|$|KQED {{was best}} known in the late '60s and {{throughout}} the 1970s, {{as one of the}} very few public stations in the country to have its own nightly news show, originally known as Newsroom. For many years, the show was anchored by Belva Davis, a pioneering African American broadcaster. Newsroom grew out of a 1968 newspaper strike in San Francisco. Journalists from the affected newspapers began reporting their stories on KQED. In 1980, <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> <b>news</b> broadcast was cancelled and replaced with a documentary production unit, which thrived for over a decade, producing a series of local documentaries and some major national productions. The staff also regularly produced feature news stories for the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour.|$|E

2500|$|The {{power of}} the Iranian blogs was {{demonstrated}} in 2003, with the Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Because her human rights work {{had much to do}} with representing women, children, and dissidents against the regime, the official Iranian news failed to report the win. Several hours later it included in <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> <b>news</b> a 15-second mention of the win, while failing to report her actual accomplishments aside for [...] "a children's charity." [...] Rather than traditional channels, therefore, the news and reactions to it spread on multiple blogs. Nasrin Alavi, author of We Are Iran, brings the statistics of www.damasanj.com, a website which works out which stories are most talked about in the Iranian blogosphere, [...] which found that Ebadi dominated the top ten Rankings.8 Most were congratulatory, and sought to provide bios and facts on the nature of Ebadi's work, which the traditional press had failed to print.|$|E
2500|$|Media {{coverage}} {{of the war in}} Vietnam also shook the faith of citizens at home as new media technologies, like television, brought images of wartime conflict to the kitchen table. Newsmen like NBC's Frank McGee stated that the war was all but lost as a [...] "conclusion to be drawn inescapably from the facts." [...] For the first time in American history the media was privileged to dispense battlefield footage to public. Graphic footage of casualties on <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> <b>news</b> eliminated any myth of the glory of war. With no clear sign of victory in Vietnam, the media images of American military casualties helped to stimulate the opposition of the war in Americans. In their book Manufacturing Consent, Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman challenge this traditional view of how the media influenced the war, proposing instead that the media censored the more brutal images of the fighting and the death of millions of innocent people.|$|E
2500|$|Marv Levy {{became the}} head coach in 1960, withBill Walsh as his one of his {{assistant}} coaches; they were at Cal until 1963.

A Cal alumni, he played under Pappy Waldorf, leading the team as a quarterback in the 1952 season's 26 to 0 win over Stanford. In the 1960s during his years as the coach, Berkeley became a center of counterculture and political protest. This led to significant problems with recruiting – Willsey had to try and commit the recruits while the Berkeley protests and police crackdowns were a regular part of <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> <b>news.</b> During this decade Cal won the Big Game only two times, in 1960 under Marv Levy and in 1967 under Ray Willsey.|$|E

2500|$|Director Kevin Macdonald {{had long}} been {{attached}} to the project, though an early report suggested screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan was set to make the film his directorial debut. Macdonald was {{a fan of the}} original mini-series, and said it would be a [...] "hard act to follow". He said it was the blend of fiction and the topical subjects of journalism and politics that attracted him to the project, adding that he wanted to examine the ways in which American and European societies learn {{what is going on in}} the world, and to what degree newspapers and <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> <b>news</b> could be trusted. He said that in an age when people read fewer newspapers, he wanted to explore the necessity for reliable information and the threat to the journalistic profession from collusion between reporters and politicians, and that the film would [...] " [...] questions of how independent the press is, how much real investigating is conducted, and how much is taken on faith from lobbyists or PR sheets." [...] Macdonald cited the films of the 1970s, All the President's Men in particular, as major influences, saying that while he was scared of comparisons with the film account of the Watergate scandal, State of Play would primarily be a piece of entertainment.|$|E
2500|$|National Basketball Association player Tim Duncan, born in Christiansted and {{a two-time}} NBA MVP, of the San Antonio Spurs {{attributed}} his basketball career to Hurricane Hugo's destruction. When Tim was 13 years old {{he was a}} competitive swimmer who {{was considered one of}} the top United States competitors for the 400-meter freestyle. However, in the aftermath of Hugo, every swimming pool on Saint Croix was destroyed, including the Olympic-size swimming pool. With no pool to practice in, Duncan turned to basketball. Tim Duncan said, [...] "I'm very fortunate to be where I am today. Without Hugo, I might still be swimming." [...] A resident of St. Croix recorded the hurricane and aftermath on a VHS video camera. After being evacuated from the island days later, the video footage was aired on [...] from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and picked up by NBC and aired as part of <b>the</b> <b>nightly</b> <b>news.</b> This was credited as the first [...] "official" [...] eye witness footage shown on U.S. national television. About 20years later, Weather Underground member Jeff Masters wrote and described his experience on Saint Croix during the hurricane, noting that [...] "in some respects, after 20 years, there are many aspects of the society that have yet to recover".|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, the Red Sox {{would again}} win the {{division}} {{and face the}} Athletics in the ALCS. However, the outcome was the same, with the A's sweeping the ALCS in four straight. That same year, Yankees fans started to chant [...] "1918!" [...] to taunt the Red Sox. The demeaning chant would echo at Yankee Stadium each time the Red Sox were there. Also, Fenway Park became the scene of Bucky Dent's worst moment as a manager, although it was where he had his greatest triumph. In June, when the Red Sox swept the Yankees during a four-game series at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Dent as their manager. Red Sox fans felt retribution to Dent being fired on their field, while the Yankees used him as a scapegoat. However, Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe severely criticized Yankees Owner George Steinbrenner for firing Dent—his 18th managerial change in as many years since becoming owner—in Boston and said he should [...] "have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore" [...] to fire Dent.
