5|$|By May 3, 1986, {{production}} {{had moved}} to New Orleans. In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker and his crew discovered a plantation village <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> as a graveyard. An unused Louisiana field was {{used to create a}} racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu).

5|$|During {{the casting}} process, Parker and {{producer}} Alan Marshall began scouting locations in New York City. On January 20, 1986, he travelled to New Orleans, where he continued writing the script.

He returned to New York City where he looked at Staten Island and Coney Island. Parker's script required a total of 78 locations in New York and New Orleans.|$|E

Lead Belly was told that if he returned later without Lomax, he would be served.|$|E
5|$|Arlington was {{established}} in the 1880s by settlers and the area was platted as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Arlington area became home to projects under the direction of federal relief agencies, including a municipal airport <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> as a naval air station during World War II. Beginning in the 1980s, Arlington experienced the effects of suburbanization, growing by over 450 percent by 2000 and annexing the unincorporated area of Smokey Point to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Coleridge {{began writing}} The Eolian Harp on 20 August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. Like his previous poem Lines Written at Shurton Bars, the poem discusses both his engagement and his future marriage. Coleridge {{was inspired to}} write the poem after {{a visit to a}} house in Clevedon <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> as his and Fricker's home after their marriage. As Coleridge worked on the poem, he and Fricker were married and they moved to the Clevedon home. During this time, Coleridge held an idealised view of his life with Fricker, and these thoughts work their way into the poem. The poem was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections. Of his poems for the 1796 collection, Coleridge felt that The Eolian Harp was his favourite.|$|E

5|$|During 1890 {{work began}} on an eighth fort, known as Linkuva; new {{construction}} techniques were introduced, particularly reinforced concrete. The Linkuva fort {{became the most}} modern entrenchment, equipped with electricity, sewerage, and casemates for a garrison of 1,000 personnel. At the same time, massive groundworks were laid along with additional defensive structures, effecting the complete enclosure of the city center between the Rivers Nemunas and Neris. By 1890, seven forts had been completed, supporting roads had been constructed, and a railroad bridge over the Nemunas had been adapted for military transport. By now, expenditures on the fortress had amounted to over nine million rubles. The first bricks for a church <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> the garrison were laid in 1891; it was completed in 1893. The following year construction began on a dedicated narrow gauge railway.|$|E
5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows and arrows. They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment was a {{segregated}} United States Army infantry regiment {{made up of}} Filipino Americans from the continental United States and a few veterans of the Battle of the Philippines that saw combat during World War II. It was formed and activated at Camp San Luis Obispo, California, {{under the auspices of}} the California National Guard. Originally created as a battalion, it was declared a regiment on 13 July 1942. Deployed initially to New Guinea in 1944, it became a source of manpower for special forces and units <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> in occupied territories. In 1945, it deployed to the Philippines, where it first saw combat as a unit. After major combat operations, it remained in the Philippines until it returned to California and was deactivated in 1946 at Camp Stoneman.|$|E

5|$|The accident, {{along with}} other similar events, {{prompted}} the IAEA to re-evaluate {{the effectiveness of the}} radioactive hazard trefoil as a warning symbol. Although the symbol was displayed on the teletherapy head, none of those handling the device were aware of its meaning, nor were there written warnings in Thai. Together with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the IAEA developed a new symbol <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> as an intuitive warning for large sources of ionizing radiation. The new symbol was published in 2007 as ISO 21482, and is intended to accompany the trefoil on internal components of devices containing dangerous sources to prevent persons from unknowingly disassembling them.|$|E
5|$|Because of the tour's cancellation, various {{media outlets}} {{circulated}} speculation that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned her {{plans for a}} tour as a result. Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Carey did not address those rumours until two years later on October 28, 2010, which was the same day she announced her new pregnancy; she admitted that she had indeed been pregnant during that time period in late 2008, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later. Carey later opted to record a new album, that would be released {{during the summer of}} 2009. During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> as the singer's twelfth studio album.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{the extension of}} I-70; however, the route still had {{to be approved by}} the representatives of the U.S. military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network did not have a direct connection from the central U.S. to southern California; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners {{approved the}} extension, but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>serve</b> no populated areas of the state. After being told this was the only way the military would approve the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route.|$|E
