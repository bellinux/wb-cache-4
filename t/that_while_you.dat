25|$|Historian J.M. Andre {{concludes that}} the {{original}} sense of otium was related to military service and the idleness {{that happened in the}} winter, as opposed to the business (negotium) {{of the rest of the}} year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual otium. Andre shows that the beauty of the individual otium poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator says <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>you</b> are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).|$|E
500|$|It was {{met with}} general acclaim from {{television}} critics. Calling it engaging, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly opined that A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was [...] "disarmingly direct, sincere, and unpretentious." [...] Tucker praised Lady Gaga's performances in the television special, expressing {{that they were a}} [...] "warm, low-key collection of solid performances of her hits and pop standards." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the television special as a [...] "dream or a hallucination." [...] The Guardian journalist Hadley Freeman wrote, [...] "It was all inoffensive, silly and knowing, and laid down the groundwork for what looks likely to be the singer's next career: as America's in-house eccentric, fearless enough to satirize the country's traditions but canny enough to know <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>you</b> can deface as many Irving Berlin songs as you like, the turkey is non-negotiable." [...] In contrast, A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was critically panned by Jen Carlson of Gothamist, who felt that it was a [...] "very transparent marketing ploy for the new Gaga holiday release." ...|$|E

500|$|On 8 February, ZANLA cadres at Connemara Barracks in Gwelo {{surprised}} their ZIPRA counterparts, killed over 60 of {{them and}} forced the rest to flee into the bush. When the ZIPRA portion of the 13th Infantry Battalion, based at Glenville Camp near Entumbane, learned of this later in the day, it waited until its instructors from the British Army left in the evening, then attacked its ZANLA comrades, killing 12 {{of them and}} scattering the rest. Charged with restoring order, McKenna sent Devine's armoured cars and D Company, 1RAR, commanded by the American Lieutenant Dave Hill, to Glenville. Arriving late in the evening, the Elands drove into the camp and flattened the ZIPRA tents, killing many of the occupants and {{clearing the way for}} Hill's troops. Taken totally by surprise, the ZIPRA troops put up little resistance; 40 were killed and many more captured, including two officers, Captains Mpofu and Dlamini. On the morning of 9 February, the British instructors were bewildered to find the ZANLA half of their unit gone, and the remaining ZIPRA men squatting in rows in 1RAR captivity. [...] "What happened?" [...] asked the British sergeant. [...] "I am afraid <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>you</b> were away, your battalion fell apart," [...] replied McKenna.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1173, Peter went to England {{to take up}} a post {{as chief}} letter-writer for Richard of Dover, Becket's {{successor}} as Archbishop. He also entered the service of Henry II, acting as a diplomat in his negotiations with Louis VII of France and the Papacy. His arrival in England approximately coincided with the rupture of the ruling family and the eruption of civil strife all over the Angevin Empire, carefully fomented by the French monarchy. Peter wrote an open letter to the Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, to [...] "deplore publicly and regretfully <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>you</b> are a most prudent woman, you have left your husband." [...] However, when in 1183 Henry the Young King died during the revolt against his father, Peter wrote to Eleanor a letter of reasoned consolation.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the game's {{criticism}} {{stemmed from}} the limitations of what procedural generation can bring to a game. While the engine can produce {{a vast array of}} different planets, it is built atop a finite number of predetermined assets, such as basic creature shapes or planetary biomes, and one quickly exhausts these core assets even with the variations allowed by procedural generation. An evaluation of the game's code showed that Hello Games had the foresight to enable new predetermined assets to be added into the game through updates, which Gamasutra Alissa McAloon suggested that with more artists to provide more content, Hello Games or third-parties could exponentially expand the perceived uniqueness of each planet. Kate Compton, who worked on the procedural generation elements of Spore, called this issue [...] "procedural oatmeal", in <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>you</b> can pour a near infinite number of bowls of oatmeal with various differences, the end result still will look like a bowl of oatmeal. Compton noted that No Man's Sky lacks a quality of perceptual uniqueness, a problem that other game researchers are looking to try to solve to provide a more crafted but still procedurally generated experience to the player, placing less emphasis on the vastness of potential outcomes as No Man's Skys marketing relied on.|$|E
