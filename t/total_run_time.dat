40|$|Abstract. Training {{agents in}} a virtual crowd to achieve a task can be {{accomplished}} by allowing the agents to learn by trial-and-error and by sharing information with other agents. Since sharing enables agents to potentially reach optimal behavior more quickly, what type of sharing is best to use to achieve the quickest learning times? This paper categorizes sharing into three categories: realistic, unrealistic, and no sharing. Real-istic sharing is defined as sharing that takes place amongst agents within close proximity and unrealistic sharing allows agents to share regardless of physical location. This paper demonstrates that all sharing methods converge to similar policies and that the differences between the methods are determined by analyzing the learning rates, communication frequen-cies, and <b>total</b> <b>run</b> <b>times.</b> Results show that the unrealistic-centralized sharing method – where agents update a common learning module – is the most effective of the sharing methods tested...|$|R

40|$|The {{high-performance}} {{separation of}} alkaline earth and {{transition metal ions}} on a bare porous silica 10. 0 cm × 0. 46 cm monolith (Merck Chromolith Si) was achieved using solvent enhanced ion chromatography. Using acetonitrile or methanol based ammonium and sodium acetate buffered mobile phases, the effect upon cation retention of mobile phase ionic strength, organic content and pH were evaluated. Increasing mobile phase acetonitrile concentration from 60 to 80 % acetonitrile resulted in 10 – 15 -fold increases in cation retention due to reduced hydration of the metal ions and hence enhanced ion-exchange interactions with surface silanol groups. The optimised conditions for the separation of Cu(II), Cd(II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Mn(II) {{were found to be}} 80 % MeCN with 10. 3 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4. 6).

40|$|Background/Aims: Excretion of urinary {{compounds}} in spot urine is often estimated relative to creatinine. For {{the growing number}} of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays of urine-excreted molecules, a fast and accurate method for determination of creatinine is needed. Methods: A high-throughput flow injection tandem mass spectrometry method for exact quantitation of creatinine in urine has been developed and validated. Sample preparation used only two-step dilution for protein precipitation and matrix dilution. Flow injection analysis without chromatographic separation allowed for <b>total</b> <b>run</b> <b>times</b> of 1 min per sample. Creatinine concentrations were quantitated using stable isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Selectivity and coelution-free quantitation were assured by qualifier ion monitoring. Results: Method validation revealed excellent injection repeatability of 1. 0 % coefficient of variation (CV), intraday precision of 1. 2 % CV and interday precision of 2. 4 % CV. Accuracy determined from standard addition experiments was 106. 1 +/- 3. 8 %. The linear calibration range was adapted to physiological creatinine concentrations. Comparison of quantitation results with a routinely used method (Jaffe colorimetric assay) proved high agreement (R- 2 = 0. 9102). Conclusions: The new method is a valuable addition to the toolbox of LC-MS/MS laboratories where excretion of urinary compounds is studied. The `dilute and shoot' approach to isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry makes the new method highly accurate as well as cost-and time-efficient. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R
