5|$|On Memorial Day, May 28, 2012, Shackleford raced in what analysts {{called the}} deepest {{field of the}} year {{featuring}} favorites To Honor and Serve, Caleb's Posse, Jackson Bend and Caixa Eletronica in the $750,000 Grade 1 Metropolitan Handicap (known by most as the Met Mile run at one mile on the dirt at Belmont Park). Shackleford had just enough left to withstand <b>the</b> <b>furious</b> late rush of Caleb's Posse, stopping the clock in 1:33 1/5 over the fast track to win by a nose. Favorite To Honor and Serve was another three and half lengths back in third. With this win, Shackleford turned the tables on old rival Caleb's Posse, who beat him in the 2011 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. The horses met each other four times, with each winning two races. However, Caleb's Posse retired soon after the Met Mile.|$|E
5|$|Daara J, {{formed in}} 1997, was {{originally}} a trio {{that consisted of}} Faada Freddy, N'Dongo D and Lord Alajiiman. Lord Alajiiman performed and toured throughout {{the world with the}} group until 2008 when the group split. Since then, Alajiman evolves in a solo career while contributing {{to the development of the}} music sector in Senegal. Daara J was formed when all of its members were in high school, where they were studying accounting. The rappers were influenced by American hip hop artists such as Grandmaster Flash and <b>the</b> <b>Furious</b> Five and Afrika Bambaataa but also listened to their parents' music, which included artists such as Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, and musical styles which included Cuban music. Faada Freddy cites the group's major inspiration as Das EFX. Originally, the members took instrumentals of hip hop tracks from the United States and France to rap over. Later they purchased a drum machine, but even with this equipment, a member of the group would have to imitate the other instruments in the song with his voice. Positive Black Soul, another Senegalese rap group, encouraged Daara J to record and perform.|$|E

5|$|In January 2017, it was {{announced}} that Johnson's role as Black Adam for the DC Extended Universe will now include two separate film installments; the previously announced Shazam feature film, and an installment focusing on his anti-hero/villain character as well. The following month, it was reported that he was also beginning work on a comedy film about a family of WWE fighters, titled Fighting with My Family. In April 2017, Johnson's upcoming production schedule {{was announced}} that filming for Rampage had begun, and that Jungle Cruise will begin filming in early 2018. Johnson's role within the movie will also extend to the themepark ride, as Disney is reportedly in the process of redesigning it, with Johnson's input as well. The new layout will feature at all Walt Disney Parks and Resorts locations worldwide. That same month, the first spin-off to The Fast and <b>the</b> <b>Furious</b> franchise was reported to feature Johnson and Jason Statham's characters teaming up for a mission with franchise screenwriter Chris Morgan signed on to write the script. Several months later in July, it was revealed that Johnson will not appear in Shazam, but will remain attached as producer for the film. October of the same year it was reported that Johnson's Fast and Furious spin-off will be released on July 26, 2019, while Fast & Furious 9 is slated for April 2020.|$|E
5|$|On 22 September Mack {{decided to}} hold the Iller line {{anchored}} on Ulm. In {{the last three days}} of September, the French began <b>the</b> <b>furious</b> marches that would place them at the Austrian rear. Mack believed that the French would not violate Prussian territory, but when he heard that Bernadotte's I Corps had marched through Prussian Ansbach, he made the critical decision to stay and defend Ulm rather than retreat to the south, which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving the bulk of his forces. Napoleon had little accurate information about Mack's intentions or maneuvers; he knew that Kienmayer's Corps was sent to Ingolstadt east of the French positions, but his agents greatly exaggerated its size. On 5 October Napoleon ordered Ney to join Lannes, Soult, and Murat in concentrating and crossing the Danube at Donauwörth. The French encirclement, however, was not deep enough to prevent Kienmayer's escape: the French corps did not all arrive at the same place– they instead deployed on a long west-east axis– and the early arrival of Soult and Davout at Donauwörth incited Kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion. Napoleon gradually became more convinced that the Austrians were massed at Ulm and ordered sizeable portions of the French army to concentrate around Donauwörth; on 6 October three French infantry and cavalry corps headed to Donauwörth to seal off Mack's escape route.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from <b>the</b> <b>furious</b> Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E

5|$|Fender's form {{dipped in}} 1924 {{after a good}} start with bat and ball; thereafter, despite {{occasional}} successes, he lacked consistency. Surrey {{finished third in the}} Championship, and Fender contributed 1,004 runs and 84 wickets in all first-class matches. Once again, Fender was a candidate for the England captaincy—South Africa played a Test series that season, and the MCC were to tour Australia in 1924–25. The eventual appointment of Arthur Gilligan was criticised in the press, which again speculated why Fender was not chosen. Fender's prospects of leading England receded further when he clashed once more with Lord Harris. The MCC had rebuked two county committees for covering their pitches prior to matches against the South Africans during a spell of wet weather. Fender pointed out in a letter published by the press that Lord Harris and the MCC were aware that this was common practice at the Scarborough Festival, despite their claims to the contrary. When Fender next played at Lord's, <b>the</b> <b>furious</b> Lord Harris summoned Fender to admonish him. Fender always regretted his indiscretion and believed it finished any chance he had of the England captaincy. Fender played in the first two Tests, without much success, and was dropped; he played only one more Test in his career. Gilligan was injured during the series, but the selectors recalled Douglas as captain rather than select Fender. When the team to tour Australia that winter was chosen, Fender was not selected, a decision which upset him deeply. Fender was married {{at the end of the}} 1924 cricket season, and in the off-season wrote about the MCC tour of Australia for the Daily Express.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November, Chinese forces {{entered the}} war against the United Nations, {{advancing}} across the Yalu border and attacking the Eighth Army's IX Corps and South Korean II Corps in the west and X Corps in the east. X Corps found itself under attack from the 20th, 26th and 27th Chinese field armies, commanding a total of 12 divisions. During <b>the</b> <b>furious</b> action that followed, the 7th Infantry Division's spread out regiments were unable to resist the overwhelming Chinese forces. Three of the division's infantry battalions were attacked from all sides the next day. 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry (nicknamed Task Force Faith) was trapped with two other battalions by the 80th and 81st Chinese infantry divisions from the 27th Field Army. In the subsequent Battle of Chosin Reservoir, the three battalions were destroyed by overwhelming Chinese forces suffering over 2,000 casualties. The 31st Infantry suffered heavy casualties trying to fight back the Chinese forces further north, but the 17th Infantry was spared of heavy attack, retreating along the Korean coastline, out of range of the offensive. By the time X Corps ordered a retreat, most of the 7th Infantry Division, save the 17th Infantry Regiment, had suffered 40 percent casualties. The scattered elements of the division saw repeated attacks as they attempted to withdrawal to the port of Hungnam in December 1950. These attacks cost the division another 100 killed before it was fully evacuated. The division suffered 2,657 killed and 354 wounded during the retreat. Most of the dead were members of Task Force Faith.|$|E
