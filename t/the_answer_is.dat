5|$|However Saudi {{judges are}} {{expected}} to consult six medieval texts from the Hanbali school of jurisprudence before reaching a decision. The Hanbali school is noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur'an and hadith. If <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> {{not found in the}} six Hanbali texts, the judge may then consult the jurisprudence of the other three main Sunni schools or apply his independent judgment and legal reasoning, referred to as ijtihad.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E

5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> evidently satisfactory. <b>The</b> chief {{bowed his}} head.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> yes, {{because for}} every natural number n {{there is a}} square number n2, and {{likewise}} the other way around.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{we might}} ask: What is the {{probability}} that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.01 hours? Let's say <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> 0.02 (i.e., 2%). Next: What is {{the probability that}} the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.001 hours? <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> probably around 0.002, since this is 1/10th of the previous interval. The probability that the bacterium dies between 5 hours and 5.0001 hours is probably about 0.0002, and so on.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Boolean algebras <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> yes. In {{particular}} the finitely many equations we have listed above suffice. We say that Boolean algebra is finitely axiomatizable or finitely based.|$|E

60|$|The {{master mason}} nodded approvingly when <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> {{translated}} to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> {{slow and}} smothered; and, of course, in the negative.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> no, {{because the}} squares are a proper {{subset of the}} naturals: every square is a natural number but there are natural numbers, like 2, which are not squares of natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|To see this, {{examine the}} (antisymmetrized) product of two {{matrices}} A and B in the correspondence limit, where the matrix elements are slowly varying {{functions of the}} index, {{keeping in mind that}} <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> zero classically.|$|E
25|$|In a 2002 poll of 100 researchers, 61 {{believed}} {{the answer to}} be no, 9 believed <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> yes, and 22 were unsure; 8 {{believed the}} question may be independent of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove.|$|E

25|$|Some people's intuition is that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> above 100,000. Most people's intuition {{is that it}} is in the {{thousands}} or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23.|$|E
25|$|The reader {{may wonder}} why a {{competent}} scientist does not publish a detailed refutation of Reich's absurd biological speculations. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> that the informed scientist doesn't care, and would, in fact, damage his reputation {{by taking the}} time to undertake such a thankless task.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem can}} easily be {{extended}} to higher dimensions. In particular, finding the chromatic number of space usually refers to the 3-dimensional version.

25|$|Suppose {{a species}} of {{bacteria}} typically lives 4 to 6 hours. What is {{the probability that a}} bacterium lives exactly 5 hours? <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> 0%.
