500|$|The Eurasian Economic Union has an {{integrated}} single market of 183 {{million people and}} a gross domestic product of over 4 trillion U.S. dollars (PPP). The EAEU introduces the free movement of goods, capital, services and people and provides for common policies in macroeconomic sphere, transport, industry and agriculture, energy, foreign trade and investment, customs, <b>technical</b> <b>regulation,</b> competition and antitrust regulation. Provisions for a single currency and greater integration are envisioned in future. The union operates through supranational and intergovernmental institutions. The Supreme Eurasian Economic Council is the [...] "Supreme Body" [...] of the Union, consisting of the Heads of the Member States. The second level of intergovernmental institutions {{is represented by the}} Eurasian Intergovernmental Council (consisting of the Prime Ministers of member states). The day-to-day work of the EAEU is done through the Eurasian Economic Commission (the executive body), which is a supranational body similar to European Commission. There is also a judicial body – the Court of the EAEU.|$|E
500|$|Historically, team orders {{have always}} been an {{accepted}} part of Formula One. However, in the final metres of the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, Schumacher's teammate, Rubens Barrichello, slowed his car under orders from Ferrari to allow Schumacher to pass and win the race. Although the switching of positions did not break any actual sporting or <b>technical</b> <b>regulation,</b> it angered fans and it was claimed that the team's actions showed a lack of sportsmanship and respect to the spectators. Many argued that Schumacher {{did not need to}} be [...] "given" [...] wins in only the 6th race of the season, particularly given that he had already won four of the previous five grands prix, and that Barrichello had dominated the race weekend up to that point. At the podium ceremony, Schumacher pushed Barrichello onto the top step, and for this disturbance, the Ferrari team incurred a US$1million fine. Later in the season at the end of the 2002 United States Grand Prix, Schumacher slowed down within sight of the finishing line, allowing Barrichello to win by 0.011 seconds, the 2nd closest margin in F1 history. Schumacher's explanation varied between it being him [...] "returning the favour" [...] for Austria (now that Schumacher's title was secure), or trying to engineer a dead-heat (a feat derided as near-impossible in a sport where timings are taken to within a thousandth of a second). The FIA subsequently banned [...] "team orders which interfere with the race result", but the ban was lifted for the 2011 season because the ruling was difficult to enforce.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that while <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> can improve welfare and facilitate markets, {{they can also}} impede trade. The trade impeding effects of <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> are especially worrisome for developing countries: they frequently lack the human and capital resources necessary to satisfy technical measures, and thus {{are more likely to}} be excluded from markets by technical measures. This paper uses highly disaggregated US data on agricultural, mining and manufacturing imports to examine the impact of <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> on trade patterns. Using instrumental variables estimation to correct for the potential endogeneity of <b>technical</b> <b>regulations,</b> the analysis suggests that <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> substantially impinge on poor countries' exports: their weaker capacities to satisfy <b>technical</b> <b>regulations</b> lead them to specialize away from industries with heavier regulatory burdens.
