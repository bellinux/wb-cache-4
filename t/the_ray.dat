5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating <b>the</b> <b>ray.</b> The shark then used its head to pin <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> to the bottom and pivoted to take <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts {{the number of times}} <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even if and only if the point is outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the point is outside. Every time <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E

5000|$|Henricia sanguinolenta is an invertebrate. It has slender five rays that taper evenly to {{tips that}} are {{connected}} by a central disc. The sea star grows to a diameter of 5 to 12 centimeters. On the oral side, <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> are smooth and have an ambulacral groove that contains two tube foot rows. On the dorsal side, <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> are rough with groupings of spinelets, each one have three to six glassy points. The sides of <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> are curving and smooth. <b>The</b> <b>rays</b> contain many of the organs in the sea star. On the tips of <b>the</b> <b>rays</b> are <b>the</b> eyespots. These are dark pigmented organs that sense the presence of light. <b>The</b> <b>rays</b> also contain parts of the pyloric stomach, parts of the nervous system, and most other organs.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} stingrays inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs, the bluespotted ribbontail ray generally spends the day hidden alone inside caves or under coral ledges or other debris (including from shipwrecks), often with only its tail showing. At night, small groups assemble and swim onto shallow sandy flats with the rising tide to feed. Unlike many other stingrays, this species seldom buries itself in sand. The bluespotted ribbontail ray excavates sand pits in search of molluscs, polychaete worms, shrimps, crabs, and small benthic bony fishes; when prey is located, it is trapped by the body of <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> and maneuvered into the mouth with the disc. Other fishes, such as goatfish, frequently follow foraging rays, seeking food missed by <b>the</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} attended William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later {{merged with}} Tollington Grammar School to become Fortismere School), where {{they formed a}} band, <b>the</b> <b>Ray</b> Davies Quartet, with Ray's friend and classmate Pete Quaife and Quaife's friend John Start. Their debut at a school dance was well received, which encouraged the group to play at local pubs and bars. The band went {{through a series of}} lead vocalists, including Rod Stewart, another student at William Grimshaw, who performed with the group at least once in early 1962. He then formed his own group, Rod Stewart and the Moonrakers, which became a local rival to <b>the</b> <b>Ray</b> Davies Quartet.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its size}} and {{electrical}} defenses, the marbled electric ray does not often fall prey to other animals such as sharks. This species exhibits different defensive behaviors depending on whether a prospective predator grasps it by the disc or the tail. A ray touched on the disc will quickly turn toward the threat while producing electric shocks; {{this is followed by}} it fleeing in a straight line, after which it may re-bury itself. A ray touched on the tail will propel itself upward into a loop; if it has not escaped after the maneuver, <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> will curl into a ring with the belly facing outward, so as to present the area of its body with the highest electric field gradient (the underside of the electric organs) towards the threat; these behaviors are accompanied by short, strong electric shocks. <b>The</b> <b>ray</b> tends to produce more electric bursts when protecting its tail than when protecting its disc.|$|E

60|$|And {{therefore}} {{there is}} an original difference in <b>the</b> <b>Rays</b> of Light, by means of which some Rays are in this Experiment constantly refracted after the usual manner, and others constantly after the unusual manner: For if the difference be not original, but arises from new Modifications impress'd on <b>the</b> <b>Rays</b> at their first Refraction, it would be alter'd by new Modifications in the three following Refractions; whereas it suffers no alteration, but is constant, and has the same effect upon <b>the</b> <b>Rays</b> in all <b>the</b> Refractions.

5|$|The demons {{attempt to}} destroy <b>the</b> <b>Ray</b> Line {{underneath}} Filgaia. It {{was the last}} resort of the Guardians to connect their remaining strength together and maintain the planet. These plans are temporarily thwarted at the last moment, with Zeikfried being thrown through a dimensional rift in space when the three confront him. Finding himself transported to the underwater wreckage of the Photosphere, Zeikfred is met by a deformed visage of Mother, who devours him. However, the remaining Demons find another way to disrupt <b>the</b> <b>Ray</b> line by creating their own tear drop designed to destroy rather than create life and using the Elw teleportation system distribute it all over Filgaia, throwing {{the forces of nature}} into chaos. It is also revealed that one of the Quarter Knights was not originally a demon, but Jack's lost love Elmina, which fueled his lust for vengeance.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> and arm making contact, <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal.

5|$|The round ribbontail ray is not aggressive, and {{has been}} known to {{approach}} and investigate divers. However, if harassed it can inflict a severe wound with its venomous tail spine. This species has been responsible for at least one recorded fatality, of a diver who was stabbed while attempting to ride <b>the</b> <b>ray.</b> The round ribbontail ray is popular with ecotourist divers because of its size and spectacular appearance. Although displayed in public aquariums, it is not hardy and 81 days is the longest one has been kept in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} (Galeocerdo cuvier) {{is known to}} prey on the bowmouth guitarfish. <b>The</b> <b>ray</b> is {{protected}} by the thorns on its head and back, and it may ram perceived threats.

5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals. There {{is a record}} of one being fed upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's nutmeg (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this ray, and possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of <b>the</b> <b>ray</b> and uses its proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E
