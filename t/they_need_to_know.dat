2500|$|Sex {{education}} {{is still a}} debate in the United States to this day. Some parents believe that their children's school programs encourage sexual activity, and the schools {{believe that there are}} many students that don't get any sex education at home. The goal for the parents is for their children to follow their family values. Parents want the ability to teach their children what they want about sex education rather than school programs teaching them of things that certain things that parents are trying to avoid. Sex education programs in schools are mainly trying to give the students a complete picture about sex and sexuality. They want students to know their bodies as well as know how to protect them and make smart decisions. In a study titled [...] "Emerging Answers: Research Findings on Programs to reduce Teen Pregnancy" [...] showed that sex education programs in schools are having a huge impact on teen's decisions to remain abstinent or to use contraceptives if they do choose to have intercourse (1). School programs are teaching students everything <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about sex and sexuality and that is helping these same students {{to make their own decisions}} and to be safe no matter what they choose to do.|$|E

2500|$|Traditional {{masks are}} still handcrafted. Most {{traditional}} communities have {{one person who}} specializes in the craft. This person is almost always male who has learned the trade from his father, with the occasional exception of a widow continuing her husband’s trade. Some mask makers specialize in those for a particular dance. Mask makers are respected as <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the significance of each dance to make the appropriate masks. Most mask makers have other occupations such as baker, wax worker, factory worker or carpenter. A number of mask makers are also makers of religious images called “santeros.” These craftsmen tend to make masks with fine features and finishes that imitate human skin. Production is aimed almost exclusively to dancers, although they are also made for collectors, and more fantastic ones for the tourist market, especially in Guerrero. It {{can be difficult to}} distinguish these masks from more “authentic” ones for dances. In a few communities, there is enough demand to have full-time mask makers, where hundreds are worn for major festivities. One of these is Tlaxcala because almost all dancers are masked. Many of these are made in the town of Apetatitlán de Antonio Carvajal by the Carlos Reyes Acoltzi family and the Mendez family of the city of Tlaxcala [...] Another area with a high demand for masks is Chiapa de Corzo, for the Parachicos dance performed for the feast of Saint Sebastian by thousands of dancers. The best known mask maker of this type is Antonio López, who also teaches the trade to young people. [...] There are still cases where dancers make their own mask, such as the Cora in Nayarit and the Mayo and Yaqui in Sinaloa and Sonora. These are not generally made of wood. In the Cora community, dancers are bound to make their own masks as part of the rituals for Holy Week from paper mache, painted white and bound with cloth. On Holy Wednesday, it is worn this way. On Maundy Thursday, black lines are added and then dyed on Good Friday.|$|E

Eventually, he saw this as a good learning experience because he can now solve the geometry problems. The PTs discussed that in order to effectively teach mathematical content, one must understand it. Additionally, finding the gaps in their own content knowledge helped them “become a better teacher” (Ruth’s Reflective Essay, 2012).|$|R
