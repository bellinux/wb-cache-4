Maria Eufrosyne gave birth to eleven children, of whom only three survived <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents.</b> These three were Privy Councillor Gustaf Adolf (1647–95), Catharina Charlotta (1655–97, wife of Field Marshal Otto Wilhelm Königsmarck) and Hedvig Ebba (c. 1659 – 1700, wife of Count Carl Gustaf Eriksson Oxenstierna).|$|E
25|$|Members often unconsciously {{identify}} the group therapist and other group members with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents</b> and siblings {{in a process}} that is a form of transference specific to group psychotherapy. The therapist's interpretations can help group members gain understanding of the impact of childhood experiences on their personality, and they may learn to avoid unconsciously repeating unhelpful past interactive patterns in present-day relationships.|$|E
25|$|In 1858, in {{a highly}} publicized case, the police of the Papal States seized a 6-year-old Jewish boy, Edgardo Mortara, from his parents. A Christian servant girl of the family, fearing he would die, had {{reportedly}} informally baptized him six years prior while he was ill. The Papal state law forbid Christians being raised by Jews, even <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents,</b> and considered the informal baptism of the infant a valid religious conversion. The incident provoked widespread outrage amongst liberal Catholics and non-Catholics, {{and contributed to the}} growing anti-papal sentiment in Europe. The boy was raised in the papal household, and was eventually ordained a priest at age 21.|$|E

25|$|At St Thomas' {{along with}} running the {{out-patient}} clinic for children, she conducted research and gathered around her a multidisciplinary group of practitioners. Frommer {{was one of}} the earliest in the field to identify childhood depression. Part of it she believed was due to parental experiences of separation from <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents.</b> When she was practising, many World War II evacuees had become parents and their children were displaying the disturbances Frommer had discovered. In some cases, she prescribed newly developed antidepressant medications in very small doses. This was a controversial approach that attracted both international interest and local criticism from some colleagues. Another innovation was to establish formal links with the burgeoning Art Therapy movement. Frommer offered internships in her department to art therapy students from the original St Alban's School of Art course, followed by students from other London courses.|$|E
500|$|While Pixar usually designs their {{characters}} to be caricatured, Carl {{was even more}} so, being only three heads high. He was not given elderly features such as liver spots or hair in his ears to keep him appealing, yet giving him wrinkles, pockmarks on his nose, a hearing aid, and a cane to make him appear elderly. Docter wanted to push a stylized feel, particularly the way Carl's head is proportioned: he has a squarish appearance to symbolize his containment within his house, while Russell is rounded like a balloon. The challenge on Up was making these stylized characters feel natural, although Docter remarked the effect came across better than animating the realistic humans from Toy Story, who suffered from the [...] "uncanny valley". Cartoonists Al Hirschfeld, Hank Ketcham, and George Booth influenced the human designs. Simulating realistic cloth on caricatured humans was harder than creating the 10,000 balloons flying the house. New programs were made to simulate the cloth and for Kevin's iridescent feathers. To animate old people, Pixar animators would study <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents</b> or grandparents and also watched footage of the Senior Olympics. The directors had various rules for Carl's movements: he could not turn his head more than 15–20degrees without turning his torso as well, nor could he raise his arms high. However, they also wanted him to grow more flexible {{near the end of}} the film, transforming into an [...] "action hero".|$|E

50|$|Children {{go through}} {{different}} stages in life, therefore <b>parents</b> create <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parenting</b> styles {{from a combination}} of factors that evolve over time as children begin to develop <b>their</b> <b>own</b> personalities. During the stage of infancy, parents try to adjust to a new lifestyle in terms of adapting and bonding with their new infant. For example, the relationship between the parent and child is attachment. In the stage of adolescence, parents encounter new challenges, such as adolescents seeking and desiring freedom.|$|R

2500|$|There {{is still}} much debate as to what social groups {{constituted}} the usual victims of these sacrifices. It is often assumed that all victims were 'disposable' commoners or foreigners. However, slaves - {{a major source of}} victims - were not a permanent class but rather persons from any level of Aztec society who had fallen into debt or committed some crime. [...] Likewise, most of the earliest accounts talk of prisoners of war of diverse social status, and concur that virtually all child sacrifices were locals of noble lineage, offered by <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In Japan, {{the use of}} {{the term}} [...] "third culture kids" [...] to refer to {{children}} returned from living overseas is not universally accepted; they are typically referred to both in Japanese and in English as kikokushijo, literally [...] "returnee children", a term which has different implications. Public awareness of kikokushijo is much more widespread in Japan than awareness of TCKs in the United States, and government reports as early as 1966 recognised the need for the school system to adapt to them. However, views of kikokushijo have not always been positive; in the 1970s, especially, they were characterised in media reports and even by <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents</b> as [...] "educational orphans" [...] in need of [...] "rescue" [...] to reduce their foreignness and successfully reintegrate them into Japanese society.|$|E

2500|$|International law has {{generally}} recognized {{that there may}} be extenuating circumstances where a child abduction may have been necessary or justifiable due to extenuating circumstances. The 1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors limited such considerations to strictly emergency situations. Starting with the 1924 Declaration on the Rights of the Child and the 1959 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child there was a growing recognition at the international level of the shift in nation's domestic laws away from parental authority and towards an emphasis on protecting the child, even from <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents.</b> [...] This foreshadowed the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and led to the establishment of exceptional circumstances in Article 13 of the Hague Abduction Convention where the removal of children would not be considered child abduction and allow the child to remain in their new country.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Ashkenazic Jews, {{who do not}} name newborn children after living relatives, Sephardic Jews often name their children after the children's grandparents, {{even if they are}} still alive. The first son and daughter are traditionally named after the paternal grandparents, then the maternal parents' names are next in line for the remaining children. After that, additional children's names are [...] "free", so to speak, meaning that one can choose whatever name, without any more [...] "naming obligations." [...] The only instance in which Sephardic Jews will not name after <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents</b> is when one of the spouses shares a common first name with a mother/father-in-law (since Jews will not name their children after themselves.) There are times though when the [...] "free" [...] names are used to honor the memory of a deceased relative who died young or childless. These conflicting naming conventions can be troublesome when children are born into mixed Ashkenazic-Sephardic households.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to examine what is {{available}} in Minnesota to help new Americans learn English {{and the extent to}} which language classes also incorporate acculturation skills and activities.

Some amongst them changed their deity every day; and the first living creature which happened to meet them in the morning was the object of their worship, not excepting even dogs or swine.

60|$|He who {{believes}} that each equine species was independently created, will, I presume, assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this particular manner, so as often to become striped like other species of the genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency, when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to produce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents,</b> but other species of the genus. To admit this view is, {{as it seems to}} me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause. It makes the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore.|$|E

[Every man in the room had his hand up to the light now, and his head canted to one side, and was minutely scrutinizing the balls of his fingers; there were whispered ejaculations of 'Why, it's so--I never noticed that before!'] The patterns on the right hand {{are not the same as}} those on the left.

I was then young, not three-and-twenty; and I thought of my country, her independence, her justice, her disposition to do right, her determination to submit to no wrongs, and her disregard of the expedient when principles were concerned,--much as young people think of the immaculate qualities of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>parents.</b> According to the decisions of judges of this latter class, {{there would not be}} a liar, a swindler, a cheat, or a mercenary scoundrel living; but the earth would be filled with so many suffering saints that are persecuted for their virtues. According to the notions of most American citizens of my age, the very name they bore ought to be a protection to them in any part of the world, under the penalty of incurring the republic's just indignation. How far my anticipations were realized, will be seen in the sequel;--and I beg the American reader, in particular, to restrain his natural impatience, until he can learn the facts in the regular order of the narrative. I can safely promise him, that should he receive them in the proper spirit, with a desire to ascertain truth only and not to uphold bloated and untenable theories, he will be a wiser, and probably a more modest man, for the instruction that is to be thus gleaned from the incidents it will be my painful office to record. As for Lord Harry Dermond, the threatened indignation of the great American nation gave him very little concern. He probably cared a vast deal more for one frown from the admiral who commanded at Plymouth, than for the virtuous resentment of the President and Congress of the United States of America.
