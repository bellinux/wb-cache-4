5|$|Balls Mahoney faced Masato Tanaka in {{the second}} Extreme Rules match of the night. Mahoney got the early {{advantage}} after throwing a beer can {{in the face of}} Tanaka. Tanaka gained the advantage after executing a superplex off the top rope. Mahoney won the match after hitting Tanaka with a steel chair. Before the WWE Championship match, Eugene came to the ring to cut a promo. He reminded the fans that he was Eric Bischoff's nephew, before being interrupted by The Sandman. Sandman hit Eugene repeatedly with his Singapore cane, leaving Eugene <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back, with The Sandman chasing after him.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Romulus, I-275 begins {{to take on a}} more {{suburban}} character when it passes the southwestern boundary of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. There is access to {{the south side of the}} airport signed at Eureka Road and to the north side at I-94. Between these two interchanges, I-275 begins <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest. South of I-94, the highway crosses over the same CSX line and a Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) line and north of I-94, it passes a campus of Wayne County Community College and the headquarters of the Visteon Corporation, a major auto parts supplier spun off from Ford Motor Corporation. Near these two complexes, the freeway turns north again, running parallel and to the east of Haggerty Road. The freeway crosses over another NS railroad line also used by Amtrak trains from Chicago and Pontiac, US12 (Michigan Avenue) and M-153 (Ford Road) in Canton. I-275 crosses the Lower Branch of the River Rouge north of Michigan Avenue and the Middle Branch north of Ford Road, and it also crosses over a CSX line again. North of the Middle Branch of the River Rouge in Plymouth Township, I-275 crosses Schoolcraft Road and another CSX line from Detroit.|$|E

5|$|Route 4 {{had several}} former spur routes that existed {{prior to the}} 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. Route 4N was {{designated}} in 1939 from the portion of pre-1927 Route 4 between Brielle and Eatontown; it is now Route 71. Route S4 was defined in 1927 <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Outerbridge Crossing in Perth Amboy from present-day Route 35; it was eventually extended to the Garden State Parkway and this route is now Routes 440 and 184. Route S4A was planned in 1927 to run from Atlantic City across swamps to Tuckerton; {{only a small portion}} of this route was built and it is now Route 87. Route S4B was planned in 1929 to run Route 4 near Paterson northwest to the New York border, replacing a portion of what was legislated as Route 3 in 1927. The portion of this route that was built between Fair Lawn and Oakland is now Route 208. Route S4D was a never built spur in Teaneck proposed in 1938; the proposal was renumbered Route 303. Route 4A was created by the 1940s following a realignment of Route 4 (and U.S. Route 9) between Freehold and Cheesequake; it became Route 79 and a portion of Route 34 in 1953. Route 4 Parkway was planned in 1946 as a northsouth parkway running from Cape May north to Route 6 (now U.S. Route 46) in Clifton, bridging the gap that existed along Route 4 between Rahway and Paterson; this proposal became Route 444 (Garden State Parkway). Route S4C was a planned route running from Route 4 in Bennett south to Cape May; the general alignment of this route is now Route 162 and Cape May County Route 626.|$|E

25|$|However, Campese would {{score the}} final try of the Test by running past Blanco. Australia had a scrum inside France's 22 {{in front of}} the goal-posts. Campese stood on the {{left-hand}} attacking side of the scrum. As Farr-Jones took the ball {{from the back of the}} scrum and started <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, Campese followed Nick Farr-Jones. Nick Farr-Jones shaped to pass the ball to Australian eightman Tim Gavin, which held-up Blanco and French eightman Olivier Roumat. Nick Farr-Jones passed to Campese, who ran through a gap and past Blanco before evading Roumat coming across in cover defence, to score a try untouched.|$|E
25|$|On June 17, 1775, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the Battle of Bunker Hill, Woodbridge marched his regiment in good order from the mainland across the Charlestown Neck, an isthmus connecting the mainland with the Charlestown Peninsula and the battlefield. The regiment was under fire from British naval vessels as they crossed the neck to reinforce Col. William Prescott's regiment; British vessels were bombarding the battlefield and the Charlestown Neck prior to the assault of the British troops. General Israel Putnam, riding his horse from the battlefield to the neck, met Woodbridge's regiment and urged them <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. The rush to battle caused confusion and separation of Woodbridge's men as {{they arrived at the}} field of action. Parts of the regiment engaged and joined the battle.|$|E
25|$|At around 9am on {{the morning}} of 17 June he flew to London on a British {{aircraft}} with Edward Spears. The escape was hair-raising, with Spears’ aide having <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hangar at the last minute to fetch a rope to tie on the luggage. Spears claimed that de Gaulle had been reluctant to come, and that he had pulled him into the aircraft at the last minute, although de Gaulle’s biographer does not accept this. Jean Laurent brought 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to him by Reynaud. De Gaulle later told André Malraux of the mental anguish which his flight to London – a break with the French Army and with the recognised government, which would inevitably be seen as treason by many - had caused him.|$|E

25|$|Kubica {{had built}} up a {{substantial}} lead {{over the course of}} the race and was never threatened while he raced towards the finish. Heidfeld held onto second place leading to the first one-two finish for the BMW Sauber team. David Coulthard finished third to score his first points of the season and his first podium finish since the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix, but had <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> podium after his car ran out of fuel 50 meters from where the podium finishers park. Toyota drivers finished fourth and sixth, with Massa between them in fifth. Barrichello kept the seventh position and Vettel defended eighth place from Kovalainen. Thus, no McLaren driver finished in the points for the first time since the 2006 United States Grand Prix, and neither Ferrari nor McLaren took a podium finish for the first time since the 2006 Malaysian Grand Prix. Kovalainen, Rosberg, Button, Webber and the lapped Bourdais were the last of the finishing drivers.|$|E

500|$|Reconstruction of the Virginia Central began {{soon after}} the Confederacy's collapse, and under the {{permission}} of General Edward Ord, repairs commenced on April 21, 1865. [...] Construction of temporary bridges and repairs were made swiftly, enabling trains <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rivanna River by May. [...] Temporary overland stage and wagon routes were set up to bypass inoperable sections of the railroad as repairs were made and provided for the transportation of goods and passengers. [...] By the end of July, trains were able <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western terminus of Jackson's River Station. [...] The Virginia Central's rolling stock had suffered throughout the Civil War, and the operable equipment had dwindled to an amount insufficient to provide for demand. [...] To help solve this issue, four locomotives and forty cars were rented from the government at a price of $20 and $2 ($ and $ today) each per day respectively. [...] The Beaverdam Depot was rebuilt in 1866.|$|E

500|$|Another {{reported}} {{problem with}} the Type UBIs was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes. The boats were equipped with compensating tanks designed to flood and offset {{the loss of the}} C/06 torpedo's [...] weight, but this system did not always function properly; as a result, when firing from periscope depth the boat could broach after firing or, if too much weight was taken on, plunge to the depths.

500|$|The exact {{circumstances}} surrounding Loving's death are unclear. According to Yoder, with Manila's defenses {{on the verge}} of collapse to the advancing American and Filipino armies, the hotel prisoners were ordered <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach while Japanese soldiers shot at them. The then 73-year-old Loving refused to run, declaring [...] "I am an American. If I must die, I'll die like an American," [...] whereupon he was beheaded. In a 2010 article, a Philippine newspaper columnist contends, however, the Manila Hotel prisoners attempted escape and Loving used his body to barricade a staircase to prevent Japanese troops from pursuit; he was [...] bayoneted to death in the process. A third account relayed in a 1945 Associated Negro Press story says that Loving was shot in the back by retreating Japanese troops. Mortally wounded, he crawled from the Manila Hotel to the battered bandstand at Luneta Park, the site of many of the Philippine Constabulary Band's performances, and died.|$|E
