5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The normal vector in this case can be defined (as in the plane) as the derivative of the <b>tangent</b> <b>vector</b> with respect to arc length, normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} the components of the Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at those points, allowing the curve-shortening flow to be defined. Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, and the flow may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define flow past singularities in plane curves.|$|E

25|$|In the {{language}} of differential geometry, the requirement that the components of a vector transform according to the same matrix of the coordinate transition is equivalent to defining a contravariant vector to be a tensor of contravariant rank one.

25|$|The tangent {{space and}} the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same {{dimension}} and therefore isomorphic to each other via many possible isomorphisms.

25|$|Given a curve {{contained}} on the x-y plane, its <b>tangent</b> <b>vector</b> T is {{also contained}} on that plane. Its binormal vector B can be naturally postulated {{to coincide with}} the normal to the plane (along the z axis). Finally, the curve normal can be found completing the right-handed system, N = B × T. This form is well-defined even when the curvature is zero; for example, the normal to a straight line on a plane will be perpendicular to the tangent, all co-planar.|$|E
25|$|The {{quantization}} of {{the volume}} proceeds {{the same way as}} with the area. As we take the derivative, and each time we do so we bring down the <b>tangent</b> <b>vector</b> , when the volume operator acts on non-intersecting Wilson loops the result vanishes. Quantum states with non-zero volume must therefore involve intersections. Given that the anti-symmetric summation is taken over in the formula for the volume we would need at least intersections with three non-coplanar lines. Actually it turns out that one needs at least four-valent vertices for the volume operator to be non-vanishing.|$|E

Like ordinary <b>tangent</b> <b>vectors,</b> the considered five-dimensional vectors and the tensors constructed out of them can be used for describing certain local quantities and in this capacity find direct application in physics. For example, such familiar physical quantities as the stress-energy and angular momentum tensors prove to be parts of a single five-tensor. In this part of the series five-dimensional <b>tangent</b> <b>vectors</b> are introduced as abstract objects related in a certain way to ordinary four-dimensional <b>tangent</b> <b>vectors.</b> I then make a formal study of their basic algebraic properties and of their differential properties in flat space-time.

A solder form on a principal H-bundle P over M is an Rn-valued 1-form θ: TP → Rn which is horizontal and equivariant so that it induces a bundle homomorphism from TM to the associated bundle P H Rn. This is furthermore required to be a bundle isomorphism.

25|$|Once the tangent {{spaces of}} a {{manifold}} have been introduced, one can define vector fields, which are abstractions of the velocity field of particles moving in space. A vector field attaches to every {{point of the}} manifold a vector from the tangent space at that point, in a smooth manner. Such a vector field serves to define a generalized ordinary differential equation on a manifold: A solution to such a differential equation is a differentiable curve on the manifold whose derivative at any point {{is equal to the}} <b>tangent</b> <b>vector</b> attached to that point by the vector field.|$|E
25|$|The hairy ball theorem of {{algebraic}} topology (sometimes called the hedgehog theorem in Europe) states {{that there is}} no nonvanishing continuous <b>tangent</b> <b>vector</b> field on even-dimensional n-spheres.
