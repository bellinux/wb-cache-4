25|$|From a young age, Snow {{demonstrated}} an aptitude for mathematics. In 1827, {{when he was}} 14, he obtained a medical apprenticeship with William Hardcastle in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1832, during his time as a surgeon-apothecary apprentice, he encountered a cholera epidemic {{for the first time}} in Killingworth, a coal-mining village. Snow treated many victims of the disease and gained a lot of experience. Additionally, while he was an apprentice, Snow could not drink, gamble or marry. Eventually he adjusted to <b>teetotalism</b> and led a life characterized by abstinence, signing an abstinence pledge in 1835. Snow was also a vegetarian and tried to only drink distilled water that was “pure”. Between 1833 and 1836 Snow worked as an assistant to a colliery surgeon, first in Burnopfield, County Durham, and then in Pateley Bridge, West Riding of Yorkshire. In October 1836 he enrolled at the Hunterian school of medicine on Great Windmill Street, London.|$|E
2500|$|Anecdotal {{accounts}} of prohibitions against maternal alcohol use from Biblical, ancient Greek, and ancient Roman sources imply a historical awareness of links between maternal alcohol use and negative child outcomes. For example, in the King James' Version of the Bible, Judges 13:4 reads: [...] "Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any uncleanthing". In 1725 British physicians petitioned the House of Commons {{on the effects}} of strong drink when consumed by pregnant women saying that such drinking is “…too often the cause of weak feeble and distempered children, who must be, instead, of an advantage and strength, a charge to their country.” There are many other such historical references. In Gaelic Scotland, the mother and nurse were not allowed to consume ale during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Martin Martin). Claims that alcohol consumption caused idiocy were part of the <b>Teetotalism's</b> message in the 19th century, but such claims, despite some attempts to offer evidence, were ignored because no mechanism could be advanced.|$|R
500|$|During his {{theatrical}} days, Davidson maintained {{high standards}} of personal morality, observed strict <b>teetotalism</b> and gave regular Bible readings to the elderly in the towns in which he performed on tour. He later gave an account of an incident from November 1894 when he was performing in London. While walking along the Thames Embankment in a thick fog, he said, he encountered a 16-year-old girl {{who was about to}} throw herself into the Thames. After preventing her suicide attempt, Davidson learned that she had run away from home near Cambridge, was penniless and without shelter. He paid her fare home: [...] "Her pitiful story made a tremendous impression on me... I have ever since... kept my eyes open for opportunities to help that kind of girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{other views}} for which Henson was known were his disapproval of <b>teetotalism</b> campaigners and of socialism, {{and for his}} disbelief in social reform as an ally of religion. When the Kikuyu {{controversy}} erupted in 1913 Henson once again found himself at odds with Gore. The question was whether two colonial bishops had committed heresy by taking part in an ecumenical service. Gore and his ally Bishop Weston of Zanzibar led the charge, and appear in Henson's journal as [...] "devoted, unselfish, indefatigable, eminently gifted, but ... also fanatical in temper, bigoted in their beliefs, and reckless in their methods." [...] Together with Bishop Moule, Dean Wace of Canterbury and other leaders, Henson strongly, and successfully, supported the accused bishops: [...] "The Church owes a deep debt of gratitude to the Bishops of Uganda and Mombasa." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones {{had been}} {{attracted}} to the Methodist faith because it advocated <b>teetotalism</b> and that the Indians must convert to the white settler lifestyle. [...] In June 1823, he attended a camp-meeting of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Ancaster Township, along with his half-sister Mary. [...] The camp-meeting touched Jones, who converted there to Christianity. [...] At this time Reverend William Case saw the potential to convert the Mississauga Indians through Jones. Case soon {{assumed the role of}} a mentor to Jones as a missionary. [...] As Jones was bilingual and bicultural, he could speak to and relate to the Mississaugas and the white Christian settlers in Upper Canada. [...] Later that year, Reverend Alvin Torry set up a congregation centered around Jones and Chief Thomas Davis (Tehowagherengaraghkwen) composed entirely of Indian members. [...] The pair encouraged converted Indians to settle around Davis' home, which acquired the name [...] "Davis' Hamlet" [...] or [...] "Davisville". [...] Jones and Seth Crawford taught Sunday school for the growing community, which began building a chapel in the spring of 1824. [...] Many of Jones' relatives were quickly converted and moved to Davis' Hamlet, including his mother Tuhbenahneequay, her daughter Wechikiwekapawiqua and Chief Wageezhegome (Wegiizhigomi, [...] "Who Possesses the Day"), Wechikiwekapawiqua's husband and Jones' uncle Joseph Sawyer (Nawahjegezhegwabe (Nawajii-giizhigwabi, [...] "He who Rests Sitting upon the Sky")). [...] Jones received his first official position in the church [...] exhorter [...] on March 1, 1825. [...] In this role, he spoke at services after local preachers and assisted travelling preachers during their circuit rides. [...] Church officials including Torry and Case recognised the need for a member fluent in Ojibwe who could translate hymns and bible passages, and present the Christian religion to the Indians in terms they could understand. [...] Jones was put to work as a teacher at the Grand River mission. [...] Around this time he began speaking to groups about Methodism. [...] In 1824, a few of his relatives came to see him speak and stayed at the Grand River mission so they could enroll their children in Jones' day school. [...] The Methodists of Upper Canada commissioned Jones, along with his brother John, to begin translating religious and instructive works in Ojibwe for use in the Methodists' schools. [...] In 1825, over half his band had converted to Christianity, and Jones decided to devote his life to missionary work.|$|E

There he talked about how he had stood in his belief and practiced <b>teetotalism</b> through his life in bureaucracy.

2500|$|In the past, Quakers {{were known}} for their use of thee as an {{ordinary}} pronoun, refusal to participate in war, plain dress, refusal to swear oaths, opposition to slavery, and <b>teetotalism.</b> Described as [...] "natural capitalists" [...] by the BBC journalist Peter Jackson, some Quakers founded banks and financial institutions, including Barclays, Lloyds, and Friends Provident; manufacturing companies, including shoe retailer C. & J. Clark and the big three British confectionery makers Cadbury, Rowntree and Fry; and philanthropic efforts, including abolition of slavery, prison reform, and social justice projects.|$|E
2500|$|NGUC thrived {{during the}} last decades of the nineteenth century, and its {{congregation}} grew to 80subscribers. The London Sunday School Society recognised the one at NGUC as the best in its class, educating up to 200children and necessitating the construction in 1887 of the schoolhouse immediately behind the main church building. [...] A range of groups sprung up, ranging from intellectual (a Society for Mutual Theological Study) to recreational (cycling and cricket). Young Men's and Young Women's groups met, as did the Mothers' Meeting, a Provident Society, and <b>teetotalism</b> (abstinence from alcohol) support for adults and children. Other issues of concern were education, social reform, and women's suffrage.|$|E
2500|$|In 1744, the {{directions}} the Wesleys {{gave to the}} Methodist societies required them [...] "to taste no spirituous [...] liquor ... unless prescribed by a physician." [...] Methodists later took {{a leading role in}} the temperance movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and Methodism remains associated with <b>teetotalism</b> in the public mind. Methodists saw alcoholic beverages, and alcoholism, as the root of many social ills and tried to persuade people to abstain from these. Temperance appealed strongly to the Methodist doctrines of sanctification and perfection. At one time, ministers had to take a pledge not to drink and encouraged their congregations to do the same. To this day, alcohol remains banned in Methodist premises. However, the choice to consume alcohol outside of church is now a personal decision for any member.|$|E
2500|$|The temperance {{movement}} appealed {{strongly to}} the Methodist doctrines of sanctification and Christian perfection. The Methodist presentation of sanctification includes {{the understanding that}} justification before God comes through faith. Therefore, those who believe are made new in Christ. The believer's response to this sanctification then is to uphold God's word in the world. A large part of this, especially in the late-19th century, was [...] "to be their brother's keepers, or [...] their brother's brothers." [...] Because of this sense of duty toward {{the other members of}} the church, many Methodists were personally temperate out of a hope that their restraint would give strength to their brothers. The Methodist stance against drinking was strongly stated in the Book of Discipline. Initially, the issue taken was limited to distilled liquors, but quickly evolved into <b>teetotalism</b> and Methodists were commonly known to abstain from all alcoholic beverages.|$|E
2500|$|Concern over {{excessive}} {{alcohol consumption}} began during the American colonial era, when fines were imposed for drunken behavior and for selling liquor without a license. In the eighteenth century, when drinking {{was a part}} of everyday American life, Protestant religious groups, especially the Methodists, and health reformers, including Benjamin Rush and others, urged Americans to curb their drinking habits for moral and health reasons. In particular, Benjamin Rush believed Americans were drinking hard spirits in excess, so he created [...] "A Moral and Physical Thermometer," [...] displaying the progression of behaviors caused by the consumption of various alcohols. By the 1840s the temperance movement was actively encouraging individuals to reduce alcohol consumption. Music (a completely new genre) was composed and performed in support of the efforts, both in social contexts and in response to state legislation attempts to regulate alcohol. Many took a pledge of total abstinence (<b>teetotalism)</b> from drinking distilled liquor as well as beer and wine. Prohibition remained a major reform movement from the 1840s until the 1920s, when nationwide prohibition went into effect, and was supported by evangelical Protestant churches, especially the Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Disciples of Christ, and Congregationalists. Kansas and Maine were early adopters of statewide prohibition. Following passage of the Maine law, Delaware, Ohio, Illinois, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New York, among others, soon passed statewide prohibition legislation; however, a number of these laws were overturned.|$|E

6000|$|JUNE 27th, Richelieu, {{taking his}} {{measures}} well, tickling French honor well, has determined on storm. Richelieu, giving {{order of the}} day, [...] "Whosoever of you is found drunk shall NOT be of the storm-party" [...] (which produced such a <b>teetotalism</b> as nothing else had done),--storms, that night, with extreme audacity. The Place has to capitulate: glorious victory; honorable defence: and Minorca gone.|$|E
60|$|And most {{especially}} was she daily tired of Gerard Godfrey! Had he always talked {{of nothing but}} 'the colours,' chants, E. C. U., classes, and <b>teetotalism?</b> Whatever she began it always came back to one or other of these subjects, and when she impatiently declared that she was perfectly sick of hearing of the Use of Sarum, {{he looked at her}} as guilty of a profanity.|$|E
60|$|It is of {{no avail}} to preach temperance and <b>teetotalism</b> to these people. The drink habit may {{be the cause of}} many miseries; but it is, in turn, the effect of other and prior miseries. The temperance advocates may preach their hearts out over the evils of drink, but until the evils that cause people to drink are abolished, drink and its evils will remain.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Kemp, {{somewhat}} affected, {{shook hands}} with him, and leaning back in the most comfortable chair in the room, described his life and struggles in New Zealand. Hard work, <b>teetotalism,</b> and the simple life combined appeared {{to be responsible for}} a fortune which he affected to be too old to enjoy. Misunderstandings of a painful nature were avoided by a timely admission that under medical advice he was now taking a fair amount of stimulant.|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the {{stranger}} and saw to his astonishment that {{he appeared to be}} struggling with a strong desire to laugh. His lips tightened and his shifty little eyes watered, but he conquered himself in a moment, and rising to his feet delivered a striking address in favour of <b>teetotalism.</b> He condemned whisky as not only wicked, but unnecessary, declaring with a side glance at the mate that two acidulated drops dissolved in water were an excellent substitute.|$|E
60|$|While I was {{wondering}} what answer I should make to this strange doctrine a servant girl announced that supper was ready, and {{we went into the}} next room to partake of a meal, plain indeed, but of most excellent quality. Moreover, I was glad to find, unlike his wife, who touched nothing but water, that Mr. Strong did not include <b>teetotalism</b> among his eccentricities. On the contrary, he produced a bottle of really fine port for my especial benefit.|$|E
60|$|Captain De Stancy knew himself conquered: he knew {{he should}} yield to Paula--had indeed yielded; but there was now, in his solitude, an hour or two of reaction. He did not drink from the bottles sent. He went early to bed, and lay tossing thereon till far into the night, {{thinking}} over the collapse. His <b>teetotalism</b> had, with the lapse of years, unconsciously become the outward and visible sign to himself of his secret vows; and a return to its opposite, however mildly done, signified with ceremonious distinctness the formal acceptance of delectations long forsworn.|$|E
60|$|Every {{building}} in Jerez is washed with lime, {{and in the}} sunlight the brilliancy is dazzling. You realise then that in Seville the houses are not white--although the general impression is of a white town--but, on the contrary, tinted with various colours from faintest pink to pale blue, pale green; they remind you of the summer dresses of women. The soft tones are all mingled with the sunlight and very restful. But Jerez is like a white banner floating under the cloudless sky, the pure white banner of Bacchus raised defiantly against the gaudy dyes of <b>teetotalism</b> and its shrieking trumpets.|$|E
60|$|So {{the talk}} went on, and {{presently}} they were criticising novelists, and certain daring essays of Wilkins got their due share of attention, {{and then they}} were discussing the future of the theatre. Ann Veronica intervened a little in the novelist discussion with a defence of Esmond and a denial that the Egoist was obscure, and when she spoke every one else stopped talking and listened. Then they deliberated whether Bernard Shaw ought to go into Parliament. And that brought them to vegetarianism and <b>teetotalism,</b> and the young man in the orange tie and Mrs. Goopes had a great set-to about the sincerity of Chesterton and Belloc that was ended by Goopes showing signs of resuming the Socratic method.|$|E
60|$|He had submitted, {{but still}} viewed himself as dedicated, {{and so far}} as {{business}} hours permitted, gave his services like a clerical pupil to St. Ambrose's with the greatest energy, and perhaps somewhat less judgment than if Mr. Dutton had been at hand. Being without natural taste for intellectual pursuits, unless drawn into them by his surroundings, he had dropped them entirely, and read nothing but the ephemeral controversial literature of his party, and not much of that, for he was teaching, preaching, exhorting, throughout his spare time; while the vicar was in too great need of help to insist on deepening the source from which his zealous assistant drew. As Miss Nugent observed, <b>teetotalism</b> was to him what dissipation was to other young men.|$|E
60|$|It {{was plain}} that, {{like so many}} of the {{extremely}} religious in the days before <b>teetotalism,</b> Attwater had a dash of the epicure. For such characters it is softening to eat well; doubly so to have designed and had prepared an excellent meal for others; and the manners of their host were agreeably mollified in consequence. A cat of huge growth sat on his shoulder purring, and occasionally, with a deft paw, capturing a morsel in the air. To a cat he might be likened himself, as he lolled at the head of his table, dealing out attentions and innuendoes, and using the velvet and the claw indifferently. And both Huish and the captain fell progressively under the charm of his hospitable freedom.|$|E
60|$|Victor and Axel {{said that}} we'd {{have a drink}} before we started on our long walk. Could I decline to drink with these two chesty shipmates? Drinking together, glass in hand, put the seal on comradeship. It was the way of life. Our {{teetotaler}} owner-captain was laughed at, and sneered at, by all of us because of his <b>teetotalism.</b> I didn't in the least want a drink, but I did {{want to be a}} good fellow and a good comrade. Nor did Louis' case deter me, as I poured the biting, scorching stuff down my throat. John Barleycorn had thrown Louis to a nasty fall, but I was young. My blood ran full and red; I had a constitution of iron; and--well, youth ever grins scornfully at the wreckage of age.|$|E
60|$|Poor woman! as {{her brother}} and sisters knew, there was {{reason to believe that}} the vice which had been fatal to her {{happiness}} and her husband's life, had descended to him from Dutch forefathers, and there was the less cause for wonder at the passionate desire to guard her son from it. Almost all her family had been water-drinkers from infancy, and though Major Harewood called <b>teetotalism</b> a superstitious contempt of Heaven's good gifts, and disapproved of supplementing the baptismal vow, his brother the Rector had found it expedient, for the sake of the parish, to embrace formally the temperance movement, and thus there had been little difficulty in giving way to Alda's desire that, at the luncheon-table, Adrian should never see wine or beer, and she insisted that the same rule should prevail at Rockquay.|$|E
60|$|The {{middle classes}} of modern England are quite fanatically fond of washing; {{and are often}} {{enthusiastic}} for <b>teetotalism.</b> I cannot therefore comprehend {{why it is that}} they exhibit a mysterious dislike of rain. Rain, that inspiring and delightful thing, surely combines the qualities of these two ideals with quite a curious perfection. Our philanthropists are eager to establish public baths everywhere. Rain surely is a public bath; it might almost be called mixed bathing. The appearance of persons coming fresh from this great natural lustration is not perhaps polished or dignified; but for the matter of that, few people are dignified when coming out of a bath. But the scheme of rain in itself is one of an enormous purification. It realises the dream of some insane hygienist: it scrubs the sky. Its giant brooms and mops seem to reach the starry rafters and Starless corners of the cosmos; it is a cosmic spring cleaning.|$|E
60|$|But {{this is not}} the {{essential}} note on which I desire to end. My main contention is that, whether necessary or not, both Industrialism and Collectivism have been accepted as necessities--not as naked ideals or desires. Nobody liked the Manchester School; it was endured as the only way of producing wealth. Nobody likes the Marxian school; it is endured as the only way of preventing poverty. Nobody's real heart is in the idea of preventing a free man from owning his own farm, or an old woman from cultivating her own garden, any more than anybody's real heart was in the heartless battle of the machines. The purpose of this chapter is sufficiently served in indicating that this proposal also is a pis aller, a desperate second best--like <b>teetotalism.</b> I do not propose to prove here that Socialism is a poison; it is enough if I maintain that it is a medicine and not a wine.|$|E
60|$|I have {{observed}} that the aggregate procession was on the whole pleasant to see. I made use of that qualified expression with a direct meaning, which I will now explain. It involves {{the title of this}} paper, and a little fair trying of <b>teetotalism</b> by its own tests. There were many people on foot, and many people in vehicles of various kinds. The former were pleasant to see, and the latter were not pleasant to see; for the reason that I never, on any occasion or under any circumstances, have beheld heavier overloading of horses than in this public show. Unless the imposition of a great van laden with from ten to twenty people on a single horse be a moderate tasking of the poor creature, then the temperate use of horses was immoderate and cruel. From the smallest and lightest horse to the largest and heaviest, there were many instances in which the beast of burden was so shamefully overladen, that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have frequently interposed in less gross cases.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he let me}} {{exonerate}} Harold {{from the}} charge of intemperance, pointing out that not even after the injury and operation, nor after yesterday's cold and fatigue, had he touched any liquor; but I don't think the notion of <b>teetotalism</b> was gratifying, even when I called it a private, individual vow. Nor could I make out whether his Australian life was known, and I was afraid to speak of it, lest I should be betraying what need never be mentioned. Of Viola's adventure, to my surprise, her uncle did not make much, but he had heard of that from the fountain-head, unpolluted by Stympson gossip; and, moreover, Lady Diana had been so disproportionately angry as to produce a reaction in him. Viola was his darling, and he had taken her part when he had found that she knew her brother was at hand. He allowed, too, that she might fairly be inspired with confidence by the voice and countenance of her captor, whom he seemed to view as a good-natured giant. But even this was an advance on [...] "the prize-fighter," [...] as Lady Diana and the Stympsons called him.|$|E
60|$|A powerful, robust, {{athletic}} man, in florid {{health and}} of temperate habits, yet with the full-blooded {{tendency of the}} eighteenth century vividly displayed in his ample face and broad features, Erasmus Darwin bubbled over with irrepressible vivacity, the outward and visible sign of that overflowing energy which forms everywhere one of the most marked determining conditions of high genius. Strong in body and strong in mind, a teetotaler before <b>teetotalism,</b> an abolitionist before the anti-slavery movement, he had a great contempt for weaknesses and prejudices of every sort, and he rose far superior to the age in which he lived in breadth of view and freedom from preconceptions. The eighteenth century considered him, in its cautious, cut-and-dried fashion, a man of singular talent but of remarkably eccentric and unsafe opinions. Unfortunately for his lasting fame, Dr. Darwin was much given to writing poetry; and this poetry, though as ingenious as everything else he did, had a certain false gallop of verse about it which has doomed it to become since Canning's parody a sort of warning beacon against the worst faults of the post-Augustan decadence in the ten-syllabled metre. Nobody now reads the 'Botanic Garden' except either to laugh at its exquisite extravagances, or to wonder at the queer tinsel glitter of its occasional clever rhetorical rhapsodies.|$|E
