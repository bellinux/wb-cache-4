5|$|Banksia serrata {{has shown}} a {{variable}} susceptibility to dieback from the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, the plants in sandier soils showing more resistance than those in heavier soils. Plants from Wilsons Promontory were sensitive. The resistance of plants from Flinders Island is unknown. <b>The</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of the stand renders it vulnerable to eradication.|$|E

5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of subsequent building.|$|E
5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, and only a few fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.|$|E

5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, {{like the}} alkali metals, has one valence {{electron}} and reacts easily with the halogens, but the similarities end {{there because of}} <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of a bare proton H+ compared to the alkali metal cations. Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration. It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties.|$|E
5|$|Leeds, {{like many}} {{industrial}} cities, has little remaining medieval architecture. The lack of Medieval architecture in central Leeds {{may be attributed}} to <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of the town during the majority of the period, the population usually being around 1,000.

This evidence, combined with <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of other primitive relatives such as Microraptor and the troodontid Anchiornis, indicates that the common ancestor of dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and birds (which is called the ancestral paravian) may have been very small, at around 65cm in length and 600 to 700grams of mass.|$|E

5|$|The {{measured}} {{density of}} iridium {{is only slightly}} lower (by about 0.12%) than that of osmium, the densest element known. Some ambiguity occurred regarding {{which of the two}} elements was denser, due to <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of the difference in density and difficulties in measuring it accurately, but, with increased accuracy in factors used for calculating density X-ray crystallographic data yielded densities of 22.56g/cm3 for iridium and 22.59g/cm3 for osmium.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes were}} {{primarily}} shot in Quiapo, Manila, church scenes {{were recorded in}} Iguig and dream sequences in Currimao, Ilocos Norte.

5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E

5|$|The {{sex of the}} {{different}} size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the pelvic bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set pelvic bones.

He concluded that <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>size</b> class with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males.|$|E
