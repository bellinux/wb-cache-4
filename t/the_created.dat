5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is not {{threatened by}} human activity, and is widespread throughout its range. The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the American goldfinch. Clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of neotropical migrants, while favoring short-distance migrants and permanent residents. This benefits the American goldfinch {{both as a}} short-distance migrant, and because <b>the</b> <b>created</b> open areas are the preferred environment of the bird, where weeds thrive which produce the primary food source of the American goldfinch.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} a create-a-superstar mode, where players {{are able to}} create their own wrestler, including their move set and ring entrances. The feature was introduced when WWF SmackDown! was released in 2000. As new games were released, the mode was altered; the first change came with the release of WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role, which featured a mode in which wrestler taunts could be created and customized. This was further modified in WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth, which enabled players to create the walking style of a wrestler. With the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006, the game first featured the ability for players to make an entrance for <b>the</b> <b>created</b> superstar. The feature was expanded with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007, as players could place pyrotechnics and special effects in any part of the superstar's entrance.|$|E

5|$|This mode was {{introduced}} in WWE 2K15, social media followers were counted for the WWE Universe liking the player (the number of followers can decrease if bad performances occur during matches); pre-set cutscenes {{that used to be}} created for Story Mode in WWE '12 to WWE 2K14 appear at random times. In WWE 2K16, the player has to fight for ranks to earn championships (the main goal is to reach the WWE Hall of Fame by fulfilling certain requirements). WWE 2K17 brings in a promo engine and every action can trigger a backstage brawl depending on what answer <b>the</b> <b>created</b> superstar gives. WWE 2K18 continues with the promo engine from 2k17 with free roaming now a central focus.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend <b>the</b> <b>created</b> championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature.|$|E

40|$|When {{analyzing}} animal behavior, it {{is important}} to consider the influence of learning principles. <b>The</b> <b>create</b> response of bottlenose dolphins, elicited by a discriminative stimulus, or an SD (visual cue presented to an animal by a trainer), has been described as an elective, often novel response based on arbitrary preferences of individual animals. The goal of this study was to identify the potential influence of reinforcement theory, response class, and primacy and recency on <b>the</b> <b>create</b> responses of bottlenose dolphins. Three, male subjects with an established mastery of <b>the</b> <b>create</b> paradigm, identified in this study as a non-specific, non-repeat contingency, were assessed over the course of two months while under stimulus control (pre-assessment), followed by evaluations of <b>the</b> <b>create</b> response (create assessment) using a double-blind sampling model. During <b>the</b> pre- and <b>create</b> assessments, each response was quantified regarding response class, frequency of request, and reinforcement type, frequency, and magnitude. When presented with <b>the</b> <b>create</b> SD, <b>the</b> dolphins elected to produce behaviors predominantly associated with the more recent training context (create assessment) versus behaviors associated with training that occurred months prior (pre-assessment), which may demonstrate the effects of primacy versus recency. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>create</b> trials were associated with reinforcement on a high frequency and magnitude, fixed, low ratio schedule, and the subjects most often performed the behaviors associated with the greatest magnitude of primary reinforcement, which highlights the influence of reinforcement and the law of effects. Lastly, two subjects never responded with high energy behaviors in <b>the</b> <b>create</b> contingency, and one subject performed significantly more low and medium energy responses when compared to high energy behaviors, capturing the effects of a response class characterized by intensity under a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>create</b> response was not represented by arbitrary elective preferences but rather, partially driven by the learning theories examined. ...|$|R

Certain specifics, such as the Trinity and the Incarnation, are revealed in the teachings in the Scriptures and can not otherwise be deduced except by special revelation.|$|E
