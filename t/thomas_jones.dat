5|$|Ernest Guest married Edith May, {{daughter}} of <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones</b> of Singapore. The couple met in Johannesburg, {{where she had}} been brought up by an uncle. They had two daughters and twin sons. Both their sons were killed in action in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, the chancel {{and north}} aisle walls were rebuilt, a porch was added {{on the south}} side and a vestry added on the north side in place of one within the north aisle that <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones</b> had created in 1840. The work was carried out by Henry Kennedy, the {{architect}} of the Diocese of Bangor.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, New York tied {{the game with}} running back <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones's</b> 17-yard {{touchdown}} run. However, the 49ers pulled away {{in the fourth quarter}} as kicker Joe Nedney nailed a 32-yard field goal, along with Hill completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bryant Johnson.|$|R
5000|$|When, {{in around}} 1840, Davies left Carmarthen, {{he went to}} work at Josiah <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones's</b> {{printing}} office at Cowbridge, where Jones had come from Merthyr Tydfil. He continued with the firm {{for the rest of his}} life, moving with Jones in 1842 to Carmarthen, and in 1854 to Aberdare.|$|R
5|$|On {{the first}} play after the turnover, <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones's</b> 52-yard run moved {{the ball to the}} Colts' 5-yard line. Three plays later, Rex Grossman threw a 4-yard {{touchdown}} pass to receiver Muhsin Muhammad, giving the Bears a 14–6 lead. After forcing an Indianapolis punt, Chicago lost another turnover when Cedric Benson's fumble was recovered by Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney on the Bears' 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field-goal attempt.|$|R
5|$|Receivers Muhsin Muhammad (60 receptions, 863yards, 5 touchdowns) and Bernard Berrian (51 receptions, 775yards, 7 touchdowns) {{provided}} the main deep threat on the team, along with tight end Desmond Clark, who caught 45 passes for 626yards and 6 touchdowns. Chicago's running game {{was led by}} running backs <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones</b> and Cedric Benson. Jones rushed for 1,210yards and caught 36 passes, while Benson rushed for 647yards and scored 6 touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Suevics {{first six}} years of service were uneventful, but then {{disaster}} struck. On 2 February 1907 she left Melbourne with scheduled stops at Cape Town, Tenerife, Plymouth, London and finally Liverpool, {{under the command of}} <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones.</b> On 17 March 1907, she was inbound to Liverpool with 382 passengers, 141 crew members and a nearly-full cargo, including thousands of sheep carcasses worth £400,000.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the third}} Super Bowl to have two players rush for more than 100 yards as Dominic Rhodes had 113 for the Colts and <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones</b> had 112 for the Bears.

50|$|In 2009, Faneca {{anchored}} the Jets to 2756 {{yards and}} 21 touchdowns, again leading the Jets to a 9-7 record and securing a wild-card playoff berth. They proceeded {{to defeat the}} Cincinnati Bengals in a 24-14 victory in that wildcard game. In an AFC divisional playoff game, the Jets beat the favored San Diego Chargers 17-14 behind Shonn Greene's 128 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} and <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones's</b> 41 yards, totaling 169 yards on the ground. They surprised many observers by beating the Chargers and going to the AFC Championship game where they eventually succumbed to the Indianapolis Colts 30-17.|$|R
25|$|The {{attacks on}} St. Mary's Isle and Whitehaven {{resulted}} in no prizes or profits {{which would be}} shared with the crew under normal circumstances, although their effect was significant on British morale and allocation of defense resources.

5|$|After {{a day at}} Mudd's house, Booth and Herold hired a local man {{to guide}} them to Samuel Cox's house.

5|$|During the Civil War {{the largest}} {{substantial}} {{conflict in the}} area was the Battle of Naseby in 1645, although a minor skirmish in the town resulted {{in the killing of}} a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer. Severe reprisals followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest, <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones,</b> and 40 prisoners by a group of Roundheads. However, after the Civil War Wellingborough was home to a colony of Diggers. Little is known about this period.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Bears {{started out}} their post-season with a 27–24 {{win over the}} Seattle Seahawks with Robbie Gould's 49-yard field goal in overtime. One week later, they {{defeated}} the New Orleans Saints 39–14 in the NFC Championship Game. Chicago dominated most of the game, jumping to a 16–0 early lead. Two touchdown passes from Saints quarterback Drew Brees, cut the score to 16–14, but the Bears responded with 23 unanswered points to propel them to their first Super Bowl since 1985. <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones</b> finished {{the game with a}} franchise postseason record 123 rushing yards and two touchdowns.|$|E

5000|$|The end of Jonson's {{career as}} a masquer for the Court, however, was due not to ill health but to a clash of personalities. Jonson and Jones had been {{partners}} {{in the creation of}} masques for the Stuart Court since The Masque of Blackness in 1605; but Jonson had long nourished a resentment against Jones, feeling that the architect took and received too much credit for the success of their joint projects. The poet expressed his resentment with thinly veiled ridicule of Jones in his works, starting at least as early as Bartholomew Fair in 1614 [...] - [...] the character Lanthorn Leatherhead in that play being a mockery of Jones. Since Jonson arranged for the publication of the texts of his masques, his name always preceded Jones's in these volumes; but when Choridia was published together with Callipolis, in a 1631 quarto issued by the bookseller <b>Thomas</b> Walkley, <b>Jones's</b> name was omitted entirely.|$|R

5|$|Still {{enduring}} is {{the debate}} {{as to why}} Voss chose to fight on against clearly almost impossible odds rather than disengage from the action. However, {{it is possible that}} he wanted to close the kill gap between himself and the Red Baron, by shooting down some British aircraft, so he stayed on. Although Voss's apparent refusal to retreat is not mentioned in the contemporary English combat reports, nor in McCudden's autobiography written in June and July 1918, McCudden is credited with the observation that Voss seemingly rejected several opportunities to disengage and withdraw from the tactically grave situation in which he found himself. In 1942 Hector Bolitho and James Ira <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones</b> received letters from both Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman concerning their recall of Voss's last stand. Bowman read and savaged the Chidlaw-Roberts account for its inaccuracies, although his own account had obvious errors. At the same time Bowman also stated that he believed Voss had an opportunity to disengage and save himself, but had deliberately chosen instead to fight in spite of the overwhelmingly unequal situation with which he was faced. This is the earliest positively identified historical source for the assertion that Voss rejected chances for a safe retreat that were open to him. The dogfight remains a subject of debate and controversy among combat aviation historians and interested parties.|$|E

His formative years were spent on his father's estate at Pencerrig near Builth Wells; thus he {{is often referred to}} as <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones</b> of Pencerrig to differentiate him from others of the same name. He was educated at Christ College, Brecon, and later at a school kept by Jenkin Jenkins at Llanfyllin in Montgomeryshire, before going to Oxford in 1759 to study at Jesus College. His university education was funded by a maternal uncle who, contrary to Jones's own wishes, hoped for him to enter the church. Jones dropped out of Oxford after this uncle’s death in 1761 and began to pursue his preferred career as an artist.|$|E

25|$|<b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones</b> (26 September 1742 – 29 April 1803) was a Welsh {{landscape}} painter. He was a pupil of Richard Wilson and {{was best}} known in his lifetime as a painter of Welsh and Italian landscapes {{in the style of}} his master. However, Jones's reputation grew in the 20th century when more unconventional works by him, not originally intended for exhibition, came to light. Most notable among these is a series of views of Naples which he painted from 1782 to 1783. By breaking with the conventions of classical landscape painting in favour of direct observation, they look forward to the work of Camille Corot and the Barbizon School in the 19th century. His autobiography, Memoirs of <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones</b> of Penkerrig, went unpublished until 1951 but is now recognised as an important source of information on the 18th-century art world.|$|E

In Howth's violent feuds with the new English settler families, particularly <b>Thomas</b> <b>Jones,</b> Archbishop of Dublin and his son, and Viscount Moore of Drogheda, Chichester invariably sided against Howth, but was unable to completely break his influence as he was a favourite of King James I.|$|E
