25|$|Elba's {{next film}} was Legacy (2010), {{in which he}} portrayed a black ops soldier who returns to Brooklyn after a failed mission in Eastern Europe, where he has {{undertaken}} a journey looking for retribution. He starred in Dark Castle's adaptation of DC/Vertigo's The Losers, {{under the direction of}} Sylvain White, in the role of Roque, the second-in-command of a black-ops team out for revenge against a government that did <b>them</b> <b>wrong.</b> Filming took place in Puerto Rico and the movie was released in April 2010. Elba appeared in the thriller Takers (2010). He played Heimdall in Kenneth Branagh's film Thor (2011) (based on the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name).|$|E

25|$|The secret {{agreement}} was concluded without any Japanese text {{so that it}} could be plausibly denied in Japan. Since only the American officials recorded the oral agreement, not having the agreement recorded in Japanese allowed Japan's leaders to deny its existence without fear that someone would leak a document to prove <b>them</b> <b>wrong.</b> The arrangement also made it appear that the United States alone was responsible for the transit of nuclear munitions through Japan. However, the original agreement document turned up in 1969 during preparation for an updated agreement, when a memorandum was written by a group of U.S. officials from the National Security Council Staff; the Departments of State, Defense, Army, Commerce and Treasury; the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Central Intelligence Agency; and the United States Information Agency.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, the Supervisor of the Masters of Writing (尚書僕射) wrote a {{memorial}} to Sun Quan, recommending the emperor to entrust Sun Lü with greater responsibilities by appointing him as a military general. Sun Quan approved, granted Sun Lü imperial authority, and appointed him as Senior General Who Guards the Army (鎮軍大將軍). Sun Lü was also allowed to set up his own office with a personal staff at his headquarters in Banzhou (半州; west of present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi). Sun Quan also issued an imperial decree to Sun Lü, stating his high hopes and expectations for his second son to become a great military leader. At the time, many people were worried that Sun Lü, given his noble status and young age, might not be suitable for the job. However, Sun Lü not only proved <b>them</b> <b>wrong,</b> but also exceeded their expectations as he took his role seriously, faithfully followed the laws and rules, and treated his colleagues and seniors respectfully.|$|E
500|$|Cresswell {{admitted}} {{he had not}} made the impact {{he had hoped to}} in the York first team, but ahead of 1998–99 said [...] "I've had some stick from a small number of fans, but hopefully I can prove <b>them</b> <b>wrong.</b> I will prove <b>them</b> <b>wrong.</b> This a big season for me. I want to do it for York City. I want to do it for myself." [...] After a positive start to the season, Cresswell attracted attention from other clubs, with a number of scouts attending matches to watch him play. Manager Alan Little claimed some clubs were making illegal approaches for the player, and that this was having a detrimental effect on his performances. Preston North End manager David Moyes claimed his club had a bid of more than £500,000 for Cresswell rejected, while York chairman Douglas Craig rejected this, saying a formal offer had not been received from any club. He was York's top scorer in 1998–99 with 19 goals from 42 appearances.|$|E

[...] Copsey also added that it isn't the [...] "greatest song of all time, nor the most original you'll hear this year, but the feeling we get from it more than makes up for it."

500|$|After the {{completion}} of Sonic 3D Blast in 1996, Sega approached Traveller's Tales about working on another Sonic game, this time being a racing game. Traveller's Tales, who coincidentally {{had been working on}} a 3D graphics engine without a purpose at the time, found this to be a logical progression, and accepted the project. Development started in February 1997 as a joint project between Sega's Sonic Team and Traveller's Tales. The game was originally known as Sonic TT (the TT standing for Tourist Trophy). Sonic Team designed the race tracks and the game's general flow, and Traveller's Tales were responsible for the implementation and programming. Sega of Europe producer Kats Sato handled communication with Sonic Team, as he was the only person who could speak both English and Japanese. Discussions led to the reward mechanisms, which Sato believed broadened the game. The courses' look and feel were inspired by other Sonic games, including Sonic 3D Blast. The 3D models were based on 2D sketches from Sonic Team. All models and animations were developed using Softimage, while Traveller's Tales created their own tools for the remaining game development.) Implementing the two-player split-screen mode proved difficult: programmer Jon Burton stated that this was mainly because it was difficult to ensure cheating was not too easy, so shortcuts were made challenging, with a penalty incurred if players got <b>them</b> <b>wrong.</b> A major development goal was to maintain a consistent 30 frames per second frame rate during gameplay. A custom game engine was developed {{to take full advantage of}} the Sega Saturn hardware and a graphical technique, described as [...] "12 layer transparency", was used to transparentise distant textures to conceal the Sega Saturn's limited draw distance. Burton claimed that Sonic R could not have been replicated on other consoles during the timeframe, such as the PlayStation console, due to the technique developed specifically for the Sega Saturn hardware.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Cook {{was asked}} to provide an expert opinion on {{military}} intelligence that the Germans were developing long-range rockets. Cherwell, Crow and Cook were agreed that a long-range liquid-propellant rocket was technologically infeasible, and a solid-propellant rocket using cordite would be impractically large. Wernher von Braun proved <b>them</b> <b>wrong,</b> with the successful deployment of the V-2 rocket. Cook {{then turned to the}} study of missile guidance mechanisms for the British Liquid Oxygen-Petrol / Guided Aerial Projectile [...] (LOP/GAP) liquid-propellant rocket. After the war he became director of the Ministry of Supply's Rocket Propulsion Establishment at Westcott, Buckinghamshire.|$|E

2500|$|Bīrūnī {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} Muslim authorities on the history of religion. Al-Biruni was a pioneer in the study of comparative religion.

2500|$|In {{international}} relations, post-hegemony references {{the decline}} of the US unilateral hegemony.

These difficulties predominantly include disdain from; those directly affected by the, sometimes forceful, hegemonic actions of the US, those who spectated the actions, and even Americans themselves who view the actions of their government as immoral. For example, after the Vietnam War, in 1978, 72% of Americans thought the war was not a mistake but fundamentally wrong and immoral. This exemplifies the hegemonic decline, how could the US maintain the legitimacy of their interventions, if their own citizens find <b>them</b> <b>wrong</b> and immoral? ...|$|E

2500|$|Once more, the Red Sox faced ALCS elimination. [...] But {{one person}} who was not panicking was Manny Ramírez.
