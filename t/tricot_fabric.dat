25|$|In {{the early}} 80Â´s Kjell Eng, {{the founder of}} Engtex, got the idea to use {{textiles}} for protection and cut prevention. Having worked as a logger earlier in life, he was very aware of the danger in using and handling a chainsaw. The first generation of protective fabrics consisted of a multi-layered and specially designed <b>tricot</b> <b>fabric</b> that peeled off layer by layer at contact with the cutting chains. This was the start and the first-ever chainsaw protective fabric was born. Statistics showed a reduction in injuries at work-related accidents in forestry and logging. However the new fabrics did not stop the more severe accidents with deep cuts and lethal outcome.|$|E
50|$|A {{headliner}} {{often is}} a composite material that is adhered to the inside roof of automobiles or yachts. It typically consists of a face fabric with nonwoven or foam backing. Headliners consist of multilayered composite materials that bring together multiple functionalities, including the requested look, feel, stiffness, and sound reduction needed in cars. Automotive headliners are optimised with respect to head impact counter measures or to integrate additional LED lighting film behind the fabric. Most headliners consist of a <b>tricot</b> knit <b>fabric</b> that is napped to provide a soft touch and uniform appearance. The fabric is adhered to melted polyurethane foam. This fabric-foam composite is glued to the interior fiberglass roof of the automobile.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{disperse}} dyes {{were selected to}} dye the new <b>tricot</b> warp-knitted curtain <b>fabric</b> under high temperature and pressure, and fabrics of different colors could be obtained. Then the optical properties of fabrics were tested through the method of spectrophotometer, the effect of color on optical properties was analyzed. The results indicated that fabrics dyed by different dyes have different optical properties; its optical transmittance and reflectance decreases after dyeing, which make transmittance and reflection performance worse. The dark purple, deep yellow and light yellow samples have better light-admitting and anti-peep performance than other samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{quasi-static}} strength, stiffness, {{and fatigue}} properties of cross-ply, angle-ply, and quasi-isotropic vinyl ester/E-glass non-woven <b>tricot</b> stitched <b>fabric</b> composite laminates fabricated from the Continuous Resin Transfer Molding (CRTM) pultrusion process were {{the focus of}} this research. The tricot stitch and the 6 % vinyl ester matrix cure shrinkage were found to play key roles in the quasi-static and fatigue strength and stiffness properties of these laminates. Laminates tested transverse to the pultrusion axis had greater fiber undulation and maximum of 44 % quasi-static strength reduction and 8 % stiffness reduction compared with axially tested specimens. While the matrix failure strain was 1. 9 %, failure strain of these laminates range over 1. 91 to 2. 08 % when tested along the pultrusion axis and as low as 1. 29 % transverse to the pultrusion axis. Fatigue evaluation, in load control mode, evaluated laminate SN, stiffness reduction, and residual strength. Measured S-N curves and residual strength curves compared with literature were found most like woven fabric laminates, well below aerospace grade laminates. Residual strength and life analysis using Reifsnider's methodology [43], revealed that the choice of quasi-static strength and stiffness, S-N curve, laminate stiffness reduction, and residual strength shape parameter, J, strongly affect predicted life. Predictions at high fatigue stress/low cycle were more exact than at low stress; the S-N curve was steep initially but at low stress/high cycle was nearly horizontal. The best predictions utilized separate off-axis stiffness reductions of E 2 obtained from cross-ply and G 12 from angle-ply laminates, the quasistatic strength and stiffness of the laminate predicted, and the average S-N and residual strength curves [...] ...|$|R
