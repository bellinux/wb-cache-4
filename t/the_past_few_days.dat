40|$|According to NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health), 20 million Americans {{consumed}} {{drugs in}} <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> 30 <b>days.</b> Combating {{illicit drug use}} is {{of great interest to}} public health and law enforcement agencies. Despite of the importance, most of the existing studies on drug uses rely on surveys. Surveys on sensitive topics such as drug use may not be answered truthfully by the people taking them. Selecting a representative sample to survey is another major challenge. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using big multimedia data, including both images and text, from social media in order to discover drug use patterns at fine granularity with respect to demographics. Instagram posts are searched and collected by drug related terms by analyzing the hashtags supplied with each post. A large and dynamic dictionary of frequent drug related slangs is used to find these posts. User demographics are extracted using robust face image analysis algorithms. These posts are then mined to find common trends with regard to the time and location they are posted, and further in terms of age and gender of the drug users. Furthermore, by studying the accounts followed by the users of drug related posts, we extract common interests shared by drug users.

Even if she tries something she doesn't keep at it for very long, due to her lack of confidence. Science is her only strong point that she inherited from her ancestor Galileo and parents. She has a big interest in Japanese culture and food, and is constantly seen eating Japanese confection. She is reserved and quiet, but in truth she is most likely to take action first of the three sisters and stand up for her own rights. Even though not shown in the beginning and her comment about her family being in pieces, she is actually very protective of her siblings and parents.

Huang Qi was arrested on June 3, 2000, and sentenced to five years imprisonment on May 9, 2003 by the Chengdu Intermediate People's Court for the crime of inciting subversion of state power. During the Sichuan Earthquake, Huang Qi's work and his website were widely reported by media to help find missing people to unite family members.

The 6th Army's Chief of Staff—Major General Arthur Schmidt—argued that a breakout was unfeasible and instead suggested that Army Group Don take steps to better supply entrapped Axis forces by air.

Jeff Smoodge and a group of troops appear at Fletcher's home and detain Mulder, Fletcher, Scully and the flight data recorder in their car.
