These varactors have a curved cantilever electrode that is actuated by a single pull-down electrode. The shape of the cantilever is designed such that its local stiffness is tailored to enable extended stable zipping.

Today’s plurality of high data-rate communication signals requires high linearity and efficiency of the wireless transceiver.

40|$|Many phase {{modulation}} schemes generally rely on phase-to-RF and amplitude-to-RF modulation alignment. Splitting a signal into amplitude and phase components and feeding them into separate paths potentially has major advantages. While theoretically achievable, amplitude and {{phase modulation}} time alignment remains a challenge. 				One of the phase modulation schemes is outphasing. Outphasing, {{also known as}} linear amplification with nonlinear components (LINC), improves the efficiency while maintaining linearity. To do so, any arbitrary signal splits into amplitude and phase. Then outphasing modulator generates two constant envelope phase modulated vectors also known as outphasing signals. Since outphasing signals are constant envelope, they can be fed into high-efficiency switching mode power amplifiers (PAs). Therefore, efficiency improves without degrading the linearity. Recombining the amplified outphasing signals after PAs, restores the phase and amplitude of the desired output signal. In this scheme, splitting the input signal into amplitude and phase is handled in digital domain thus {{reducing the risk of}} time mismatch between amplitude-to-RF and phase-to-RF modulation.

The power amplifier consumes most of the power in a receiver/transmitter system (transceiver), and its output signal is directly transmitted by the antenna without further modification. Thus, optimizing the PA for low power consumption, increased linearity, and compact integration is highly desirable. Micro-electromechanical systems enable new levels of performance in radio-frequency integrated circuits, which are not readily available via conventional IC technologies. They are good candidates to replace lossy, low Q-factor off-chip components, which have traditionally been used to implement matching networks or output resonator tanks in class AB, class F, or class E power amplifiers. The MEMS technologies also make possible the use of new architectures, with the possibility of flexible re-configurability and tunability for multi-band and/or multi-standard applications.

At present, MEMS technology for radio-frequency (RF) applications is maturing steadily, and significant improvements have been demonstrated over solid-state components. A wide range of RF MEMS varactors have been fabricated in the last fifteen years. Despite demonstrating tuning ranges and quality factors that far surpass solid-state varactors, certain challenges remain. Firstly, it is difficult to scale up capacitance values while preserving a small device footprint. Secondly, many highly-tunable MEMS varactors include complex designs or process flows.

40|$|Varactors form an {{important}} part of many communication circuits. They are utilized in oscillators, tunable matching networks, tunable filters and phase-shifters. This thesis deals with the design, analysis, characterization and applications of a novel MEMS varactor. Lower actuation voltage and higher dynamic range are the two important issues widely addressed in the study of MEMS varactors. The pull-in instability, due to which only 33 % of the gap between plates could be covered smoothly, greatly reduces useful dynamic range of MEMS varactors. We propose a torsional MEMS varactor that exploits “displacement amplification” whereby pull-in is overcome and wide dynamic range is achieved. The torsion beam in the device undergoes torsion as well as bending. Behavior of the device has been analyzed through torque and force balance. Based on the torque balance and the force balance expressions, theoretical limits of torsion angle and bending for stable operation have been derived. Torsional MEMS varactors and its variants are fabricated through a commercial fabrication process (polyMUMPS) and extensive characterization has been carried out. Capacitance-voltage characteristics show a maximum dynamic range of 1 : 16 with parasitic capacitance subtracted out from the capacitance values. A bidirectional torsional varactor, in which the top AC plate moves not only towards bottom plate but also away from bottom plate, is also tested. The bottom AC plate is isolated from low resistivity substrate with a thin nitride layer. This gives rise to large parasitic capacitances at higher frequencies. So to avoid <b>this,</b> a <b>varactor</b> with both AC plates suspended in air is designed and fabricated. A dynamic range of 1 : 8 including parasitic capacitances has been achieved. Self-actuation is studied on fabricated structures and a torsional varactor that overcomes self-actuation has been proposed. Hysteresis behavior of the torsional varactor is analyzed for different AC signals across the varactor plates. Effects of residual stress on C-V characteristics are studied and advantages and disadvantages of residual stress on device performance are discussed. The torsional varactors have been cycled between Cmax and Cmin for 36 hours continuously without any failure. High-frequency characteristics of torsional varactors are analyzed through measurements on one-port and two port configurations.

Among the technologies, semiconductor varactor is the critical component that is capable of implementing tunable and adaptive characteristics, particularly for the frond- end components of the wireless communication systems. For base station applications, high voltage handling capability, typically of 100 V or greater, high quality factor (Q), typically of above 100 at operation frequency, and high linearity, OIP 3 > 65 dBm, are required.

This thesis presents various varactor diode-based circuit topologies that facilitate RF adaptivity. The proposed varactor configurations can act as variable capacitors with high tuning range, low losses and ultra-low distortion, while being continuously tunable and facilitating fast modulation.

The challenges on varactors for these applications are brought out, which suggests an urgent need for high-performance <b>varactors.</b> <b>This</b> chapter ends with a descriptive and flow-graph-like outline of the thesis. Chapter 2 presents an overview of the state-of-the-art tunable elements such as BST varactors, MEMS based switches and varactors, and currently available semiconductor switches and varactors. Their advantages and drawbacks are extensively discussed. These surveys clarify the motivation and goal of this thesis, and can at the same time be used as a reference to place this research with respect to the existing literature. To overcome the limitations of currently available tunable elements, Chapter 3 deals with the theory of two novel extremely linear varactor diode configurations with complementary linearity properties in a single varactor diode technology. Both varactor configurations use anti-series varactor diode configurations, where the diodes share the same exponential C(VR) depletion capacitance relation. However, the proposed structures differ in their harmonic terminations and varactor area ratios, resulting in a fundamentally different linearity behavior versus tone spacing. It is this feature that makes it possible to address different requirements of transmit and receive chains in one single technology. In Chapter 4, all varactor configurations, aiming for the cancellation of third-order intermodulation distortion, are summarized and their performance are compared. It is shown that the unique feature of the narrow tone-spacing varactor stack, compared to other “infinite” impedance center-tapped varactor stacks and MEMS varactors, is its high modulation frequency for operation and high linearity for signals with low tone spacing, making it perfectly suitable for many dynamic RF modulation applications. The wide tone-spacing varactor stack, which can be implemented in the same process technology as the narrow tone-spacing varactor stack, offers a complementary linearity behavior in terms of tone spacing and it can be regarded as a bonus, provided that the use of the narrow tone-spacing varactor stack is compulsory. In addition, their exponential C(VR) relationship generally yields larger tuning range compared to the uniformly doped varactors, i. e., the distortion-free varactor stack. When the multi-stack topology is used to further improve the IM 5 dominated linearity and power handling capability, it turns out that this stacking yields a linearity improvement that is the double of what is generally found for IM 3 dominated devices. The system-level responses of the different varactor configurations are investigated under different bandwidth or data-rate conditions. It reveals that the narrow tone-spacing varactor stack is suitable for both moderate and high data-rate applications, while varactor configurations with linearity limitations at low tone spacings, like the distortion-free varactor stack, may raise some in-band distortion when the bandwidth under consideration is relatively small. Chapter 5 discusses the technology implementation issues and provides the experimental verification of the proposed varactor configurations. The measurement results provide the experimental evidence for the predicted IM 3 cancellation, as well as, for the complementary linearity behavior of the narrow tone-spacing varactor stack and wide tone-spacing varactor stack. Their usability in practical circuit conditions was demonstrated through source-pull simulations and measurements, illustrating that high linearity can be maintained in all cases. The multi-stack topology is used to further reduce the IM 5 dominated nonlinearity of the narrow tone-spacing varactor stack, yielding a record high linearity for continuously tunable capacitances. Using the ability to adjust the C-VR relationship through the doping profile, the desired capacitance control range and related control voltage are achieved for various practical applications. In particular, the measured data of Skyworks’ pre-production GaAs varactors represent the current state-of-the-art in tuning range, linearity and quality factor among all existing continuously tunable elements. As two application examples of the novel varactors, the adaptive matching networks for mobile handsets are demonstrated in Chapter 6, while a phase shifter and amplitude modulator are given in Chapter 7. The demonstrated adaptive matching networks in Chapter 6 are focused on the efficiency enhancement of the power amplifier in the presence of antenna mismatch. Making use of a varactor-based approach, the resulting networks are capable of dynamically correcting the antenna mismatch with the VSWR of 10 over the whole Smith-chart. For all these conditions, an optimum loading for a power level between 0. 5 W and 1 W is offered to the power amplifier stage along with a relatively high operating power gain. The proposed “whole Smith-chart” solution will ease the design of the RF frontend and antennas, yielding a significant reduction in the time-to-market of mobile phones. As another application example, given in Chapter 7, ultra linear low-loss varactors are applied for the implementation of amplitude and phase modulators, which can be used in phase diversity systems. The designed structures allow rapid amplitude and phase modulation with a very low distortion. These components can not only improve the performance of existing RF systems, like phased-array antennas and active load-pull system, but also facilitate other new circuit implementations or RF applications. As a demonstration, a novel polar modulator is proposed that can considerably simplify the structure of the traditional transmitter architecture, while being capable of generating the complex signals, which are typically in use in wireless communication systems. Chapter 8 presents the conclusions and recommendations of this research. The most important conclusion is that the linearization techniques proposed in this thesis has enabled the implementation of ultra linear low-loss varactors. Making use of these varactors, various adaptive circuits can be designed for adaptive RF systems.
