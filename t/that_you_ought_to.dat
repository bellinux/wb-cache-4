[...] Nevertheless, the marriage was a success. [...] Eliza understood her husband and did not complain about his frequent absences. [...] The couple had one son, Edward Fleming Sheffey, (1865–1933), who became a successful Lynchburg businessman. [...] He remembered as a boy telling his father, “Uncle Johnny thinks <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{spend more time with}} your family,” to which Sheffey replied, “Son, Uncle Johnny doesn’t know which way the rats run. [...] The Lord will take care of you.” [...] Eventually even the Staffords were reconciled to the marriage.|$|E

6000|$|... “I {{should be}} {{the last person to}} suggest <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should do {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> do to—” began Mrs. Bebberly Cumble impressively.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear me, mamma, here is Sophy declaring <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be a charity-schoolmistress. You wont {{be angry}} with her, {{but it is so}} funny!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose,' {{said the}} cousin, 'you won't prosecute, will you? It's really such {{shocking}} luck, you know, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> forget you're a master.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it seems}} to me, my dear fellow, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be very much obliged to Crosbie;--that is to say, if you've a mind to--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] said Mr. Chase, with a chuckle. [...] "Go on. Don't mind me. <b>You</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{be on the}} stage, Gussie, <b>that's</b> where <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, say--my friend--don't {{you know}} any better than to be whittling the ship all <b>to</b> pieces <b>that</b> way? <b>You</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> know better than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'By Jove! <b>that's</b> bad. <b>You</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> lie up in {{hospital}} for a while. I've had a turn of it myself. It's as bad as being blind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I said <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{be ashamed}} of yourself," [...] {{answered}} his nephew, standing his ground bravely; [...] "and, what is more, I meant it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} to me, then, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> force her out {{of that kind of}} thing. Why should she not go down to Herefordshire?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} have thrown away nothing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> keep," [...] she said at last. [...] "It {{seems to me that}} you have got everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not so sure," [...] {{answered}} my mother, [...] "it's in the blood. I've often thought <b>that</b> <b>you,</b> Luke, <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{have been a}} poet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will give}} you twenty crowns," [...] Gerald replied; [...] "and {{considering}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> owe your life to my interposition, I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> haggle about terms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Five o'clock, I think," [...] said Dele, plaintively. [...] "The iron--I {{mean the}} rabbit {{came off the}} fire about <b>that</b> time. <b>You</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have seen Gen. Pinkney, Joe, when--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly {{it so far}} {{concerns}} you, Hetta, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> know it. And I {{trust you}} will {{believe that it was}} my intention to tell it you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Frank, {{go up to}} her," [...] again {{urged the}} doctor. [...] "You've been ready enough with your visits when you knew <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> stay away." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'And I {{really must}} say again <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> be {{in such a}} hurry, and wait for a few years. You might go higher than a {{bankrupt}} pa'son's girl then.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was I? Was I? To be sure, yes. I {{was saying}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> let {{yourself}} get tired. Deuce of a thing, getting tired. Plays the dickens with the system." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{answered}} his nephew, on whose good-tempered face a curious look of contempt and anger had gathered, [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{be ashamed of}} yourself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|LEVER. If {{you tell}} the Colonel about this sale the poor old chap will think me a man <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{have nothing to do}} with. Do you want that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are all saying <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> give up {{the case}} to Dr. Mulbridge. But I hope you won't. I should n't blame you for calling in another female physician"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{can you say}} so. Gerald? Did <b>you</b> {{not know}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> scribble in books? Can <b>you</b> say <b>that</b> Miss Morley has not often spoken {{to you about the}} Atlas?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hoped more. Perhaps I thought more. Nay, Isabel, do not {{interrupt}} me. When {{they told}} me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were to be your uncle's heir, I knew <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> marry me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{who will}} do it," [...] said Lionel, [...] "it is an impudent, ungentlemanlike thing, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> all <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be ashamed of. I declare papa shall hear of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't say that, sir, don't say that. The cost {{of being}} {{moved to the}} Bench is almost insignificant, and if the general feeling is strong <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be there, why--really--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... '--Says {{what has}} some sense in it, that [...] "nothing is so ruinous as doing things by halves," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{be ashamed of}} hanging about here doing nothing--' ...|$|E

60|$|ANN. They see you coming. Anybody can see <b>you</b> coming, Daddy. <b>That's</b> why <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be so careful. I {{shall make}} {{you wear a}} hard hat. Those squashy hats of yours are hopelessly inefficient.|$|R
6000|$|LADY CICELY (sternly). Certainly not. I {{would not}} allow such a thing, {{even if you were}} wicked enough to attempt it. No. What I say is, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> tell the story {{yourself}} ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure the}} Countess has forgiven me," [...] I said, [...] "and in <b>that</b> case <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> bear no grudge. As I {{have had the}} honour to say, I will call upon her immediately." ...|$|R
