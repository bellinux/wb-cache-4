5000|$|Urban Waste (active 1981-84) was a {{hardcore}} punk {{band that}} was part of the New York renaissance of hardcore punk in the early 1980s. Much more raw, visceral, and overtly confrontational than their New York punk predecessors, they were contemporaries of Reagan Youth (of which bass player Andy Apathy was an early member), the earliest incarnation of the Beastie Boys, and Bad Brains. They belonged to a group of bands coming out of the borough of Queens that included [...] Kraut, Gilligan's Revenge (later called <b>Token</b> <b>Entry),</b> Murphy's Law, and The Mob. The band, like many others of the era, was short-lived, and after the breakup several members went on to form Major Conflict.|$|E
5000|$|Arthur {{sought to}} form a {{hardcore}} band and asked Civ to act as vocalist. However Civ {{was not interested in}} singing, and had to face the floor or wall during early gigs due to nerves. Members of the band <b>Token</b> <b>Entry</b> arranged a gig for the still unnamed band (Gorilla Biscuits used Token Entry's drummer, Ernie Parada for that first show), but needed a name to give it to the promoter. A popular drug in the area at that time was quaaludes, which people called [...] "ape shit," [...] or [...] "gorilla biscuits" [...] due to the pill's large size. Eventually the name evolved into Gorilla Biscuits, and though it was initially only meant to be temporary, they have continued to use it.|$|E

40|$|RoadRunner is an {{in-vehicle}} app {{for traffic}} congestion control without costly roadside infrastructure, instead judiciously harnessing vehicle-to-vehicle communications, cellular connectivity, and onboard computation and sensing to enable large-scale traffic congestion control at higher penetration and finer granularity than previously possible. RoadRunner limits {{the number of}} vehicles in a congested region or road by requiring each to possess a <b>token</b> for <b>entry.</b> <b>Tokens</b> can circulate and be reused among multiple vehicles as vehicles move between regions. We built RoadRunner as an Android app utilizing LTE, 802. 11 p, and 802. 11 n radios, deployed it on 10 vehicles, and measured cellular access reductions of up to 84 % and response time improvements of up to 80 %. In a microscopic agent-based traffic simulator, RoadRunner achieved travel speed improvements of up to 7. 7 % over an industry-strength electronic road pricing system.

5000|$|Two, three, or four can play, without partnerships. At the {{beginning}} of the game, each player's four tokens are out of play and [...] in one of the large corner areas of the board in the player's colour (the player's home base or yard  ). When able to, the players will enter their tokens one per time on their respective starting squares, and proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the game track (the path of squares not part of any player's home column). When reaching the square below his home column, a player continues by racing tokens up the column to the finishing square. The rolls of a single cube die control the swiftness of the <b>tokens,</b> and <b>entry</b> to the finishing square requires a precise roll from the player. The first to bring all their tokens to the finish wins the game. The others often continue play to determine second-, third-, and fourth-place finishers.|$|R
40|$|The {{valuation}} of public recreational facilities {{is complicated by}} the absence of a market established price. In this study, existing methods for valuing non-market priced recreational resources have been refined to compensate for price absence. In addition, crosselasticities of demand between recreation resources have been comptted to describe their substitution relationships. Questionnaires were mailed to a random sample of 2, 000 owners of motorboats registered in Arizona to determine their socioeconomic characteristics, participation habits, expected participation during the 1967 boating season and costs of operating their boating outfit. To those respondents returning an acceptable questionnaire a returnable cost accounting ledger was mailed in which the boat owner could keep a complete record of his boating activities and costs during the study period. The expected participation information yielded by the questionnaire describes a boating season participation pattern unconstrained by short-run fluctuations due to unforeseen incidents. This exhibits the potential value of the facility for recreational use. Further, it was found that expected number of trips {{can be used as a}} single predictor variable for estimating recreation use for the forthcoming season. Since public recreation areas generally have only a <b>token</b> <b>entry</b> fee, their value may be captured by consumers in the form of a consumer's surplus. Compensated demand curves for the recreation resources were constructed to eliminate the income effect of a theoretical price change. This was accomplished by grouping consumers into cells according to their income and variable costs of participation, then calculating the differences in annual total fixed costs of participation between the marginal consumer (with the highest annual total fixed costs) and each intramarginal consumer within each cell. The value of a recreation resource obtained in the above manner represents the value to a perfectly discriminating monopolist. The value of reservoirs based on expected participation were found to be greater than resource value determined under actual participation, probably due to intercedence of short-run factors affecting actual participation plans. Demand curves for the recreation experience at different locations were constructed by linearly regressing actual and expected number of trips, respectively, on average total costs of participation. The elasticity of demand, in all instances, was inelastic, relating the relative insensitivity of the motorboat recreation market, in terms of participation adjustment, to changes in average total costs of participation. Actual participation demand, however, tended to be more elastic than expected participation demand, thus reflecting the constraints imposed on actual participation by various short-run factors. Cross-elasticities of demand between selected pairs of reservoirs were computed to describe the extent to which a shift in participation might occur at one reservoir as a result of an entrance fee imposition or increase at another assuming that the costs of attending all other reservoirs will remain constant. Three combinations of signs were found to exist among the reservoir pairs. With both signs positive the locations were assumed to bear a competitive relationship, offering a substitute recreation experience. If both signs were negative the locations were assumed to have a complementary relationship, implying that the locations do not offer a substitute recreation experience, though not necessarily independent. Finally, when one sign was positive and the other negative, the location with a substitute relationship to the other was assumed to offer the superior recreation experience. Sign combinations, however, did not remain consistent between pairs of reservoirs from actual to expected participation computations. Substitution relationships based on actual participation computations were discounted on the basis that due to such a small number of observations of actual attendance an accurate representation of the perception of the recreation experience was not obtained. Further, the substitution relationships based on expected attendance appeared more realistic than those based on actual attendance. Major factors influencing reservoir substitution relationships appeared to be the proximity of the resource locations to a major population center, their similarity in physical and/or user characteristics, accessibility and general level of facility development...|$|E

There are four play modes. In Theme mode, only pre-constructed theme decks may be used. In standard mode the player's deck can only use cards which are legal in the current standard rotation (each year older cards are retired from play). Expanded mode allows cards from the expanded rotation. In unlimited mode, any cards are allowed, however the unlimited mode has been restricted to only be a playable option with online friends in a Friend Battle.|$|R
40|$|Smartphones are pervasive, and possess {{powerful}} processors, multi-faceted sensing, {{and multiple}} radios. However, networked mobile apps still typically use a client-server programming model, sending all shared data queries and uploads through the cellular network, incurring bandwidth consumption and unpredictable latencies. Leveraging the local compute power and device-to-device communications of modern smartphones can mitigate demand on cellular networks and improve response times. This thesis presents two systems towards this vision. First, we present DIPLOMA, which aids developers in achieving this vision {{by providing a}} programming layer to easily program a collection of smartphones connected over adhoc wireless. It presents a familiar shared data model to developers, while underneath, it implements a distributed shared memory system that provides coherent relaxed-consistency access to data across different smartphones and addresses the issues that device mobility and unreliable networking pose against consistency and coherence. We evaluated our prototype on 10 Android phones on both 3 G (HSPA) and 4 G (LTE) networks with a representative location-based photo-sharing service and a synthetic benchmark. We also simulated large scale scenarios up to 160 nodes on the ns- 2 network simulator. Compared to a client-server baseline, our system shows response time improvements of 10 x over 3 G and 2 x over 4 G. We also observe cellular bandwidth reductions of 96 %, comparable energy consumption, and a 95. 3 % request completion rate with coherent caching. With RoadRunner, we apply our vision to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). RoadRunner implements vehicular congestion control as an in-vehicle smartphone app that judiciously harnesses onboard sensing, local computation, and short-range communications, enabling large-scale traffic congestion control {{without the need for}} physical infrastructure, at higher penetration across road networks, and at finer granularity. RoadRunner enforces a quota on the number of cars on a road by requiring vehicles to possess a <b>token</b> for <b>entry.</b> <b>Tokens</b> are circulated and reused among multiple vehicles as they move between regions. We implemented RoadRunner as an Android application, deployed it on 10 vehicles using 4 G (LTE), 802. 11 p DSRC and 802. 11 n adhoc WiFi, and measured cellular access reductions up to 84 %, response time improvements up to 80 %, and effectiveness of the system in enforcing congestion control policies. We also simulated large-scale scenarios using actual traffic loop-detector counts from Singapore. by Jason Hao Gao. Thesis (S. M.)
