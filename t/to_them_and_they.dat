5|$|Dinuzulu {{rebelled against}} the British in 1888 but was {{defeated}} and {{fled to the}} Transvaal. He gave himself up in November 1888, {{and he and his}} uncles Ndabuko and Tshingana were found guilty of high treason in April 1889 and exiled to St Helena. Bishop Colenso's daughter, Harriette, intervened on their behalf in London. On her return to Zululand in August 1893, Clarke invited her to his residence in Etshowe. While there, she was visited by Zulu from across the land. The Zulu people had great affection for Bishop Colenso and his daughter. She persuaded them that Clarke's appointment was beneficial <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> gave Clarke the nickname 'uKwezi', meaning 'Keeper' or 'Protector'. A sign of this was the release of a number of Dinzulu's followers from prison.|$|E

25|$|In {{the decades}} {{preceding}} World War 2, the bicycle amounted {{to one of}} the Board's biggest competitors thanks largely to Christchurch's flat terrain, numbering as many as 50,000. They were popular for commuting and for many were the only form of transport a household had. The Board maintained a hostile attitude <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were not popular with the tramway men for the major fluctuations in patronage they could cause depending on the weather.|$|E
25|$|Golden eagles {{are fairly}} {{adaptable}} in habitat but often reside {{in areas with}} a few shared ecological characteristics. They are best suited to hunting in open or semi-open areas and search them out year-around. Native vegetation seems to be attractive <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> typically avoid developed areas of any type from urban to agricultural as well as heavily forested regions. In desolate areas (e.g., the southern Yukon), they can occur regularly at roadkills and garbage dumps. The largest numbers of golden eagles are found in mountainous regions today, with many eagles doing a majority of their hunting and nesting on rock formations. However, they are not solely tied to high elevations and can breed in lowlands if the local habitats are suitable. Below are more detailed description of habitats occupied by golden eagles in both continents where they occur.|$|E

25|$|The British did {{not make}} a secret of their preparations. The {{authorities}} in France and the Batavian Republic were therefore aware of them. The intended landing location was not known <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were therefore forced to spread their forces thinly to guard against all eventualities. The Batavian army at the time consisted of two divisions (each of about 10,000 men), one commanded by Lieutenant-General Daendels, the other by Lieutenant-General Jean-Baptiste Dumonceau. The latter had taken up positions in Friesland and Groningen to guard against a landing from the Wadden Sea or an incursion from the East. Daendels indeed was positioned {{in the northern part of}} North Holland, with headquarters at Schagen. The French troops (only 15,000 of the full complement of 25,000 troops that the Treaty of The Hague called for) were divided between Zeeland (another logical landing spot, where in 1809 the Walcheren Expedition took place), and the middle of the country, strung out between the coast and Nijmegen. The entire Franco-Batavian army was placed under the command of the French General Brune.|$|E

500|$|... "Night Fishing Is Good" [...] was {{inspired}} by the style of musical theatre and classical music. Originally the other band members were hesitant about the song when Yamaguchi first played it <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> suggested that they split the piece into two compositions. During the song's recording, Yamaguchi felt that the song would benefit from having a similar style to the English rock band Queen, which the band's pianist Emi Okazaki in particular responded well to. Iwadera added Queen-style guitar riffs to the song, and the group decided to add a vocal chorus, in the style of a Queen song. Only after [...] "Night Fishing Is Good" [...] had been finished did the band decide to title the album after this song.|$|E

500|$|Fields {{had come}} [...] "up from the cutting room floor" [...] {{and out of}} the customary, near-anonymity of film editors. Regarding this change in her career path, Fields told Peary in 1980 that [...] "All these young filmmakers are possessive. They feel I belong <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> feel a certain resentment - that I went to the other side. In calmer moments, of course, they know it isn't true, that I can do more for them now." [...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün. They're {{executives}} who actually made records. In the movie business, as an executive who's worked with film, you have only Verna. She saves Universal a fortune...every day." ...|$|E

What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just {{want to know if you}} like it enough to consider it". I sent it <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, [...] "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|The NSWCA pressed {{charges against}} {{two men who}} were charged with [...] "having participated in the disorder".

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the two men [...] "expressed regret for what had occurred, and pleaded guilty" [...] and [...] "the Bench fined them 40 shillings, and to pay 21 shillings professional costs of the court".Despite initial cynicism from journalists, the NSWCA announced a crackdown on betting on cricket matches, and it was reported that over the next 10 years, gambling at cricket matches in Sydney mainly died out.|$|E

5000|$|In Australia, {{the term}} [...] "flogger" [...] is {{sometimes}} used rather than [...] "pom-pom". Floggers are very large, heavy pom-poms in the team's colours.

500|$|Record {{producer}} Greg Fidelman {{said that}} [...] "the {{fact that the}} songs were still new and fresh <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> hadn't been playing them for six months in rehearsal, kept the vibe and excitement in the studio very high." [...] Vocalist Tom Araya said that there [...] "are two principal music writers in this band, so you're {{going to get a}} combination of speed and heaviness," [...] and later said that the [...] "writing is really aggressive and fast, while Jeff likes things to be fast, but with melodies and grooves. In making this album, we seemed to share the same vision from song ideas to titles; when we get together as Slayer, it just happens, nothing is contrived, it's not thought out, we just do it, and we did that with this new album." [...] Lombardo said that Hanneman's writing and performance had [...] "gone back to this great punk energy, especially with 'Psychopathy Red'." ...|$|E
500|$|General Gage was {{understated}} in his {{casualty report}} to London: [...] "Two men {{were killed and}} a few wounded." [...] Others, however, apparently exaggerated, reporting large casualties. The Pennsylvania Journal reported on June 21, 1775, that General Gage himself recorded at least one hundred killed while other sources said more than three hundred. [...] From another source: [...] "The regulars {{were said to have}} suffered very much, not to have had less than two hundred killed and wounded. The loss was probably greatly exaggerated; that, however, had a good effect on the provincials. The affair was a matter of no small triumph <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> felt upon the occasion more courageous than ever." [...] Gage ordered cannon mounted on Copp's Hill in Boston, and Vice-Admiral Graves moved the Somerset, which had been stationed in the shallow waters between Boston and Charlestown, into deeper waters to the east of Boston, where it would have improved maneuverability if fired upon from land. [...] He also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure Noddle's Island; the Colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on the island.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} not {{originally}} intended to be included on Fearless, due to Swift believing solemness was already represented accurately on the album; therefore, Swift was planning on including the track on her third studio album, what would become Speak Now in 2010. However, when Swift's Los Angeles managing agency set up an appointment with the executive producers of her favorite television series, Grey's Anatomy, Betsy Beers and Shonda Rhimes, they discussed including Swift's music on the series. Swift chose to play them [...] "White Horse" [...] live with an acoustic guitar. Beers and Rhimes were very impressed and told Swift they would respond her via telephone {{as soon as they}} could. Swift decided to not include the track on Fearless, until the producers responded, which they did not for some time. When Grey's Anatomys representatives called, Swift and Nathan Chapman recorded the song immediately, sent a CD <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> decided to use it on the television series. [...] "White Horse" [...] debuted on the fifth season premiere of Grey's Anatomy, [...] "Dream a Little Dream of Me", on September 25, 2008.|$|E

500|$|To {{direct the}} play, the duo engaged Harold Clurman, noted {{for his work}} in drama and {{one of the founders of}} the Group Theatre. Jo Mielziner, veteran of several Rodgers and Hammerstein productions, was the stage designer. In {{contrast}} to the complex staging of Me and Juliet, Mielziner's sets were uncomplicated, a system of house-frame outlines in front of backdrops representing Monterey. Boris Runanin was the choreographer, Robert Russell Bennett provided orchestrations, and Salvatore Dell'Isola conducted. The two producers had hoped to hire the prestigious Majestic Theatre, where South Pacific had run, but the writing process took too long, and the Majestic was lost to Fanny. Instead, they booked the Shubert Theatre, in the top rank of Broadway theatres, but not as prestigious as the Majestic. Uniquely for their joint work, they solicited no backers, but underwrote the entire cost themselves. Feuer later said of the bargain he and Martin had made with Rodgers and Hammerstein, [...] "And the deal was pretty good: 50percent of the producers' end. And we thought, We're rich! And we turned it over <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> destroyed it." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season two, Michael and Sawyer are stranded {{in the middle of}} the ocean, with Jin missing. They wash ashore and discover Jin, then are knocked unconscious by one of the survivors from the tail section of the plane. After convincing the tail section survivors that they were on the same plane, they all return to the beach camp of the fuselage survivors. Later, Michael offers to take a shift in the [...] that the survivors have found. Here, he begins receiving computer messages from someone who he thinks is Walt, who gives him directions to where he is being held. Michael ventures off in search of him, but moments after leaving the camp, two of the Others kidnap him and hold him hostage. Michael is told to retrieve their leader, who is held captive in the hatch, then bring Sawyer, Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Jack (Matthew Fox) and Hurley (Jorge Garcia) <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> will return Walt and let them leave the Island. In order to free their leader, Ben (Michael Emerson), Michael convinces Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), who is guarding Ben, that he will kill Ben on her behalf, but instead kills her when she hands over the gun and the combination to the armory. When Libby (Cynthia Watros) walks in on them, a startled Michael shoots her twice. He succeeds in bringing the four requested survivors to the Others, so Ben reunites him with Walt. Michael and Walt are given a boat and coordinates to freedom, and they sail away from the Island.|$|E
500|$|Repatriation {{was one of}} the {{two most}} talked-about {{subjects}} at camp (the other being food). On 6 May 1942, the Japanese authorities informed the internees repatriation for the Americans would take place on 15 June. Japanese treatment of the American internees improved during this period before the actual repatriation took place; more and better food was given <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were allowed contacts with Chinese friends outside of camp. American journalists were interviewed by a Japanese news agency and asked questions about the war and the camp. The internees came to find out later the interview became war propaganda for the Japanese, {{in the form of an}} article claiming that American journalists had complimented the Japanese military and the camp itself, stating the camp was [...] "probably the most comfortable in the world." [...] It was not until 29 June that repatriation for the Americans finally took place, after Japanese and Thai citizens held in the US and South America boarded ships in late June in preparation for exchange of internees. Those being repatriated were given smallpox vaccination, cholera inoculation, and thorough medical examinations. No books, bibles, diaries, or addresses were allowed to leave with the Americans, but the remaining internees were each allowed to write a 150-word letter for the Americans to take with them. The American internees boarded the ship, the Asama Maru, along with other Americans who had been allowed to stay in Hong Kong outside of the camp. [...] After picking up Americans for repatriation from other locations in Asia, the Asama Maru arrived at Maputo, Mozambique (then called Lourenço Marques) on 22 July, where the Americans and Japanese exchanged internees. The Americans were to finally reach New York City on 25 August. Reportedly a total of 377 Americans were repatriated from Hong Kong.|$|E
