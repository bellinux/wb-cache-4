5|$|In November 1987, Kai and Martin {{became known}} as The Glamour Girls, and she {{underwent}} an image change that involved bleaching her dark hair platinum blonde {{at the suggestion of}} their manager Jimmy Hart. The duo appeared at the first Survivor Series in 1987 as part of then champion Sherri Martel's team to face <b>the</b> <b>Fabulous</b> Moolah's team. Martel's team—Martel, the Glamour Girls, Dawn Marie, and Donna Christanello—lost to <b>The</b> <b>Fabulous</b> Moolah's team—Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki).

5|$|The Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame is a {{professional}} wrestling hall of fame that recognizes people who make significant contributions to the sport. It was founded in 1996 by Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Like other wrestling halls of fame, such as the WWE, TNA, and WCW hall of fames, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame is not contained in a building, {{and there are no}} ceremonies for inductions other than a highly detailed biographical documentation of their career in the newsletter. Inductees include wrestlers, managers, promoters, trainers, and commentators. On seven occasions, tag teams have been inducted rather than the individual members of the team. This first occurred in 1996, when The Dusek family, <b>The</b> <b>Fabulous</b> Kangaroos, and The Road Warriors entered the hall. <b>The</b> <b>Fabulous</b> Freebirds, The Midnight Express, The Rock 'n' Roll Express and The Assassins have also been inducted as a group.|$|E

Shortly after the match began, Moolah grabbed Richter as she was outside on the floor, but Lauper saved her from an attack. Kai then performed a flying crossbody from the top rope, but Richter used Kai's momentum to roll-up Kai in a pinning position. With this pin, Richter became the new Women's Champion.|$|E
