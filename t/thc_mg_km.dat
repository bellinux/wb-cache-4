This {{study was}} carried out to determine the impact of traffic on soil compaction, crop and energy consumption during the sugarcane harvest in the Cauca river valley (Colombia). Four experiments with four replicates were harvested with different systems. Plots were mechanically harvested with self tipping, HD 8000, HD 12000 and HD 20000 trailers and evaluated by traffic intensity (IT), direct stool traffic, penetration resistance and fuel consumption. Heavy trailers caused a greater effect due to a greater IT and direct stool traffic. IT varied between 241 and 317 <b>Mg</b> <b>km</b> ha- 1. Stool traffic {{at the end of}} field varied from 8 to 18 m per furrow, meanwhile stool traffic along the furrow varied from 5 to 24 %.

40|$|Rationale An {{increase}} in the potency of the cannabis cigarettes has been observed {{over the past three}} decades. Objectives In this study, we aimed to establish the impact of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the rating of subjective effects (intensity and duration of the effects), up to 23 % <b>THC</b> potency (69 <b>mg</b> <b>THC)</b> among recreational users. Methods Recreational users (N = 24) smoked cannabis cigarettes with four doses of THC (placebo 29, 49 and 69 <b>mg</b> of <b>THC)</b> on four separate test days in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The participants filled in three different questionnaires measuring subjective effects during the exposure up to 8 h post-smoking. The 'high' feeling, heart rate, blood pressure and THC serum concentrations were also regularly recorded during these 8 h. Results THC significantly increased the high feeling, dizziness, dry-mouthed feeling, palpitations, impaired memory and concentration, and 'down', 'sedated' and 'anxious' feelings. In addition, THC significantly decreased alertness, contentment and calmness. A cubic relationship was observed between 'feeling the drug' and 'wanting more'. The THC-induced decrease in 'feeling stimulated' and {{increase in}} anxiety lasted up to 8 h post-smoking. Sedation at 8 h post-smoking was increased by a factor of 5. 7 with the highest THC dose, compared to the placebo. Conclusions This study shows a strong effect of cannabis containing high percentages of THC on the rating of subjective effects. Regular users and forensic toxicologists should be aware that the THC-induced increase in 'feeling sedated' continues longer with a 69 <b>mg</b> <b>THC</b> dose than with a 29 <b>mg</b> <b>THC</b> dose. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|The {{non-agricultural}} ammonia (NH 3) {{emissions in}} cities have received little attention but could rival agricultural sources {{in term of}} the efficiency in PM formation. The starting point for finding credible solutions is to comprehensively establish a city-specific Non-agricultural Ammonia Emission Inventory (NAEI) and identify the largest sources where efforts can be directed to deliver the largest impact. In this paper, I present a NAEI of 113 national key cities targeted on environmental protection in China in 2010, which {{for the first time}} covers NH 3 emissions from pets, infants, smokers, green land, and household products. Results show that totally 210 478 Mg, the NH 3 emissions from traffic, fuel combustion, waste disposal, pets, green land, human, and household products are 67 671 Mg, 56 275 Mg, 44 289 Mg, 23 355 Mg, 7509 Mg, 7312 Mg, and 4069 Mg, respectively. The NH 3 emission intensity from the municipal districts ranges from 0. 08 to 3. 13 <b>Mg</b> <b>km</b> − 2 yr − 1, with a average of 0. 84 <b>Mg</b> <b>km</b> − 2 yr − 1. The high NH 3 emission intensities in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta region and Pearl River Delta region support the view that non-agricultural NH 3 sources {{play a key role in}} city-scale NH 3 emissions and thus have potentially important implications for secondary PM formation (ammonium-sulfate-nitrate system) in urban agglomeration of China. Therefore, in addition to current SO 2 and NO x controls, China also needs to allocate more scientific, technical, and legal resources on controlling non-agricultural NH 3 emissions in the future...|$|R

40|$|Soil loss {{tolerance}} (T value) {{serves as}} an ultimate criterion for determining if erosion control measures are necessary to preserve long-term soil productivity; therefore, it must be determined scientifically and rationally. In this study, soil formation rates (SR) of the purple soils (Entisols in the U. S. Soil Taxonomy and Regosols in the FAO soil classification) in the hilly area of Sichuan, China, were determined in field plots (measured SR) for three treatments: (i) soil type (J 2 s, J 3 s, and J 3 p soils) and parent materials or bedrock, (ii) vegetation (wheat [Triticum aestivum L. ]-maize [Zea mays L. ], loquat tree [Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. ], and perennial ryegrass [Lolium perenne L. ]), and (iii) soil depth (10, 20, 40, and 60 cm). The measured values were further {{used to test the}} applicability of the Barth equation (estimated SR) for the test soils. The measured SR varied among the treatments as a result of different characteristics of soil parent materials (PM) and different temperature and soil moisture at the interface between the soil and the parent materials. The trends (the order of increase or decrease) of measured and estimated soil formation rates were the same, however, for the soil type and vegetation treatments, but not for the soil depth treatments. The measured SR values were 800 <b>Mg</b> <b>km</b> - 2 yr - 1 for J 3 s purple soils and 1200 <b>Mg</b> <b>km</b> - 2 yr - 1 for J 2 s and J 3 p purple soils in the study region. The estimated SR values were closely related to runoff volumes but were substantially lower than the measured values. It was concluded that the Barth equation is not a reliable prediction model for estimating the soil formation rate for short-term and plot-scale observations. Therefore, T values should be determined by the measured SR values in the experimental region. © Soil Science Society of America...|$|R

40|$|Introduction No model {{exists to}} {{describe}} the disposition and kinetics of inhaled cannabis containing a high THC dose. We aimed to develop a kinetic model providing estimates of the THC serum concentrations after smoking cannabis cigarettes containing high THC doses (up to 69 <b>mg</b> <b>THC).</b> Methods Twenty-four male non-daily cannabis users smoked cannabis cigarettes containing 29. 3 mg, 49. 1 mg, and 69. 4 <b>mg</b> <b>THC.</b> Blood samples were collected {{over a period of}} 0 - 8 h and serum THC concentrations were measured. A two-compartment open model was fitted on the individual observed data. Results Large inter-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters. The median pharmacokinetic parameters generated by the model were Cmax = 175 ng/mL, Tmax = 14 min, and AUC 0 - 8 h = 8150 ng × min/mL for the 69. 4 <b>mg</b> <b>THC</b> dose. Median model results show an almost linear dose response relation for Cmax/Dose = 2. 8 × 10 - 6 /mL and AUC 0 - 8 h/Dose = 136 × 10 - 6 min/mL. However, for increasing dose level, there was a clear decreasing trend: Cmax/Dose = 3. 4, 2. 6 and 2. 5 × 10 - 6 /mL and AUC 0 - 8 h/Dose = 157, 133 and 117 × 10 - 6 min/mL for the 29. 3, 49. 1 and 69. 4 mg dose, respectively. Within the restriction of 8 h of observation, the apparent terminal half life of THC was 150 min.

40|$|Rationale: Anecdotally, both {{acute and}} chronic {{cannabis}} use {{have been associated}} with apathy, amotivation, and other reward processing deficits. To date, empirical support for these effects is limited, and no previous studies have assessed both acute effects of Δ- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), as well as associations with cannabis dependence. Objectives: The objectives of this study were (1) to examine acute effects of cannabis with CBD (Cann + CBD) and without CBD (Cann-CBD) on effort-related decision-making and (2) to examine associations between cannabis dependence, effort-related decision-making and reward learning. Methods: In study 1, 17 participants each received three acute vaporized treatments, namely Cann-CBD (8 <b>mg</b> <b>THC),</b> Cann + CBD (8 <b>mg</b> <b>THC</b> + 10 <b>mg</b> CBD) and matched placebo, followed by a 50 % dose top-up 1. 5 h later, and completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT). In study 2, 20 cannabis-dependent participants were compared with 20 non-dependent, drug-using control participants on the EEfRT and the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT) in a non-intoxicated state. Results: Cann-CBD reduced the likelihood of high-effort choices relative to placebo (p = 0. 042) and increased sensitivity to expected value compared to both placebo (p = 0. 014) and Cann + CBD (p = 0. 006). The cannabis-dependent and control groups did not differ on the EEfRT. However, the cannabis-dependent group exhibited a weaker response bias than the control group on the PRT (p = 0. 007). Conclusions: Cannabis acutely induced a transient amotivational state and CBD influenced the effects of THC on expected value. In contrast, cannabis dependence was associated with preserved motivation alongside impaired reward learning, although confounding factors, including depression, cannot be disregarded. This is the first well powered, fully controlled study to objectively demonstrate the acute amotivational effects of THC...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMeasurements of aerosol {{particle}} number size distributions (18 ? 700 nm), mass concentrations (PM 2. 5 and PM 10) and NO x were {{performed in the}} Plabutsch tunnel, Austria, and in the Kingsway tunnel, United Kingdom. These two tunnels show different characteristics regarding the roadway gradient, {{the composition of the}} vehicle fleet and the traffic frequency. The submicron particle size distributions contained a soot mode in the diameter range D = 80 ? 100 nm and a nucleation mode in the range of D = 20 ? 40 nm. In the Kingsway tunnel with a significantly lower particle number and volume concentration level than in the Plabutsch tunnel, a clear diurnal variation of nucleation and soot mode particles correlated to the traffic density was observed. In the Plabutsch tunnel, soot mode particles also revealed a diurnal variation, whereas no substantial variation was found for the nucleation mode particles. During the night a higher number concentration of nucleation mode particles were measured than soot mode particles and vice versa during the day. In this tunnel with very high soot emissions during daytime due to the heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) share of 18 % and another 40 % of diesel driven light-duty vehicles (LDV) semivolatile species condense on the pre-existing soot surface area rather than forming new particles by homogeneous nucleation. With the low concentration of soot mode particles in the Kingsway tunnel, also the nucleation mode particles exhibit a diurnal variation. From the measured parameters real-world traffic emission factors were estimated for the whole vehicle fleet as well as differentiated into the two categories LDV and HDV. In the particle size range D = 18 ? 700 nm, each vehicle of the mixed fleet emits (1. 50 ± 0. 08) × 10 14 particles km - 1 (Plabutsch) and (1. 26 ± 0. 10) × 10 14 particles km - 1 (Kingsway), while particle volume emission factors of 0. 209 ± 0. 008 cm 3 km - 1 and 0. 036 ± 0. 004 cm 3 km - 1, respectively, were obtained.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measurements of}} traffic-generated gas and particle pollution at two sites, one near a major highway and one near a busy urban street in Copenhagen, Denmark. Both sites were equipped for a 4 -week period {{with a set}} of two measurement stations, one close to the kerbside and one background station. Measurements were carried out from March to April 2008, investigating NO x concentrations, submicrometer particle number size distribution (size range 10 – 700 nm), particle mass (PM 2. 5, PM 10), and meteorological parameters. In this study we further estimate the emission factors for NO x, particle number and particle mass using measured traffic volume and dilution rate calculated by the Operational Street Pollution Model (WinOSPM). The mean concentrations of most of the measured pollutants are similar for the highway and the urban kerbside stations due to similar traffic density. The average concentrations of NO x are 142 μg m and 136 μg m for the highway and the urban kerbside stations, respectively. These values are about 5 times higher compared to the corresponding background values. The average particle number concentration is 24 860 particles cm − 3 and 27 100 particles cm − 3 for the highway and the urban kerbside stations, respectively, and these values exceed those measured at the background stations by a factor of 3 to 5. The temporal variation of the traffic contribution (difference of kerbside and background concentrations) is analysed for NO x, particle number and mass, and it follows the traffic pattern at the urban and the highway sites. Emission factors for particle number are found to be quite similar at both sites, (215. 4 ± 5. 3) 10 12 particles veh − 1 km − 1 for the highway and (187. 1 ± 3. 1) 10 12 particles veh − 1 km for the urban site. Heavy duty vehicles (HDVs) are found to emit about 20 times more particles than light duty vehicles (LDVs), which is in good agreement with other published studies. Emission factors are also determined for individual particle modes identified in the size spectra. Average fleet emission factors for PM 2. 5 at the highway and the urban site are 29 <b>mg</b> <b>km</b> − 1 and 46 <b>mg</b> <b>km</b> − 1, respectively. The estimated particle number and size spectra emission factors will provide valuable input for air quality and particle dispersion modelling near highways and in urban areas...|$|R

At a laboratory scale, biodegradation experiments {{carried out in}} an aerobic batch reactor showed that toxic oily sludge was biodegradable after dilution. Compared with freshwater, the use of municipal wastewater for dilution clearly enhanced the biodegradation of this toxic pollutant. Using municipal wastewater, experiments showed that, starting from an initial total hydrocarbon concentration (<b>THC)</b> of 750 <b>mg</b> L- 1, we could reach a final <b>THC</b> of 5 <b>mg</b> L- 1 and a COD removal of 97 % in only 19 days.

The development of tolerance to effects of around-the-clock oral synthetic D 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (<b>THC)</b> (20 <b>mg</b> every 3. 5 – 6 h) was evaluated in 13 healthy male daily can-nabis smokers residing on a secure research unit: 40 mg on Day 1; 100 mg on Days 2 – 4; 120 mg on Days 5 – 6. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and symptoms of subjective intoxi-cation (100 mm visual-analogue scales, VAS) were assessed the morning of Day 1 (before any oral THC), and on Days 2, 4 and 6, every 30 min for 3 h after the first morning THC dose. Morning sub-jective intoxication ratings increased from Days 1 to 2, and then declined on Days 4 and 6. The morning THC dose increased intoxi-cation ratings on Day 2, but had less effect on Days 4 and 6, a pattern consistent with tolerance. THC lowered BP and increased heart rate over the six days. Plasma THC and 11 -OH-THC concentra-tions increased significantly over the first five days of dosing.

40|$|High-resolution {{mapping of}} fuel {{combustion}} and CO 2 emission provides valuable information for inferring terrestrial carbon balance, modeling pollutant transport, and developing mitigation strategies. Previous inventories included {{only a limited}} number of fuel types and anthropogenic emissions were mapped using national population proxies which may distort the geographical distribution within countries. In this study, a sub-national disaggregation method (SDM) was applied to establish a global 0. 1 °× 0. 1 ° geo-referenced inventory of fuel combustion (PKU-FUEL) and a corresponding CO 2 emission inventory (PKU-CO 2) based upon 64 fuel sub-types for the year 2007. Uncertainties of the new inventories were evaluated using a Monte Carlo method. The total combustion CO 2 emission in 2007 was 11. 2 (9. 11 and 13. 3 as 5 th and 95 th percentiles) Pg C yr − 1. By replacing national disaggregation with sub-national disaggregation in this study, the average 95 th minus 5 th percentile ranges of CO 2 emission for all grids can be reduced from 417 to 68. 2 <b>Mg</b> <b>km</b> − 2 yr − 1, indicating a significant reduction in uncertainty, because the uneven distribution of per-capita fuel consumptions within countries has been taken into account by using the sub-national fuel consumption data directly. Significant difference in per-capita CO 2 emissions between urban and rural areas was found in developing nations (2. 09 vs. 0. 600 Mg C cap − 1 yr − 1), but not in developed ones (3. 57 vs. 3. 42 Mg C cap − 1 yr − 1), suggesting strong influence of the rapid urbanization of these countries on the carbon emission. By using the CO 2 emission product, a new spatial pattern of terrestrial carbon sink was derived and the impact of sub-national disaggregation is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Runoff is the {{key factor}} to {{understand}} the land degradation causing high risk of soil erosion and can reduce the water available for human societies and ecosystems. The dynamics of runoff and suspended sediment transport are not completely understood. In this study, we examined the trends, breaking point and regime changes for the runoff and sediment load at different temporal scales using 50 years of continuous observational data from a highly erodible sub-catchment with an area of 7, 325 km 2 in the Beiluo River basin on the Loess Plateau, China. At the annual scale, the runoff and sediment load declined signi fi cantly (p < 0 · 05) with decreasing rates of 0 · 23 mm y 1 and 164 · 9 <b>Mg</b> <b>km</b> 2 y 1, respectively. Abrupt changes in the runoff and sediment load series were detected between 1979 and 1999; thus, the data were divided into intervals of 1960 – 1979, 1980 – 1999 and 2000 – 2009. The fl ow duration curve analysis indicated increasing low fl ow values and decreasing daily runoff and sediment discharge peaks, which suggested that {{soil and water conservation}} measures reduced the volume of runoff and the sediment load. This led to a more uniform runoff regime. At the fl ood event scale, we investigated the relationship between runoff and the suspended sediment load based on 123 fl ood events, which showed clearly that the magnitude and frequency of hyper-concentrated sediment fl ows decreased in 2000 – 2009 compared with 1960 – 1999. The annual erosive rainfall exhibited non-signi fi cant changes throughout the entire study period. We conclude that soil and water conservation measures (e. g. afforestation, grassing, terraces and check dams) have played major roles in the changes in runoff and the sediment load in the Beiluo River catchment.   <br style="orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;" /...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{comparison of}} green leaf phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases from the C 4 -species Atriplex spongiosa and the C 3 -species Atriplex hastata revealed significant physical and kinetic differences. The two alloenzymes can be separated by anion exchange chromatography but have comparable molecular weights (350, 000). Maximal velocity estimates were 38. 0 and 1. 48 micromoles per minute per milligram of chlorophyll for the carboxylases of A. spongiosa and A. hastata, respectively. Km phosphoenolpyruvate estimates were 0. 49 and 0. 08 mm for the C 4 A. spongiosa and C 3 A. hastata and the <b>Km</b> <b>Mg</b> estimates were 0. 33 mm for the C 4 species and 0. 017 mm for the C 3 species. The {{activity of the}} phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase of A. spongiosa is more sensitive to chloride and phosphate than the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase of A. hastata, but both are equally sensitive to Mg chelating substances such as ATP, ADP, and citrate if assayed at their respective <b>Km</b> <b>Mg</b> values. A survey of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases from 18 C 4 and C 3 species resulted in mean maximal velocity estimates of 29. 0 ± 13. 2 and 1. 50 ± 0. 57 micromoles per minute per milligram of chlorophyll for the C 4 species and C 3 species, respectively. Km phosphoenolpyruvate estimates were 0. 59 ± 0. 35 mm and 0. 14 ± 0. 07 mm for the C 4 and C 3, and <b>Km</b> <b>Mg</b> estimates were 0. 50 ± 0. 30 and 0. 097 ± 0. 057 mm for C 4 and C 3. All differences between means were significant at the 0. 01 confidence level, supporting our hypothesis that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase alloenzymes of C 4 and C 3 plants are functionally different and are associated with different photosynthetic roles. Both function in the photosynthetic production of C 4 acids, the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase of C 4 species largely producing malate or aspartate (or both) as a photosynthetic intermediate and the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase of C 3 species producing malate or aspartate (or both) as a photosynthetic product...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{mapping of}} fuel {{combustion}} and CO 2 emission provides valuable information for modeling pollutant transport, developing mitigation policy, and for inverse modeling of CO 2 fluxes. Previous global emission maps included only few fuel types, and emissions were estimated on a grid by distributing national fuel data {{on an equal}} per capita basis, using population density maps. This process distorts the geographical distribution of emissions within countries. In this study, a sub-national disaggregation method (SDM) of fuel data is applied to establish a global 0. 1 ° × 0. 1 ° geo-referenced inventory of fuel combustion (PKU-FUEL) and corresponding CO 2 emissions (PKU-CO 2) based upon 64 fuel sub-types for the year 2007. Uncertainties of the emission maps are evaluated using a Monte Carlo method. It is estimated that CO 2 emission from combustion sources including fossil fuel, biomass, and solid wastes in 2007 was 11. 2 Pg C yr − 1 (9. 1 Pg C yr − 1 and 13. 3 Pg C yr − 1 as 5 th and 95 th percentiles). Of this, emission from fossil fuel combustion is 7. 83 Pg C yr − 1, which {{is very close to}} the estimate of the International Energy Agency (7. 87 Pg C yr − 1). By replacing national data disaggregation with sub-national data in this study, the average 95 th minus 5 th percentile ranges of CO 2 emission for all grid points can be reduced from 417 to 68. 2 <b>Mg</b> <b>km</b> − 2 yr − 1. The spread is reduced because the uneven distribution of per capita fuel consumptions within countries is better taken into account by using sub-national fuel consumption data directly. Significant difference in per capita CO 2 emissions between urban and rural areas was found in developing countries (2. 08 vs. 0. 598 Mg C/(cap. × yr)), but not in developed countries (3. 55 vs. 3. 41 Mg C/(cap. × yr)). This implies that rapid urbanization of developing countries is very likely to drive up their emissions in the future...|$|R
40|$|Different {{approaches}} {{were used}} to model soil losses in the Sele River basin (southern Italy) characterized by data scarcity. The suitability of models interpolating different sources of data was evaluated with the aim to suggest similar methodologies in other regions where data availability is not sufﬁcient to use the more complex and detailed models. The ﬁrst approach {{is based on the}} concept of the balance between driving and resisting forces. Rain- fall is considered as both a driving and resisting factor: the rain erosivity not only increases with its amount and intensity but also enhances the protective effect of vege- tation. The long-term erosion rate of the basin resulted mainly affected by local land-cover conditions that showed a more dramatic effect than the variability of rain erosivity. In the period during which soils were protected by natural woodlands, net erosion rates were extremely low, while the elimination of forest (AD 1780 – 1810) increased erosion that reached annual rates from 20 to 300 <b>Mg</b> <b>km</b> - 2. The second approach is a revised and scale-adapted Foster– Meyer–Onstad model suitable for scarce input data (CliFEM = Climate Forcing and Erosion Modelling). This new idea was addressed to develop a monthly Net Erosion model (NER) and gross erosion was estimated from the sediment delivery ratio (SDR). From this approach {{it is clear that the}} erosion regime was clearly autumnal with a mean rate of 8 Mg ha - 1 per month. The long-term average soil erosion highlighted, since 1990, a more irregular temporal pattern, with the highest annual erosion (200 Mg ha - 1) in 2002. The third approach combines the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) with GIS– geospatial technology. Regression Ordinary Kriging (ROK) -based maps of erosive rainfall were made on annual and monthly basis. The months following soil tillage (from August to November) have become even more hazardous for soil erosion, with values higher than 80...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAcute {{administration}} of the primary psychoactive constituent of cannabis, Δ- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), impairs human facial affect recognition, implicating the endocannabinoid system in emotional processing. Another main constituent of cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), has seemingly opposite functional effects on the brain. This study aimed {{to determine the effects}} of THC and CBD, both alone and in combination on emotional facial affect recognition. 48 volunteers, selected for high and low frequency of cannabis use and schizotypy, were administered, <b>THC</b> (8 <b>mg),</b> CBD (16 mg), THC+CBD (8 mg+ 16 mg) and placebo, by inhalation, in a 4 -way, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. They completed an emotional facial affect recognition task including fearful, angry, happy, sad, surprise and disgust faces varying in intensity from 20 % to 100 %. A visual analogue scale (VAS) of feeling ‘stoned’ was also completed. In comparison to placebo, CBD improved emotional facial affect recognition at 60 % emotional intensity; THC was detrimental to the recognition of ambiguous faces of 40 % intensity. The combination of THC+CBD produced no impairment. Relative to placebo, both THC alone and combined THC+CBD equally increased feelings of being ‘stoned’. CBD did not influence feelings of ‘stoned’. No effects of frequency of use or schizotypy were found. In conclusion, CBD improves recognition of emotional facial affect and attenuates the impairment induced by THC. This is the first human study examining the effects of different cannabinoids on emotional processing. It provides preliminary evidence that different pharmacological agents acting upon the endocannabinoid system can both improve and impair recognition of emotional faces...|$|R
40|$|A 33 -kD glycoprotein, {{known as}} the "prostate-specific antigen," was {{purified}} to homogeneity from human seminal plasma. The prostatic protein {{was identified as a}} serine protease, and its NH 2 -terminal sequence strongly suggests that it belongs to the family of glandular kallikreins. The structural protein of human seminal coagulum, the predominant protein in seminal vesicle secretion, was rapidly cleaved by the prostatic enzyme, which suggests that this seminal vesicle protein may serve as the physiological substrate for the protease. The prostatic enzyme hydrolyzed arginine- and lysine-containing substrates with a distinct preference for the former. All synthetic substrates tested were poor substrates for the enzyme. Synthetic Factor XIa substrate (pyro-glutamyl-prolyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide), and the synthetic kallikrein substrate (H-D-prolyl-phenylalanyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide) were hydrolyzed with maximum specific activities at 23 degrees C of 79 and 34 nmol/min per <b>mg</b> and <b>Km</b> values of 1. 0 and 0. 45 mM, respectively.

40|$|A kinetic {{analysis}} of L-cystine uptake in wild-type Salmonella typhimurium indicates {{the presence of}} at least two, and possibly three, separate transport systems. CTS- 1 accounts {{for the majority of}} uptake at 20 muM L-cystine, with a Vmax of 9. 5 nmol/min per <b>mg</b> and a <b>Km</b> of 2. 0 muM; CTS- 2 is a low-capacity, higher-affinity system with a Vmax of 0. 22 nmol/min per <b>mg</b> and a <b>Km</b> of 0. 05 muM; a third, nonsaturable process has been designated CTS- 3. We find that wild-type CTS- 1 levels are at least 11 times higher in sulfur-limited cells than in L-cystine-grown cells. Pleiotropic cysteine auxotrophs of the types cysE (lacking serine transacetylase) and cysB- (lacking a regulatory element of positive control) have very low levels of CTS- 1 even when grown under conditions of sulfur limitation, which response is analogous to that previously observed for cysteine biosynthetic enzymes (N. M. Kredich, J. Biol. Chem. 246 : 3474 - 3484, 1971). CTS- 1 is induced in cysE mutants by growth in the presence of O-acetyl-L-serine (the product of serine transacetylase), again paralleling the behavior of the cysteine biosynthetic pathway. Strain DW 25, a prototrophic cysBc mutant, which is constitutive for cysteine biosynthesis, is also derepressed for CTS- 1 when grown on L-cystine. Since CTS- 1 is regulated by sulfur limitation, O-acetyl-L-serine, and the cysB gene product, the same three conditions controlling cysteine biosynthesis, we propose that this transport system {{is a part of the}} cysteine regulon...|$|R

The RNAi induced parasites have a greatly reduced capability to form GDP-Man, leading ultimately to a reduction in their ability to synthesize their essential glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors.
