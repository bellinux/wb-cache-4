Jack has to attend the meeting alone, but his idea for a fireworks special impresses the network and he successfully defends his job against Devon Banks. When <b>the</b> <b>fireworks</b> special actually airs, however, <b>the</b> <b>fireworks</b> are shot off in midtown New York outside Rockefeller Center and it ends up looking like a terrorist attack. Panic results and the mayor calls, causing the event to be unceremoniously ended.|$|E

5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} {{accident}} {{seemed to be that}} <b>the</b> <b>fireworks</b> attached to her balloon had been knocked out of position by a tree as she ascended; possibly the balloon was heavily loaded and failed to rise quickly enough. When she had lit the fuses <b>the</b> <b>fireworks</b> headed towards the balloon instead of away from it; one of them burned a hole in the fabric, igniting the gas. One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E

30|$|The optimal {{solution}} search using the FWA algorithm is a sequential {{process in which}} the explosion of <b>the</b> <b>firework</b> is followed by selection of sparks for the next explosion based on the number and distance between sparks associated with <b>the</b> <b>firework</b> explosion. <b>The</b> good <b>firework</b> selected for next round of explosion denotes the feasible optimal location of the optimization problem in the search space defined. The characteristics of the FWA which aid in selection of sparks for the next generation are given below.|$|R

5|$|After the show, WWE {{was criticized}} for a {{malfunction}} in the pyrotechnics during The Undertaker's victory celebration. During the celebration, a hot cable for pyrotechnics was sent flying into audience members in the upper seating bowl of the stadium, leaving 45 injured, with some hospitalized. The accident was apparently due to a cable which fireworks were traveling across snapping, thus resulting in <b>the</b> <b>fireworks</b> exploding into the top rows of the upper bowl of the stadium. WWE's corporate website released a statement afterward stating that they would investigate the incident, but {{the results of the}} investigation were never released.|$|E

From 2015 <b>the</b> <b>Firework</b> Display is being organised by Woking District Rotary Club.|$|R
50|$|Organised by {{the local}} Rotary Club and usually held on 5 November. Traditionally <b>the</b> <b>firework</b> display is preceded by a torchlit {{procession}} starting in Broad Street making its way along West Street and up Pound Hill into Arlebury Park, the venue for <b>the</b> <b>firework</b> display. <b>The</b> display is always well attended with proceeds donated to local, national and international causes. Each year a 'Guy' is burned following tradition, with the Guys made by local schoolchildren.|$|R
50|$|Another {{challenge}} the photographer faces with exposure timing {{is having to}} estimate how long to expose the image in relation to when <b>the</b> <b>firework</b> bursts. Opening <b>the</b> shutter just before <b>the</b> <b>firework</b> bursts and then closing it after its finished would provide the ideal timing for capturing that 'perfect moment'. This {{can be achieved by}} setting the camera to 'b' or 'bulb' whereby exposure times are under the direct control of the photographer through the shutter release button.|$|R
5|$|The Sivakasi {{municipality}} {{was established}} in 1920. After India's independence from the British in 1947, Sivakasi {{continued to be a}} municipality under the Madras state and later a part of Tamil Nadu, when the state was split on linguistic lines during 1953, 1956 and 1960 and renamed in 1968. It was promoted to a second-grade municipality in 1978, first-grade in 1978, selection-grade in 1998 and special-grade in 2013. Over the decades after independence, Sivakasi grew as an industrial town specialising in firecracker, match and printing industries. Several incidents of fire and explosions have occurred in <b>the</b> <b>fireworks</b> factories.|$|E
5|$|Many musicians, {{bands and}} orchestras from diverse genres have been {{influenced}} by Zappa's music.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as the Beatles' Freak Out!, Jimi Hendrix, and heavy rock and metal acts like Black Sabbath, Simon Phillips, Mike Portnoy, Warren DeMartini, Steve Vai, Strapping Young Lad, System of a Down, and Clawfinger acknowledge Zappa's inspiration. On the classical music scene, Tomas Ulrich, Meridian Arts Ensemble, Ensemble Ambrosius and <b>the</b> <b>Fireworks</b> Ensemble regularly perform Zappa's compositions and quote his influence. Contemporary jazz musicians and composers Bill Frisell and John Zorn are inspired by Zappa, as is funk legend George Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Production for {{the special}} began in Berlin on October 2, 2017, moved to Brussels on October 12, and then to Paris later within the day, where it {{remained}} up to October 24. Around midnight of October 22, production filmed a four-minute fireworks show near the Eiffel Tower. Due to insufficient notices posted by the Paris City Hall, reportedly some Parisians were taken by surprise and mistook the sound of <b>the</b> <b>fireworks</b> for a terrorist attack. On October 25 production moved to Naples where it remained up to November 4. They donated €7,000 to the local community to thank them for the hospitality, and to fund {{the construction of a}} pedestrian plaza.

After a transplant, however, Nick would regain his vision, and form a lukewarm relationship with Ramona. Ramona, however, was dating Nick to mask her attraction to Johnny.|$|R
5|$|Weizsäcker {{took office}} {{for his second}} presidential term on 1 July 1989, {{and in the course}} of it he oversaw the end of the Cold War and the Reunification of Germany. Thereupon, Weizsäcker became the first all-German Head of State since Karl Dönitz in May 1945. At midnight on 3 October 1990, during the {{official}} festivities held before the Reichstag building in Berlin to mark the moment of the reunification of Germany, President Weizsäcker delivered the only speech of the night, immediately after the raising of the flag, and before the playing of the National Anthem. His brief remarks, however, were almost inaudible, due to the sound of the bells marking midnight, and of <b>the</b> <b>fireworks</b> that were released to celebrate the moment of reunification. In those remarks he praised the accomplishment of German unity in freedom and in peace. He gave a longer speech at the act of state at the Berliner Philharmonie later that day.|$|E
5|$|LeChuck's advances, he {{nevertheless}} pursues {{her love}} and aims to impress her by discovering {{the secret of}} Monkey Island. The exhibition ultimately costs LeChuck his life, but he returns as a ghost still intent on marrying Elaine. LeChuck's ambitions for Elaine's hand in marriage—whether given willingly or not—form {{a major part of}} the franchise's plot. Elaine first encounters Guybrush when he breaks into the governor's mansion on Mêlée Island in an attempt to steal a valuable idol. Elaine has been fascinated to meet Guybrush since hearing of his arrival on the island and his strange name, however, their first meeting is stunted by Guybrush being too awestruck by Elaine's beauty to say anything intelligible. When the local sheriff tries to drown Guybrush after a fight, Elaine nevertheless rushes to his aid, confessing that she feels deeply attracted to Guybrush, which he reciprocates. She implores Guybrush to finish his pirate trials before they act on their new-found love, but is kidnapped by LeChuck and taken to his hideout on Monkey Island when the ghost pirate's crew suddenly raids the island. Guybrush mounts a rescue attempt, but fails to reach Elaine before LeChuck's ship returns to Mêlée Island for LeChuck's wedding to Elaine. The well-intentioned Threepwood gatecrashes the wedding, but in actuality ruins Elaine's own plan to defeat LeChuck with an anti-ghost concoction. Guybrush still manages to destroy LeChuck, and the game closes with the happy couple watching <b>the</b> <b>fireworks</b> as the evil pirate's ghost form explodes.|$|E
5|$|Quagmire {{returns home}} from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some {{fireworks}} into Quahog by hiding them in his anus. Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and could have just brought them in normally, but Quagmire doesn't see any fun in doing that. Later on, the Griffins and Quagmire start to play with <b>the</b> <b>fireworks.</b> Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows Quagmire, but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire, and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on {{his work at the}} brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away screaming. In the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him.|$|E
