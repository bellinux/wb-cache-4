5|$|The {{rotational}} {{axis of the}} Moon lies within Shackleton, only a few kilometers from its center. The crater is 21km in diameter and 4.2km deep. From the Earth, it is viewed edge-on in a region of rough, cratered terrain. It is located within the South Pole-Aitken basin on a massif. The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted. No significant craters intersect <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> <b>and</b> it is sloped about 1.5° toward the direction 50–90° from the Earth. The age of the crater is about 3.6billion years {{and it has been}} in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years.|$|E
25|$|A Faraday disk {{can also}} be {{operated}} with neither a galvanometer nor a return path. When the disk spins, the electrons collect along <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> leave a deficit near the axis (or the other way around). It is possible in principle to measure the distribution of charge, for example, through the electromotive force generated between <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> the axle (though not necessarily easy). This charge separation will be proportional to the relative rotational velocity between the disk and the magnet.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rim</b> of Cavendish {{is heavily}} worn and the crater Cavendish E lies across <b>the</b> {{southwest}} <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> smaller Cavendish A is intruding into <b>the</b> northeast <b>rim.</b> On <b>the</b> flood are {{a pair of}} low-rimmed craters that are joined at <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> <b>and</b> span most of the central Cavendish crater floor from east to west.|$|R
50|$|This crater {{has been}} worn and eroded by {{subsequent}} impacts. A small crater overlays <b>the</b> eastern <b>rim,</b> <b>and</b> much of <b>the</b> northeastern and northern parts of <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> have been disorganized by lesser impacts. There is a depression in <b>the</b> southern <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> southwest <b>rim</b> has an outward bulge or slump. The interior floor is also rough and somewhat irregular, with several tiny craterlets marking the surface.|$|R
25|$|The first {{preserved}} {{sketch of}} the horn comes from this treatise. Wormius notes {{that he had not}} seen the horn in the state in which it was found, and it cannot now be determined whether <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> the narrow segments devoid of ornamentation were modern additions like the pommel.|$|E
25|$|During {{commercial}} {{filling it}} is common to use a flame to sterilize <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> lid of jars to destroy any yeasts and molds which may cause spoilage during storage. Steam is commonly injected immediately prior to lidding to create a vacuum, which both helps prevent spoilage and pulls down tamper-evident safety button when used.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to curb counterfeiting, a new 5-rand coin was {{released}} in August 2004. Security features introduced on the coin include a bimetal design (similar to the €1 and €2 coins, the Thai 10-baht coin, the British £2 coin, and the Canadian $2 coin), a specially serrated security groove along <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> microlettering.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rim</b> of Zeno is {{slightly}} distorted and has received some erosion due to subsequent impacts. There is a {{depression in the}} surface attached to <b>the</b> eastern <b>rim,</b> forming a bulging extension. Small craters lie on <b>the</b> southern <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> across <b>the</b> interior of the northern wall. The crater Zeno B {{is attached to the}} exterior of <b>the</b> southwestern <b>rim,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distorted Zeno A is attached in turn to <b>the</b> western <b>rim</b> of Zeno B.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rim</b> of this crater is {{overlaid}} {{by a pair}} {{of small}} but notable craters: Biela C across <b>the</b> northeast <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> Biela W along the western inner wall. The satellite crater Biela B is attached to <b>the</b> southwestern outer <b>rim,</b> <b>and</b> ejecta from Biela covers the northwestern part of the interior. Despite a certain degree of wear, <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of Biela remains relatively well-defined, especially in the southeast.|$|R
25|$|A {{shot that}} misses both <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> the {{backboard}} completely {{is referred to}} as an air ball. A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a brick.

25|$|The ceramic ritual vessel vats {{that bear}} these {{cinnabar}} inscriptions were all unearthed within the palace area of this site. They were unearthed {{mostly in the}} sacrificial pits holding cow skulls and cow horns, but also in other architectural areas. The inscriptions are written on the exterior and interior of <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> <b>and</b> {{the exterior of the}} belly of the large type of vats. The characters are mostly written singly; character compounds or sentences are rarely seen.|$|E
25|$|The Wildcats were {{relatively}} injury-free in 2015/16 {{and finished the}} regular season in second place with an 18–10 record. By qualifying for the finals in 2016, the Wildcats set a record with their 30th straight season of playing in the playoffs. With Jawai's presence inside, Prather's athleticism, tough defence and ability to finish at <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> Kenny being able support captain Damian Martin admirably, they provided improvement in crucial areas. Alongside the core of Martin, Redhage, Wagstaff, Knight, Hire, Jermaine Beal and Tom Jervis, Gleeson and the Wildcats were successful in {{going all the way}} in 2015/16 by reaching the NBL Grand Final and defeating the New Zealand Breakers 2–1.|$|E

25|$|Utah {{defeated}} Missouri in {{the opening}} round, 45–35, and then defeated Iowa State, 40–31, in the Final Four (back then, only eight teams qualified for the tournament). In the NCAA Championship game, Utah and Dartmouth played one another evenly. The game went into overtime, and Utah prevailed 42–40 for the school's first (and still only) men's national basketball championship. Wilkinson scored seven points in the game, including the game's winning basket in the extra period with five seconds remaining. Standing {{at the top of}} the key, he received a pass from Bob Lewis and then shot. The ball bounced off the front of <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> dropped into the net, securing Utah the national championship.|$|E
25|$|The horns {{were found}} in 1639 and in 1734, respectively, at {{locations}} only some 15–20 metres apart. They were composed of segments of double sheet gold. The two horns {{were found in}}complete; the longer one found in 1639 had seven segments with ornaments, to which six plain segments and a plain rim were added, possibly by the 17th-century restorer. The shorter horn found in 1734 had six segments, a narrow one bearing a Proto-Norse Elder Futhark inscription at <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> five ornamented with images. It is uncertain whether the horns were intended as drinking horns, or as blowing horns, although drinking horns have more pronounced history as luxury items made from precious metal.|$|E
25|$|On March 14, 2007 in Dallas, Phoenix beat Dallas in a 129–127 double {{overtime}} thriller. With the Mavericks up by 7 with {{a minute}} left in regulation, Dirk Nowitzki (a 90% free throw shooter) missed two free throws. Steve Nash fed off his mistakes and scored 10 straight points including the game-tying three-pointer with 3 seconds left to go. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-winning shot bounced off <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> sent the game to overtime. Jason Terry sent the game into another overtime with a game-tying three-pointer of his own. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-tying shot in double overtime went {{in and out of}} the rim as Amar'e Stoudemire's 41 points were too much for Dallas to handle.|$|E
50|$|This feature {{has been}} {{battered}} by subsequent impacts, leaving {{a series of}} smaller craters along <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> inner wall, <b>and</b> floor of the crater.

25|$|The immortal souls {{that follow}} the gods most closely {{are able to}} just barely raise their chariots up to <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, {{having to deal with}} their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while {{straining}} to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.|$|E
25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside of <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.|$|E

25|$|Dante and Virgil {{approach}} the Central Well, {{at the bottom}} of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell. The classical and biblical Giants – who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery – stand perpetual guard inside the well-pit, their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>and</b> can be visible from the Malebolge. Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city. Among the Giants, Virgil identifies Nimrod (who tried to build the Tower of Babel; he shouts out the unintelligible Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi); Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy; he has his arms chained up) and Briareus (who Dante claimed to have challenged the Gods); and Tityos and Typhon, who insulted Jupiter. Also here is the Giant Antaeus, who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian Gods and therefore is not chained. At Virgil's persuasion, Antaeus takes the Poets in his large palm and lowers them gently to the final level of Hell.|$|E
