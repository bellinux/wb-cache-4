5|$|Friends of <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Line {{has raised}} more than $150 million in public and private funds toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Line. Unlike the first two phases of <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Line was solely responsible for raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. Friends of <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations. A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Line received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Line raised an extra $85 million that year.|$|E

In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E

On the north side, the Plaza is principally delimited by Structures 5D-77, 5C-45, 5C-46, together with some smaller structures. The Low Plaza lies {{to the west of the}} Lost World Pyramid, centred upon Structure 5C-53, a low platform. The Low Plaza is closed on its north side by the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49), which is the second largest structure in the whole complex.|$|E
