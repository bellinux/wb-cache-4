5|$|A further {{distinction}} {{is the number}} of chambers in the national legislature; unicameral systems with one chamber or bicameral ones with a lower house and an upper house. Federations and countries with strong regional differences or regional identities are normally bicameral, to reflect the regions' interests in national bills. The states with the larger populations, from the Netherlands upwards, all have a bicameral system. Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> mix among the smaller states (some influenced by their federalist structure), the smallest states are on the whole unicameral.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{barometric}} {{pressure and the}} pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) {{have been used in}} forecasting since the late 19th century. The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than , the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> chance of rain. Rapid pressure rises are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.|$|E
5|$|Roman troops, however, {{penetrated}} {{far into}} the north of modern Scotland several more times. Indeed, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> density of Roman marching camps in Scotland {{than anywhere else in}} Europe, as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area. The Antonine Wall was occupied again for a brief period after 197. The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus, claiming to be provoked by the belligerence of the Maeatae, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy. Severus invaded Caledonia with an army perhaps over 40,000 strong.|$|E

5|$|Terns are {{protected}} by international legislation such as the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the US-Canada Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Parties to the AWEA agreement are required {{to engage in a}} wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. The North American legislation is similar, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> emphasis on protection.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{international}} border is firmly established and peaceful; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> sense of Canadian nationality, {{and fears of}} U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing {{up and down the}} valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E
5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style {{is the use of}} drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Amphibian {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiation based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region One, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount of sand, and deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. Region Two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation, due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer/hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in Region Two than Region One. Region Three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to Region Two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region, and tend to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer/broadleaf hardwood tracts. Region Four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer/broadleaf forests again predominate.|$|E
