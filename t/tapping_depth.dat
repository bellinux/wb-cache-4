It is also {{available}} at: [URL] use of power screwdrivers and drills for tapping and screw insertion in surgery is becoming more common. It has been established from clinical observations {{that the use of}} a small air drill for inserting self-tapping screws provides improved coaxial alignment and precision, and that the drill should be stopped before the screw head is completely seated on the plate, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} over-tightening. The risk of overrun and over-tightening during tapping and screw insertion is increased with the use of power tools. Prevention of over-tightening is dependent upon when the surgeon detects the onset of tightening, both visually and from the feel of the rapid increase in torque. If detection is too late, then over-tightening or stripping can occur. This study is concerned with using a mechatronic screwdriver to control the <b>tapping</b> <b>depth</b> and to prevent the over-tightening of screws. The effects of various parameters upon the torque profile during tapping and screw insertion have been investigated in synthetic bone and sheep tibia. An automated system is proposed for preventing over-tightening of pre-tapped and self-tapping screws when attaching a surgical plate to a sheep tibia in vitro. The system was used to attach a plate to a sheep tibia using self-tapping screws. The mean torque of the screws inserted using the automated system was 35 per cent of the stripping torque...|$|E
30|$|The {{provision}} of groundwater has therefore become an attractive source of suitable water supply. In Ghana, groundwater of sufficient quality is gradually becoming {{an integral part}} of the socioeconomic development. This resource forms the backbone of the rural water delivery system in the country and it is being <b>tapped</b> at various <b>depths</b> to meet growing needs. Groundwater use is the most cost effective means of rural water supply (Kortatsi 1994). This is because groundwater can be <b>tapped</b> at shallow <b>depths</b> in several areas of the country. Also, well yields are in many cases good (Gyau-Boakye and Dapaah-Siakwan 2000) and serve as adequate supply of water throughout the year. Lastly, when well sites are adequately protected, groundwater has excellent natural quality and requires minimal or no prior treatment.|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} 36 water samples were {{collected}} from canals, existing hand pumps, bore wells, tube wells <b>tapping</b> different <b>depths</b> and covering {{different parts of the}} district during both pre-monsoon (18 nos.) and post-monsoon (18 nos.) seasons. In general, hand pumps <b>tap</b> shallow <b>depths</b> (10 – 50  m bgl), while bore wells and tube wells tap both shallow and deep groundwater (15 – 150  mg bgl). Sample locations are shown in Fig.  1. Samples were collected from the four blocks in the district that are classified as safe for groundwater development potential (CGWB 2007). The blocks include Bathinda, Sangat, Talwandi Sabo and Maur. The samples were filtered using 0.45 -μm-pore-size membrane filters and stored in polyethylene bottles that were initially washed with nitric acid and rinsed thoroughly with distilled water. Another set was collected and acidified to pH =  2 by adding ultrapure nitric acid for cation measurements. Physical parameters like pH, conductivity and temperature were measured in situ using field kit, whereas chemical analysis was carried out in the laboratory. Alkalinity was measured by titrating 10  mL of water sample with 0.02  N H 2 SO 4 by Gran titration method. Major cations such as Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + were analyzed by titration method, Na+ and K+ by flame photometer 128 (Systronics), chloride by titration method and NO 3 −, F−, SO 4 2 − by spectrophotometer (Spectronic 21 D). All the analytical procedures were followed in compliance with standard protocols (APHA 1998).|$|R

In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he <b>tapped</b> the <b>depths</b> of his feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death. These themes are expressed in paintings such as The Sick Child (1885), Love and Pain (retitled Vampire; 1893–94), Ashes (1894), and The Bridge. The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses.

40|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} is {{the largest}} explosive event at Merapi volcano since 1872. The high energy of the initial 26 October explosions cannot be explained by simple gravitational collapse and the paroxysmal explosions were preceded by {{the growth of a}} lava dome not large enough to ensure significant pressurization of the system. We sampled pumice from these explosive phases and determined the pre-explosive depths of the pumices by combining textural analyses with glass water content measurements. Our results indicate that the magma expelled was <b>tapped</b> from <b>depths</b> of several kilometers. Such depths are much greater than those involved in the pre- 2010 effusive activity. We propose that the water-rich magma liberated enough gas to sustain the explosivity. Our results imply that the explosive potential of volcanoes having dome-forming, effusive activity is linked to the depth from which fresh magma can be evacuated in a single explosion, regardless of the evacuated volume...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{possibility}} of shale-gas {{development in the}} environmentally sensitive Karoo Basin, South Africa has created {{the need to develop}} a hydrochemical baseline for deep Karoo groundwater. Little is known about the composition of deep (> 1500 m) groundwater in the Karoo because there are no functional boreholes that <b>tap</b> these <b>depths.</b> This study examined whether sub-thermal spring waters, defined as groundwater with a temperature > 25 °C, are suitable proxies for deep Karoo groundwater. On the basis of temperature, major cations and anions and 14 C, three groups of groundwaters were defined: (1) shallow (cold, young); (2) deep (sub-thermal, old); and (3) mixed (sub-thermal or cold, intermediate age). δ 18 O, δ 2 H, δ 13 CDIC, δ 11 B and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios for the three groups indicate that the sub-thermal groundwaters may be suitable proxies for deep groundwater but also that mixing already occurs between the deep and the shallow groundwater systems. This does not impact on the overall groundwater quality but could leave the shallow groundwater vulnerable to future contamination should shale gas development proceed...|$|R

40|$|Many {{have argued}} that {{international}} agreements face a trade-off between width and depth: that is, that having more members (and greater diversity among those members) tends to lead to lower levels of co-operation within an organization. Recent theoretical literature has called into question {{the nature of this}} trade-off, and has even questioned its existence. In this contribution, we seek to uncover the empirical relationship between width and depth using a cross-sectional dataset on regional economic organizations (REOs). We use expert survey data to capture information on key dimensions that <b>taps</b> into the <b>depth</b> of co-operation. We demonstrate that there is no empirical relationship between the number of members in an organization and the depth of co-operation. However, organizations with more members tend to have more ambitious goals and broader scope. This may contribute to the perception of a depth and breadth tradeoff. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

This is also the storyteller’s craft. How can we use story within interactive simulations to better teach, train, or inspire? Now that science and technology can make simulations more realistic, how can art make them more compelling through interactive fiction? The key is to use story to <b>tap</b> the <b>depths</b> of emotions, engaging the user’s desire for exploration, learning, challenge, and adventure. In the new domain of training, story becomes the means more than the end. Can the compelling art of story transition from the passive media of motion pictures to the nonlinear interactivity of simulation? This is venturing beyond the reactive branching of cause-and-effect games or choose-your-own-ending adventure stories. This process is about the unpredictable expressiveness of audiences exchanging discourse with the author mediated through the digital media—the story engine.

40|$|In this contribution, {{the channel}} {{characteristic}} {{of the next generation}} DDR 5 -SDRAM architecture and possible approaches to overcome channel impairments are analysed. Because modern enterprise server applications and networks demand higher memory bandwidth, throughput and capacity, the DDR 5 -SDRAM specification is currently under development as a follow-up of DDR 4 -SDRAM technology. In this specification, the data rate is doubled to DDR 5 - 6400 per IO as compared to the former DDR 4 - 3200 architecture, resulting in a total per DIMM data rate of up to 409. 6  Gb s − 1. The single-ended multi-point-to-point CPU channel architecture in DDRX technology remains the same for DDR 5 systems. At the specified target data rate, insertion loss, reflections, cross-talk as well as power supply noise become more severe and have to be considered. Using the data buffer receiver front-end of a load-reduced memory module, sophisticated equalisation techniques can be applied to ensure target BER at the increased data rate. In this work, the worst case CPU back-plane channel is analysed to derive requirements for receiver-side equalisation from the channel response characteristics. First, channel impairments such as inter-symbol-interference, reflections from the multi-point channel structure, and crosstalk from neighboring lines are analysed in detail. Based on these results, different correction methods for DDR 5 data buffer front-ends are discussed. An architecture with 1 -tap FFE in combination with a multi-tap DFE is proposed. Simulation of the architecture using a random input data stream is used to reveal the required DFE <b>tap</b> filter <b>depth</b> to effectively eliminate the dominant ISI and reflection based error components...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{detailed}} stratigraphical and volcanological study has allowed {{the definition of the}} Neapolitan Yellow Tuff (NYT) as the largest known trachytic phreatoplinian eruption with an estimated volume of not less than 30 km 3 DRE. The NYT sequence can be subdivided in a lower and an upper member. Sedimentological and textural variations in time and space indicate that different eruptive and depositional mechanisms operated during the eruption. The lower member eruptive phase was characterized by alternating phreatoplinian and magmatic explosions while the upper member eruptive phase was characterized by a random sequence of phreatomagmatic and magmatic explosions. Particles produced by the same explosion were deposited contemporaneously by fallout and surge mechanisms either at different or at the same distance from the vent. Compositional variations show that the NYT sequence cannot be modeled as an inverted compositionally zoned magma body with magma becoming more basic {{in the course of the}} eruption. The chamber, composed of three geochemically distinct magma layers, was <b>tapped</b> at different <b>depths</b> according to the eruption dynamics. Each phreatoplinian explosion tapped concurrently all the magma layers while magmatic explosions tapped only one of them. The onset of the NYT caldera collapse is well constrained between lower and upper member eruptive phases. The collapse, which is only gravimetrically detectable, occurred inside the larger Phlegrean Fields caldera, which therefore can be defined as a nested caldera...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe magmatic {{phase of}} the AD 79 {{eruption}} of Vesuvius produced alternations of fall and pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits. A previous investigation demonstrated that the formation of several PDCs was linked with abrupt increases {{in the proportion of}} denser juvenile clasts within the eruptive column. Under the premise that juvenile clast density is controlled by vesiculation processes within the conduit, we investigate the processes responsible for these variations at or close to fragmentation levels. Pumice textures (vesicle sizes, numbers, and connectivity combined with crystal textures) from the AD 79 PDC deposits are compared to those from interbedded fall samples. Both PDC and fall deposits preserve textures that represent a full spectrum of degassing and outgassing processes, from bubble nucleation to collapse. Combining the textural and volatile (groundmass H 2 O) data, we derive a conduit model that satisfies all the textural and physical observations made for this {{phase of the}} eruption: lateral vesicularity/density stratifications are produced by maturing of bubble textures with superimposed localized shearing of bubble-rich magmas, which enhance outgassing of H 2 O. The incorporation of denser slower-moving magma from the conduit margins ("lateral magma density gradient") is likely to be responsible for the higher abundances of dense juvenile pumice that triggered partial column collapses. We also illustrate how variations in the fragmentation <b>depth</b> (<b>tapping</b> a "vertical magma density gradient") can be responsible for variations in erupted clast density distributions, and potentially in the extent of degassing/outgassing...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally {{community}} engagement {{for academic}} libraries translates as outreach {{to the academic}} community. But what are the possibilities when an academic library extends outreach to people not normally defined as university stakeholders? At Indiana State University (ISU), we learned that extending outreach to an untapped population can reap unexpected gains. For {{the past two years}} ISU instruction librarians have traveled to a local retirement community to teach computer skills as part of ISU’s Bites & Bytes Program. The initial goal of the program was to benefit the community-at-large by providing these adult learners with therapeutic activity and a social outlet. But we soon realized that these students did not behave like our pupils in the university community. We had to learn to teach to a new population of learners, and because of this our new students were teaching us as much – if not more – than we were teaching them. After networking with experts on campus who work with elders, we learned that our Bites & Bytes students were adopting learning behaviors typical of their age group – behaviors that we were unfamiliar with. So we began to learn, and in so doing we adopted teaching techniques that addressed their unique learning styles. We also began to incorporate some of these newly acquired techniques into our upper division library instruction classes. And realizing that this outreach program could offer our university students opportunity for growth, we then partnered with faculty to open up Bites & Bytes as a field site for students enrolled in a freshman social work course. In this presentation we will trace the evolution of a library community outreach initiative that grew {{to become part of the}} university curriculum, review pedagogical approaches that work with elder adult learners, and relate how some of these approaches can be employed to teach undergraduates.

40|$|Teak (Tectona grandis Linn. F.) is {{a highly}} {{preferred}} plantation species in Ghana. Stumps are usually used to establish teak plantation. There has been persistent problem of low survival rate of planted teak stumps in large-scale plantation establishment in the country. A 4 x 3 x 3 factorial experiment in randomized complete design in two blocks was undertaken to evaluate the depen-dence of length of tape root bellow root collar, percentage of retention of rootlets and depth of planting of stumps on the biomass of planted teak (Tectona grandis Linn. F) stumps. The main aim was to develop suitable method of converting teak seedlings into stumps and appropriate planting practice to improve the survival and growth of teak stumps. The quadratic reciprocal with an optimal level model (79 ≤ R 2 ≤ 95 %) appears to be precise modeling the trends {{in the number of}} shoots production on sprouted teak stumps over time for length of <b>tap</b> root and <b>depth</b> of planting of stumps. Length of tape root below, percentage of retention of rootlets and depth of planting of stumps significantly affected the growth of tree height, tree collar diameter, stem dry weight, root dry weight, leaf dry weight and total tree dry weight. The two-factor interaction of length of tap root and percentage of retention of rootlets also had a significant influence on tree growth, except leaf dry weight. The best biomass production was observed for non-treated stump tap root and rootlets and planting at 9 cm soil depth ensuring a gain of about 486 % of tree dry weight over the traditional method of stump preparation and planting...|$|R
40|$|In {{the heating}} and cooling sector, {{borehole}} heat exchangers (BHE) have become increasingly popular for supplying renewable energy. When grouped in compact arrays, BHEs represent suitable thermal energy storage systems for fluctuating heat sources such as solar energy or district heating grids. <b>Tapping</b> into greater <b>depth</b> allows for storage operation on a higher temperature level. This so called medium deep borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) requires negligible groundwater flow in the reservoir rock and the thermal insulation of {{the upper part of}} the boreholes to meet legal requirements and to improve the BHEs’ performance. Medium deep BTES is characterized by a slow thermal response and a large storage capacity, which makes it particularly suitable for seasonal heat storage applications. However, the economic feasibility of these systems is compromised by high investment costs, especially by the expensive drilling of the boreholes. Therefore, a priori numerical simulations of the storage operation are imperative for the systems’ planning and design. Only fully discretized models can account for depth-dependent borehole properties like insulated sections, but the model setup is cumbersome and the simulations come at high computational cost. Hence, these models are often not suitable for the simulation of larger installations and are difficult to handle in mathematical optimization applications. This thesis presents a versatile tool for the simulation and optimization of medium deep BTES systems. The Borehole Heat Exchanger Array Simulation and Optimization tool (BASIMO) includes models for the three most common BHE types: U-pipe, double U-pipe and coaxial pipe BHEs. In a dual-continuum approach, the simulator couples a numerical subsurface model with an analytical solution for the BHEs, which allows for the efficient, but detailed consideration of the relevant thermo physical and operational parameters. With the presented tool, many aspects of BTES systems can be simulated and optimized. The concept of medium deep BTES has not been put into practice so far. However, simulations yield promising results and show that large scale medium deep BTES can achieve more than 80...|$|R
40|$|Water {{exploitation}} and population explosion {{are two major}} problems facing Nwangele Local Government. This study was therefore predicated on these problems to assess the underground water and pollution vulnerability of the study area. The method of study involves literature survey of previous work done in Imo River sedimentary basin and other works considered necessary for the study. A total of ten (10) vertical electricity soundings (VES) was conducted for data generation using terrameter 300 SAS employing Schlumberger configuration. Aquifer (sands) from boreholes within three (3) communities and ten (10) water samples were collected and used for statistical and geochemical analysis. The result shows that the lithology is made of sand, silt sand, clay and shale. Three (3) aquifer systems exits in the area confined, semi confined and unconfined aquifers, these occur as upper (33. 5 m), middle (82 m) and lower (102 to 115 m) aquifers. The lithology comprises 4 to 6 layers with water bearing bed occurring at the fifth layer. Average aquifer thickness measured 38 metres. Multiaquifer system exists in some localities. Hydraulic conductivity values range from 25. 6 m/day to 28. 9 m/day, transmissivity ranges from 450. 842 /day to 111. 7 m 2 /day while the storativity values ranges from 0. 468 x 10 - 5 to 1. 13 x 10 - 5, all indicate aquifer of good yield. Aquifer thickness ranges from 12. 5 to 45 m. The water chemistry is neutral, mildly acidic to mildly alkaline. The underground water is of calcium by carbonate type (CaHCO 3) fresh and ideal for consumption, irrigation and laundry industry. None of the constituents fell short of WHO (1984) standard.

40|$|The {{importance}} of domesticating and integrating high value fruit trees in agricultural landscapes by farmers is increasingly being {{recognized in the}} humid tropics. However in an agroforestry context, the growth attributes of intercropped trees above and belowground determine whether the association will be complementary or competitive. The focus of the present research was on two African indigenous fruit tree species (Dacryodes edulis G. Don) H. J. Lam (Burseraceae) and Allanblackia floribunda Oliv. (Clusiaceae), which are currently under domestication, and have high food, income and environmental security values. On D. edulis, the thrust was to assess and compare the structural and fine rooting systems together with the aboveground growth attributes of fruiting trees propagated sexually and vegetatively, while on A. floribunda, {{the focus was on}} how to reduce the long juvenile phase of about 10 - 12 years before first fruiting to less than 5 years through grafting techniques. The results of the investigations on D. edulis indicate that trees of seed origin were characterized by a <b>tap</b> root, reaching <b>depths</b> of about 1. 20 m, whereas, trees of cutting origin showed three strong vertical roots (d > 5 mm) with the longest reaching depths of 1. 31 m. Similarly, trees of marcot origin were observed to have thick, relatively short prominent vertical roots, reaching depths of 1. 15 m. In addition, trees of seed origin had greater fine root density (RD) (P ≤ 0. 001) than trees of vegetative origin (cuttings and marcots) in the upper soil stratum (0 - 30 cm). Trees of seed origin were also shown to have an exponential distribution pattern for fine root density and root length within depth to 80 cm. In contrast, the distribution pattern of fine roots of trees of vegetative origin (cuttings and marcots) were quadratic for the same variables which increased in the 20 - 30 cm soil depth stratum before declining steadily to a depth of 80 cm. Furthermore, shoot density, defined as, number of shoots per tree, and height differed significantly (p= 0. 004 and p= 0. 005, respectively) amongst tree origins. Trees of seed and cutting origins had single-stem shoots whereas marcots had 6 shoots per tree on average. Trees of cutting origin grew tallest, with mean height of 8. 4 ± 2. 2 m compared to 6. 7 ± 0. 9 m and 7. 6 ± 1. 9 m for trees of marcot or seed origins respectively. Mean carbon (C) sequestration estimated using allometric models differed significantly (p= 0. 014) between trees of vegetative origin and those of seed origin, with 10 years old D. edulis trees of cutting and marcot origins sequestrating averagely 26. 8 ± 19. 1 Mg C ha- 1 and 21. 74 ± 12. 8 Mg C ha- 1 respectively over 10 years, compared to 13. 10 ± 9. 4 Mg C ha- 1 for trees of seed origin. In summary, the results from the studies on D. edulis suggest that vegetative propagation on the species, besides reducing the long juvenile phase to fruiting and maintaining trueness in the transfer of desirable traits over generations, also results in trees that are apparently less competitive for belowground resources. In addition, vegetative propagated trees of D. edulis were shown to have apparently stable root system and the trees bigger in stature and higher in carbon sinks than trees of seed origin. In parallel, A. floribunda scions were taken from female trees, and grafted onto rootstocks using side tongue, top cleft, side veneer, and whip-and-tongue methods under nursery conditions. In a separate experiment, side tongue and inverted ‘T’ budding methods were also tested in situ on young A. floribunda wildings growing under semi-deciduous and evergreen tree covers. In addition, the effects of protecting side tongue grafts with non-perforated, translucent plastic, perforated translucent plastic and aluminium foil were assessed. A. floribunda was shown to be amenable to grafting both under nursery and field (in situ) conditions. Under nursery conditions, side tongue grafts were significantly more successful (80. 0 ± 6. 3 %), than grafts of side veneer (52. 5 ± 7. 9 %), top cleft (55. 0 ± 7. 9 %) and whip–and-tongue (50. 0 ± 7. 9 %). The success of side tongue grafts was further increased (86. 7 ± 6. 2 %) under evergreen shade when grafts were protected by non-perforated translucent plastic. A grafted A. floribunda tree transplanted in the field in 2007 flowered and carried a single fruit to maturity after 4 years, thereby reducing the long juvenile period to first fruit production of about 10 - 12 years reported in literature to less than 5 years. In conclusion, the effect of propagation methods on the belowground and aboveground growth attributes and their C storage potential studied in the present research on D. edulis, have not yet been studied and published anywhere according to the authors knowledge. Similarly, the reduced long juvenile period to first fruit production to less than 5 years in A. floribunda grafts reported in this research is the first published prove of concept on this species according to the author’s knowledge. Therefore, the research results presented in this thesis should be considered as pilot case studies aimed at obtaining insights into the effect of vegetative propagation methods on the above and belowground growth and development of improved planting materials of these two African indigenous fruit trees (Dacryodes edulis and Allanblackia floribunda) under domestication...|$|R
