In 1917, following the United States' entry into World War I, {{he went to work}} with the National Research Council.

25|$|Smallholders’ lump is {{produced}} by smallholders who collect rubber from trees far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in remote areas, tap dispersed trees {{on their way to}} work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a factory that processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products, and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the smallholder will coagulate it by any means available, in any container available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to coagulate the latex— a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are formed, which may also include tree lace.|$|E

Lutyens {{wanted to make a}} long {{inclined}} grade all the way to Viceroy's House with retaining walls on either side. While this would give a view of the house from further back, it would also cut through the square between the secretariat buildings. The committee with Lutyens and Baker established in January 1914 said the grade was to be no steeper than 1 in 25, though it eventually was changed to 1 in 22, a steeper gradient which made it more difficult to see the Viceroy's palace. While Lutyens knew about the gradient, and the possibility that the Viceroy's palace would be obscured by the road, it is thought that Lutyens did not fully realize how little {{the front of the house}} would be visible. In 1916 the Imperial Delhi committee dismissed Lutyens's proposal to alter the gradient. Lutyens thought Baker was more concerned with making money and pleasing the government, rather than making a good architectural design.|$|E

[...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "11001001" [...] is {{a binary}} number, a {{contraction}} {{of the names}} of the Bynars (One One, Zero Zero, One Zero, and Zero One). The episode at one point was called [...] "10101001". It was originally intended that this episode would take place prior to [...] "The Big Goodbye", with the Bynars' modifications causing the problems with the holodeck seen in that episode. Instead it was changed to the Bynars aiming to fix the holodeck to prevent those problems re-occurring. The Bynars themselves were played by young women. Children were considered for the parts, but the production team thought that it would be too problematic because of the limited time they could work each day and the need to hire teachers. Each actress was required to wear extensive make-up, which was created by make-up supervisor Michael Westmore. A large single-piece bald cap was made from the same mold for each actress, which required some customised trimming <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> fit properly. To cover up problems with the seams of the cap, some fake hair was added on the Bynars' necks. Each actress also controlled the flashing light inside the apparatus {{on the side of the}} headpiece through a battery pack attached to the waistband of their costumes. To disguise their voices, the pitch was lowered in post production. It was originally planned to add subtitles over the Bynars' conversations between themselves.|$|E

On November 8, 2005, Horton was placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury. He was activated on December 1 and scored in his first game back against the Washington Capitals to help the Panthers win 32. Horton added 2 goals against the Chicago Blackhawks in the Panthers' next game to bring his season total to 10 in 17 games. Against the Nashville Predators on December 13, Horton recorded his first career hat trick and stated after the game that, [...] "It's a pretty nice feeling. I felt like there was no one on me. I just tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the net and it went in every time." [...] Despite missing 10 games to injury, Horton was tied with teammate Olli Jokinen for the team lead in goals with 16 after 38 games. Against Washington on January 9, Horton and Joe Nieuwendyk scored a goal in the shootout to help the Panthers win 43. Two days after his shootout goal, Horton was promoted to the Panthers' first line. Despite his promotion to the first line, Horton's name was mentioned in a potential trade with the Vancouver Canucks; however, nothing materialized. [...] In a 62 win over the Ottawa Senators, Horton scored 2 goals including one on a rebound, after which he said, [...] "It just popped right out to me. It was a long time coming for goals for me. I got lucky tonight and hopefully they keep going in." [...] In March, Horton began playing in penalty kill situations for the first time in his career.

500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich deemed the episode {{a tribute to}} Lady Gaga's [...] "genius", explaining that the costumes the characters wear are not exact replicas of Gaga's, giving the impression the glee club members made them themselves.

Murphy selected Tina to wear the Hussein Chalayan–inspired bubble dress, which Eyrich adapted into a vest {{to make it easier}} to take on and off. Kurt's costume is inspired by the Alexander McQueen outfit Gaga wears in the [...] "Bad Romance" [...] video, described by Colfer as [...] "George Washington meets an Oceanic whale disco ball type thing". Eyrich strove for authenticity in replicating McQueen's ten-inch 'Armadillo' platforms. She was unable to buy a pair to fit Colfer, as they were not made in large enough sizes. Quinn wears the Armani Privé orbit dress Gaga wore to the 52nd Grammy Awards, fitted around her pregnant stomach. The most complicated costume was the Philip Treacy lobster hat, worn by Brittany (Heather Morris), as <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> stay in place during the [...] "Bad Romance" [...] dance, Eyrich had to build a Buckram orb which could be safety–pinned on her head, then solder steel tentacles onto the sphere. It took 45 minutes to get the hat on and off Morris each day, and restricted her vision to what was directly in front of her. In solidarity with Kurt, Finn wears a vinyl floor–length red dress, based on the latex Atsuko Kudo dress Gaga wore to meet Elizabeth II. Mercedes wears a glittery bodysuit and a purple hair bow and wig, and Santana wears the Jeffrey Bryant lace bodysuit, and black rose Charlie Le Mindu hat, with lace airbrushed onto her face. As mentioned in the episode, members of Vocal Adrenaline wear red Chantilly lace full-body outfits and headpieces (as well as blonde wigs) inspired by the Fall 1998 Alexander McQueen dress Gaga wore whilst accepting her award for Best New Artist at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E

In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child.
