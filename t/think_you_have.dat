500|$|Bassist Paul McGuigan briefly {{left the}} band in September 1995, citing nervous exhaustion.

500|$|Other {{major themes}} of the series include choice and free will. Meyer says that the books are {{centered}} around Bella's choice to choose her life on her own, and the Cullens' choices to abstain from killing rather than follow their temptations: [...] "I really think that's the underlying metaphor of my vampires. It doesn't matter where you're stuck in life or what you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do; you can always choose something else. There's always a different path." ...|$|E

500|$|Due to the high-pitch {{employed}} in the recording, Dickson reflected in later years that she [...] "never liked the original [...] for that reason. The song has seasoned over the years with my singing of it." [...] Dickson believed {{that she did not}} sound like herself on the song. While performing it later point of time on her concerts, Dickson sang it in her actual tone, saying that although the track [...] "might have been written for a teenage girl, but the experience of being abandoned by a man is one, women of all ages can relate to. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be honest with songs and with yourself." [...] The singer's music director Ian Lynn arranged the track differently which she performs currently.|$|E

Because Glik was concerned that the officers were using excessive force, he filmed the encounter with his cell phone. Although Glik was 10 feet away and was not interfering with the arrest, {{one of the officers}} turned to him after placing handcuffs on the suspect and said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> taken enough pictures". Glik replied that he was recording the incident; he said, [...] "I am recording this. I saw you punch him". When the officer determined that this included audio, he placed Glik under arrest for violating the Massachusetts wiretapping law.|$|E

[...] He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Although four graduating seniors were confirmed in January 2012 as returning in the fourth season—Rachel, Finn, Kurt and Santana—there had been no announcement regarding Quinn or any other seniors as of the end of February 2012. As of May 2012, Murphy stated that all graduating seniors will come back for season 4 but, not all will be doing [...] "all 22 episodes".|$|E

Roosevelt wrote to The Post, [...] "This is the first pictorial representation I have seen of the staunchly American values contained in the rights of free speech and free worship and our goals of freedom from fear and want."

500|$|The filming {{schedule}} {{was intended to}} last 138 days but grew to 160. Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned [...] "a lot of money". Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio {{said there was no}} point when he felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E

500|$|Steven Moffat {{left his}} job as an English teacher at Cowdenknowes High in Greenock to write the BAFTA-award winning show Press Gang. However, its high cost {{and changes in the}} {{executive}} structure at Central Independent Television meant that the show might not be recommissioned after its second series. As the writer wondered what to do next and was worried about future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Inspired by his experience in education (in addition to his own former career, his father was a headteacher), the writer's initial proposal was similar to what would become Chalk. However, Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking more passionately at the meeting at the Groucho Club about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead. That idea became Joking Apart, which received low audience figures but a high rating on the Appreciation Index. In an interview with The Herald, Moffat reflected on the nature of writing from experience: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an alternative to writing about what you know. You've no life experience to go on other than your own. Even if you're writing something you think is entirely remote from you - Star Trek, for instance - you'll find the finished result is actually very close to your own experience. That's not a conscious decision a writer makes - it's an inevitability." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilbert Adair, {{writing in}} a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that [...] "Kubrick's {{approach}} to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to view the entire problem of putting the story {{you want to tell}} up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|E
