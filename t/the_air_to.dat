5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results {{in the formation of}} a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E

5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: {{while most of the}} lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the {{decorative}} {{features of the}} building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built. An ascending orchestra pit and independent Wurlitzer organ platform allowed the musicians to be raised up to main stage height or to orchestra pit level from the basement below. The ventilation system had thermostatic controls throughout the building, and allowed <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.|$|E

50|$|As with {{condensation}} dryers, {{the heat}} exchanger will not dry <b>the</b> internal <b>air</b> <b>to</b> as low {{a level of}} humidity as <b>the</b> typical ambient <b>air.</b> With respect <b>to</b> ambient <b>air,</b> <b>the</b> higher humidity of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> used <b>to</b> dry <b>the</b> clothes {{has the effect of}} increasing drying times; however, because heat pump dryers conserve much of the heat of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> they use, <b>the</b> already-hot <b>air</b> can be cycled more quickly, possibly leading to shorter drying times than traditional dryers, depending on the model.|$|R
5|$|Large {{fish are}} caught with the bill-tip, then tossed up in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> be caught and {{slid into the}} gullet head-first. A gull will {{sometimes}} stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds.|$|E
5|$|Other {{means are}} also used to garner prey. Some species such as the red-naped sapsucker sally into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> catch flying insects, and many species probe into crevices and under bark, or glean prey from leaves and twigs. The rufous {{woodpecker}} specialises in attacking the nests of arboreal ants and the buff-spotted woodpecker feeds on and nests in termite mounds. Other species such as the wrynecks and the Andean flicker feed wholly or partly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{partially}} filled ballonet would cause longitudinal instability, {{due to the}} mass of air rolling fore or aft {{in the direction of}} pitch, two cloth partitions were used to divide the ballonet into three separate compartments; small holes in the partitions allowed <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> permeate gradually throughout the ballonet without affecting the stability of the airship.|$|E

5|$|The 27 {{minutes that}} had been played the {{previous}} day had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly an insight into Borussia defensive vulnerability in <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>To</b> exploit this he brought tall forward John Toshack into the starting team demoting the small build of Brian Hall to appearing only as a late substitute. In the 21st minute Peter Cormack's throw-in on the right fed Chris Lawler to cross to the back post. Toshack's header across the penalty area set up Kevin Keegan's headed opening goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before {{any part of the}} casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E

But, if the other gases of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> were removed, leaving everything else the same, condensation and evaporation would proceed as before and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> was irrelevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> behavior of the water molecules.

5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sophomore}} {{in the fall}} of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity {{basketball}} team from the junior varsity due to injuries. As a junior, his presence was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> simulate playing against him. He helped his team reach the Class 4A-state Region II final. As a junior in baseball, Young threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997. However, he missed {{a large part of the}} season after getting off to a 6–0 start because of a stress fracture in his foot. Nonetheless, he was already considered a top professional prospect, and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all-district team. By the summer of 1997, he was able to play for the Dallas Mustangs who were the defending national champions in the Connie Mack World Series, and he earned the win in the fifth place game of the World Series.|$|E
5|$|England took a 38-run lead after Australia {{replied with}} 458. Morris contributed only six while batting with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, {{who had been}} {{promoted}} from the middle order to open while Barnes was still injured; Bradman had overlooked reserve opener Brown. Morris chipped Bedser in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> Ken Cranston at mid-wicket to leave Australia at 1/13. Australia slumped to 3/68 before a middle-order fightback took Australia to 458 early on the fourth morning. England declared at 8/365 early on the fifth morning, leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make the surface more likely to spin and bounce unevenly.|$|E

5|$|Georgia's kicking {{game had}} {{a far more}} active day than its offense. Punter Gordon Ely-Kelso booted sevenpunts and kicker Brandon Coutu nailed threefieldgoals. The field goals, kicked from 39,51,and28yards away and two extra points made Coutu Georgia's leading scorer in the game, earning 11points. Ely-Kelso netted 264yards in punts, an average of 37.7yards per kick. Though not long, the punts were high enough in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> allow Georgia's special teams to get downfield and prevent long punt returns. Only two of Ely-Kelso's punts were {{returned}} by Tech kick returner Eddie Royal, and one return was for negative yardage.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E
5|$|In the 1923 season, {{under the}} eye of the county's coach, James Iremonger, Larwood {{concentrated}} on building his physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew a few inches in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight. Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> produce swing. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.|$|E
