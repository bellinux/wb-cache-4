5|$|Performance {{estimates}} of the Spey-engined Phantom contrary to its American equivalent indicated that the former had a 30% shorter <b>take-off</b> <b>distance,</b> 20% faster climb to altitude, higher top speed and longer range. The Spey was more efficient at lower altitudes, and had better acceleration at low speed, giving British Phantoms better range and acceleration, which was shown during the deployment of 892 NAS to the Mediterranean aboard USS Saratoga in 1969, when the F-4K was repeatedly quicker off the deck than the F-4J used by the Americans. It was less efficient at higher altitudes, the British Phantoms lacking speed compared to J79-powered versions owing to the increased drag of the re-designed fuselage. This discrepancy became apparent when the F-4J was obtained by the UK in 1984; it was regarded as being {{the best of the}} three variants to serve in the RAF.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} {{original}} Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage {{to withstand the}} great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings (landings where the aircraft does not 'float' and slow its decent rate just prior to touchdown). The leading edge slats, flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the wingspan remains unchanged. The wings feature double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons; in total, the refinements enlarge the wing area by 10–12%. The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck. The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust-to-weight ratio, {{as well as an}} in-flight refuelling probe. The Su-33 sports canards that shorten the <b>take-off</b> <b>distance</b> and improve manoeuvrability, but have required reshaping of the leading edge root extensions (LERX). The rear radome is shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking the deck during high-Alpha (angle of attack) landings.|$|E
25|$|Atlantic Airways is the {{national}} airline of the Faroe Islands and {{was at the time}} owned by the Government of the Faroe Islands. OY-CRG was one of five BAe 146s in Atlantic Airways' fleet {{at the time of the}} accident. The airline was flying a long-term charter contract with for Aker Kværner, who was participating in the construction of the gas field Ormen Lange in the vicinity of Molde. The contract involved regular flights between Stavanger Airport, Sola via Stord Airport, Sørstokken to Molde Airport, Årø and return five times each week. The company also flew to Alta Airport from Stavanger and Stord in relation to the construction of Snøhvit. To allow full take-off weight for the latter service, Atlantic Airways applied the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway on 18 February 2005 for permission to use a longer <b>take-off</b> <b>distance</b> at Sørstokken. This was rejected because the airport's limits were already below international minimum recommendations.|$|E

500|$|In 1944, the Sukhoi design bureau (OKB) began {{designing}} a twin-engined fighter powered by two Lyulka TR-1 turbojets, known internally as the Samolyet or Izdeliye (item or product) K. The ultimate design was very probably {{influenced by a}} captured Messerschmitt Me 262, but the Su-9 was not {{a copy of the}} German aircraft. The Su-9 had an oval cross-section, all-metal stressed skin monocoque fuselage that housed a single cockpit. The pilot was protected by armor plates to his front, an armored seat back and a bulletproof windscreen for the bubble canopy. He was provided with an ejection seat, copied from that used in the Heinkel He 162 [...] The aircraft carried a total of [...] of fuel in two bladder tanks, one each ahead and behind the pilot. The low-mounted, straight wing had a single-spar and a slight dihedral of 4°20'. The outer flaps were split and could act as air brakes. The Su-9 was the first Soviet aircraft to use hydraulic powered controls. A Soviet copy of the Junkers Jumo 004B turbojet, known as the RD-10, was hung under each wing in a streamlined nacelle. The aircraft had a tricycle undercarriage that retracted into the fuselage. The Su-9 was designed with a very high wing loading which increased the aircraft's speed and reduced its dimensions. This consequently increased the take-off and landing speeds so it was equipped with a provision for two JATO bottles (11.27kN (530lbf) thrust for 8 seconds) mounted {{on the sides of the}} fuselage. These reduced the <b>take-off</b> <b>distance</b> by nearly 50 percent and a braking parachute was fitted to reduce the landing distance.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1940 de Havilland began {{manufacturing}} a kit {{to convert}} their two pitch propeller unit to a constant speed propeller. Although this propeller {{was a great}} deal heavier than the [...] earlier types (500lb (227kg) compared with 350lb (183kg)) it provided another substantial improvement in <b>take-off</b> <b>distance</b> and climb rate. Starting on 24 June de Havilland engineers began fitting all Spitfires with these units and by 16 August every Spitfire and Hurricane had been modified. [...] "Two step" [...] rudder pedals were fitted to all frontline Spitfires; these allowed the pilot to lift his feet and legs higher during combat, improving his [...] "blackout" [...] threshold and allowing him to pull tighter sustained turns. Another modification was the small rear view mirror which was added {{to the top of the}} windscreen: an early [...] "shrouded" [...] style was later replaced by a simplified, rectangular, adjustable type.|$|E

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of the improvements in <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>distances</b> possible with a conventional propeller-driven transport-type airplane when the available lift is increased by propeller slipstream effects and by very effective trailing-edge flaps and ailerons.

The data were applied to an assumed airplane with four propellers and a wing loading of 50 pounds per square foot. Also included is {{an examination of the}} stability and control problems that may result in the landing and take-off speed range of such a vehicle. The results indicated that the landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>distances</b> could be more than halved by the use of highly effective flaps in combination with large amounts of engine power to augment lift (STOL). At the lowest speeds considered (about 50 knots), adequate longitudinal stability was obtained but the lateral and directional stability were unsatisfactory. At these low speeds, the conventional aerodynamic control surfaces {{may not be able to}} cope with the forces and moments produced by symmetric, as well as asymmetric, engine operation. This problem was alleviated by BLC applied to the control surfaces...|$|R

50|$|Tactical airlift is a {{military}} term for the airborne transportation of supplies and equipment within a theatre of operations (in contrast to strategic airlift). Aircraft which perform this role {{are referred to as}} tactical airlifters. These are typically turboprop aircraft, and feature short landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>distances</b> and low-pressure tires allowing operations from small or poorly prepared airstrips. While they lack the speed and range of strategic airlifters (which are typically jet-powered), these capabilities are invaluable within war zones. Larger helicopters such as the CH-47 Chinook and Mil Mi-26 {{can also be used to}} airlift men and equipment. Helicopters have the advantage that they do not require a landing strip and that equipment can often be suspended below the aircraft allowing it to be delivered without landing but are fuel inefficient and thus typically have limited range. Hybrid aircraft such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey also exist which attempt to combine VTOL flight with greater range and speed.|$|R

5000|$|Trials of the America began 23 June 1914 with Porte also as Chief Test Pilot; testing soon {{revealed}} serious {{shortcomings in}} the design; it was under-powered, so the engines were replaced with more powerful tractor engines. There {{was also a}} tendency for {{the nose of the}} aircraft to try to submerge as engine power increased while taxiing on water. This phenomenon had not been encountered before, since Curtiss' earlier designs had not used such powerful engines nor large fuel/cargo loads and so were relatively more buoyant. In order to counteract this effect, Curtiss fitted fins to the sides of the bow to add hydrodynamic lift, but soon replaced these with sponsons, a type of underwater pontoon mounted in pairs on either side of a hull. These sponsons (or their engineering equivalents) and the flared, notched hull would remain a prominent feature of flying boat hull design in the decades to follow. With the problem resolved, preparations for the crossing resumed. While the craft was found to handle [...] "heavily" [...] on takeoff, and required rather longer <b>take-off</b> <b>distances</b> than expected, the full moon on 5 August 1914 was selected for the trans-Atlantic flight; Porte was to pilot the America with George Hallett as co-pilot and mechanic.|$|R
