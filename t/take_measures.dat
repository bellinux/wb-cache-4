5|$|In 2007, then Florida lawyer Jack Thompson, who had {{previously}} campaigned against other games from Rockstar, stated that he would <b>take</b> <b>measures</b> to prevent the sale of Grand Theft Auto IV to minors. On 14 March 2007, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive {{filed a lawsuit against}} Thompson in an attempt to preemptively restrict him from his attempts to declare Rockstar's games as a nuisance. Games declared to be a nuisance are effectively banned for sale, which Take-Two believed would be a violation of First Amendment rights. Thompson responded by filing a countersuit, accusing Take-Two of violating federal RICO statues, committing perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiring against him with third parties to deprive him of his civil rights.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} told {{in the form of}} a series of {{interviews}} conducted by the narrator, Max Brooks, an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission. Although the exact origin of the plague is unknown, a young boy from a village in China is identified as the plague's official patient zero. The boy's case marks the point where the Chinese government begins to <b>take</b> <b>measures</b> to cover up the disease, including generating a crisis with Taiwan to mask their activities. Nevertheless, the plague still manages to spread to various nations by human trafficking, refugees and the black market organ trade. Initially, these nations were able to cover up their smaller outbreaks, until a much larger outbreak in South Africa brings the plague to public attention.|$|E
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to <b>take</b> <b>measures</b> during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E
5|$|Tatsuya and Miyuki are {{siblings}} of {{the same}} year and children to Tatsurou Shiba and the late Miya Yotsuba; their parents had a loveless forced marriage, and when their mother died, their father married his mistress, Sayuri Furuha, leaving the siblings to live by themselves. Maya Yotsuba, their aunt and the leader of the Yotsuba, was the reason Tatsuya was born with the unique magic to decompose, reconstruct, and detonate matter. Out of fear, the Yotsuba rallied for Tatsuya's death, forcing Miya and Maya to <b>take</b> <b>measures</b> to ensure his survival: the first was Miyuki's creation, a powerful magician who will act as a seal to Tatsuya's power; the second is to magically dull Tatsuya's emotions except for his familial love towards Miyuki; and the third was to assign Tatsuya to be Miyuki's bodyguard in order to develop his sense of loyalty towards her. During a family vacation in Okinawa, Tatsuya wards off an invasion by the Great Asian Alliance and joins the 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion which is headed by major Kazama Harunobu. At some point during his life, Tatsuya developed an interest in engineering magical technology and commercialized revolutionary technology through his family's company, Four Leaves Technology, under the identity Taurus Silver. He is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura.|$|E

5|$|The Right to Freedom of Religion, {{covered in}} Articles 25–28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, {{there is no}} official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally. Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience {{and the right to}} preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, {{and the power of the}} State to <b>take</b> <b>measures</b> for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it would amount to an infringement of the other's right to freedom of conscience. Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months later}} royalist general Pío Tristán {{advanced}} {{in the north}} with more than three thousand men, prepared to invade the United Provinces. Once again outnumbered by larger armies, Belgrano organised a great exodus {{of the city of}} Jujuy: the entire population of the city would have to retreat with the army and not leave behind anything that might be of value to the royalists (such as animals, crops, or housing). By September a proper formation of columns provided them with a victory against a royalist task force of 500men during the Battle of Las Piedras. The First Triumvirate commanded Belgrano to retreat to Cordoba without fighting, but he thought that doing so would mean the loss of the northern provinces. Thus, instead of continuing to Cordoba, he was convinced by the people of San Miguel de Tucumán to make a stand there. His forces had increased by then to nearly 1,800 soldiers, still much less than the 3,000 at Tristan's command. Even so, he obtained a victory in the Battle of Tucumán. By that time, the First Triumvirate was replaced by the Second Triumvirate, which provided greater support for Belgrano. The Second Triumvirate called the Assembly of Year XIII soon after taking power, which was intended to declare independence and enact a national constitution, but failed to do so because of political disputes between the members. It did not <b>take</b> <b>measures</b> regarding the national flag, but allowed Belgrano to use the blue and white flag as the flag of the Army of the North.|$|E
