25|$|There {{are four}} ratings of {{plug and socket}} in BS546, (2A, 5A, 15A and 30A). Each has the same general {{appearance}} but they are different physical sizes to prevent interchangeability, they use pin spacing which is also different from the <b>two</b> <b>pin</b> plugs specified in BS 372, so earthed plugs will not fit into unearthed sockets, and vice versa. Plugs fitted with BS646 fuses have been optional since the original BS546:1934 with maximum fuse ratings of 2A in the 2A plug, and 5A in the 5A, 15A and 30A plugs. In practice most BS546 plugs are unfused with fused versions being unusual and expensive.|$|E
500|$|In 1946, a joint Soviet-Mongolian {{expedition}} to the Gobi Desert in the Mongolian Ömnögovi Province turned up a large theropod skull and some vertebrae in the Nemegt Formation. In 1955, Evgeny Maleev, a Soviet paleontologist, made this specimen the holotype (PIN 551-1) of a new species, which he called Tyrannosaurus bataar. The specific name is a misspelling of the Mongolian баатар/baatar ("hero"). In the same year, Maleev also described and named three new theropod skulls, each associated with skeletal remains discovered by the same expedition in 1948 and 1949. The first of these (PIN 551-2) was named Tarbosaurus efremovi, a new generic name composed of the Ancient Greek ταρβος/tarbos ("terror", [...] "alarm", [...] "awe", or [...] "reverence") and σαυρος/sauros ("lizard"), and the species named after Ivan Yefremov, a Russian paleontologist and science fiction author. The other <b>two</b> (<b>PIN</b> 553-1 and PIN 552-2) were also named as new species and assigned to the North American genus Gorgosaurus (G. lancinator and G. novojilovi, respectively). All three of these latter specimens are smaller than the first.|$|E

40|$|Aim : {{several studies}} have shown that supracondylar {{fractures}} could be treated with two or three lateral pins. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the stability of lateral <b>pinning</b> with <b>two</b> or three <b>pins</b> with <b>two</b> <b>pins</b> bridged with a small non-invasive device, which would allow the operator to use only <b>two</b> <b>pins</b> instead of three. Methods : fifteen synthetic humerus were cut at the level of the center of the olecranon fossea to simulate supracondylar fractures. All the samples were fixed with parallel pins (Kirschner, diameter 1. 6 mm) with lateral entry. Three different pins configurations were tested : <b>two</b> <b>pins,</b> <b>two</b> bridged <b>pins</b> and three pins. Each sample was tested in internal and external rotations using a MTS 809 axial / torsional Test System to measure the torsional stiffness and the torque needed to reach an angle of 10 degrees. A statistical analysis using the Student Law was performed. Results : configurations with <b>two</b> <b>pins,</b> bridged with the non-invasive device or not, had identical mechanical properties. The configurations with three pins demonstrated the following change in mechanical properties, respectively over <b>two</b> <b>pins</b> and over <b>two</b> bridged <b>pins</b> : an increase in internal torsional stiffness of 21. 2 % and 25. 3 %, an increase in external torsional stiffness of 15 % and 6. 8 %; concerning the maximum torque needed to reach an angle of 10 degrees, the increase for internal rotation was 15. 1 % and 16. 4 % and the increase for external rotation was 12. 4 % and 13. 3 %. The bridging device did not provide an increase in mechanical properties, which could have avoided the use of a third pin. However, this study showed that the third pin increased all four mechanical properties measured, increase that is needed to fix unstable reduced supracondylar fracture. Our samples showed a statistically significant result (P< 0. 05) for the torsional stiffness in external rotation between <b>two</b> and three <b>pins.</b> No statistical difference was made between <b>two</b> <b>pins</b> configurations. Clinical relevance : the opportunity to bridge <b>two</b> <b>pins</b> configuration with a small non-invasive device to reach a mechanical stability equivalent to a configuration with three pins would avoid one invasive pinning procedure and its iatrogenic complications...|$|R
