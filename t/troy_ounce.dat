5|$|Osmium {{is usually}} {{sold as a}} minimum 99.9% pure powder. Like other {{precious}} metals, it is measured by troy weight and by grams. Its price in 2012 was about $400 per <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> (or about $13,000 per kilogram), depending on the quantity and its supplier.|$|E
5|$|Political and {{financial}} problems led to very low {{oil prices and}} oversupply, causing most metals to drop in price. The economies of China, India and other emerging countries slowed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014 alone, 23,722,890 motor vehicles were produced in China, excluding motorbikes. This resulted in a rhodium price of 740.00 US-$ per <b>Troy</b> <b>ounce</b> (31.1 grams) in late November 2015.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1934, {{the price}} of silver in the United States was {{effectively}} set by the government as it would support that price through purchases and sales of the metal; in 1934 it was $.45 per <b>troy</b> <b>ounce.</b> In 1958, {{with the return of}} lend-lease bullion, the Treasury's stock of silver reached 2.1 billion troy ounces; it began to vend the metal at $.91 per ounce to the public, despite the warnings of the Conference of Western Governors that there was not enough silver to make these sales and maintain coinage operations.|$|E

The district also produced byproduct bismuth, and iron-manganese ore.|$|R
5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} catalytic converters in the automobile industry. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E
25|$|In numismatics, {{intrinsic}} value, {{also known}} as melt value, {{is the value of}} the metal, typically a precious metal, in a coin. For example, if gold trades in commercial markets at a price of US$1200 per fine <b>troy</b> <b>ounce,</b> then a coin minted from one <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> of fine gold would have an intrinsic value of US$1200.|$|E

They range in similar sizes as gold coins and come in 0.05 <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> {{all the way up to}} 1 <b>troy</b> <b>ounce.</b> Unlike gold coins, gold rounds have no additional metals added to them for durability purposes and do not have to be made by a government mint, which allows the gold rounds to have a lower overhead price as compared to gold coins. On the other hand, gold rounds are not as collectible as gold coins.|$|E

25|$|In March 1968, {{the effort}} to control the private market price of gold was abandoned. A two-tier system began. In this system all central-bank {{transactions}} in gold were insulated from the free market price. Central banks would trade gold among themselves at $35 per <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> (112.53 ¢/g) but would not trade with the private market. The private market could trade at the equilibrium market price {{and there would be}} no official intervention. The price immediately jumped to $43 per <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> (138.25 ¢/g). The price of gold touched briefly back at $35 (112.53 ¢/g) near the end of 1969 before beginning a steady price increase. This gold price increase turned steep through 1972 and hit a high that year of over $70 (2.25 $/g). By that time floating exchange rates had also begun to emerge, which indicated the de facto dissolution of the Bretton Woods system. The two-tier system was abandoned in November 1973. By then the price of gold had reached $100 per <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> (3.22 $/g).|$|E

50|$|In 2004, Russia {{repealed}} the {{law that}} kept PGM production data secret and, in 2005, repealed {{the law that}} kept PGM reserve data secret. The Government published reserve figures for its major PGM holdings at the Norilsk Nickel complex in 2005. Based on an independent audit carried out by Micon International Co. Ltd. according to the Australian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) Code, Norilsk Nickel’s reserves of combined proven and probable reserves of all six platinum group elements (iridium, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhodium and ruthenium) at Norilsk Nickel’s holdings in East Siberia as of December 31, 2004, were reported to be 81.791 million <b>troy</b> <b>ounces.</b> Proven and probable reserves were reported to be 62.183 million <b>troy</b> <b>ounces</b> of palladium and 15.993 million <b>troy</b> <b>ounces</b> of platinum with ore grades that ranged from 5.5 grams per metric ton (g/t) to 11.1 g/t. Measured and indicated mineral resources were reported to be an additional 141 million <b>troy</b> <b>ounces</b> of palladium and 40 million <b>troy</b> <b>ounces</b> of platinum. These reserves are adequate for Norilsk Nickel to maintain current levels of palladium and platinum production for more than 20 years.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the early}} silver discoveries, Colorado’s largest silver district, Leadville, was not {{discovered}} until 1874. Leadville {{was the largest}} silver-producing district in Colorado.

25|$|At {{the time}} of the 1702 London Mint Assay by Sir Isaac Newton, the silver content of British coinage was defined to be one <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> of {{sterling}} silver for 62 pence. Therefore, the value of the monetary pound sterling was equivalent to only 3.87 troy ounces of sterling silver. This was the standard from 1601 to 1816.|$|E
25|$|The London Gold Pool was the pooling of gold {{reserves}} {{by a group}} of eight central banks in the United States and seven European countries that agreed on 1 November 1961 to cooperate in maintaining the Bretton Woods System of fixed-rate convertible currencies and defending a gold price of US$35 per <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> by interventions in the London gold market.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} market rates were fixed, but were allowed adjustments when necessary and currencies {{were required to}} be convertible. For this purpose, all currencies had to be backed by either physical gold reserves, or a currency convertible into gold. The United States dollar was recognized as the world's reserve currency, as the anchor currency of the system. The price of one <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> of gold was pegged to US$35.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, Alaska was the nation's leading silver-producing state. Two Alaska mines were {{significant}} silver producers. The Greens Creek mine, owned by Hecla Mining, produced 8,452,153 <b>troy</b> <b>ounces</b> of silver.

At {{the end of the}} 19th century, the Indian silver rupee went onto a gold exchange standard at a fixed rate of one rupee to one shilling and fourpence in British currency, i.e. 15 rupees to 1 pound sterling.|$|E
25|$|The sudden jump in {{the price}} of gold after the demise of the Bretton Woods accords was a result of the {{significant}} prior debasement of the US dollar due to excessive inflation of the monetary supply via central bank (Federal Reserve) coordinated fractional reserve banking under the Bretton Woods partial gold standard. In the absence of an international mechanism tying the dollar to gold via fixed exchange rates, the dollar became a pure fiat currency and as such fell to its free market exchange price versus gold. Consequently, the price of gold rose from $35 per <b>troy</b> <b>ounce</b> (1.125 $/g) in 1969 to almost $500 (29 $/g) in 1980.|$|E
