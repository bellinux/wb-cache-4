40|$|There is, practically, {{imperfect}} {{communication network}} (e. g., time delay and packet loss/switching) in haptic interaction (or teleoperation) systems.

We hypothesis that as an imperfectness level in the communication network is increasing, the <b>teleoperator's</b> performance is decreasing monotonically. In this paper, we verified the hypothesis via a human-centered evaluation of the <b>teleoperator's</b> perceptual performance in terms of just noticeable difference (JND), point of subject equality (PSE), and perception time using two psychophysical experiments: experiment of packet separation time and experiment of packet loss. In the experiment of packet separation time, there were significant increases of JND and PSE as the packet separation time was increased. However, interestingly, there was no significant decrease of <b>teleoperator's</b> perceptual performance in the experiment of packet loss although the packet loss rate was increased until 75. The experimental results clearly shows that the packet separation time affects on the <b>teleoperator's</b> perceptual performance more than the packet loss rate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} the maneuverability performance of human <b>teleoperators</b> on multi-robots. First, we propose that maneuverability performance {{can be assessed}} by a frequency response function that jointly considers the input force of the operator and the position errors of the multi-robot system that is being maneuvered. Doing so allows us to evaluate maneuverability performance {{in terms of the}} human <b>teleoperator’s</b> interaction with the controlled system. This allowed us to effectively determine the suitability of different haptic cue algorithms in improving teleoperation maneuverability. Performance metrics based on the human <b>teleoperator’s</b> frequency response function indicate that maneuverability performance is best supported by a haptic feedback algorithm which is based on an obstacle avoidance force.

40|$|Effective {{training}} {{is essential for}} human <b>teleoperators</b> to deliver satisfactory performance in actual tasks. Teleoperation is naturally a very difficult task due {{to the absence of}} naked-eye vision that cripples the cog-nitive behavior of the remote operator.

How-ever, training with naked-eye vision feedback may help human <b>teleoperators</b> to learn how to deliver satisfac-tory performance when they actually interact with camera vision. This study was carried out to fur-ther investigate this hypothesis, and to quantitatively supplement it with experimental proofs. For this cause, the recently built telerobotic test-bed between KAIST(Korea) and Saga University(Japan) was re-shaped to a telerobotic mini-golf system, which is the trial experiment in this study. The performance of the players with and without naked-eye training was com-pared and quantitatively evaluated.

Martin Marietta won the contract for $26 million to design the apparatus. TRS would contain about three tons of propellant. The remote-controlled booster had TV cameras and was designed for duties such as space construction and servicing and retrieving satellites the shuttle could not reach. After rescuing Skylab, the TRS would have remained in orbit for future use. Alternatively, it could have been used to de-orbit Skylab for a safe, controlled re-entry and destruction.|$|E

50|$|A {{telemanipulator}} (or <b>teleoperator)</b> is {{a device}} that is controlled remotely by a human operator. If such a device {{has the ability to}} perform autonomous work, it is called a telerobot. If the device is completely autonomous, it is called a robot. In simple cases the controlling operator's command actions correspond directly to actions in the device controlled, as for example in a radio controlled model aircraft or a tethered deep submergence vehicle. Where communications delays make direct control impractical (such as a remote planetary rover), or it is desired to reduce operator workload (as in a remotely controlled spy or attack aircraft), the device will not be controlled directly, instead being commanded to follow a specified path. At increasing levels of sophistication the device may operate somewhat independently in matters such as obstacle avoidance, also commonly employed in planetary rovers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Teleoperator</b> Retrieval System was {{a robotic}} {{spacecraft}} {{designed to be}} capable of remote payload observation and boosting or de-orbiting another spacecraft, and it was developed to potentially re-boost Skylab space station to a higher orbit. After the third manned mission to Skylab, plans were made to boost the station into a higher orbit to extend its service life or to de-orbit it into a remote ocean area. [...] A remotely controlled booster rocket was to be carried up in the Space Shuttle's third mission. Astronaut Jack R. Lousma described the remote booster as [...] "as big as a truck" [...] and requiring a control system able to match the circular motion of the Skylab docking port. The core of TRS was a propulsion system that could accommodate additional fuel modules. It had a 24 nozzle 6-axis control thruster system to support Space rendezvous, docking, and orienting the spacecraft.|$|E

This {{would have been a}} 20-day mission to boost Skylab to a higher altitude and do more scientific experiments. [...] Another plan was to use a <b>Teleoperator</b> Retrieval System (TRS) launched aboard the Space Shuttle (then under development), to robotically re-boost the orbit. When Skylab 5 was cancelled, it was expected Skylab would stay in orbit until the 1980s, which enough time to overlap with the beginning of Shuttle launches. Other options for launching TRS included the Titan III and Atlas Agena. None of these options received the level of effort and funding needed for execution before Skylab's sooner-than-expected re-entry. Skylab's internal systems were evaluated and tested from the ground, and effort was put into plans for re-using it, as late as 1978.|$|E
40|$|Para sistematizar a produção, majorar a produtividade, suprimir gastos e economizar tempo, empresas aderiram ao telemarketing, {{principal}} atividade terceirizada no Brasil e uma das maiores empregadoras do país (665 mil teleoperadores). Todavia, doenças desencadeadas pela atividade laboral são freqüentes em teleoperadores, fato que tem motivado empresas a buscarem recursos no próprio ambiente laboral, como a implementação de uma sala de descanso para seus funcionários, para atender ao recém aprovado Anexo II, da Norma Regulamentadora 17, que instituiu a obrigatoriedade da realização do intervalo para refeição/descanso fora do posto de trabalho. O presente trabalho teve por objetivo verificar, junto a teleoperadores e supervisores de telemarketing, o uso da sala de descanso implementada na empresa e suas opiniões sobre a relação entre uso e afastamentos por motivo de saúde, promovendo uma intersecção entre Psicologia Ambiental e Direito Ambiental do Trabalho. Realizou-se, primeiramente, um estudo piloto com 15 teleoperadores (10 mulheres e 5 homens) e 1 advogado da empresa, resultando em algumas alterações no questionário para teleoperadores. Participaram da pesquisa, fora do ambiente e expediente de trabalho: 80 teleoperadores (48 mulheres e 32 homens), 56 % entre 18 - 25 anos; 73 % solteiros; 59 % do turno manhã/manhã-tarde; 74 % sem ou cursando nível superior, sendo 39 % de indicações de ensino médio completo e 35 % de ensino superior incompleto; 56 % iniciaram na atividade de telemarketing entre 2004 - 2007 e, nesse mesmo período, 60 % ingressaram nessa empresa em que atualmente trabalham; e três supervisores de telemarketing do sexo masculino, entre 26 - 28 anos, nível superior completo, turno M/M-T, dois solteiros e um casado, contratados entre 2000 - 2001. Evidenciou-se que: (1) tanto teleoperadores (97 %) como supervisores (100 %) consideram a atividade parcialmente ou plenamente estressante; (2) durante as curtas pausas, a maioria freqüentemente permanece no refeitório (teleoperadores 71 %, supervisores 100 %); (3) seja antes (50 %), durante (43 %) ou após o expediente de trabalho (74 %), a maioria nunca utiliza a sala de descanso; (4) relaxamento (41 %) e interação (teleoperadores 31 %, supervisores 100 %) são as atividades mais realizadas pelos teleoperadores, quando do uso da sala; (5) cerca da metade dos teleoperadores (53 %) nunca se afastaram, embora 75 % dos supervisores indicassem certa freqüência de afastamentos na empresa, porém 60 % dos participantes entraram na empresa entre 2004 - 2007; (6) a maioria atribui fatores positivos à sala (76 %) e acredita em sua influência na saúde e bem-estar (teleoperadores 84 %, supervisores 75 %); (7) 67 % dos teleoperadores e 100 % dos supervisores julgam necessário ou relevante a implementação de políticas de saúde na empresa, para estimular o uso da sala de descanso e reduzir afastamentos por doenças ocupacionais. Em suma, os resultados evidenciaram o não uso dessa sala de descanso por diversos fatores (ambientais, cultuais, sociais e econômicos), embora os participantes a considerem relevante para a questão da saúde do trabalhador, sugerindo a necessidade de se repensar este espaço, bem como a organização do trabalho, observando-se as sugestões dos participantes apontadas neste estudo, como recreação e interação, atividades que se contrapõem às características rígidas e penosas do telemarketing. (CAPES/CNPq) To systematize the production, increase productivity, eliminate {{costs and}} save time, companies has joined to telemarketing, the main activity outsourced in Brazil {{and one of}} the largest employers in the country (665 thousand <b>teleoperators).</b> However, occupational diseases are common in this context, motivating firms to seek resources in this own workplace, such as the implementation of a quiet room for its employees, to mut the newly approved Anexo II, of the Norma Regulamentadora 17 (rule), wich established the obligatory completion of break for meal/rest off workplace. This study aimed to check, next to the <b>teleoperators</b> and supervisors of telemarketing, the use, for <b>teleoperators,</b> of the quiet room implemented in the company and its opinions about relation between use and removal for reason of health, proposing an intersection between Environmental Psychology and Enviromental Labour Law. There was a pilot study with 15 <b>teleoperators</b> (ten women and five men) and a lawyer of the company, resulting in some changes in the final questionnaire for <b>teleoperators.</b> Participated on the survey, out of the company and expediency of work, 80 teleoperators: 48 women and 32 men; 56 % between 18 - 25 years; 73 % single; 59 % of the turn morning/morning-late; 74 % without or taking higher level, with 39 % of indications of complete average education and 35 % of incomplete higher education; between 2004 - 2007, 56 % had started in the activity of telemarketing and 60 % joined the company in wich they work. Three male supervisors had also participated, between 26 - 28 years, higher level complete, turn morning/late-morning, two singles and one married, recruited between 2000 - 2001. The results showed {{no significant differences between the}} <b>teleoperators</b> (sex/shift of work) and had showed that: (1) 97 % of the <b>teleoperators</b> and all the three supervisors had considered the activity partially or fully shessful; (2) during short breaks, 71 % of the <b>teleoperators</b> had indicated the frequent use of the cafeteria, also indicated for the three supervisors; (3) the majority of the <b>teleoperators</b> never uses the quiet room, either before (50 %), during (43 %) or after hours of work expedient (74 %); (4) when the use of the room, activities were held more relaxing (indicated by 40 % of the <b>teleoperators)</b> and interaction (indicated by 29 % of the <b>teleoperators</b> and two supervisors); (5) 54 % of the <b>teleoperators</b> has never moved away for health reason, however two supervisors had indicated frequent removals and one, sometimes; (6) 84 % of the <b>teleoperators</b> and two supervisors had indicated the influence of the use of the quiet room in health; (7) 67 % of the <b>teleoperators</b> and all the supervisors had judged necessary or relevant the implementation of politics of health in the company, to stimulate use of the quiet room and reduce injuries by occupational diseases. In conclusion, although the results showing the non-use by <b>teleoperators</b> of the quiet room, which had the many factors (environmental, personal, cultural, social, economic, etc.), the participants had considered it excellent for the health of the worker, suggesting the need to reflect about this space and the organization of the work, in compliance with the suggestions of participants, such as the need for recreation and interaction, activities no common on the rigid and heavy context of telemarketing.
