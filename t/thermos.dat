5|$|The American <b>Thermos</b> Bottle Company Laurel Hill Plant is {{historically}} significant {{as the primary}} factory {{for the production of}} <b>Thermos</b> bottles that would allow the company to dominate in the world market. It is also historically significant {{as an example of the}} Norwich community coming together to attract the company and diversify the local industry. The plant was the primary factory where <b>Thermos</b> bottles were manufactured from raw materials between 1913 and 1984. The complex is architecturally significant as an example of late-19th century and early 20th century industrial mill design being adapted for new industry. The American <b>Thermos</b> Bottle Company Laurel Hill Plant was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Human Resources and Research and Development {{buildings}} were originally constructed around 1912 by the MacKay Copper Process Company. The property was acquired in 1923 by the <b>Thermos</b> Company following the foreclosure of the MacKay company. The Human Resources building {{was used by}} the enameling department until its conversion in 1948. The Research and Development building was previously the Engineering building. A one-story hipped frame gatehouse was constructed in the 1920s. The Carpenter Shop (Building 62) was constructed in 1926. The <b>Thermos</b> factory completed construction of a storage building in 1929 (Building 2) and another storage building in 1941 (Building 1). Glass House 1 (Building 5) was constructed in 1939 and incorporates a warehouse dating from 1930 into its construction. Glass House 2 was constructed in 1951 and is connected to the Manufacturing Building by a conveyor.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a <b>Thermos</b> flask).|$|E

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (<b>thermos),</b> meaning hot.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a <b>thermos</b> of eggnog.|$|E
25|$|The No. 73 grenade, {{also known}} as the <b>Thermos,</b> Woolworth bomb, or hand {{percussion}} grenade, was a British anti-tank grenade used during the Second World War. It got its nickname from the resemblance to a <b>Thermos</b> flask.|$|E
25|$|Some {{other objects}} that may conduct sparks are plastic/holographic print <b>thermoses</b> (such as Starbuck's novelty cups) or cups with metal lining. If any {{bit of the}} metal is exposed, all the outer shell will burst off the object or melt.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} transport, natural gas is cooled down to approximately [...] at atmospheric pressure, {{at which point the}} gas condenses to a liquid. The tanks on board an LNG carrier effectively function as giant <b>thermoses</b> to keep the liquid gas cold during storage. No insulation is perfect, however, and so the liquid is constantly boiling during the voyage.|$|R
50|$|This {{can also}} be done by using {{reusable}} items such as <b>thermoses</b> for daily coffee or plastic containers for water and other cold beverages rather than disposable ones. If that option isn't available, {{it is best to}} properly recycle the disposable items after use. When one household recycles at least half of their household waste, they can save 1.2 tons of carbon dioxide annually.|$|R
25|$|In Uruguay, people {{commonly}} {{walk around}} the streets toting a mate and a <b>thermos</b> with hot water. In some parts of Argentina, gas stations sponsored by yerba mate producers provide free hot water to travelers, specifically {{for the purpose of}} drinking during the journey. Disposable mate sets with a plastic mate and straw and sets with a <b>thermos</b> flask and stacking containers for the yerba and sugar inside a fitted case are available.|$|E

[...] He also mentions nearby Benacre, Lowestoft and Covehithe.|$|R
50|$|Senga solicits the {{assistance}} of a police officer, but when she seems unhelpful, goes after the RV herself, tailing the officer who had just left the diner. The police office meets up with the inhabitants of the RV. Senga breaks into their RV and discovers a number of strange and horrifying things, including <b>thermoses</b> full of blood and videos of young girls talking about their past lives. She escapes the RV before anyone returns, but once back on the road, The Backpacker reveals herself to be hiding in the backseat. She strangles Senga, causing her to crash.|$|R
25|$|A {{recently}} built landmark is Arctura, {{named after}} Jämtland's provincial star Arcturus, a large hot water accumulator tank.

25|$|The basic {{trick in}} a solar water heating {{system is to}} use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are vacuum- insulated, acting {{something}} like large <b>thermos</b> bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the plane}} was broken into two pieces, it was immaculately preserved, with {{functioning}} machine guns, a working radio, and some supplies of food and water. A <b>thermos</b> of tea {{was found to be}} drinkable. No human remains were found on board the aircraft nor in the surrounding crash site, nor were parachutes found. Evidence aboard the plane indicated that the men had bailed out. Records in the log of navigator Lieutenant Hays, who was on his very first combat mission, ended at Naples.|$|E

5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee <b>thermoses</b> scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|R
50|$|It is {{here where}} John {{inquires}} {{as to how}} the ice-nine came into Papa Monzano's possession. The Hoenikkers explain that when they were young, their father would riddle them with the concept of ice-nine. One day, they find their father has died taking a break from freezing and unfreezing ice-nine to test its properties. With the sweep of a cloth, Frank Hoenikker collects residual amounts of ice-nine from a cooking pan, as was the various collection and examination methods of their father when creating the substance. A dog licks the cloth and also instantly freezes. Witnessing this, the young Hoenikkers finally deduce the properties of ice-nine. They collectively cannot determine who had what part in gathering the ice-nine, but chunks of the substance were chipped from the cooking pan supply and placed in mason jars then later in <b>thermoses.</b> The Hoenikkers explain that this is how they had become fortunate throughout their lives, each one selling off the substance to various buyers.|$|R

25|$|It is {{prepared}} by steeping dried leaves of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis, known in Portuguese as erva-mate) {{in hot water}} and is served with a metal straw from a shared hollow calabash gourd. The straw is called a bombilla in Spanish, a bomba in Portuguese, and a bombija or, more generally, a masassa (straw) in Arabic. The straw is traditionally made of silver. Modern, commercially available straws are typically made of nickel silver, called alpaca; stainless steel, or hollow-stemmed cane. The gourd {{is known as a}} mate or a guampa; while in Brazil, it has the specific name of cuia, or also cabaça (the name for Indigenous-influenced calabash gourds in other regions of Brazil, still used for general food and drink in remote regions). Even if the water is supplied from a modern <b>thermos,</b> the infusion is traditionally drunk from mates or cuias.|$|E
25|$|The key patents {{having to}} do with natural gas {{liquefaction}} were in 1915 and the mid-1930s. In 1915 Godfrey Cabot patented a method for storing liquid gases at very low temperatures. It consisted of a <b>Thermos</b> bottle type design which included a cold inner tank within an outer tank; the tanks being separated by insulation. In 1937 Lee Twomey received patents for a process for large scale liquefaction of natural gas. The intention was to store natural gas as a liquid so it could be used for shaving peak energy loads during cold snaps. Because of large volumes it is not practical to store natural gas, as a gas, near atmospheric pressure. However, if it can be liquefied it can be stored in a volume 600 times smaller. This is a practical way to store it but the gas must be stored at −260°F (−162°C).|$|E

50|$|As {{with food}} {{supplies}} and clothing, {{the availability of}} housewares went through several stages. Simple, inexpensive household items, like <b>thermoses,</b> cooking pans, and clocks were stocked in department stores and other retail outlets all over China from the 1950s on. Relatively expensive consumer durables became available more gradually. In the 1960s production and sales of bicycles, sewing machines, wristwatches, and transistor radios grew {{to the point that}} these items became common household possessions, followed in the late 1970s by television sets and cameras. In the 1980s supplies of furniture and electrical appliances increased along with family incomes. Household survey data indicated that by 1985 most urban families owned two bicycles, at least one sofa, a writing desk, a wardrobe, a sewing machine, an electric fan, a radio, and a television. Virtually all urban adults owned wristwatches, half of all families had washing machines, 10 percent had refrigerators, and over 18 percent owned color televisions. Rural households on average owned about half the number of consumer durables owned by urban dwellers. Most farm families had 1 bicycle, about half had a radio, 43 percent owned a sewing machine, 12 percent had a television set, and about half the rural adults owned wristwatches.|$|R
5000|$|... 32. Class Trip Calamity - It's {{the end of}} {{the school}} year, and the entire seventh grade is embarking on a class trip to Ellis Island. Everyone is excited. Shortly beforehand, the city of Bridgeport had {{approved}} a plan to turn Wakeman Junior High into a middle school, sending the eighth graders to high school next year, and therefore, making the seventh-graders the upper class. Shawnie Pendergast has a party to celebrate this the next night, and a few kids decide to make a toast, drinking champagne. There's a little bit of opposition, but in the end, nearly everyone participates. For the class trip, some students wind up sneaking alcohol in their <b>thermoses.</b> Jana and her friends do not take part, but Laura McCall does and she gets very sick inside the Statue of Liberty and the ruse is uncovered. The school deals with those who were drinking on an individual basis. Since Jana has not heard from her father in a while, she believes her father has gone back to drinking, with his new wife encouraging it. Later on, she receives a letter from him, stating that he was busy, and that he and his wife are expecting a baby, and that his wife wants Jana to come see them after he's born.|$|R
