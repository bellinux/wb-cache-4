5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been <b>trussed</b> once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two spans, 64.1 feet and 81.10 feet, with a 3.2 feet gap between them. The combined <b>trussed</b> portions of the bridge are 149.1 feet long. The bridge's Town lattice is an unusual design choice, but the later addition of the queen trusses are also unusual, resulting in a unique visual appearance by the bridge's unequal spans. This gives the appearance of kingposts within the queenposts. Since {{the addition of the}} steel I-beam flooring in 1973, the trusses have supported nothing but themselves. The State of Connecticut's lists the bridge as CT 1338 and the May 2012 inspection of the bridge found the deck and superstructure conditions to be satisfactory and condition of the substructure to be fair. The West Cornwall Covered bridge has been appraised as functionally obsolete.|$|E

5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has <b>trussed</b> the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 This study {{presents}} a practical method to model an actual Metal-Plate- Connected (MPC) roof <b>truss</b> assembly using a commercial program, SAP 2000, to investigate its system performance. <b>Truss</b> assembly modeling was examined because the conventional single <b>truss</b> design method ignores system effects, such as variability of {{modulus of elasticity}} (MOE), interaction of sub-assemblies, realistic boundary conditions, etc. Two types of semi-rigid MPC joint models, linear spring (LS) joint model and a <b>truss</b> plate manufacturer's (TPM's) joint model, {{were used for the}} <b>truss</b> and <b>truss</b> assembly models. To verify the <b>truss</b> models using the LS joint model, the predicted deflections of individual <b>trusses</b> and the load sharing of nine-truss roof assembly models were compared with experimental results from the literature. Fourteen individual <b>trusses</b> (the components of the actual roof <b>truss</b> assembly) using TPM's joint models were also verified by comparing the Combined Stress Index (CSI) values with the CSI values provided by the TPM. Both design and one set of random material properties were used in the analysis of the actual roof <b>truss</b> assembly model. The predictions for <b>truss</b> models using the LS joint model for <b>truss</b> deflections and load sharing effect agree with the experimental results. The CSI values for individual <b>trusses</b> with the TPM's joint model matched the CSI values provided by the TPM. The load distribution in an actual roof <b>truss</b> assembly is strongly influenced by the interaction of sub-assemblies and by the boundary conditions. In the <b>truss</b> assembly, the prediction of location and value of maximum CSI are different from those for the single <b>truss.</b> The <b>truss</b> with the maximum CSI value of 0. 91 among fourteen individual <b>truss</b> types decreased to 0. 52 and 0. 51 when this <b>truss</b> is in the assembly with design and random material properties, respectively.

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Trusses</b> are {{suitable}} load-bearing structural systems for heavy concentrated loads. In this paper, it is {{shown that it}} is possible to use active control mechanisms to enhance the load-bearing capacity of the <b>trusses.</b> Under heavy loading, some elements of a <b>truss</b> might experience high stresses and show non-linear behavior, resulting in large deformations in the <b>truss.</b> Under such a condition, some elements of the <b>truss</b> might damage which can lead to the collapse of the <b>truss.</b> Application of control forces on some of the degrees of freedom of the <b>truss</b> can render help the <b>truss</b> tolerate larger forces before its collapse. A neural network can then be trained to learn the relationship between the information about the external loads on the <b>truss,</b> as input, and the required control forces, as output, and act as a neuro-controller for the <b>truss.</b> This method is explained and then tested on a small <b>truss</b> to show the capabilities of the method...|$|R
