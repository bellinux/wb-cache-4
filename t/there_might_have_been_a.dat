25|$|In the United Kingdom Chancellor's budget {{statement}} of November 2016, {{it was announced}} that the Trust was to receive a grant of £7.6million for restoration work; the Chancellor noted a claim that the property had been Jane Austen's inspiration for Pemberley in her novel Pride and Prejudice. It was thought that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> connection to the house because Austen uses the name Fitzwilliam in her novel, but following the Chancellor's Autumn Statement the Jane Austen Society dismissed the likelihood that Austen had had the house in mind, given the absence of any evidence that she had visited the estate.|$|E

50|$|Metaphysical {{nihilism}} is {{the philosophical}} theory that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> no objects at all—that is, {{that there is}} a possible world in which there are no objects at all; or at least that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> no concrete objects at all, so that even if every possible world contains some objects, {{there is at least one}} that contains only abstract objects.|$|R

25|$|Though {{there is}} no doubt that the {{demographic}} crisis of the 14th century caused a dramatic fall in production and commerce in absolute terms, there has been a vigorous historical debate over whether the decline was greater than the fall in population. While the older orthodoxy held that the artistic output of the Renaissance was a result of greater opulence, more recent studies have suggested that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> so-called 'depression of the Renaissance'. In spite of convincing arguments for the case, the statistical evidence is simply too incomplete for a definite conclusion to be made.|$|E
25|$|Irmenach {{belonged to}} the “Hinder” County of Sponheim and thus shared its history. In particular, its {{proximity}} to the Grevenburg (castle) often led to occupation by enemy armies, under which the villagers suffered greatly. In 1557, the Reformation was introduced into Irmenach, as it was throughout the County. Ever since, Irmenach has been an Evangelical (Lutheran) community. Nevertheless, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> few families who were under Electoral-Trier serfdom and who therefore remained Catholic, even if– unlike what happened in other municipalities– a simultaneum was never instituted at the church. Only in recent times has the Catholic share of the population grown somewhat with newcomers.|$|E
25|$|At Western discovery, Kiritimati was uninhabited. As {{on other}} Line Islands <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> small or {{temporary}} native population, most probably Polynesian traders and settlers, {{who would have}} found the island a useful replenishing station on the long voyages from the Society Islands to Hawaiʻi, perhaps as early as AD 400. This trade route was apparently used with some regularity by about AD 1000. From 1200 onwards Polynesian long-distance voyages became less frequent, and had there been human settlement on Kiritimati, {{it would have been}} abandoned in the early-mid second millennium AD. Two possible village sites and some stone structures of these early visitors have been located. Today, most inhabitants are Micronesians, and Gilbertese is the only language of any significance. English is generally understood, but little used outside the tourism sector.|$|E

25|$|In the 1940s, {{a service}} trench had been {{excavated}} {{in the adjacent}} Bellefield Road by workmen, who revealed pieces of Romano-British pottery. Archaeologist A. Eldridge published this discovery in the Archaeologica Cantiana journal, suggesting that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> building dating to Roman Britain nearby. In the 1960s, local archaeologists decided to test this theory by investigating the derelict site at Fordcroft following the demolition of the houses on that site. Test excavation {{took place at the}} site from July 1965, sponsored by Orpington Museum, under the authority of the London Borough of Bromley, to whom the site legally belonged. The borough council provided a mechanical digger to remove surface rubble, allowing excavation to commence. Much of the investigation was organised by M. Bowen, curator of Orpington Museum, where the site finds were initially stored.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of future NY17F {{was divided into}} multiple parts, the {{construction of}} the road between Addison village and the hamlet of Rathbone and one between Rathbone and the town of Canisteo. The first section constructed was the stretch between Addison and Rathbone, with construction beginning in 1921. The contract was signed to Frank J. Foote, Inc for construction of the new road. By October 1921, the new road was constructed a mile (1.6km) from the village of Addison to Baldwin Cemetery. The project was not without its controversy. In July 1922, six workers went on strike after the contractor did not meet their demands to raise wages from 35 an hour to 40. The strikers amounting to six would make it appear to the contractor that a change of heart was had by most of the workers. The company stated that if they all had struck, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> raise in wage, but not with the lack of workers. The new road was about complete in August1922, {{with the exception of the}} tarva top that would go on the roads. By August 10, the road was completed with a speculated opening date of September 1, 1922. By November1922, the road was open to traffic.|$|E

On the whole I think our team played very well but of course it is a shame we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes."

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Tchaikovsky's {{music has}} also varied but also improved over time.

[...] Of the foreign critics who did not care for his music, Eduard Hanslick lambasted the Violin Concerto as a musical composition [...] "whose stink one can hear" [...] and William Forster Abtrop wrote of the Fifth Symphony, [...] "The furious peroration sounds like {{nothing so much as a}} horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker.

[...] He went on to question the song's inclusion—"In an episode about confronting one's greatest teenage insecurities, I wonder if <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> better choice for a solo than the popular football player with the cheerleader girlfriend lamenting his inability to dance"—and ultimately gave the performance a [...] "B−". Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: [...] "In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever imagine this song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1918 {{he met the}} French poet Raymond Radiguet. They collaborated extensively, socialized, and {{undertook}} many journeys and vacations together. Cocteau {{also got}} Radiguet exempted from military service. Admiring of Radiguet's great literary talent, Cocteau promoted his friend's works in his artistic circle and arranged for the publication by Grasset of Le Diable au corps (a largely autobiographical story of an adulterous relationship between a married woman and a younger man), exerting his influence to have the novel awarded the [...] "Nouveau Monde" [...] literary prize. Some contemporaries and later commentators thought <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> romantic component to their friendship.

2500|$|In June 1936 Churchill {{organised}} a deputation {{of senior}} Conservatives who shared his concern to see Baldwin, Chamberlain, and Halifax.

[...] As it was the meeting achieved little, Baldwin arguing that the Government was doing all it could given the anti-war feeling of the electorate.

2500|$|Another {{problem with}} the figures is that those numbers were drawn from {{a period of about}} 20 to 30 years, mostly from 1890 to 1915. German {{official}} figures representing the Armenian population within the Empire were about 1.9 million to 2 million. side of 1.8 million. Ludovic de Contenson, present the figure of 1,150,000 for Asiatic Turkey, and call them “statistics” without any sources. His numbers suggest that they might actually be the Ottoman census statistics, without correction. Another problem arises, and it {{is the fact that the}} Ottoman census statistics have maintained constant increase for the Armenian population from the period where between 1894–1897, an estimated [...] 100,000 to 300,000 Armenians lost their lives during the Hamidian massacres. While the minimum in the range represent the Armenian increases of population over years, the 1905 census hasn't shown any anomaly of Armenian increases, which suggest that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> fixed quota of Armenian population, and that regardless of the census, there were much more Armenians within the Empire. Another element that add, is that many Armenians, like many Jews and Christians, were considered as foreigners, because they had foreign nationalities or enjoyed the protection of foreign consulates and those for were not counted in those census statistics.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1936, Churchill {{organised}} a deputation {{of senior}} Conservatives to see Baldwin, Inskip and Halifax. There had been {{demands for a}} Secret Session of the House and the senior ministers agreed to meet the deputation rather than listen to a potential four-hour speech by Churchill. He had tried to have delegates from the other two parties and later wrote, [...] "If {{the leaders of the}} Labour and Liberal oppositions had come with us <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> political situation so intense as to enforce remedial action." [...] Robert Rhodes James writes that this is [...] "not quite the impression" [...] given by the documentary record of the meetings of 28–29 July, and another meeting in November. Churchill's figures for the size of the Luftwaffe, leaked to him by Ralph Wigram at the Foreign Office, were less accurate than those of the Air Ministry and he believed that the Germans were preparing to unleash thermite bombs [...] "the size of an orange" [...] on London. Ministers stressed that Hitler's intentions were unclear, and the importance of maximising Britain's long-term economic strength through exports, whereas Churchill wanted 25–30 percent of British industry to be brought under state control for purposes of rearmament. Baldwin argued that the important thing had been to win the election to get [...] "a perfectly free hand" [...] for rearmament.
