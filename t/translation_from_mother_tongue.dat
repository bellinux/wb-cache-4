40|$|Translating is a {{complicated}} task as it involves two different languages with two different systems. To produce a good translation product a translator should have good translation competence. Translation competence consists of several sub-competencies, among which is the linguistic mastery of the two languages. The more a translator is linguistically qualified, the better the translation is expected. So, {{it is assumed that}} in the case of students of a foreign language, some linguistic errors would normally be found in their <b>translation</b> <b>from</b> the <b>mother</b> <b>tongue</b> as the source language to the foreign language as the target language, which may affect the quality of their translation. This paper presents the common linguistic errors EFL students make in translating <b>from</b> their <b>mother</b> <b>tongue</b> to a foreign language, in this case from Indonesian to English. The data were taken <b>from</b> the Indonesian-English <b>Translation</b> course at the English Department of Universitas Negeri Semarang. The data show that none of the students‘ translation works are linguistically error free. The paper will describe the common linguistic errors the students make, which can serve as feedback for better teaching of Translation...|$|R

In the latter case, a student can opt to study an unofficial language such as French, German or Japanese as their <b>mother</b> <b>tongue.</b> Such situations are assessed on a case-by-case basis.|$|R

40|$|Namibia is {{a country}} where the {{official}} language has been English since independence in 1990. There are different national languages in the country and a majority of the people do not have English as a <b>mother</b> <b>tongue.</b> Nevertheless, the language of instruction from fourth grade and onwards is indeed English. Consequently, {{for the majority of the}} population the education is in their second language. What this essay explores is the role English as a second language has as a medium of instruction and the implications it may have. It is a minor field study that was carried out with the help of a scholarship from SIDA (Swedish Agency for International Development Cooperation) and it took place in a school in Northern Namibia, April and May 2007. It is a qualitative study that explores the use of English among teachers and students as well as the transition <b>from</b> <b>mother</b> <b>tongue</b> instruction to English instruction and the implications that this can have for the quality of education. The reality of the Namibian students that have to study and perform in a second language is questioned and discussed from pedagogical and linguistic points of view. The results show that most pupils do not speak English before starting fourth grade. Furthermore, the sudden transition <b>from</b> <b>mother</b> <b>tongue</b> to English instruction creates some descent in the participation of the pupils and possibly in the learning, not only of the new language but also of the content subjects. As far as the teachers concern, there are positive but ambiguous opinions among them concerning English as a medium of instruction...|$|R

A sample of error analysis in the written work of English second language learners at primary school level is undertaken. Errors resulting <b>from</b> <b>mother</b> <b>tongue</b> interference are identified at lexical, semantic, phonological and syntactical level. Various methods and approaches in the teaching of English are identified in accordance with their relevance to outcomes based education.
