5|$|He is {{credited}} with popularising a technical innovation in the printing of illustrations using wood. He adopted metal-engraving tools to cut hard boxwood across the grain, producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type, but were much more durable <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> woodcuts. The result was high-quality illustration at a low price.|$|E

5|$|Increasing costs: due {{to higher}} costs {{of fuel and}} insurance, and due to greater {{regulation}} requiring equipment such as new radios, {{or in some cases}} transponders, gliding costs have increased, although without the continuous use of engines and fuel, they are still considerably lower <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> power flying.|$|E
5|$|Moulds {{are built}} through two main methods: {{standard}} machining and EDM. Standard machining, in its conventional form, {{has historically been}} the method of building injection moulds. With technological developments, CNC machining became the predominant means of making more complex moulds with more accurate mould details in less time <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> methods.|$|E

5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern {{studies suggest that the}} battle was smaller and that both sides were more evenly matched <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted the morale of the Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} research documented intervention {{approach is the}} activation database guided EEG biofeedback approach, which has shown significant improvements in memory abilities of the TBI subject that are far superior <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> approaches (strategies, computers, medication intervention).

5|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E
5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. Although a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity pledges were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as service organizations rather <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. By the fall of 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E
5|$|By {{utilizing}} a short route and using mounted riders rather <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> stagecoaches, they proposed {{to establish a}} fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per , then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, {{but that did not}} come about.|$|E

5|$|Chapman's {{archipelago}} frigates provided better {{protection for}} their crew than the galleys they replaced, {{and up to}} three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water {{in all but the}} worst storms. They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet's firepower, provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E
5|$|Development of Life Is Strange {{began in}} April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both {{financial}} and creative. The developers conducted field {{research on the}} setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest, and subverted known archetypes to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and character arc serve as the central point in the game rather <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> graphic adventure tropes like point-and-click puzzles. The voice recording sessions took place in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Development of The Blair Witch Project {{began in}} 1993. While film {{students}} at the University of Central Florida, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez came across {{the idea for the}} film after realizing that they found documentaries on paranormal phenomena scarier <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> horror films. The two decided to create a film that combined the styles of both. After graduation, Myrick and Sánchez, along with Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie, and Michael Monello started the production company Haxan Films, derived from Benjamin Christensen's 1922 Swedish-Danish silent documentary horror film Häxan, whose English-language title is Witchcraft Through the Ages.|$|E

5|$|Developments in AspectJ have {{revealed}} {{the potential to}} incorporate just-in-time compilation into the execution of aspect-oriented code to address performance demands. At run-time, an aspect weaver could translate aspects in a more efficient manner <b>than</b> <b>traditional,</b> static weaving approaches. Using AspectJ on a Java Virtual Machine, dynamic weaving of aspects at run-time {{has been shown to}} improve code performance by 26%. While some implementations of just-in-time virtual machines implement this capability through a new virtual machine, some implementations can be designed to use features that already exist in current virtual machines. The requirement of a new virtual machine is contrary to one of the original design goals of AspectJ.|$|E
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Korn are {{identified}} as the pioneers of nu metal music, a form of alternative metal music {{which began in the}} mid-1990s. While generally considered an alternative metal and nu metal band, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, grunge, hard rock, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal, funk, hip-hop, groove, and dissonance. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather <b>than</b> <b>traditional</b> heavy metal themes. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world.|$|E
