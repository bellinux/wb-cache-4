They had an axle loading of 12 LT, and since the line had been {{designed}} for a maximum axle load of 8 LT, the bridges needed to be inspected with both railmotors upon them before they could be approved for use. When they were temporarily returned to the GWR for maintenance between October/November 1904 and January/February 1905, their replacements were nos. 19 & 21, {{which had been}} built in July/June 1904. In July 1905, one of the railmotors covered a duty which on Mondays to Saturdays began at 07:45 and ended at 19:52, covering 125 mi; it was supplemented on Thursdays and Saturdays by the other which began at 12:40 and finished work at 17:11, covering 52 mi. On Sundays just one railmotor was required, between 10:00 and 14:00. The highest speed attained by the railmotors was 23.1 mph, with an average speed of 22.2 mph. One railmotor could handle a <b>tail</b> <b>load</b> having not more than 28 wheels.

The horizontal-tail loads {{were found to be}} nonlinear with lift throughout the lift ranges tested at all Mach numbers except at a Mach number of 1. 00. The balancing tail loads reflected the changes which occur in the wing characteristics with increasing angle of attack.

No apparent effects of altitude on the balancing tail loads were evident over the comparable lift ranges of these tests at altitudes from 40, 000 feet to 15, 000 feet. Comparisons of balancing tail loads obtained from flight and windtunnel tests indicated discrepancies in absolute magnitudes, but the general trends of the data agree.
