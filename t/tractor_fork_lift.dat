5000|$|The {{regulations}} require {{employers to}} identify which of their employee's {{may be at risk}} from Hand Arm Vibration disorders (HAV) or whole body vibration disorders (WBV) [...] Hand Arm Vibration disorders can be caused by the use of hand-held power tools and can cause painful and disabling disorders of the blood vessels, nerves and joints. [...] The risk of suffering from a disorder is increased dependent on the exposure to vibration and can vary widely between individuals. The symptoms, which affect the blood supply, to the fingers are also known as vibration-induced white finger. [...] Whole Body Vibration is vibration which is transmitted via the seat when sitting down in a vehicle or machine or through the feet. Drivers of certain <b>tractors,</b> <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> trucks, quarrying or earth moving machinery could be exposed to WBV which could lead to back pain.|$|R
