Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the <b>trade-union</b> <b>movement</b> was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.|$|E

50|$|Kolkata was {{the capital}} of the British Indian Empire until 1911. Throughout British Raj, the city was a major port and {{commerce}} center in world economy. The Partition of India in 1947 was a major blow to the once flourishing economy during the world wars, it removed most of the hinterland, cutting down the supply of the human resource and a took away a huge portion of its market. Also the huge inflow of refugee from East Pakistan, Bihar, Jharkhand was a major drain to the city's infrastructure which was inadequate for the population boom. In the 1970s, the city saw a predominance of the <b>trade-union</b> <b>movements</b> which led the investors to flow out of the state to other newly emerging destinations in India. As the investors lacked trust in the newly formed communist government, the lack of capital destroyed most of its small-scale industries like foundrys and tool casting.|$|R

However, Hewitt was to serve in opposition only briefly before his retirement on 31 July 1976. Hewitt was not able to enjoy retirement however as he died a few months later on 22 November 1976. On his death the new Premier Neville Wran said of Hewitt during his condolence motion in the Legislative Assembly: [...] "He was a down-to-earth man and one who was well regarded, not only within the business world but also within the <b>trade-union</b> <b>movement.</b> Mac was a practical and realistic man.

5000|$|In {{comparison}} with traditional historical analysis of 20th-century European conflicts, {{the utility of}} the [...] "civil war" [...] concept has not been demonstrated. [...] the construct of a continental European [...] "civil war" [...] in the period has not yet completely explained the geographic coverage, the multiple causes of the subsets of conflicts within the historical period and geographical range of operations and effects. At least two historically understood national [...] "civil wars", the Russian Civil War (1917-1923) and the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), are among some of the internally conflicting arguments of the thesis. K. M. Panikkar's original range from 1914 to 1945 is among the chronological ranges proposed, but does not explain some of these problems, such as the ideological content of both the nationalist and communist movements, the decline or elimination of related monarchies, and the rise of national and transnational social democratic organizations (political parties and <b>trade-union</b> <b>movements)</b> in the period.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{submission}} {{builds on}} previous {{work by the}} author, conducted through a participant observation of the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) process (2002 - 2005). A typology of involved civil society actors, of their respective positions taken during the WSIS discussions, and of tensions between them, allowed to analyze {{the evolution of the}} WSIS participants configuration. This analysis has revealed a process of delegitimation of organized social actors, starting from WSIS 2 nd phase. This follow-up work has been conducted through the empirical analysis of exchanges on the mailing list of the Civil Society Internet Governance Caucus since the setting up of the UN Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in 2006. Additional data have been gathered from the discussions among some thematic IGF Dynamic Coalitions, as well as during the IGF open consultation processes, and the IGF meetings themselves. We show that the establishment of the IGF, its advisory committees and its rules of procedure have reinforced the participation, in their individual capacity, of various kind of “experts” (academics, consultants, [...] .). Instead of NGOs, <b>trade-unions</b> and social <b>movements,</b> it is the figure of the “policy entrepreneur” that has thus found its “window of opportunity”, in a context of a weakened role of the State. There is a need to better understand these transformations of civil society presenting itself as one of the “stakeholders” of the triad formed together with government and the private sector. Our thesis is that it should be analyzed through the prism of the individualistic and liberal vision of the civil society, as theorized by the Scottish Enlightenment philosophers (most notably Ferguson and Smith) and then by Hegel. The Gramscian perspective - at least in its dimension identifying “civil society” as an organized sphere, independent from the market and the State spheres, and autonomous with respect to them – might indeed not fit anymore such evolution. Furthermore, we show that these transformations deeply impact the definition and understanding of human rights, and of how they could translate in the information society context. “Communication Rights” were at the heart of heated debates during the WSIS first phase (2002 - 2003), most notably due to the involvement of organized civil society actors with strong and diverging viewpoints on how they should be defined (CRIS Campaign members, Civil Society Human Rights Caucus members, Media Caucus members). Research findings on the WSIS second phase (2003 - 2005), and even more since the establishment of the IGF, show a regression of the concerns related to socio-economic and development (or collective) rights, while the consensus may only be reached on some civil and political rights, namely freedom of expression and privacy, i. e. individual rights. In conclusion, we relate these two sets of findings (on the one hand a more individualistic form of civil society participation; on the other hand the emphasis put on individual rights) to the crisis of the Nation State, at least in its understanding of a welfare State, in a globalization context...|$|R
