5|$|Since the RAM and <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> on some {{generations of}} MacBook Pro are user {{serviceable}} parts, there are aftermarket modifications {{to enhance the}} system with up to 16GB of DDR3-1600 RAM (maximum capacity and frequency depend on the hardware in question), 7200-rpm hard drives or third party SSDs.|$|E
5|$|The {{polycarbonate}} Intel MacBook {{is easier}} for users to fix or upgrade than its predecessor. Where the iBook required substantial disassembly to access internal components such as <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive,</b> users only need to remove the battery and the RAM door to replace the MacBook drive. Apple provides do-it-yourself manuals for these tasks.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the iMac series of Macintoshes, the {{firmware}} was updated. The ROM was reduced in size to 1MB, called BootROM, and the remainder of the ROM was moved to the file Mac OS ROM in the Mac OS System Folder, stored on <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> This ROM used a full implementation of the OpenFirmware standard (contained in BootROM) and was named the New World ROM.|$|E

Files for Gatz disclosed a large number of emails, but none were relevant. Further, it was determined by the Expert that certain relevant emails identified by the Plaintiffs to be searched for were not found on <b>the</b> <b>Hard</b> <b>Drives</b> {{and that there was no}} proof of deletion found.|$|R

A {{spokesman for the}} ATF stated that agents were dispatched to the scene to assist and to help trace the weapons used. The FBI also sent agents to assist. According to police, Steven Kazmierczak removed <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> from his laptop computer and a computer chip from his cell phone and did not leave a note that could help explain why he chose a geology class on Valentine's Day to open fire.

When Mac, Parker, and Veronica go to the leader’s house, they find a woman, but he invites them in anyway. Veronica finds cages of rats in Bronson’s house, but he says that they showed up on his {{doorstep}} one day. Logan has sex with a surfer woman, and when the police show up at Bronson’s house to inquire after the stolen rats, they were gone. While investigating <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> of the lab’s computer, Mac finds leaves, which Veronica discovers are green tea. She shows them to the coworker, Emi, and discovers that Emi stole one of the monkey’s toys.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed on <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on server-side processing..|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} episode, Mahone and Michael {{are the only}} ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln {{to the other side of}} the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there is something wrong with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E

25|$|The {{recycling}} of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, {{and credit card}} numbers, which can be recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> Before recycling a computer, users should remove <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>drive,</b> or hard drives if {{there is more than}} one, and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E

25|$|The Mac Mini G4 uses {{a single}} 2.5-inch Ultra ATA/100 hard drive, {{which offers a}} maximum {{transfer}} rate of 100MB/s.

Smaller optical media do exist, such as business card CD-Rs which have the same dimensions as a credit card, and the slightly less convenient but higher capacity 8cm recordable MiniCD and MiniDVD.

This leaves just under 54GB of free space, rounded down to 53GB in the dashboard, for saving game files, Xbox Live Arcade downloadable content, and media files (such as music and video). Similar figures apply to other hard disk drive sizes.|$|E
