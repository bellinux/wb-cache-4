5|$|In 1934, Rona {{was back}} in Paris {{studying}} with Joliot-Curie, who had discovered artificial radioactivity. Soon after, Curie died and Rona became ill, but {{she was able to}} return to Vienna late the following year to share what had been learned with a group of researchers made up of Pettersson, Elizabeth Kara-Michailova, and Ernst Føyn, who was serving as an assistant to Ellen Gleditsch at that time. Their studies centered on research of the effect caused by bombarding radionuclides with neutrons. In 1935 Rona consolidated some of these relationships, working on Stora Bornö, then visiting Gleditsch in Oslo, then traveling to Copenhagen to see Hevesy, and later to Kålhuvudet, Sweden to meet with Karlik and Pettersson.

40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of the {{information}} flowing into and out of a system or network is fundamental <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is adherence <b>to</b> a usage policy. Traditional methods of determining traffic type rely on the port label carried in the packet header. This method can fail, however, in the presence of proxy servers that re-map port numbers or host services that have been compromised to act as backdoors or covert channels. We present an approach to classify server traffic based on decision trees learned during a training phase. The trees are constructed from traffic described using a set of features we designed to capture stream behavior. Because our classification of the traffic type is independent of port label, it provides a more accurate classification in the presence of malicious activity. An empirical evaluation illustrates that models of both aggregate protocol behavior and host-specific protocol behavior obtain classification accuracies ranging from 82 - 100 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} cosmology strongly relies {{upon the}} Cosmological Principle, which consists on the hypotheses of large scale isotropy and homogeneity of the Universe. Testing these assumptions is, therefore, crucial <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are {{deviations from the}} standard cosmological paradigm. In this paper, we use the latest type Ia supernova compilations, namely JLA and Union 2. 1 to test the cosmological isotropy at low redshift ranges ($z< 0. 1 $). This is performed through a Bayesian selection analysis, in which we compare the standard, isotropic model, with another one including a dipole correction due to peculiar velocities. We find that the Union 2. 1 sample favors the dipole-corrected model, but the opposite happens for the JLA. Nonetheless, the velocity dipole results are in good agreement with previous analyses carried out with both datasets. We conclude {{that there are no}} significant indications for large anisotropic signals from nearby supernova compilations, albeit this test should be greatly improved with the upcoming cosmological surveys...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the issue of {{capacity}} utilisation (CU) in the Nigerian economy over the last 12 years (1991 - 2003) with the view <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> has been significant improvement in CU despite changes in government policies initiated to boost the productive capacity level. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology is basically descriptive and analytical. Planned and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of secondary data are adopted to explain CU situation in Nigeria. Findings – The paper shows that CU trends in Nigeria from 1993 - 2003 ranges between 30 and 60 per cent. Practical implications – The government and organised private sector organisations have a monumental role to play for positive changes and sustainable improvement of CU level in Nigeria through boosting aggregate demand, improved employment, low interest rate, improved export drive, cheap fuel and power supply, creation of enabling environment for businesses. Originality/value – The results of this paper support the finance-economics view that the relatively low level of CU across the sectors analysed suggests that firms in Nigeria are subject to economic constraints.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} and estimate long-run relationships among M 1, prices, output and interest rates, with a view <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a stable relationship that can be interpreted as long-run money demand. The paper uses a maximum-likelihood multiple- equation cointegration technique, developed by Johansen, to fit a system of equations to the data. One finding is that long-run, but not short-run, unitary price elasticity is easily accepted, while the income elasticity is close to one-half. The coefficients on the deviation of money from its long-run equilibrium in the vector error-correction model imply that when M 1 is above its long-run demand, money will decrease and prices increase to restore long-run equilibrium. The effects of the deviation on output and interest rates are insignificant, pointing to the weak exogeneity of these variables. The implication of the results is that all the adjustment to return the economy to monetary equilibrium comes from fluctuations in money and prices. However, this does not preclude the possibility that changes in the stock of money may have short-run real effects. Indeed, the results suggest that changes in M 1 lead short-term changes in output. ...|$|R
50|$|Stylidium nominatum is a {{dicotyledonous}} {{plant that}} belongs to the genus Stylidium (family Stylidiaceae). It is an annual plant that grows from 4 to 15 cm tall. The oblanceolate leaves, about 5-15 per plant, form basal rosettes around the stem and are 2.5-9 mm long, 0.5-1.5 mm wide. About 4-11 leaves per plant are also scattered along the stem and are generally 2.3-4.7 mm long and 0.3-0.5 mm wide. Scapes are absent. Inflorescences are 2-6 cm long and produce white flowers that bloom from April to June in the southern hemisphere. S. nominatum is endemic to the northern area of Kakadu National Park and Melville Island in the Northern Territory. Its habitat is recorded as being sandy soils in Melaleuca viridiflora woodlands, bases of sandstone escarpments, and gravelly yellow soil in flat, treeless areas. S. nominatum is most closely related to S. capillare. In his recent revision of the subgenus Andersonia, A. R.

40|$|African {{fiction and}} {{the medium of}} its {{communication}} have engaged the attention of critics and writers for some time now. While a group in the early sixties led by Ngugi wa Thiongo advocated the use of African languages, others like Achebe would rather domesticate English to project African values. For some language formalists like Soyinka, there is no contest as language choice is considered a lame-duck discourse and "poetics of praying mantis". This paper interrogates how {{the new generation of}} writers has grappled with the age-long issue of languages of expression for African literature. This is with a view <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a paradigm shift in linguistic choice especially by third-generation Nigerian writers. The focus is an analysis of language strategies employed in selected third-generation Nigerian novels. Through a close and comparative reading of two purposively selected African novels – Shade Adeniran Imagine This and Doreen Baigana Tropical Fish, the paper highlights the stylistic and formal strategies employed by the writers. In addition to strategies such code-mixing, code-switching, inter-language and the like, earlier noted by scholars, the paper isolates Americanisms, loan words, hybridization, coinages as mechanisms of language mediation in the texts. This demonstrates that third-generation writers are not only sensitive to the vexed issue of medium of expression of African literature, they also inject fresh strategies to accommodate linguistic diversity and portray the transnational tilt of their works. This ultimately makes the creative productions accessible as globalized art forms...|$|R
