500|$|On June 17, 1992, President Yeltsin {{revealed}} {{that after the}} 1991 failed coup attempt concerted {{attempts were made to}} locate Soviet-era documents relating to KAL007. He mentioned the discovery of [...] "a memorandum from K.G.B. to the Central Committee of the Communist Party," [...] stating that a tragedy had taken place and adding that there are documents [...] "which would clarify the entire picture." [...] Yeltsin said the memo continued to say that [...] "these documents are so well concealed that it is doubtful <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> will be able to find them." [...] On September 11, 1992, Yeltsin officially acknowledged the existence of the recorders, and promised to give the South Korean government a transcript of the flight recorder contents as found in KGB files.|$|E
500|$|Controversy also {{arose from}} the YOG {{attendance}} policy in Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School, a local primary school. The school stated that a S$5 refundable deposit was required from students who attend the YOG events on a non-school day. The principal, Clifford Chua, {{said that it was}} to [...] "ensure <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> learn the value of responsibility and not take this rare opportunity for granted, by wasting the ticket and depriving others of the chance". Also, the deposit was returned even if the child did not attend the event. However, the move garnered mixed reactions from parents, who either supported the idea or felt it was not the right way to do things. Some other schools such as Nanyang Girls High School, Bukit View Primary School and Park View Primary School gave free tickets to their students while Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) encouraged co-pay of $1 to $2 by the students to teach them to treasure their tickets.|$|E

We're saying <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>child</b> is not newsworthy." [...] California Senate Bill 606 passed in 2013, with {{testimony}} by actors Halle Berry and Jennifer Garner.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a {{very strange}} tale, but has it struck you, Quatermain, that if your suppositions are correct, {{one of the most}} terrible {{circumstances}} connected with my case is <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>child</b> should have chanced to come to its dreadful death through the wickedness of an elephant?" ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{scarcely}} necessary {{for me to}} say, <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>child</b> had been expected. In fact, it had been expected, with comparative confidence, for some months. Mrs. Meek's mother, who resides with us - {{of the name of}} Bigby - had made every preparation for its admission to our circle.|$|R
2500|$|According to Texas State Representative Mike Villarreal, [...] "We have a {{responsibility}} to ensure <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> receive accurate information in the classroom, particularly when students' health is at stake," [...] Villarreal said. [...] "We're dealing with a myriad of problems in Texas {{as a result of our}} sky high teen pregnancy rates. We cannot allow our schools to provide erroneous information—the stakes are far too high." [...] With this in mind, many state legislators have proposed bills to improve sex education in Texas Schools.|$|E
2500|$|The etymological {{sense of}} [...] "absence of government" [...] {{is enough for}} me. We have to destroy the spirit of {{authority}} and {{the prestige of the}} laws. That's it. That would be the work of the free exam. The fools think that anarchy is disorder and that without government the society will always end in chaos. They don't conceive other order that the one imposed from the exterior by the terror of the weapons. The anarchism, as I understand it, is reduced to the free political exam. [...] ¿So what we must do? Educate the others and us. Everything is resumed in the free exam. <b>That</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> examine our laws and despise them! ...|$|E

40|$|Rather than {{a single}} focus on {{assessing}} risk and diagnosing deficit, this book recognises <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>child</b> protection systems bear down disproportionately on those from disadvantaged and marginalised communities and argues that {{what is needed is}} real support and practical assistance for poor and vulnerable parents and children. It uses real-world case examples to illustrate the relevant ethical and practice principles, and ways in which students and practitioners can practise ethically when dealing with complex, multi-faceted issues...|$|R
2500|$|Legal {{professionals}} and academics {{have criticized the}} use of child pornography laws with mandatory punishments against teenagers {{over the age of}} consent for sex offenses. Florida cyber crimes defense attorney David S. Seltzer wrote of this that [...] "I do not believe <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>child</b> pornography laws were designed for these situations... A conviction for possession of child pornography in Florida draws up {{to five years in prison}} for each picture or video, plus a lifelong requirement to register as a sex offender." ...|$|R

60|$|Now also <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> gave us occupation, {{we found}} excuses for our idleness, {{in the idea}} of {{bringing}} them up to a more splendid career. At length our tranquillity was disturbed, and the course of events, which for five years had flowed on in hushing tranquillity, was broken by breakers and obstacles, that woke us from our pleasant dream.|$|E
6000|$|ZOO. What {{is the use}} of prolonging the agony? You would perish {{slowly in}} our presence, no matter what we did to {{preserve}} you. You were almost dead when I took charge of you today, merely because you had talked for a few minutes to a secondary. Besides, we have our own experience to go upon. Have you never heard <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> occasionally revert to the ancestral type, and are born shortlived? ...|$|E
40|$|Our {{decision}} to homeschool began with hesitation and uncertainty. Our initial concerns included the socialization of <b>our</b> <b>children,</b> {{the delivery of}} curriculum, {{as well as the}} contemplation of our aspirations for <b>our</b> <b>children.</b> Through research, and the observation of <b>our</b> <b>children,</b> it has become clear <b>that</b> allowing <b>our</b> <b>children</b> to follow a willed curriculum is the chosen path for our family. This narrative explores the issues that were initially concerns and how they have become our motivation for homeschooling...|$|R
5000|$|Rick Perry, {{governor}} of Texas and Republican a former {{candidate for the}} 2012 presidential election, {{said in an interview}} on Fox News Sunday on December 11, 2011: [...] "I would support a constitutional amendment <b>that</b> allows <b>our</b> <b>children</b> to pray in school anytime they would like." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, then,' says I, 'it is this: as I {{told you}} before in a heat, that I was not your lawful wife, and <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>{{children}}</b> were not legal children, so I must let you know now in calmness and in kindness, but with affliction enough, that I am your own sister, and you my own brother, {{and that we are}} both the children of our mother now alive, and in the house, who is convinced of the truth of it, in a manner not to be denied or contradicted.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have not}} {{suffered}} all {{things for a}} reward," [...] he said, [...] "but because a righteous cause may grow. And though our names may be forgotten, our deeds will be remembered. We have conquered a vast land <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> and our children's children may be freed from tyranny, and we have brought a just vengeance upon our enemies. I thank you, one and all, {{in the name of}} the Continental Congress and of that Commonwealth of Virginia for which you have fought. You are no longer Virginians, Kentuckians, Kaskaskians, and Cahokians--you are Americans." ...|$|E
60|$|In fact, the few and {{scattered}} students of {{nature of that}} day picked up the clue to her secrets exactly as it fell {{from the hands of}} the Greeks a thousand years before. The foundations of mathematics were so well laid by them, <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> learn their geometry from a book written for the schools of Alexandria two thousand years ago. Modern astronomy is the natural continuation and development of the work of Hipparchus and of Ptolemy; modern physics of that of Democritus and of Archimedes; it was long before modern biological science outgrew the knowledge bequeathed to us by Aristotle, by Theophrastus, and by Galen.|$|E

60|$|The Wizard then {{announced}} the last act of all, which was considered really wonderful. He had invented a machine to blow huge soap-bubbles, {{as big as}} balloons, and this machine was hidden under the platform so that only {{the rim of the}} big clay pipe to produce the bubbles showed above the flooring. The tank of soap-suds, and the air-pumps to inflate the bubbles, were out of sight beneath, so that when the bubbles began to grow upon the floor of the platform it really seemed like magic to the people of Oz, who knew nothing about even the common soap-bubbles <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> blow with a penny clay pipe and a basin of soap-and-water.|$|E
60|$|The {{children}} were sitting by studying their evening lessons, and I begged Mrs. Gurney {{to allow me}} to look over their geographies and atlases; and on her inquiring why, I told her that well-informed people in England sometimes made such unaccountable mistakes about the geography of our country as were quite surprising to me, and that I did not understand how it was <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> should know so much more about England than they about us. I found the children, however, in possession of a very excellent and authentic map of our country. I must say also that the most highly educated people I have met in England have never betrayed any want of information on this subject.|$|E

"Come, come, my dear," [...] {{says the}} husband, [...] "charity is {{a duty to}} the poor, and he that gives to the poor lends to the Lord; let us lend our heavenly Father a little of our children's bread, as you call it; {{it will be a}} store well laid up for them, and will be the best {{security}} <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> shall never come to want charity, or be turned out of doors, as these poor innocent creatures are." [...] "Don't tell me of security," [...] says the wife, [...] "'tis a good security for our children to keep what we have together, and provide for them, and then 'tis time enough to help keep other folks' children. Charity begins at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|The ayah who {{had come}} with the child from India had been sent back {{a few months after}} they arrived, for his mother had written to Mrs. Covington {{requesting}} that he should have a white nurse. [...] "The native servants," [...] she wrote, [...] "spoil the children dreadfully, and let them have entirely their own way, and the consequence is that they grow up domineering, bad-tempered, and irritable. I have seen so many cases of it here that Herbert and I have quite decided <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>child</b> shall not be spoilt in this way, but shall be brought up in England as English children are, to obey their nurses and to do as they are ordered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, my dear Mrs. Conway, we {{feel this}} matter personally, as our Mabel was {{as you know}} made joint-heiress with your Ralph of Herbert's property. We cannot but feel, however, that the loss is greater in your case than in ours. Mabel was never {{informed}} of Herbert's intentions toward her, and although we should of course have been glad to know <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>child</b> had such brilliant prospects, the loss of them will not we may hope in any way affect her happiness. In the case of your son it is different, and his prospects in life will of course be seriously affected by the loss, and my husband begs me to express to you his very deep regret at this.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{have not}} {{mentioned}} the other alternative, Eustace, namely, that I {{and the children}} should go to Paris as hostages; and this, it seems to me, {{is the best of}} the three to follow. If there were indeed a chance of an English invasion I should not say so, but I think not that there is any such prospect. It is many years since England has done aught in earnest, and during all that time her power in France has been waning. I would not <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> should lose this fair estate when it can well be preserved by some slight sacrifice on my part. Were I and the children to go to Paris it would put an end to all doubts as to your loyalty, and you would hold the castle and estates. The peace now patched up between the parties will not last, and as soon as they are engaged with each other, and have no time to spare to think of attacking you here, I will endeavour to escape with the children and rejoin you. I shall assuredly have no cause for complaint. I shall, of course, have honourable treatment, and apartments fitting to our rank assigned to me. It would be no great hardship, and even were it so it would be worth enduring in order that our son Charles should inherit his father's estate." ...|$|E
60|$|We paid a {{visit to}} Fort Ellsworth, and from its ramparts (which have been heaped up out of the muddy soil within the last few months, and will require still a year or two to make them verdant) we had a {{beautiful}} view of the Potomac, a truly majestic river, and the surrounding country. The fortifications, so numerous in all this region, and now so unsightly with their bare, precipitous sides, will remain as historic monuments, grass-grown and picturesque memorials of an epoch of terror and suffering: they will serve to make our country dearer and more interesting to us, and afford fit soil for poetry to root itself in: for this is a plant which thrives best in spots where blood has been spilt long ago, and grows in abundant clusters in old ditches, such as the moat around Fort Ellsworth will be a century hence. It may seem to be paying dear for what many will reckon but a worthless weed; but the more historical associations we can link with our localities, the richer will be the daily life that feeds upon the past, and the more valuable the things that have been long established: so <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> will be less prodigal than their fathers in sacrificing good institutions to passionate impulses and impracticable theories. This herb of grace, let us hope, will be found in the old footprints of the war.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} {{paying for a}} thing is earning it. Perhaps some one else earned the money that pays for it. But I believe {{there is too much}} work in the world. If I were to live my life over again, I should not work half so hard. My husband and I took this place when we were young married people, and began working to pay for it. We wanted to feel that it was ours, that we owned it, and <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>children</b> should own it afterward. We both worked all day long like slaves, and many a {{moonlight}} night we were up till morning, almost, gathering the stones from our fields and burying them in deep graves that we had dug for them. But we buried our youth and strength and health in those graves, too, and what for? I don't own the farm that we worked so hard to pay for, and my children won't. That is what it has all come to. We were rightly punished for our greed, I suppose. Perhaps no one has a right to own any portion of the earth. Sometimes I think so, but my husband and I earned this farm, and now the savings-bank owns it. That seems strange, doesn't it? I suppose you'll say that the bank paid for it. Well, perhaps so; but the bank didn't earn it. When I think of that I don't always think that a person who pays for his breakfast has the best right to a breakfast." ...|$|E

40|$|I enjoy reminiscing {{about our}} {{earliest}} years with Giti and her language learning. My husband, Hafiz, and I were graduate students at Indiana University {{and interested in}} everything {{there was to know}} about life. When I found out I was pregnant, I never doubted <b>that</b> <b>our</b> <b>child</b> would read. I had spent entire days in my childhood whipping through piles of library books and swapping Nancy Drew and Judy Bolton books with cousins. My husband had taught himself to read under the most miserable of circumstances, and begged for paper and pen in a Central Asian village where neither could easily be found. Even as struggling students, we would always buy books before clothes, and treasure owning them. We remain infatuated with the special feel of libraries. How could we not share these emotions with the newest member of our family...|$|R
