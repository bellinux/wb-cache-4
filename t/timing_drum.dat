The thesis describes the design and construction of a local area computer network to provide a distributed industrial control and monitoring system for glass container manufacture. In particular, a commercially available local area network, originally manufactured to link industrial programmable controllers, {{has been used to}} allow the implementation of multi-processor control scheme for container forming and to achieve an integrated data processing link with other plant computers concerned with inspection and quality data collection. A microprocessor-based I. S. machine controller was designed to replace conventional <b>Timing</b> <b>Drum</b> controllers used in many container manufacturing plants, and linked to the local area network. The control system developed provided the usual machine sequencing functions but also provided adaptive control of the invert mechanism speed using a specially designed electropneumatic servo mechanism valve. A data capture system was also designed, developed and tested to allow' on-line monitoring of container inspection machines. The system utilises the local area network to provide access to a file server (for data storage), to allow remote access (e. g. in Quality Control) and to establish a link with the I. S. machine controllers. The distributed control and monitoring scheme produced allows the convenient integration of other data processing functions in other plant areas such as batch, furnace, forehearth, and packing and can facilitate the integration of organisational functions such as planning, scheduling, and data base management in a planned step by step manner...|$|E
50|$|About {{a minute}} from the end, the music {{suddenly}} switches {{to a new}} riff which also uses complex polyrhythms. The instrumentation is not as stringent as the first riff's, because in some parts, some instruments hold a sustained note while others continue the pattern. Aside from that, all instruments play the melody together, as was done for the first riff, including John Marshall furiously beating out the <b>timing</b> on <b>drums</b> and cymbals, bringing the music to a sustained climax. The song ends on a final note which holds while Sanders plays an ascending flourish on violin.|$|R
50|$|Richardson's {{drumming}} {{is characterized}} by a fusion of death metal elements as well as jazz influences. Noted for his blast beats, odd <b>timing,</b> double bass <b>drumming,</b> and fill-heavy style, Richardson is considered a standout in his field. His favorite drummers include Terry Bozzio, Dennis Chambers, Dave Grohl, Simon Phillips, Dave Weckl, Morgan Ågren, Virgil Donati, Ken Schalk and Tomas Haake.|$|R
50|$|His <b>timing</b> {{and varied}} <b>drumming</b> help {{to give the}} band its sound. Whereas his {{technique}} on earlier albums such as Pablo Honey and The Bends corresponded to the classic rock feel of the band's original style, the more experimental and atmospheric feel of their more recent work has been complemented by Selway's transition to a more solid, repetitive technique, often featuring a motorik sound.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though the}} session players hired for Gaucho were amongst {{the most talented}} from both the East and West Coast session fraternities, Fagen and Becker were still not {{satisfied}} with the basic tracks for some of the songs, particularly with regard to the <b>timing</b> of the <b>drum</b> tracks. In a 2006 interview for Sound On Sound Magazine, Donald Fagen stated that he and Becker told recording engineer Roger Nichols: ...|$|R
5000|$|In June 1978 {{the band}} entered the Record Plant in New York {{to record their}} third album, and first with Chapman. However, Chapman found the band {{difficult}} to work with, remembering them as the worst band he ever worked with in terms of musical ability, although praising Frank Infante as [...] "an amazing guitarist". Sessions with Chris Stein were hampered by his being stoned during recording, and Chapman encouraged him to write songs rather than play guitar. Similarly, according to Chapman, Jimmy Destri would prove himself to be far better at songwriting than as a keyboardist and Clem Burke had poor <b>timing</b> playing <b>drums.</b> As a result, Chapman spent time improving the band, especially Stein with whom Chapman spent hours rerecording his parts to ensure they were right. Bassist Nigel Harrison became so frustrated with Chapman's drive for perfectionism that he threw a synthesizer at him during recording. Chapman recalls the atmosphere at the Record Plant in an interview for Sound on Sound: ...|$|R
5000|$|Reggaestep (portmanteau of reggae and dubstep) is {{a fusion}} genre of reggae music and dubstep that has gained {{popularity}} online, particularly SoundCloud. Reggaestep typically has similar drum samples {{as those used}} in reggae; however, the <b>timing</b> of these <b>drums</b> corresponds with the typical syncopation of drums in dubstep. Other influence taken from reggae include harmonic accentuation of the offbeats, however off-beat rhythms can sometimes be layered on top of more traditional dubstep or ragga melodies. The tempo tends to be at 140 BPM which is typical to dubstep. The [...] "drops" [...] in reggaestep {{are very similar to}} those of dubstep, but often follow similar melody patterns to reggae.|$|R
5000|$|Cognitive {{research}} has also been applied to ethnomusicological studies of rhythm. Some ethnomusicologists believe that African and Western rhythms are organized differently. Western rhythms may be based on ratio relationships, while African rhythms may be organized additively. In this view, that means that Western rhythms are hierarchical in nature, while African rhythms are serial. [...] One study that provides empirical support for this view was published by Magill and Pressing in 1997. The researchers recruited a highly experienced drummer who produced prototypical rhythmic patterns. Magill and Pressing then used Wing & Kristofferson’s (1973) mathematical modeling to test different hypotheses on the <b>timing</b> of the <b>drummer.</b> One version of the model used a metrical structure; however, the authors found that this structure was not necessary. All drumming patterns could be interpreted within an additive structure, supporting {{the idea of a}} universal ametrical organization scheme for rhythm.|$|R
50|$|The dragon {{dance is}} {{performed}} by a skilled team {{whose job is to}} bring the motionless body to life. The correct combination and proper timing of the different parts of the dragon are very important to make a successful dance. Any mistakes made by even some of the performers would spoil the whole performance. To be very successful in the dance, the head of the Dragon must be able to coordinate with the body movement to match the <b>timing</b> of the <b>drum.</b> For larger ceremonial and parade style dragons, the head can weigh as much as 12 katis (14.4 kg, almost 32 lb). The dragon tail also has an important role to play as it will have to keep in time with head movements. The fifth section is considered to be the middle portion and the performers must be very alert as the body movements change from time to time. The dragon is often led by a person holding a spherical object representing a pearl.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an in-depth {{account of the}} Low-Country, ritual, drumming tradition of Sri Lanka. Low-Country drumming is characterized by its expressive and illusive sense of timing which makes it appear {{to be free of}} beat, pulse and metre. This makes it special in respect to other drumming cultures of the world. However, the drumming of the Low-Country is marginalized, unaccepted and unexposed. Drawing on original fieldwork from the Western province of Sri Lanka, this study analyses the drumming of three distinct rituals: devol maḍuva, Kalu Kumāra samayama and graha pūjāva of Raigama, the dominant sub-tradition of the Low-Country. The thesis reveals key features of the drumming tradition, some of which are hidden. These features include the musical structure that is {{beneath the surface of the}} <b>drumming,</b> <b>timing,</b> embellishment, improvisation and performance practice. It also documents the Low-Country drum, the yak beraya, its construction and relationship to the musician. The thesis addresses some of the changes that are occurring in the contemporary ritual and argues the need for the drumming to be brought out of its ritual context, for its survival in the future. It also documents a collaborative performance between Low-Country ritual performers and musicians from New Zealand...|$|R
