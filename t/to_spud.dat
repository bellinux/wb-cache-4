Despite this, Spud is disgusted and slightly disturbed by her - this is exacerbated when, while at a party at her house with Gecko (with whom she formed a relationship in order to get close <b>to</b> <b>Spud),</b> she lures him into her bedroom and forcibly tries to get him to have sex with her. Based on his writings, Spud is the only boy in the entire series who turns down her advances, despite her persistence, suggesting he may be the only boy in the series she has genuine feelings for. She continues to make advances on Spud when he goes to the Matric dance with Mermaid (Christine had gone with Boggo).|$|E

50|$|In Edinburgh, Tommy dies from AIDS-related {{toxoplasmosis}} and {{the three}} travel back to Scotland to attend his funeral. They meet Spud, who has been released from prison. Sick Boy suggests a lucrative yet dangerous heroin transaction, but needs Renton to supply half of the initial £4,000. Renton injects himself with a sample to test the heroin's purity and the four sell the heroin to a dealer in London for £16,000. During their celebration at a pub, Renton secretly suggests <b>to</b> <b>Spud</b> that they steal the money, but Spud is too scared of Begbie to even consider it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film has}} {{experienced}} some controversy around {{some of its}} content as Justice Edwin Cameron of the Constitutional Court sent <b>to</b> <b>Spud</b> producer Ross Garland a letter saying that he saw in particular two scenes as [...] "denigrating gays and lesbians".

Although Spud expresses open {{contempt}} for his pick-up abilities, he is still very successful with girls and, Spud occasionally mentions several relationships that Boggo is in. A frequent topic of humour in Spud's diaries is his being caught masturbating, and having to endure the school's notorious humiliation policy whenever he enters the dining hall. He is close friends with Fatty, and somewhat friendly with Rambo, as Spud often writes of comments he makes to this effect. He does not bully people like Rambo and Mad Dog, who are very physical with their bullying, but more verbally. He is actually quite intelligent and this is evident throughout the series with his witty comebacks and one-liners, and his clever money-making schemes which, <b>to</b> <b>Spud's</b> surprise, often work.|$|R
50|$|Spud {{began working}} for Frontier Wrestling Alliance in 2004, and {{was brought up}} into the main roster {{to be used as}} a jobber for a short time, {{competing}} against many larger opponents.

He made it to the tournament final, where he was defeated by Ross Jordan, who became the first FWA Flyweight Champion. However, Jordan was only awarded the match after the referee stopped the contest due to a kayfabe injury <b>to</b> <b>Spud's</b> leg. The pair continued to feud for over 14 months, with Jordan repeatedly attacking <b>Spud</b> in attempts <b>to</b> re-injure his leg. The feud ended when Spud defeated Jordan in a Last Man Standing match at FWA Last Fight at the Prom on 30 September 2006.|$|R

He befriends Mr Edly, a teacher nicknamed [...] "The Guv", after he is the only one in the English class to pass an exam.

He is also an eating champion and local celebrity, having won several eating competitions. According <b>to</b> <b>Spud,</b> he got his nickname from Head of House 'PJ' Luthuli, who had a lisp and couldn't pronounce the name [...] "Sidney Smitherson-Scott." [...] Fatty, due to his weight, struggles with a lack of attention from girls, although he finally forms a relationship near the end of Learning to Fly, with a 13-year-old girl named Penny, for which he receives a lot of stick from his peers. Although he starts to diet extensively while in a relationship with Penny, she eventually breaks up with him, and he reverts to his gluttonous ways.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph, a 6'11" [...] center from Cap-Haïtien, Haiti, {{had never}} played {{organized}} basketball in 1980 {{when he was}} discovered by a coach from Miami Dade College and was offered a scholarship to the school.

5000|$|Robert 'Rambo' Black - The (self-appointed and self-nicknamed) {{leader of}} the Crazy Eight. He is known for having a public affair with Eve, the drama teacher and wife of his housemaster, and his {{exceptionally}} brutal ways. Although <b>Spud</b> is oblivious <b>to</b> it in his writings, Rambo appears <b>to</b> like <b>Spud</b> and tries <b>to</b> help him with his personality flaws - at one point, when Spud goes through a phase of arrogance, Rambo uses his influence with the group to discipline him. He also tries <b>to</b> make <b>Spud</b> feel better after he gets his [...] "birthday present."He is described as being very muscular and has black hair. In his third year, he starts to become a kinder and much more protective person, and is often seen to threaten the second years with punishment if they make any attempts at initiating the first years.|$|R
50|$|While Interviewing Ethan Carter III, Borash {{was engaged}} in a feud with him after he {{interfered}} <b>to</b> help Rockstar <b>Spud.</b> While Carter and his bodyguard Tyrus tried to head shave the head of <b>Spud</b> but due <b>to</b> interference of Borash, that attempt was failed. Rather than shaving Spud, Carter and Tyrus decided to shave Borash. This event caused an alliance with Spud and Borash, with Borash saving Spud numerous other times from getting his head shaved. Ken Anderson and Mandrews would also start <b>to</b> help <b>Spud</b> as well. On the February 20 episode of Impact Wrestling, Borash, Anderson, Mandrews and Spud made an attempt to shave Carter's head but Tyrus saved him. Tyrus, instead got shaved by Spud.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, {{along with}} Mothers Against Drunk Driving, alleged that Anheuser-Busch was {{pitching}} {{the dog to}} children. Although the Federal Trade Commission found {{no evidence to support}} that allegation, Anheuser-Busch decided <b>to</b> retire <b>Spuds</b> in 1989, partly because they felt the character's image had started to overshadow the product.|$|R
5000|$|Leonard Pike - Spud's (and the Crazy Eight's) nemesis. He {{is often}} seen to be {{bullying}} most of the students, and often members of the Crazy Eight. He enjoys flashing himself {{to the members of}} the Crazy Eight, but this is often written off as being part of his behaviour. However, it is suggested that he has a homosexual crush on Spud, as he makes a sexual advance towards him at the end of the first book. He shows up in Learning to Fly and is made a prefect, much to the horror of the group, as they cannot do anything without getting into trouble because of him. After he is de-prefected midway through the year, he suspects Spud ratted on him for his possession of illicit items (Spud was actually doing some work for Viking). In his very final appearance, he corners Spud at the cricket nets and, to Spud's shock, proceeds to passionately kiss him, confirming that he has a crush on him. As Spud recovers from this turn of events, Pike walks away, with his last words <b>to</b> <b>Spud</b> simply being [...] "Something to remember me by." ...|$|E
5000|$|Debbie or [...] "the Mermaid" [...] - Spud's first {{girlfriend and}} first love. She is {{described}} as being very beautiful with blonde hair and big green eyes, hence her nickname. In the first book Spud writes of her growing depression after her father moves out. She is very fickle and has little respect for Spud's heart, twice breaking up with him on Valentine's Day - the first time after having won a beauty competition and finding a more attractive boyfriend, and the second time to become a born-again Christian, and establish {{a close relationship with}} a 29-year-old cricket umpire named Gavin. These events are a frequent topic that Spud writes about in his diary, and although it appears that he lacks the self-esteem to confront her about this, he eventually finds the strength in the third book, firmly telling her that [...] "I don't think we can be friends anymore," [...] although this incident brings her out in tears. Despite these breakups, she continues to hold feelings for him, and he frequently writes of their strained interaction. Their relationship eventually reignites permanently after she breaks up with Gavin in Exit, Pursued by a Bear, and she becomes Spud's date to Matric Dance. Despite their continued relationship, her poor alcohol tolerance prevents them from engaging in intimacy, which becomes a source of frustration <b>to</b> <b>Spud.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Knee {{spent much}} of the autumn of 1943 in New York, where she began a new life with the painter Alexander Brook. They settled in Savannah, Georgia, where Brook had lived {{previously}} with his former wife, renovating an old warehouse into a living space with two separate studios. An exhibit at the E. B. Crocker Gallery Sacramento partnered Knee with modernist painters Lionel Feininger, Mark Tobey and Morris Graves, and her subtle and contemplative works contributed to a harmonious exhibition. In a c.1950 letter to a friend (Gina Knee <b>to</b> <b>Spud</b> Johnson, the Johnson Papers), she noted that [...] "Maybe its easiest to say that in adjusting to a new life, I had to cut the lovely strands of the past," [...] and she sold her New Mexico home. While she was used to the differences {{in the lives of the}} Anglo, Hispanic and Native American residents of New Mexico, the South was new and different, and she tried to evoke in her work the live of southern blacks. For the first time, she began to paint with oils. With the knowledge that she could scrape away and re-do allowed her new ways to explore texture, color and brushstrokes, telling gallery owner Willard in a letter that she no longer felt [...] "in tune with watercolor painting at all when I attempt it." [...] (Gina Knee to Marian Willard, 27 Jan. 1947, WGP) ...|$|E
5000|$|Charlie 'Mad Dog' Hooper - A {{fierce and}} {{ruthless}} thug-like boy {{so named because}} of his hunting habits. A talented cricket bowler (has no co-ordination for batting) due to his scare tactics and high speed bowling, he appears <b>to</b> view <b>Spud</b> as a close friend, as he often includes him in hunting trips and forces him to hike with {{him a lot of}} the time, although Spud often expresses fear of him. In several entries, he cries at the idea of never seeing Spud again. In the second book, he {{spends a lot of time}} on the phone with Spud when he is expelled. Based on what Spud writes of him, he can scare anyone into submission simply by wielding his knife, and it is mentioned at some point that he has Dyslexia. After the gang visit his farm in Learning <b>to</b> Fly, <b>Spud</b> never mentions him again.|$|R
5000|$|Garth Garlic - a Malawian {{student who}} replaces Mad Dog. Fatty often relies {{on him for}} chocolate, since his father is the {{managing}} director of Nestlé Malawi. Spud often writes of the insufferable Garlic's incessant talking (specifically about Malawi), and how he persists with it even after being advised by <b>Spud</b> <b>to</b> keep quiet (<b>Spud</b> claims he has 'verbal diarrhea'). Nevertheless, Spud finds him becoming a friend. Garlic took the Crazy Eight on a trip with him to Lake Malawi {{near the end of}} 'Exit, Pursued by a Bear.' ...|$|R
