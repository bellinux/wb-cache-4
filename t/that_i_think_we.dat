500|$|In 2000, Dave Alizadeth from Las Vegas outlasted a {{field of}} 109 {{participants}} {{to become the first}} [...] "Dealers World Poker Championship". While other Dealer Tournaments had a reputation for sloppy play, the first Dealer Championship was noted for the seriousness with which the players approached the game. In the end, however, the winner was not determined by the deal of the cards, but by a deal at the table. According to initial reports, the deal was only achieved because [...] "a World Series bracelet was not available for negotiation, the players decided to take their money and go home." [...] Other sources, however, indicate that the event was always intended to be a bracelet event. Either way, the official WSOP standings, credits Alizadeth with winning a WSOP bracelet at this event. By contrast the final three contestants at the 2003 Championship were doing Kamikaze shots. [...] "We were all having such a great time," [...] the winner David Lukaszewski said, [...] "sitting around playing poker <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> may have forgotten about the prize money and the bracelet." ...|$|E
2500|$|King {{appeared}} on MSNBC's [...] "The Cycle" [...] on May 9, 2014. He {{was asked by}} co-host Touré if he believed that Democratic Party has done {{enough to get the}} overwhelming support from African-Americans it receives. King's answer is said to have shocked the host. “The party does not do enough,” he said. “It's our responsibility to hold the party accountable. And I'm not sure we do <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{have to find a way}} to hold the parties accountable. He went on to say that he believed there should be communication between African-Americans and the Tea Party Movement, saying [...] "the only way you change is you have to be at least communicating".|$|E
2500|$|Bernie Sanders opposes {{guest worker}} {{programs}} {{and is also}} skeptical about skilled immigrant (H-1B) visas, saying, [...] "Last year, the top 10 employers of H-1B guest workers were all offshore outsourcing companies. These firms are responsible for shipping large numbers of American information technology jobs to India and other countries." [...] In an interview with Vox he stated his opposition to an open borders immigration policy, describing it as:...a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States...you're doing away {{with the concept of}} a nation-state. [...] What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don’t believe in <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have to raise wages in this country, I think we have {{to do everything we can}} to create millions of jobs.|$|E

6000|$|... "We have, <b>we</b> have! <b>That</b> is--yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> may say, Marcelli, that we {{have often}} heard of him, and not unfavorably. Well, what of this Grimaldi?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Discussing other {{specific}} {{songs on}} the album, Skiba mentioned that the title track uses heroin and methadone addiction {{as a metaphor for}} love, stating that [...] "It's a human condition <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all, in one way or another, fall victim to. It's not to say that people can't be happy or find bliss in a relationship. It's just amazing to me how unhappy most people are and they can't shake it and can't fix it, much like an addiction." [...] He also discussed the politically themed [...] "The American Scream", a song inspired by the suicide of a United States Army soldier after his return from the War in Afghanistan: [...] "For a long time we were afraid to write overtly political songs but I read this article about a US soldier that came back from a tour of duty in Afghanistan and blew his head off on his mother's grave and I wrote a song about that." [...] He has described the lyrical style of This Addiction as [...] "thinking-man's punk": [...] "We wanted to do something that's fun but also interesting and lyrically, something that will be fun for people to read along to and hopefully understand." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} led to {{a diplomatic}} furor and deterioration in Pakistan–United States relations. A major focus of the incident was the U.S. government's assertion that Davis was protected under the principle of diplomatic immunity due to his role as an [...] "administrative and technical official" [...] attached to the Lahore consulate. The U.S. government claimed that Davis was protected under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and demanded he be released from custody immediately. President Barack Obama asked Pakistan not to prosecute Davis and recognize him as a diplomat, stating, [...] "There's a broader principle at stake <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have to uphold." [...] The Pakistani officials disputed the claim of immunity from a murder charge, asserting that Davis was involved in clandestine operations, and questioned the scope of his activities in Pakistan. The Pakistani Foreign Office stated that [...] "this matter is sub judice [...] {{in a court of}} law and the legal process should be respected." [...] Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi stated that, according to official records and experts in the Foreign Office, Davis was [...] "not a diplomat and cannot be given blanket diplomatic immunity"; Qureshi's stand on the issue allegedly led to him losing the Foreign Affairs ministerial post.|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of {{the wreckage of the}} R.M.S. Titanic in 1985 attracted Yeston's interest in writing a musical about the famous disaster. [...] "What drew me to the project was the positive aspects of what the ship represented – 1) humankind's striving after great artistic works and similar technological feats, despite the possibility of tragic failure, and 2) the dreams of the passengers on board: 3rd Class, to immigrate to America for a better life; 2nd Class, to live a leisured lifestyle in imitation of the upper classes; 1st Class, to maintain their privileged positions forever. The collision with the iceberg dashed all of these dreams simultaneously, and the subsequent transformation of character of the passengers and crew had, it seemed to me, the potential for great emotional and musical expression onstage." [...] Librettist Peter Stone and Yeston knew that the idea was an unusual subject for a musical. [...] "I think if you don't have that kind of daring damn-the-torpedoes, you shouldn't be in this business. It's the safe sounding shows that often don't do well. You have to dare greatly, and I really want to stretch the bounds of the kind of expression in musical theater," [...] Yeston explained. [...] Yeston saw the story as unique to turn-of-the-century British culture, with its rigid social class system and its romanticization of progress through technology. [...] "In order to depict that on the stage, because this is really a very English show, I knew I would have to have a color similar to the one found in the music of the great composers at that time, like Elgar or Vaughan Williams; this was for me an opportunity to bring in the musical theater an element of the symphonic tradition <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> really haven't had before. That was very exciting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose {{nobody else}} would have a gift of him," [...] said Julia. [...] "And for <b>that</b> matter, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> could have done without the monster very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barbara laughed. [...] "Pshaw!" [...] she said. [...] "You had a {{much better}} reason than <b>that.</b> Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were {{what might be called}} good comrades in the bush?" ...|$|R
3000|$|Interviewee 4 : “I’m a spiritist, right? So I {{believe we}} {{reincarnate}} {{and things like}} <b>that.</b> So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> come like this, we’re not here for nothing. There’s a reason!” [...]...|$|R

6000|$|... "In <b>that</b> case <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{had better}} move the boat {{away from the}} shore," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "It {{may not be as}} comfortable as under the trees but it will be safer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{rather a}} hateful woman!" [...] she said, slowly. [...] "I wish I had not said <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have managed things very cleverly, Lawrence. Still, I suppose life {{is made up}} of these sorts of idiotic blunders." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a certain}} crisp definiteness about those two words which carried {{conviction}} with them. Mabane and I were a little staggered. Our position was such a strong one, our request so reasonable, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had never realized {{the possibility of a}} refusal.|$|R
60|$|But how {{was their}} conduct hypocritical? Stupid {{we might call}} it, or unreasonable: but how hypocritical? <b>That,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> may see better, by {{considering}} what the word hypocrite means.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{boatswain}} is killed, sir," [...] Bob shouted back, [...] "and we {{have lost}} two spars but, in spite of <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are sailing as fast as you." ...|$|E
6000|$|This induced John Rokesmith to observe--by way {{of making}} the thing more natural--'Bella, my love, this {{is so much more}} {{successful}} than any of our past anniversaries, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> must keep our future anniversaries here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Within {{the hour}} I will return here {{and explain to}} you and to the citizeness what I want you to do. We will get the aristos inside the Rat Mort, never fear; and after <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may safely leave Carrier to do the rest, what?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Looking {{back with}} 20/20, <b>I</b> wish <b>that</b> {{we could have}} had better {{communication}} with ElcomSoft, Dmitry Sklyarov and the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) before the whole thing went public. I'm sorry that we weren't able to do <b>that,</b> because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> could have resolved a lot of the issues.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then," [...] {{she lowered}} her voice, [...] "it does a little {{reconcile}} me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ought to go further into it till we can understand. <b>I</b> did make <b>that</b> dreadful vow. <b>I</b> know I ought not now; but still I did, in so many words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! that's the question. Who {{did write}} them? We know very well, Mr. Mason, you and I that is, who did not. And having come to <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> may give {{a very good}} guess who did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{will be no}} good {{in going}} into <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might as well sit down, Mr. Greenwood." [...] They did sit down, the {{chaplain}} as usual perching himself {{on the edge of}} a chair. [...] "You have been here a great many years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] Sarah {{acknowledged}} with emphasis. [...] "He {{has developed}} gifts of which I {{had not the}} slightest apprehension. Of course, Josephine would scratch me if I ventured upon {{such a thing as}} comparison,-so I'll be content with saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are both very happy women." ...|$|E
60|$|LUBIN. I {{have not}} {{gone so far as}} <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> After all, <b>we</b> have had many very able {{political}} leaders even within your recollection and mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly know. Perhaps {{they would}} hardly do <b>that.</b> However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to make}} it legal now--as soon as {{you are able to}} go out." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no {{need for}} more. During our long journey into these far-off wilds each man had fallen into his allotted place and work, and the force of habit had made us so like {{machines}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>we</b> had suddenly become a party of somnambulists we would have gone through the same actions each evening on landing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, uncle, to Gibraltar. It {{is a nice}} station, {{everyone}} says, and I am very pleased. There are so {{many places}} where there is fighting going on, now, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are most fortunate in going there. I was so afraid the regiment might be sent either to America, or India." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; as to <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{had better}} take some {{little time for}} consideration. But I think I may say that, if you will make our way easy for us, we will {{endeavour}} to make yours easy for you. You acknowledge this to be your uncle's will {{as far as you}} know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The sun {{was high}} when {{they sat down}} to rest. They had seen no one, near or distant, for a long time; and the {{solitude}} remained unbroken. 'It is so still here, Rachael, and the way is so untrodden, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> must be the first who have been here all the summer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] he said, [...] "this confessional {{business}} of yours {{has been an}} excellent exercise. It has enabled me to get outside myself, to look at myself as a Case. Now I can even {{see myself as a}} remote Case. <b>That</b> <b>I</b> needn't bother about further.... So far as <b>that</b> goes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have done all that there is to be done." ...|$|R
60|$|From wot he said I {{thought the}} pub was quite close, but instead o' <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>we</b> walked pretty nearly a mile afore we got there.

60|$|We murmured that it {{was very}} {{astonishing}} and very gratifying, or something to <b>that</b> effect. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> knew what it was either, but this is what our politeness expressed.|$|R
