5|$|In TgPVR1 mice, the <b>transgene</b> {{encoding}} {{the human}} PVR {{was incorporated into}} mouse chromosome 4. These mice express {{the highest levels of}} the <b>transgene</b> and the highest sensitivity to poliovirus. TgPVR1 mice are susceptible to poliovirus through the intraspinal, intracerebral, intramuscular, and intravenous pathways, but not through the oral route.|$|E
5|$|In TgPVR5 mice, {{the human}} <b>transgene</b> {{is located on}} {{chromosome}} 12. These mice exhibit the lowest levels of hPVR expression and are the least susceptible to poliovirus infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of a <b>transgene</b> requires the assembly of a few main parts. The <b>transgene</b> must contain a promoter, which is a regulatory sequence that will determine where and when the <b>transgene</b> is active, an exon, a protein coding sequence (usually derived from the cDNA for the protein of interest), and a stop sequence. These are typically combined in a bacterial plasmid and the coding sequences are typically chosen from transgenes with previously known functions.|$|E
40|$|To produce {{transgenic}} plants {{which have}} various applications in agricultural and non-agricultural fields, a marker gene {{is necessary to}} recover a viable transgenic plant. To express or transcribe of <b>transgenes,</b> utilization of promoters is also unavoidable. Analysis of <b>transgenes</b> includes copy number, insertion site, integration stability, expression and it`s pattern and variability is immensely important {{in order to develop}} a successful transgenic event. This review presents the necessities for better recovery of transgenic plants, transcription or expression of <b>transgenes,</b> as well as methods to analyze <b>transgenes...</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{only found}} a few cases (Table  4) of gene {{pyramiding}}. The pyramiding was obtained either by crossing individual lines (e.g., Datta et al. 2002) or by co-bombardment of separate <b>transgenes</b> (e.g., Kim et al. 2003). We found no example of several <b>transgenes</b> borne on one single T-DNA, indicating that transferring several <b>transgenes</b> in one single transformation event is not a common strategy.|$|R
40|$|The genome {{sequences}} {{of two of}} the three major species of schistosomes are now available. Molecular tools are needed to determine the importance of these new genes. With this in mind, we investigated introduction of reporter <b>transgenes</b> into schistosome eggs, with the longer-term aim of manipulation of schistosome genes and gene functions. The egg is a desirable developmental stage for genome manipulation, not least because it contains apparently accessible germ cells. Introduction of <b>transgenes</b> into the germ cells of schistosome eggs might result in transgenic schistosomes. However, the egg is surrounded by a thick shell which might block access to entry of <b>transgenes.</b> We cultured eggs in the presence of three types of reporter <b>transgenes</b> of increasing molecular size, and in addition we tried to produce transient holes in the eggs by electroporation to investigate whether the <b>transgenes</b> would more easily enter the eggs. Electroporation of eggs appeared to allow entry of two larger types of <b>transgenes</b> into cultured schistosome eggs, messenger RNA encoding firefly luciferase, and retroviral virions. We anticipate that this approach, electroporation of <b>transgenes</b> into schistosome eggs, will facilitate genetic manipulation of schistosomes for investigating the importance of schistosome genes and gene products as new intervention targets...|$|R
25|$|Viral vectors are {{generally}} genetically engineered viruses carrying modified viral DNA or RNA {{that has been}} rendered noninfectious, but still contain viral promoters and also the <b>transgene,</b> thus allowing for translation of the <b>transgene</b> through a viral promoter. However, because viral vectors frequently are lacking infectious sequences, they require helper viruses or packaging lines for large-scale transfection. Viral vectors are often designed for permanent incorporation of the insert into the host genome, and thus leave distinct genetic markers in the host genome after incorporating the <b>transgene.</b> For example, retroviruses leave a characteristic retroviral integration pattern after insertion that is detectable and indicates that the viral vector has incorporated into the host genome.|$|E
25|$|Genetically {{modified}} mice are {{the most}} common animal model for transgenic research. Transgenic mice are currently being used to study a variety of diseases including cancer, obesity, heart disease, arthritis, anxiety, and Parkinson’s disease. The two most common types of genetically modified mice are knockout mice and oncomice. Knockout mice are a type of mouse model that uses transgenic insertion to disrupt an existing gene’s expression. In order to create knockout mice, a <b>transgene</b> with the desired sequence is inserted into an isolated mouse blastocyst using electroporation. Then, homologous recombination occurs naturally within some cells, replacing the gene of interest with the designed <b>transgene.</b> Through this process, researchers were able to demonstrate that a <b>transgene</b> can be integrated into the genome of an animal, serve a specific function within the cell, and be passed down to future generations.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} {{monitoring and}} controlling {{of a particular}} <b>transgene</b> has been shown not to be feasible. The European Food Safety Authority published a guidance for risk assessment in 2010.|$|E
40|$|Pathogen derived {{resistance}} {{can be used}} {{to develop}} transgenic plants that are resistant to virus infection. It is possible to reduce both potential and perceived risks associated with the <b>transgenes</b> by constructing <b>transgenes</b> that reduce potential for insect transmission and sequence capture.

40|$|Balancer {{chromosomes}} {{are critical}} tools for Drosophila genetics. Many useful <b>transgenes</b> are inserted onto balancers using a random and inefficient process.

30|$|Only few efforts {{designed}} to investigate unique risk assessment {{issues related to}} GM crops or products containing dsRNA have been reported. The present study is the first that characterizes the miRNome of commercialized GM maize events to further investigate potential alterations in miRNA regulatory network. We were interested in testing miRNA content {{in two of the}} most commonly used <b>transgenes</b> in agriculture which currently do not produce intentional dsRNA; the insecticide Bt and the herbicide-tolerant Roundup Ready <b>transgenes.</b> The seed set of stacked (combination of <b>transgenes</b> by crossing or mating) and single GM maize events, as well as the non-transgenic near-isogenic counterpart, developed in the near-isogenic genetic background, enables the isolation of potential effects derived from <b>transgenes</b> independently.|$|R
25|$|A 2003 review {{published}} {{on behalf of}} Food Standards Australia New Zealand examined transgenic experimentation on terrestrial livestock species as well as aquatic species such as fish and shellfish. The review examined the molecular techniques used for experimentation as well as techniques for tracing the transgenes in animals and products as well as issues regarding <b>transgene</b> stability.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transgene</b> use {{in humans}} is {{currently}} fraught with issues. Transformation of genes into human cells {{has not been}} perfected yet. The most famous example of this involved certain patients developing T-cell leukemia after being treated for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID). This was attributed to the close proximity of the inserted gene to the LMO2 promoter, which controls the transcription of the LMO2 proto-oncogene.|$|E
25|$|Transgenic or genetically {{modified}} organisms, be they bacteria, viruses or fungi, serve {{all kinds of}} research purposes. Transgenic plants, insects, fish and mammals have been bred. Transgenic plants such as corn and soybean have replaced wild strains in agriculture in some countries (e.g. the United States). <b>Transgene</b> escape has been documented for GMO crops since 2001 with persistence and invasiveness. Transgenetic organisms pose ethical questions and may cause biosafety problems.|$|E
40|$|Currently, soybean {{transformation}} can {{be obtained}} by direct gene transfer using particle bombardment or through the mediation of Agrobacterium. The former has a tendency to insert multiple copies of <b>transgenes</b> in the host genome or to cause fragmentation of <b>transgenes</b> that can sometimes cause the deactivation of <b>transgenes</b> by gene silencing (Reddy et al. 2003). In contrast, the plants transformed using Agrobacterium generally have low copy numbers of the <b>transgenes.</b> Agrobacterium-mediated transformation makes it easier to obtain stable expression of the gene of interest and this allows the rapid fixation of the inserted gene in transgenic plants. In the circumstance for soybean transformation, the method mediated by Agrobacterium have limitations that several regular soybean varieties are used to generat...|$|R
40|$|Engineered underdominance (EU), meiotic drive (MD) and Wolbachia {{have been}} {{proposed}} as mechanisms for driving anti-pathogen <b>transgenes</b> into natural populations of insect vectors of human diseases. EU can drive <b>transgenes</b> to high and stable frequencies but requires the release of sizeable numbers of engineered insects. MD and Wolbachia either cannot maintain high frequencies of <b>transgenes</b> or lack appropriate expression in critical tissues, but both can drive the <b>transgenes</b> to spread from very low initial frequencies. Here we use mathematical models to assess the utility of combining EU with MD or withWolbachia. Under some conditions, the combination of EU and MD results in a more efficient transgene-drive strategy than either mechanism alone. This combined strategy could drive the <b>transgenes</b> to stable fixation and would require fewer released insects than EU alone, especially when only males are released. However, a combination of EU and Wolbachia does not work better than EU alone because it requires the release of even more engineered insects...|$|R

These results demonstrate the ease of establishing transgenic lines in X. laevis...|$|R
25|$|Unlike viral vectors, non-viral ones {{avoid the}} risk of {{acquiring}} replication competence. They {{have the capacity to}} deliver a large amount of therapeutic genes repeatedly, and it is convenient to produce them on a large scale. The most important of all, they do not elicit immune responses in the host organism. In spite of having advantages, non-viral vectors have not yet replaced viral vectors due to relatively low efficiency and short-term <b>transgene</b> expression.|$|E
25|$|Transgenic {{rapeseed}} Brassicus napus, hybridized with {{a native}} Japanese species Brassica rapa, {{was found in}} Japan in 2011 after they had been identified 2006 in Québec, Canada. They were persistent over a 6-year study period, without herbicide selection pressure and despite hybridization with the wild form. This was the first report of the introgression—the stable incorporation of genes from one gene pool into another—of an herbicide resistance <b>transgene</b> from Brassica napus into the wild form gene pool.|$|E
25|$|Two {{proteins}} {{are essential}} for the regulation of GLUT-4 expression at a transcriptional level – myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and GLUT4 enhancer factor (GEF). Mutations in the DNA binding regions for either of these proteins results in ablation of <b>transgene</b> GLUT-4 expression. These results prompted a study in 2005 which showed that AMPK directly phosphorylates GEF, but it doesn’t seem to directly activate MEF2. AICAR treatment has been shown, however, to increase transport of both proteins into the nucleus, as well as increase the binding of both to the GLUT-4 promoter region.|$|E
5000|$|A 2009 study {{verified}} {{the original}} {{findings of the}} controversial 2001 study, by finding <b>transgenes</b> in about 1% of 2000 samples of wild maize in Oaxaca, Mexico, despite Nature retracting the 2001 study and a second study failing {{to back up the}} findings of the initial study. The study found that the <b>transgenes</b> are common in some fields, but non-existent in others, hence explaining why a previous study failed to find them. Furthermore, not every laboratory method managed to find the <b>transgenes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Reversible {{transcriptional}} silencing {{of genes}} located near telomeres, termed the telomere position effect (TPE), is well characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TPE {{has also been}} observed in human tumor cell lines, but its function remains unknown. To investigate TPE in normal mammalian cells, we developed clones of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that contain single-copy marker genes integrated adjacent to different telomeres. Analysis of these telomeric <b>transgenes</b> demonstrated that they were expressed at very low levels compared to the same <b>transgenes</b> integrated at interstitial sites. Similar {{to the situation in}} yeast, but in contrast to studies with human tumor cell lines, TPE in mouse ES cells was not reversed with trichostatin A. Prolonged culturing without selection resulted in extensive DNA methylation and complete silencing of telomeric <b>transgenes,</b> which could be reversed by treatment with 5 -azacytidine. Thus, complete silencing of the telomeric <b>transgenes</b> appears to involve a two-step process in which the initial repression is reinforced by DNA methylation. Extensive methylation of the telomeric <b>transgenes</b> was also observed in various tissues and embryonic fibroblasts isolated from transgenic mice. In contrast, telomeric <b>transgenes</b> were not silenced in ES cell lines isolated from 3 -day-old preimplantation embryos, consistent with the hypothesis that TPE plays a {{role in the development of}} the embryo...|$|R
40|$|The exact {{placement}} of foreign DNA into the plant genome produces <b>transgenes</b> with greater structural fidelity and faithful expression. Recombinase-mediated site-specific integration {{has been reported}} for several plant species, including rice and maize. The next challenge will be to develop an integrated strategy to stack and translocate DNA. Being able to append new DNA sequentially to a target site permits the continual use of a previously characterized chromosome location, which justifies the initial investment costs in identifying favorable chromosome targets. Stacking transgenic traits at {{a limited number of}} target sites is also preferable to scattering <b>transgenes</b> all over the genome, as the clustering of <b>transgenes</b> expedites the introgression of bundled traits to elite cultivars, through a process mediated by the translocation of <b>transgenes</b> from one chromosome to another...|$|R
25|$|With {{sufficiently}} {{high levels}} of <b>transgene</b> expression, {{nearly all of the}} heterozygotes (S/s), i.e., the largest segment of the pest population carrying a resistance allele, will be killed before maturation, thus preventing transmission of the resistance gene to their progeny. Refuges (i. e., fields of nontransgenic plants) adjacent to transgenic fields increases the likelihood that homozygous resistant (s/s) individuals and any surviving heterozygotes will mate with susceptible (S/S) individuals from the refuge, instead of with other individuals carrying the resistance allele. As a result, the resistance gene frequency in the population remains lower.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} five thousand known genetic diseases, {{and the potential}} to treat these diseases using transgenic animals is, perhaps, {{one of the most}} promising applications of transgenes. There is a potential to use human gene therapy to replace a mutated gene with an unmutated copy of a <b>transgene</b> in order to treat the genetic disorder. This can be done through the use of Cre-Lox or knockout. Moreover, genetic disorders are being studied through the use of transgenic mice, pigs, rabbits, and rats. More recently, scientists have also begun using transgenic goats to study genetic disorders related to fertility.|$|E
25|$|Corn sampled in 2000 {{from the}} Sierra Juarez, Oaxaca, Mexico {{contained}} a transgenic 35S promoter, while a large sample {{taken by a}} different method from the same region in 2003 and 2004 did not. A sample from another region from 2002 also did not, but directed samples taken in 2004 did, suggesting <b>transgene</b> persistence or re-introduction. A 2009 study found recombinant proteins in 3.1% and 1.8% of samples, most commonly in southeast Mexico. Seed and grain import from the United States could explain the frequency and distribution of transgenes in west-central Mexico, {{but not in the}} southeast. Also, 5.0% of corn seed lots in Mexican corn stocks expressed recombinant proteins despite the moratorium on GM crops.|$|E

The Flax Council of Canada has proposed testing all certified seed {{for the presence of}} GM before it is used for planting (Flax Council of Canada 2011). Further development of valid methods to detect <b>transgenes</b> in flax and vigorous screening of flax breeding material for <b>transgenes</b> is urgently needed and will contribute towards understanding the inheritance of <b>transgenes</b> in the flax germplasm and, importantly, the restoration of export markets.|$|R
25|$|Insertional {{mutagenesis}} – If the DNA {{is integrated}} in a sensitive {{spot in the}} genome, for example in a tumor suppressor gene, the therapy could induce a tumor. This has occurred in clinical trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) patients, in which hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with a corrective <b>transgene</b> using a retrovirus, and {{this led to the}} development of T cell leukemia in 3 of 20 patients. One possible solution is to add a functional tumor suppressor gene to the DNA to be integrated. This may be problematic since the longer the DNA is, the harder it is to integrate into cell genomes. CRISPR technology allows researchers to make much more precise genome changes at exact locations.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970 and 1980s, {{scientists}} {{passed this}} hurdle by inventing procedures for combining the DNA of two vastly different species with genetic engineering. The organisms produced by these procedures were termed transgenic. Transgenesis {{is the same}} as gene therapy {{in the sense that they}} both transform cells for a specific purpose. However, they are completely different in their purposes, as gene therapy aims to cure a defect in cells, and transgenesis seeks to produce a genetically modified organism by incorporating the specific <b>transgene</b> into every cell and changing the genome. Transgenesis will therefore change the germ cells, not only the somatic cells, in order to ensure that the transgenes are passed down to the offspring when the organisms reproduce. Transgenes alter the genome by blocking the function of a host gene; they can either replace the host gene with one that codes for a different protein, or introduce an additional gene.|$|E
25|$|A {{precondition}} for further commercialization of GM forest trees {{is likely to}} be their complete sterility. Plantation trees remain phenotypically similar to their wild cousins in that most are the product of no more than three generations of artificial selection, therefore, the risk of <b>transgene</b> escape by pollination with compatible wild species is high. One of the most credible science-based concerns with GM trees is their potential for wide dispersal of seed and pollen. The fact that pine pollen travels long distances is well established, moving up to 3,000 kilometers from its source. Additionally, many tree species reproduce {{for a long time before}} being harvested. In combination these factors have led some to believe that GM trees are worthy of special environmental considerations over GM crops. Ensuring sterility for GM trees has proven elusive, but efforts are being made. While tree geneticist Steve Strauss predicted that complete containment might be possible by 2020, many questions remain.|$|E
