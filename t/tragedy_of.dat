5|$|Dramatic {{poetry is}} drama written in verse to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, {{sometimes}} related forms in many cultures. Greek tragedy in verse {{dates to the}} 6th century B.C., {{and may have been}} an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama, just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the bianwen verse dramas in China, forerunners of Chinese Opera. East Asian verse dramas also include Japanese Noh. Examples of dramatic poetry in Persian literature include Nizami's two famous dramatic works, Layla and Majnun and Khosrow and Shirin, Ferdowsi's tragedies such as Rostam and Sohrab, Rumi's Masnavi, Gorgani's <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> Vis and Ramin, and Vahshi's <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> Farhad.|$|E

5|$|Although {{considered}} an original character, Simba {{was inspired by}} the character Bambi from Disney's Bambi (1942), as well as the stories of Moses and Joseph from the Bible. Additionally, several similarities have been drawn between Simba and Prince Hamlet from William Shakespeare's <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> the same name. In 1997, The Lion King was adapted into Broadway musical, with actors Scott Irby-Ranniar and Jason Raize originating the roles of the cub and adult Simbas, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} human qualities, we never entirely lose sympathy with Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, and our {{imagination}} participates with theirs in the tragedy. Their imagination makes the two more human and yet also destroys them. As Kinnaird points out (elaborating on {{an idea of}} Joseph W. Donohue, Jr.), Hazlitt in part sees Macbeth as a <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> imagination itself.|$|E

The play followed two characters whose wives are busy having affairs {{and how they}} attempt to keep their wives faithful.

5|$|In 1881 Barlow sat {{as member}} of the Wind Pressure (Railway Structures) Commission {{established}} at {{the recommendation of the}} Tay Bridge report. He led the design of the replacement Tay Bridge (188287) with his son Crawford Barlow as engineer. The new design used large monocoque piers to support a double railway track. The old brick and masonry piers from the first bridge were retained as breakwaters for the new piers upstream. They can still be seen today as a forlorn reminder of the <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> 1879.|$|E

The twins Atreus and Thyestes with their descendants played the leading role in the <b>tragedy</b> <b>of</b> the devolution of power in Mycenae.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{began work}} on Macbeth to provide a sample of what he thought could be {{achieved}} in a new edition of Shakespeare. He got much of his information while working on the Harleian Catalogue, a catalogue of the collection of works and pamphlets owned by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. He published this work, along with a commentary on Sir Thomas Hanmer, 4th Baronet's edition of Shakespeare's plays, as Miscellaneous Observations or Miscellaneous Observations on the <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> Macbeth on 6 April 1745 by Edward Cave.|$|E
5|$|Lady Macbeth {{has gained}} fame along the way. In his 1865 novel Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, Nikolai Leskov updated The <b>Tragedy</b> <b>of</b> Macbeth {{so that it}} takes place among the Imperial Russian {{merchant}} class.
