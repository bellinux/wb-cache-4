5|$|His second {{first-class}} {{season with}} Middlesex {{was much less}} successful than the first; Kartik <b>took</b> <b>only</b> 16 wickets at 34.06 in seven matches, with a best of 4/101 against Derbyshire. He scored 161 runs at 20.12 with a best of 44 against Warwickshire. His one-day form was also lean, yielding six wickets at 33.00 in six matches.|$|E

5|$|The new ball rule {{also meant}} that spin bowling was less {{effective}} in the Tests, so Australia only used one full-time spinner in the Tests, off spinner Johnson, until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring. Together they <b>took</b> <b>only</b> eight wickets.|$|E
5|$|After the film's {{commercial}} success, Roekiah, Kartolo, {{and most}} of the cast and crew of Terang Boelan were signed to Tan's Film, first appearing for the company in their 1938 production Fatima. They acted together in two more films before Mochtar left the company in 1940; through these films, Roekiah and Mochtar became the colony's first on-screen couple. Mochtar's replacement, Rd Djoemala, acted with Roekiah in four films, although these were less successful. After the Japanese invaded the Indies in 1942, Roekiah <b>took</b> <b>only</b> one more film role before her death; most of her time was used entertaining Japanese forces.|$|E

5|$|Alec Coxon took match {{figures of}} 4/113 for Yorkshire against Australia, taking four middle-order wickets, and scored 21 and 16 not {{out in the}} middle-order. He came into the team as an all-rounder, even though his {{performances}} {{during the rest of}} the English season had been mediocre; he had a batting average of 20.25 for the summer and <b>took</b> <b>only</b> ten wickets in seven matches prior to the county fixture against Australia. Bowes saw him as an attacking bowler compatible with Robins's strategic thinking.|$|E
5|$|Although Mendelssohn {{attributed}} {{great importance}} to musical education, and made a substantial commitment to the Conservatoire he founded in Leipzig, he did not greatly enjoy teaching and <b>took</b> <b>only</b> a very few private pupils who he believed had notable qualities. Amongst such students were the composer William Sterndale Bennett, the pianist Camille-Marie Stamaty, the violinist and composer Julius Eichberg, and Walther von Goethe (grandson of the poet). At the Leipzig Conservatoire Mendelssohn taught classes in composition and ensemble playing.|$|E
5|$|Clay, though embittered {{by another}} of his many defeats for the presidency, was appeased by Tyler's {{withdrawal}} from the still-unresolved Senate race, which would permit the election of Rives, and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison/Tyler ticket.

Van Buren <b>took</b> <b>only</b> seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress.|$|E

5|$|During 1885 Somerset {{suffered}} badly {{from their}} lack of a strong bowling attack. Playing six matches, there were a total of 120wickets on offer, but Somerset's bowlers <b>took</b> <b>only</b> 67. Edward Bastard, a slow left-arm orthodox bowler, was the county's leading wicket-taker, claiming 25wickets during his four appearances, {{at an average of}} 15.32. His bowling average was not far below that of George Lohmann, who finished the season as the country's leading wicket taker, with 142wickets from his 24matches. Unfortunately for Somerset, Bastard was only able to play in four of the county's six matches, and of the other bowlers, the best bowling average was the 25.85 managed by Bill Roe, who <b>took</b> <b>only</b> seven wickets. Charles Winter, who took the next highest total of wickets, only managed to claim 15 in his 6appearances. Batting was the strongest aspect of Somerset's play, but the club lacked the strength-in-depth of other county teams. Herbie Hewett, playing his second season of first-class cricket, finished with the highest batting average for the county with 35.28, a respectable average which exceeded a number of England Test batsmen that season. Only four Somerset batsman passed 50runs in an innings– Hewett, Octavius Radcliffe, Bill Roe, and Charles Winter– and only Radcliffe advanced to reach a century during the season.|$|E
5|$|Ebsary {{had more}} {{difficult}} {{times in the}} 2006–07 WNCL season. She <b>took</b> <b>only</b> three wickets at 60.33 and an economy rate of 5.14, the worst average and economy rate she had recorded for a WNCL season. She never took more than one wicket in any match. Her batting also regressed, making 101 runs at 14.42, more than half coming in a 51 against New South Wales in the last match of the season. This was Ebsary's last season for her native state as she moved to Western Australia for the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|For {{the home}} Ashes series of 195051 Tallon was fit {{once more and}} {{available}} for national selection. Despite making only 37 runs in four innings in the lead-up matches, Tallon was chosen for all five Tests. He had a poor time with the bat, making only 39runs {{at an average of}} just 6.50. He <b>took</b> <b>only</b> eight catches, but kept tidily to retain his place in the team. His performances for Queensland were hardly more productive; he scored 161 runs at 16.10 and aside from a rain-affected draw, his state lost their remaining six matches.|$|E

5|$|Hood {{was laid}} down at Chatham Dockyard on 12 August 1889 and was {{launched}} on 30 July 1891, the Viscountess Hood christening her. She finished her sea trials in May 1893 and was commissioned on 1 June 1893 {{at the cost}} of £926,396. Her assignment to the Mediterranean Fleet was delayed when she sprang a leak in her forward compartments on 7 June as a result of faulty riveting and excessive strain on the hull when she had been docked. Repairs <b>took</b> <b>only</b> two days, and the ship left Sheerness for the Mediterranean on 18 June.|$|E
5|$|In 194142, McCabe {{played his}} final {{first-class}} match. He scored 8 and 41 as Queensland took a 17-run win. Ten days later, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, prompting {{the start of}} the war in the Pacific. With that, first-class cricket was cancelled and did not resume until 194546, ending McCabe's career at the age of just 31. He had 24 wins and four losses in 38 first-class matches as captain for all teams. In his last three seasons, McCabe <b>took</b> <b>only</b> one wicket, from 18 overs of bowling.|$|E
5|$|In a low-scoring {{match against}} Queensland, New South Wales started {{the final day}} needing 142 to win. Morris scored 108 in only 80 balls, {{steering}} his team to victory before lunch. Previously, only Bradman had scored a century before lunch in a Shield match. The innings <b>took</b> <b>only</b> 82 minutes and Morris promptly returned to {{his work as a}} salesman. Morris rounded off his Shield campaign with 110 against South Australia. The Western Australian Cricket Association attempted to lure Morris to switch states, but he declined.|$|E

5|$|In early 1988, Butthole Surfers {{were ready}} to record a new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, {{choosing}} a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions <b>took</b> <b>only</b> one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years. The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.|$|E
5|$|Macartney {{finished}} with 61 in the drawn Fifth Test at The Oval, {{to head the}} run-scoring with 300 runs at 42.85 as Australia took the series 3–0. He did not take a wicket in the Tests. Macartney then scored 121 against Gloucestershire in an innings victory immediately after the Tests, but did not pass 45 in the remaining four matches of the tour. Macartney topped the batting aggregates and averages with 2,317 runs at 59.41 in the first-class matches. He <b>took</b> <b>only</b> eight wickets at 32.63 for the entire tour.|$|E
5|$|Macartney's form tailed off thereafter; in the {{following}} six weeks, he made only one score beyond 40 in 11 innings and <b>took</b> <b>only</b> three wickets in nine matches. This included the Fifth Test, when he scored 25 and 16 and failed to take a wicket as England won the Test by 289 runs {{and with it the}} Ashes. Macartney topped the batting averages with 473 runs at 94.60 and took four wickets at 53.75. Macartney returned to form in the final first-class fixture of the season with an unbeaten 100 against and England XI.|$|E
