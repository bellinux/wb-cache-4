40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{theoretically}} {{the behaviors of}} the magnetic excitations(MEs) in the normal and nematic phases of iron pnictides. <b>The</b> normal state <b>MEs</b> exhibit commensurability to diamond and to square-like structure transition {{with the increase of}} energy. This structure transition persists in the spin and orbital scenarios of nematic phases, although <b>the</b> <b>MEs</b> show anisotropic behaviors due to the C 4 symmetry breaking induced by the nematic orders. <b>The</b> <b>MEs</b> exhibit distinct energy evolution behaviors between the spin and orbital scenarios of nematicity. For the spinnematic scenario, the anisotropy of <b>the</b> <b>MEs</b> persists up to the high energy region. In contrast, for the orbital-nematic scenario, it reduces dramatically in the low energy region and is negligible in the high energy region. These distinct behaviors of <b>the</b> <b>MEs</b> are attributed to the different origins between the spin and orbital scenarios of nematic orders. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
5|$|Generals Alfred Keller and Adolf Galland had {{scheduled}} {{an inspection}} at Achmer {{for the afternoon}} of 7November1944. Galland had already visited Kommando Nowotny several times and was deeply concerned over the high attrition rate and meager success achieved by <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262. After inspecting the two airfields at Achmer and Hesepe, {{he stayed in the}} Penterknapp barracks discussing the problems of the past few weeks. Several pilots openly expressed their doubts as to the readiness of <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262for combat operations.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Nowotny {{was made}} {{commander}} of a specialist unit dubbed Kommando Nowotny, flying the newly developed Messerschmitt Me 262 out of airfields near Osnabrück. The unit {{not only had}} to contend with the enemy, but also with working through the 'teething' phase of <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262and developing the tactics appropriate for a jet unit. On 7 October, Nowotny downed a B-24 Liberator bomber, his first aerial victory on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|On 2 November 1944, Welter was {{transferred}} to II. Gruppe/Nachtjagdgeschwader 11 (NJG11), a reformation of his former unit. Here he was given command of a special Kommando subordinate to II./NJG11, set up on 11 November 1944 at Erprobungsstelle Rechlin's southern Lärz airbase (2 November 1944 – 28 January 1945), and dedicated to performing nocturnal interception with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter of RAF Mosquitos attacking the Berlin area. According to some sources, Oberleutnant Welter added a Lancaster to his growing list of Mosquitos {{on the night of}} 12 December 1944, the first night victory by a jet fighter. Other sources state that his first aerial victory flying <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262 was claimed either on the night of 2 January 1945 or 5 January 1945. On 28 January 1945, the unit initially known as Sonderkommando Stamp, named after its founder Major Gerhard Stamp and then Sonderkommando Welter, was re-designated 10. Staffel/NJG11 and transferred to the airfield at Burg near Magdeburg (28 January 1945 – 12 April 1945). The unit was equipped with Me 262 jet fighters, and tasked with intercepting Mosquito bomber aircraft of No. 8 Group RAF in the Berlin area. <b>The</b> <b>Me</b> 262 were not fitted with radar and used the aid of ground control and the searchlight defences, partially a Wilde Sau form of night combat. Welter had claimed three aerial victories while flying <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262 by early February 1945.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} myths involving Inanna comes from an ancient Sumerian epic poem entitled Inanna and Enki, which tells the story of how Inanna stole <b>the</b> sacred <b>mes</b> from Enki, <b>the</b> ancient Sumerian god of culture. In ancient Sumerian mythology, <b>the</b> <b>mes</b> were sacred powers or properties belonging the gods that allowed human civilization to exist. Each me embodied one specific aspect of human culture. These aspects were very diverse and <b>the</b> <b>mes</b> listed in <b>the</b> poem include abstract concepts such as Truth, Victory, and Counsel, technologies such as writing and weaving, and also social constructs such as law, priestly offices, kingship, and prostitution. <b>The</b> <b>mes</b> were believed to grant power over all the aspects of civilization, both positive and negative.|$|R
50|$|In the myth, Inanna travels {{from her}} own city of Uruk to Enki's city of Eridu, where she visits his temple, the E-Abzu. Inanna is greeted by Enki's sukkal, Isimud, who offers her food and drink. Inanna starts up a {{drinking}} competition with Enki. Then, once she has gotten Enki thoroughly intoxicated, Inanna cunningly persuades Enki into giving her <b>the</b> <b>mes</b> using clever rhetoric. Inanna flees from Eridu in the Boat of Heaven, taking <b>the</b> <b>mes</b> back with her to Uruk. Enki wakes up to discover that <b>the</b> <b>mes</b> are gone and asks Isimud {{what has happened to}} them. Isimud replies that Enki has given all of them to Inanna. Enki becomes infuriated and sends multiple sets of fierce monsters after Inanna to take back <b>the</b> <b>mes</b> before she reaches the city of Uruk. Inanna's sukkal, Ninshubur, however, fends off all of the monsters that Enki sends after them. Through Ninshubur's aid, Inanna successfully manages to take <b>the</b> <b>mes</b> back with her to the city of Uruk. After Inanna escapes, Enki reconciles with her and bids her a positive farewell. It is possible that this legend may represent a historic transfer of power from the city of Eridu to the city of Uruk. It is also possible that this legend may be a symbolic representation of Inanna's maturity and her readiness to become the Queen of Heaven.|$|R
5|$|On 26 April, {{he assumed}} {{command of the}} unit when Galland was wounded. Bär {{possibly}} flew his first operational sortie with JV 44 on 27 April 1945. Flying <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262 A-1/U5, a six MK 108 cannon prototype, he was accompanied by Major Wilhelm Herget and the non-commissioned officer NCO (Unteroffizier) Franz Köster when the trio engaged American fighters over Riem; Bär claimed one aerial victory. While not flying operationally, Bär {{spent most of his}} time giving hasty instruction to the new pilots still being assigned to JV44. With JV44, he achieved his final four aerial victories (3 P-47s and 1 Mosquito) on 28 April, bringing his total to 220. All told, he had achieved 16 victories in <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262, making him the second most successful Jet Expert of the war, which he finished as a Lieutenant Colonel (Oberstleutnant).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Me</b> 262, {{while not}} a war winner, might have {{extended}} the Defence of the Reich campaign. The problems with the engines, failures of production priorities and Hitler's meddling are well known, but the long delay between operational testing, tactical and doctrinal development and training were largely Galland's fault.|$|E
5|$|The {{unit was}} officially formed on 22 February 1945. Galland did {{everything}} he could to introduce <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262s to the wing as quickly as possible. Göring showed sympathy for Galland's efforts, which thus far had only 16 operational jets in February. General Josef Kammhuber was asked to assist Galland. Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51 or Bomber Wing 51), 6 and 27 were behind their training schedules on jets, and they were to hand over their pilots and Me 262s to Jagdgeschwader 7 and Kampfgeschwader 54. Galland added a suggestion that all experienced fighter pilots flying with Bf 109 or Fw 190 units should be made to join <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262 unit. If this could be done Galland believed he could get 150 jets in action against the USAAF fleets. The general chaos and impending collapse prevented his plans from being realised.|$|E

5|$|Born in Braunschweig, Waldmann {{volunteered for}} {{service in the}} Luftwaffe in 1940. After {{training}} at various pilot and fighter-pilot schools, he was posted to Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing), operating on the Eastern Front, in August 1942. Here Waldmann fought in the aerial battles over Stalingrad, the Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the Crimea. He was credited with 84 aerial victories before briefly being transferred to the Western Front, where he was credited with one aerial victory. Back on the Eastern Front, Waldmann accumulated further victories, bringing his score to 125 victories by end of May 1944. He then fought in the skies over France after the Western Allied Invasion of Normandy, claiming seven aerial victories, before converting to the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter in late 1944. Flying <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262, Waldmann shot down two North American P-51 Mustangs on 22 February 1945 before being killed in a mid-air collision {{with one of his}} squadron members on 18 March 1945 near Schwarzenbek, Holstein.|$|E
5|$|During the {{remainder}} of World War II, Bär was credited with 130 other aerial victories, including 16 while flying {{one of the first}} jet fighters, <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262, an achievement which would normally have earned him the coveted Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. Hermann Göring's personal dislike of Bär, coupled with Bär's insubordinate character and lack of military discipline, deprived him of this award. After World War II, Bär continued his career as an aviator. He was killed in a flying accident on 28 April 1957 near Braunschweig.|$|E
5|$|Galland did {{not give}} up. He made {{repeated}} appeals for Me 262 fighter aircraft. Göring refused Galland's requests to have equal numbers of Me 262 fighter and bomber variants built. However, Galland's close relationship with Albert Speer, the German armaments minister, enabled him to retain a small operational number. Even this was difficult, as Hitler had taken personal control of turbo-jet production and checked where each batch of the aircraft were being deployed. It was not until September 1944 that Hitler rescinded his directive that <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262 {{be used as a}} fighter-bomber. Galland ignored the order and formed Eprobungskommando 262 to test <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262 against high-flying Allied reconnaissance aircraft. He selected the highly decorated pilot Werner Thierfelder as its commander. Hitler heard of the experiment through Milch and ordered Göring {{to put a stop to}} it at a meeting on 29 May 1944. Galland persisted with the experiments and ordered operations to be continued. They achieved isolated successes until Thierfelder was shot down and killed by P-51 Mustangs on 18 July 1944. On 20 August, Hitler finally agreed to allow one in every 20 Me 262 to go into service with the Jagdwaffe which allowed Galland to build all–jet units.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{controversy}} surrounding Welter's claims for success in nocturnal aerial combat with <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262 stems from a memorandum written by Welter on 29 May 1945 for his British captors. In this memorandum Welter stated that between December 1944 {{and the end of}} January 1945, as the sole pilot of Kommando Welter, he flew seven Me 262 sorties and achieved three victories against Mosquito aircraft and two victories against Lancaster aircraft. Welter further stated that from the formation of 10./NJG11 on 28 January 1945 {{to the end of the}} war, 10./NJG11 flew around another 63 operational sorties and claimed a further 38 victories against Mosquito aircraft at night and five victories against Mosquito aircraft by day; his share being 20 Mosquitos at night and two during the day. Thus, according to the memo, a total of 25 Mosquitoes and two Lancasters were claimed in aerial combat by Welter, flying <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262 with the Kommando/Staffel, while other pilots of the Staffel claimed a further 21 kills (of which three were achieved with the two-seater Me 262). Official Luftwaffe documents show that by 4 April 1945, 10./NJG11 had claimed 34 aerial victories, of which only one was claimed in a two-seater Me262. Research of RAF records show that at most 15 Mosquitoes could have been possibly destroyed by Kommando Welter—10./NJG11.|$|E

5|$|By late April, {{the war was}} {{effectively}} over. On 1 May 1945, Galland attempted {{to make contact with}} United States Army forces to negotiate the surrender of his unit. The act itself was dangerous. SS forces roamed the countryside and towns executing anyone who was considering capitulation. The Americans requested that Galland fly his unit and Me 262s to a USAAF controlled airfield. Galland declined citing poor weather and technical problems. In reality, Galland was not going to hand over Me 262 jets to the Americans. Galland had harboured the belief that the Western Alliance would soon be at war with the Soviet Union, and he wanted to join American forces and to use his unit in the coming war to free Germany from Communist occupation. Galland replied, making his whereabouts known to the Americans, and offering his surrender once they arrived at the Tegernsee hospital where he was being treated. Galland then ordered his unit, which had then moved to Salzburg and Innsbruck, to destroy their Me 262s. At the time of his surrender, Galland had filed claims for 104 Allied aircraft shot down. His claims included seven with <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262.|$|E

The research question was around issues which Unisa academic staff members experienced during the course of their enrolment for <b>the</b> <b>MEd</b> in ODL. Relevant scholarly literature on online learning, theories for online learning, and previous research on online learning, was surveyed in this regard. Variation theory which framed the study through a phenomenographic research lens was described. Interviews were conducted with seven participants from the students on <b>the</b> <b>MEd</b> in ODL programme. Postings on MyUnisa Discussion Forum which were treated as data were analysed in relation to the aspects raised in the interviews. The findings revealed students’ varied online experiences in the three main aspects namely, experience and understanding, understanding the object of learning and learning objects. Important recommendations made, were based on the findings.

5|$|By spring 1944, <b>the</b> <b>Me</b> 262 was {{sufficiently}} ready for operational service. By this time, Galland faced rivalries amongst the Luftwaffe command over {{how best to}} employ the aircraft. Dietrich Peltz, commander of the IX. Fliegerkorps (9th Air Corps), {{wanted to use the}} aircraft as a weapon against a future Allied landing in France. Peltz saw the aircraft as an ideal fast bomber which could evade the overwhelming numbers of Allied piston-engine fighters and attack the landing grounds. Peltz also wished to use highly trained bomber pilots who he felt could better serve as home defence fighter pilots in place of the overextended and overworked Jagdwaffe. Their blind-weather experience and training, and background in multi-engine aircraft made them ideal for these operations in his view. In the first five months of 1944, Peltz' conventional bomber force had suffered a significant defeat over England in Operation Steinbock but it did not dull his appetite for offensive action or dent his reputation with Göring. Galland argued against his suggestion. Instead, Galland thought the bomber corps should be disbanded and its pilots converted onto fighters. Göring adopted Peltz' idea to impress Hitler and regain his waning influence.|$|E
