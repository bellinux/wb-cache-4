In 1888, before any of the Siegfrieds or Odins had been laid down, Caprivi was {{selected}} to replace Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who had been forced out of the position by the new Kaiser, Wilhelm II; Caprivi in turn was replaced by Vice Admiral Alexander von Monts. Monts, a veteran naval officer, opposed Caprivi's policy on coastal defense, and instead proposed building four new [...] s. These ships replaced what would have been the last two of the coastal defenders for which Caprivi had called. This set Germany on the trend of building large, ocean-going battleships for the next two decades.

The latter, who sprang at once into the middle of his subject, was nervous {{and more than a little}} bitter. He explained that he had resigned his commission and was therefore free to speak his mind. He spoke of enormous military preparations in Germany and a general air of tense expectation. Against whom were these preparations? Without an earthly doubt against Germany's greatest rival, whose millions of young men, even in this hour of danger, preferred playing or watching football or cricket on Saturday afternoons to realising their duty. The conclusion of an ill-pointed but earnest speech was punctuated by the furtive entrance into the hall of a small boy selling evening newspapers, and there was a <b>temporary</b> <b>diversion</b> from any interest in the proceedings on the part of the younger portion of the audience, whilst they satisfied themselves as to the result of various Cup Ties. The Member of Parliament then descended upon them in a whirlwind of oratory and in his best House of Commons style. He spoke of black clouds and of the cold breeze that went before the coming thunderstorm. He pointed to the collapse of every great nation throughout history who had neglected the arts of self-defence. He appealed to the youth of the nation to prepare themselves to guard their womenkind, their homes, the sacred soil of their country, and at that point was interrupted by a drowsy member of the audience with stentorian lungs, who seemed just at that moment to have waked up.|$|E
6000|$|So Bert fell on {{his feet}} again, and sat eating cold meat and good bread and mustard and {{drinking}} very good beer, and telling in the roughest outline and with the omissions and inaccuracies of statement natural to his type of mind, the simple story of his adventures. He told how he and a [...] "gentleman friend" [...] had been visiting the seaside for their health, how a [...] "chep" [...] came along in a balloon and fell out as he fell in, how he had drifted to Franconia, how the Germans had seemed to mistake him for some one and had [...] "took him prisoner" [...] and brought him to New York, how {{he had been to}} Labrador and back, how he had got to Goat Island and found himself there alone. He omitted the matter of the Prince and the Butteridge aspect of the affair, not out of any deep deceitfulness, but because he felt the inadequacy of his narrative powers. He wanted everything to seem easy and natural and correct, to present himself as a trustworthy and understandable Englishman in a sound mediocre position, to whom refreshment and accommodation might be given with freedom and confidence. When his fragmentary story came to New York and the battle of Niagara, they suddenly produced newspapers which had been lying about on the table, and began to check him and question him by these vehement accounts. It became evident to him that his descent had revived and roused to flames again a discussion, a topic, that had been burning continuously, that had smouldered only through sheer exhaustion of material during the <b>temporary</b> <b>diversion</b> of the gramophone, a discussion that had drawn these men together, rifle in hand, the one supreme topic of the whole world, the War and the methods of the War. He found any question of his personality and his personal adventures falling into the background, found himself taken for granted, and no more than a source of information. The ordinary affairs of life, the buying and selling of everyday necessities, the cultivation of the ground, the tending of beasts, was going on as it were by force of routine, as the common duties of life go on in a house whose master lies under the knife of some supreme operation. The overruling interest was furnished by those great Asiatic airships that went upon incalculable missions across the sky, the crimson-clad swordsmen who might come fluttering down demanding petrol, or food, or news. These men were asking, all the continent was asking, [...] "What are we to do? What can we try? How can we get at them?" [...] Bert fell into his place as an item, ceased even in his own thoughts to be a central and independent thing.|$|E

40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} <b>temporary</b> fecal <b>diversion</b> in colorectal and perianal Crohn’s disease. Method. We retrospectively identified 29 consecutive patients (14 females, 15 males; median age: 30. 0 years, range: 18 – 76) undergoing <b>temporary</b> fecal <b>diversion</b> for colorectal (n= 14), ileal (n= 4), and/or perianal Crohn’s disease (n= 22). Follow-up was in median 33. 0 (3 – 103) months. Response to fecal diversion, rate of stoma reversal, and relapse rate after stoma reversal were recorded. Results. The response to <b>temporary</b> fecal <b>diversion</b> was complete remission in 4 / 29 (13. 8 %), partial remission in 12 / 29 (41. 4 %), no change in 7 / 29 (24. 1 %), and progress in 6 / 29 (20. 7 %). Stoma reversal was performed in 19 out of 25 patients (76 %) available for follow-up. Of these, the majority (15 / 19, 78. 9 %) needed further surgical therapies for a relapse of the same pathology previously leading to <b>temporary</b> fecal <b>diversion,</b> including colorectal resections (10 / 19, 52. 6 %) and creation of a definitive stoma (7 / 19, 36. 8 %).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the lives of}} men in south-western rural Nicaragua. But contrary to anthropological analyses of masculinity focused on public performance or investigations of gender in Nicaragua centered {{on the concept of}} machismo, I use a materialist theoretical framework in studying the everyday interactions of men. Through participant-observation based field research, I was able to scrutinize some of the more important aspects of men's lives that have been overlooked by many scholars of masculinity such as household relations and the world of work. Although I also examined practices more typically associated with men in the literature such as drinking, fighting, and womanizing, I did this from the standpoint of vagancia, a local category of meaning used by men to understand such acts as <b>temporary</b> <b>diversions</b> and not as crucial components of their persona. Through my research, I found that most of the men I encountered in rural Nicaragua derived their sense of manhood more from being able providers for their households or successful agricultural workers than from the performance of symbolic acts in a public setting. Moreover, men developed gender-based identities directly related with their work as macheteros (machete workers). Ultimately, this thesis demonstrates that if we want to better understand men in specific cultural settings, we should prioritize in our analyses the aspects of their lives they find most important and not reduce them to pre-conceived categorizations such as machismo that have little local relevance...|$|R

The project was planned and coordinated by the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs through the John Day Basin Office in Prairie City, Oregon.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the overall risk of a permanent stoma in patients with complicated perianal Crohn’s disease, and to identify risk factors predicting stoma carriage. A total of 102 consecutive patients presented with the first manifestation of complicated perianal Crohn’s disease in our outpatient department between 1992 and 1995. Ninety-seven patients (95 %) could be followed up at a median of 16 years after first diagnosis of Crohn’s disease. Patients were sent a standardized questionnaire and patient charts were reviewed with respect to the recurrence of perianal abscesses or fistulas and surgical treatment, including fecal diversion. Factors predictive of permanent stoma carriage were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis. Thirty of 97 patients (31 %) with complicated perianal Crohn’s disease eventually required a permanent stoma. The median time from first diagnosis of Crohn’s disease to permanent fecal diversion was 8. 5 years (range 0 – 23 years). <b>Temporary</b> fecal <b>diversion</b> became necessary in 51 of 97 patients (53 %), but could be successfully removed in 24 of 51 patients (47 %). Increased rates of permanent fecal diversion were observed in 54 % of patients with complex perianal fistulas and in 54 % of patients with rectovaginal fistulas, as well as in patients that had undergone subtotal colon resection (60 %), left-sided colon resection (83 %), or rectal resection (92 %). An increased risk for permanent stoma carriage was identified by multivariate analysis for complex perianal fistulas (odds ratio [OR] 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2 – 18), <b>temporary</b> fecal <b>diversion</b> (OR 8; 95 % CI 2 – 35), fecal incontinence (OR 21, 95 % CI 3 – 165), or rectal resection (OR 30; 95 % CI 3 – 179).

40|$|Purpose: Although valve {{ablation}} is {{the treatment}} of choice in patients with posterior urethral valves (PLTV), <b>temporary</b> high (ureterostomy) <b>diversion</b> remains controversial. In this study we evaluated the effect of bilateral Sober high urinary diversion on renal and bladder function. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 36 patients with PUV who underwent bilateral Sober-type diversion. Following valve ablation urodynamic studies were done in all patients after diversion and repeated after ureterostomy closure. The mean duration of diversion was 55 months. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), renal dysplasia, serum creatinine during followup and urodynamic parameters were recorded. Results: All patients underwent endoscopic valve ablation. Renal function impairment {{at the end of}} followup was present in 15 patients. Renal dysplasia was found in 10 patients, while VUR was present in 16 {{at the time of the}} first urodynamic studies. Urodynamic studies after ureterostomy closure showed well preserved bladder capacity or compliance in 80 % and 69 % of cases, respectively. About a third of patients showed increased capacity and normal compliance. Univariate analysis showed that VUR, urinary tract infection and renal dysplasia significantly correlated with impaired renal function. On multivariate analysis renal dysplasia was an independent prognostic factor for poor prognosis. Conclusions: In patients with PLTV <b>temporary</b> high <b>diversion</b> of the Sober type does not have a negative influence on bladder function. It immediately releases high intrarenal pressures but only improves renal function temporarily and may contribute to postpone the time of end stage renal failure. Renal dysplasia dictates long-term renal outcomes in this group...|$|R
