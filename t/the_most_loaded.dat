6000|$|The fact of {{the bottom}} of the river valleys being flatter towards the watershed, is {{connected}} with that of their fall being less rapid at that part of their course; this is the consequence of the great extent in breadth of the most elevated portion of the chain. If we select the Teesta as an example, and measure its fall at three points of its course, we shall find the results very different. From its principal source at Lake Cholamoo, it descends from 17,000 to 15,000 feet, with a fall of 60 feet to the mile; from 15,000 to 12,000 feet, the fall is 140 feet to the mile; in the third part of its course it descends from 12,000 to 5000 feet, with a fall of 160 feet to the mile; and in the lower part the descent is from 5000 feet to the plains of India at 300 feet, giving a fall of 50 feet to the mile. There is, however, no marked limit to these divisions; its valley. gradually contracts, and its course gradually becomes more rapid. It is worthy of notice that the fall is at its maximum through that part of its valley of which the flanks are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>loaded</b> with snow; where the old moraines are very conspicuous, and where the present accumulations from landslips, etc., are the most extensive.* [It is not my intention to discuss here the geological bearings of this curious question; but I may state that as the humidity of the climate of the middle region of the river-course tends to increase the fall in a given space, so I believe the dryness of the climate of the loftier country has the opposite effect, by preserving those accumulations which have raised the floors of the valleys and rendered them level.] ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{single-ended}} single-phase systems {{where the}} Earth and neutral are combined (TN-C, and {{the part of}} TN-C-S systems which uses a combined neutral and earth core), {{if there is a}} contact problem in the PEN conductor, then all parts of the earthing system beyond the break will rise to the potential of the L conductor. In an unbalanced multi-phase system, the potential of the earthing system will move towards that of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>loaded</b> line conductor. Such a rise in the potential of the neutral beyond the break is known as a neutral inversion. Therefore, TN-C connections must not go across plug/socket connections or flexible cables, where there is a higher probability of contact problems than with fixed wiring. There is also a risk if a cable is damaged, which can be mitigated by the use of concentric cable construction and multiple earth electrodes. Due to the (small) risks of the lost neutral raising 'earthed' metal work to a dangerous potential, coupled with the increased shock risk from proximity to good contact with true earth, the use of TN-C-S supplies is banned in the UK for caravan sites and shore supply to boats, and strongly discouraged for use on farms and outdoor building sites, and in such cases it is recommended to make all outdoor wiring TT with RCD and a separate earth electrode.|$|E

50|$|The POL (called {{by older}} texts: oblique {{portion of the}} sMCL) is a fascial {{expansion}} with three main components: superficial, central (tibial), and capsular. The central arm is the strongest and thickest. It arises from the semimembranosus tendon and connects anterior and distal to the gastrocnemius tubercle via the posterior joint capsule. The POL, therefore, is not a stand-alone structure, but a thickening of the posteromedial joint capsule. It stabilizes internal rotation of the knee through all degrees of flexion but bears <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>load</b> when internally rotated in full extension. It also acts as a secondary external rotation stabilizer.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe classic {{assembly}} line balancing problem (ALBP) basically consists of assigning {{a set of}} tasks {{to a group of}} workstations while maintaining the tasks' precedence relations. When the objective is to minimize the number of workstations m for a given cycle time CT, the problem is referred to as ALBP- 1; if the objective is to minimize CT given m, then the problem is called ALBP- 2. The only objective in ALBP- 2 is to minimize CT, i. e., the workload of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> heavily <b>loaded</b> workstation (<b>the</b> bottleneck). However, considering the second-biggest and third-biggest etc. workloads, can be important. Distributing a workload among six workstations as 10, 10, 10, 4, 3, 3, {{is not the same as}} distributing it as 10, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6. The CT value is the same, but the second distribution is beyond question more reliable and balanced. In this paper, we present and formalize a new {{assembly line}} balancing problem: the Lexicographic Bottleneck Assembly Line Balancing Problem (LB-ALBP).
