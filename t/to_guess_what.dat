25|$|Name the Game – A gaming trivia segment where {{footage of}} a game is shown and the {{audience}} is asked <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> it is.|$|E
25|$|Clued In - In this mini-game, a {{character}} is slowly {{drawn on the}} screen while clues are presented to guide players. In this game, players have <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> character is being drawn on the screen.|$|E
25|$|This segment, which {{appeared}} during Livinia Nixon's {{time on the}} show, featured footage from movies or TV shows sent in by viewers, which contained a mistake or blooper of some sort (such as a production error). Audience members had <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> the mistake was.|$|E
5000|$|West Hollywood: Kate's father tries <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what's</b> [...] "wrong" [...] {{with the}} [...] "tall, good looking" [...] guy she {{brought to the}} {{retirement}} party, alluding to the city's homosexual population.|$|R

25|$|The game borrows its {{elements}} from the Scene It? DVD game franchise and is hosted by Genie {{from the film}} Aladdin who introduces and gives results for each round. Each game contains 15 rounds and takes about 30–40 minutes to play. Some rounds require watching clips without the sound, and some where players have to answer trivia questions about Disney films, and some where players have <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> the artist is drawing. Disney Think Fast is currently the only game developed by Magenta Software that has been released for the Wii.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E
25|$|Disney Think Fast is a trivia game show-based game. Each game can {{be played}} with up to four players which players can play as various Disney {{characters}} including Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. The game also includes 4 stages, including Ocean Grotto, Regent's Park, Hawaiian Beach and The Pridelands. Each game takes about 30–40 minutes and contains 15 rounds. Some rounds require players having to watch movie clips without the sound, some where players have to answer multiple-choice Trivia Questions about Disney Movies, and some where players have <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> the artist is drawing. There are over 5,000 questions, and each one has 2-4 multiple choice answers. Players get more points for correct answers as the rounds increase, and in later rounds, players get penalized for choosing wrong answers.|$|E
60|$|I fell <b>to</b> <b>guessing</b> <b>what</b> her {{feelings}} were; {{for the life}} of me I could not tell from her face. I was sorry for Miss Trevor in spite of the fact that she had neglected to ask my advice before falling in love with the Celebrity. I asked her to go canoeing with me. She refused kindly but very firmly.|$|R
50|$|The {{player has}} to uncover gems which are hidden behind some tiles {{and has to}} break all other tiles on the board. Numerical hints above {{and to the left}} of the board tell the player where the hidden gems are. Gems are picked up with a hand cursor whereas cursed tiles are smashed with a hammer. Jokers help if the player has <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what's</b> behind a tile.|$|R

25|$|The script {{laid out}} quite {{specifically}} how characters were {{to move and}} behave, but the actors themselves chose how to bring these directions to life. For example, when Alec Hardy tells Ellie Miller that her husband is the murderer, the script called for Hardy to come round to Miller's {{side of the table}} and for Miller to vomit after the revelation. David Tennant was allowed to improvise how he came round the table and whether he sat or stood. Olivia Colman improvised the portrayal of nausea by rising, crouching, turning to the wall, and vomiting. Director James Strong knew that this put stress on his technical crew, who often had <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> technical adjustments had to be made (such as lighting or the placement of microphones) in order to accommodate this unusual style of direction and acting. But he felt this spontaneity freed the cast and permitted them to deliver far more intense performances. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right, as Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes.|$|E
500|$|Cannon Fodder 2 {{retains the}} same {{mechanics}} and core gameplay of its predecessor, prompting reviewers to say: [...] "It's still as wonderfully playable as it ever was", and to acknowledge [...] "all the amazing control and playability" [...] of the original. Reviewers {{complained about the}} lack of plot, with Amiga Power stating: [...] "There's little explanation as to why you're doing this [...] and absolutely none in the game. As a result, the game doesn't hang together." [...] AUI called the plot [...] "pointless", while Amiga Computing called it a [...] "slight problem", saying [...] "you have <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> {{is going on in the}} game because there's no plot explanation [...] it's all very confusing!" ...|$|E
500|$|Once in the maze, The Nameless One converses with Ravel, {{who asks}} him, [...] "What {{can change the}} nature of a man?" [...] — a {{question}} that plays a prominent role throughout the game. Ravel is pleased with The Nameless One's answer because he offers his own thoughts; she claims she has killed many men in the past who, instead of giving their own answers, tried <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> her answer might be. As the conversation progresses, Ravel explains that, in a past life, The Nameless One had asked her to make him immortal; however, the ritual she performed was flawed, causing him to lose his memory each time he died. She reveals that the mortality she separated from him was not destroyed, and that {{as long as he was}} alive, his mortality must still be intact. She does not know where his mortality is, but suggests that the fallen deva Trias might.|$|E
50|$|A {{water cooler}} {{effect is a}} phenomenon, {{occurring}} when employees at a workplace gather around the office water cooler and chat. It is a synonym for gathering and connecting people in a certain environment (e.g. the office). When a television program, like a soap-opera or series, is talked about among many people (mostly related <b>to</b> <b>guessing</b> <b>what</b> {{will happen in the}} next episode) {{it can be said that}} the program has a water cooler effect.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He is gone!' said Felix, steadily, but in {{an unnatural}} voice. 'Quite suddenly. Not very long ago,' he began, but he felt unable <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> for <b>what</b> space of time he had been rocking Cherry there.|$|R
5000|$|... "Yes, I am, {{which seems}} to offend the {{religious}} right far worse than if I said I thought there was no God. Every time I've been asked if I believe in God, I've said yes, because I do, {{but no one ever}} really has gone any more deeply into it than that, and I have to say that does suit me, because if I talk too freely about that I think the intelligent reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what's</b> coming in the books." ...|$|R
500|$|For the cutscenes, the {{localization}} team {{took into}} account that the animation {{had been done to}} the Japanese lines, so they made sure that the English script matched the already set lip flaps and timing. Because the Japanese voice acting was not yet recorded when Hsu worked on the English dub script, she used her imagination <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> the Japanese voice acting would be like based on the script; this was made easier due to her familiarity with [...] "standard anime conventions" [...] from frequently watching anime. For some dialogue, she wrote alternative lines, as the footage had not yet been finished, and the script could be interpreted in different ways: in one scene, where Phoenix speaks on the phone, Hsu had him follow the line [...] "It's for this very reason I returned" [...] with either [...] "Time to bring it to an end" [...] or [...] "To put an end to it all"; she used the former because of how there was a dramatic pause between the two lines.|$|E
500|$|The episode's action {{revolves}} around the practical joke involving the cake and, in particular, viewers' attempts <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> has caused injury, as {{they know that the}} paramedic will be coming. Both Angela and the alcoholic Carol are [...] "ticking time-bomb". Angela is the central character, and is similar to a more anxious version of Sue Brockman, Skinner's character from Outnumbered. She is stressed and obsessive-compulsive, but aspirational, fastidious, and dutiful. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau compared Ashbourne's characterisation of Carol to Elizabeth Taylor's characterisation in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; as the episode progresses, Carol becomes increasingly abusive. Commentators variously described Pat as [...] "appalling", [...] "tiresome", an [...] "irritating tit" [...] and [...] "an insufferable booby". For Chris Bennion, writing in The Independent, Pat's character is more complex: [...] "Behind Pat's cheesy jokes and schoolboy tomfoolery lies a desperately sad and dignified man, standing by and caring for a wife whose love for him has long gone." [...] Pat and Carol, for Pemberton and Shearsmith, have a more honest relationship than Jim and Angela, despite the problems in their relationship.|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, JC's Girls went to Las Vegas {{to operate}} a booth at the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo—the largest trade fair for {{pornography}} in the United States. The booth was decorated {{in the style of}} the booths advertising strip clubs; the women wore sleeveless shirts with the organization's name in sequins. When men attending the convention visited the booth thinking that JC's Girls was a strip club, the women asked them <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> [...] "JC" [...] meant and gave attendees a sticker reading: [...] "I've been booby-trapped by JC's Girls." [...] JC's Girls told thousands of male attendees about the gospel, distributed more than 200 Bibles wrapped in T-shirts reading [...] "Holy Hottie", and gave out DVDs of a sermon by Brown about pornography addiction. Jesse Jane was one of the women who accepted a Bible. Many convention attendees wished to take pictures with the JC's Girls volunteers. Veitch was interviewed for a variety of media, including a CNN news broadcast and a documentary film by Bill Day, who had previously made the film Missionary Positions about XXXchurch.com, another Christian organization that was operating a booth at the trade fair.|$|E
50|$|If a {{favourite}} {{is placed}} in every single race the Placepot payout is typically as low as it can get, {{and it could be}} anywhere from £3 to £15, although anything less than £6 - £7 is quite unusual. If favourites fail to finish in the places for half of the races then something around the £40 - £200 could be anticipated, placepots of over £25,000 have been known but they are extremely uncommon. However, there isn't a science <b>to</b> <b>guessing</b> <b>what</b> the placepot might be, the placepot dividend is the calculation of the number of tickets left divided by the pool money.|$|R

5000|$|Some say I have a 'sixth sense' [...] [...] [...] Baloney. I've {{just learned}} <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what's</b> going <b>to</b> happen next. Its anticipation. It's not God-given, its Wally-given. He used {{to stand on}} the blue line and say to me, 'Watch, this is how {{everybody}} else does it.' Then he'd shoot a puck along the boards and into the corner and then go chasing after it. Then he'd come back and say, 'Now, this is how the smart player does it.' He'd shoot it into the corner again, only this time he cut across to the other side and picked it up over there. Who says anticipation can't be taught? ...|$|R
500|$|Two critics from Pitchfork Media {{reviewed}} [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{separately from}} Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics [...] "How could {{you know what}} it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?" [...] and [...] "You think you know me so well" [...] for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for [...] "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines [...] "I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / I blame myself" [...] for acknowledging her own wrongdoings with the intention of starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "I’m just a face without a choice / Trust you’d never like <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> I think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Martin's {{brilliance}} in evoking atmosphere through {{description is}} an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings {{much more than}} just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with [...] "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters". CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire {{to know what was going}} to happen combined with my absolute inability <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor advised reading the novels with an A Song of Ice and Fire encyclopedia at hand to [...] "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [...] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered." ...|$|E
500|$|Woodroof {{frequently}} {{declares that}} the drug AZT (azidothymidine) is ineffective and counter-productive, yet years later it is still prescribed to patients with AIDS, albeit {{at a much lower}} dose (hinted at in the film). Medical historian Jonathan Engel, who wrote [...] "The Epidemic: A History of AIDS," [...] states that AZT was in fact a relatively effective treatment for the period, consistently prolonging lives for a year at a time when AIDS had a 100% mortality rate. [...] Journalist David France, who directed the documentary “How to Survive a Plague,” suggested that AZT was actually [...] "the first element of a cocktail of drugs that ended the era of AIDS-as-death sentence." [...] Initial attempts to use high doses of AZT proved to be no more effective than smaller doses, but HIV/AIDS activist Peter Staley (who was consulted by the filmmakers) believes this was not the result of any conspiracy - initially medical researchers had <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> dose would be effective and they feared a low dose would be ineffective. Eventually, researchers realized that AZT was ineffective in the long term because the HIV virus mutated and became resistant to the treatment. By the mid-1990s, David Ho and other researchers found AZT was quite effective when used in conjunction with two other anti-virals, which decreased the chances of virus developing resistance to any one drug.|$|E
60|$|I remembered {{directly}} Old File's {{story of}} Mrs. Dulcifer's elopement, {{and of the}} jewels she had taken with her. It was easy <b>to</b> <b>guess,</b> after <b>what</b> I had heard, that the poor woman had secretly preserved some of her little property {{for the benefit of}} her child.|$|R
5000|$|Ad Hoc - In this game, {{the contestants}} are shown a frame from a {{commercial}} {{and they must}} buzz in <b>to</b> try and <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> the product is in the commercial.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Gardner {{described}} Hyslop as [...] "gullible {{and ignorant}} of magic". According to Gardner, Piper's control failed <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> correctly <b>what</b> Hyslop's uncle died from and took twenty séance sittings <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> his uncle's name. Gardner also wrote that [...] "Hyslop {{had been introduced}} to Mrs. Piper by Hodgson, who could have provided the medium {{with all sorts of}} facts about him." ...|$|R
500|$|Critics had {{polarized}} {{opinions on}} the production of [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl". Spence D. of IGN Music wrote that [...] "strings create a mournfully thoughtful tone" [...] on the ballad. Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy commended [...] "the pleasant mix of cascading piano and tender strings", but criticized the drum sounds for their hollowness. He nevertheless added that the drums do not prevent the song from being [...] "a classy, well-constructed pop ballad". Nissim concluded that although [...] "the emotion-filled vocals offer yet more proof that [...] {{is one of the}} finest pop singers of her generation", [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] is not as catchy as her best work. Darryl Sterdan of Jam! called it a [...] "grand-piano ballad" [...] that may stand out from pop songs on a regular studio album, but seems monotonous on I Am... Sasha Fierce as it is on a disc that contains ballads only. Negative reviews came from The A.V. Club Michaelangelo Matos, who felt that [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] sounded [...] "unfinished", and Paste magazine's Jessica Suarez, who said Beyoncé's [...] "commanding voice sounds unusually thin" [...] on the ballad. She was unconvinced by the lyrics, noting that the line, [...] "I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl", [...] "rings false". Ben Westhoff of Las Vegas Weekly wrote that it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> inspired the development of the breakup ballad as Beyoncé married Jay-Z a few months before the album's release.|$|E
500|$|John Anderson of Newsday wrote [...] "The kind {{of movie}} that will {{entertain}} everyone of every age and probably for ages to come." [...] John Zebrowski of The Seattle Times gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "The movie is helped immensely by its cast, who carry it through some of the early, sluggish scenes. But this is Murphy's movie. Donkey gets most of the good lines, and Murphy hits every one." [...] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote [...] "In an era when much on film seems old, Shrek seems new and fresh and clever." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film five out of five stars, saying [...] "Despite all its high-tech weirdness, it is really that most perdurable of human constructions, a tale told well and true." [...] Joe Baltake of The Sacramento Bee wrote that it [...] "isn't so much a fractured spoof of everything Disney, but actually a Monty Python flick for kids – kids of all ages". Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote [...] "What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices remind us of their stellar screen personae in live-action movies." [...] Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader wrote [...] "This romantic fantasy complicates the roles of beauty and beast, making it hard <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> form a sensitive resolution will take." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote [...] "The charms of Shrek, which is based on the children's book by William Steig, go far beyond in-jokes for adults." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{case was}} never appealed beyond the Sixth Circuit. Commentators have either hailed Dezarn as [...] "nudg federal {{criminal}} law closer to everyday morality" [...] or decrying it as requiring witnesses <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> a questioner really means. [...] "The DeZarn decision appears {{to place the}} witness at risk — {{if he or she}} subjectively misinterprets the state of mind of the interrogator and gives a literally true answer", wrote Barry Tarlow. [...] "This expansion of the traditional definition of perjury is both unwise and unnecessary." ...|$|E
500|$|Pujols's swing {{has been}} praised for its consistency. [...] "It's the same swing every time", former {{teammate}} Lance Berkman once said. [...] "He {{has the ability}} to repeat his swing over and over and over, which leads to him being very consistent", Cardinals' video coordinator Chad Blair said. Sports Illustrated writer Daniel G. Habib described the swing as [...] "quick" [...] and [...] "quiet." [...] Pujols uses a 32.5-ounce bat against right-handed pitchers, but he uses a 33-ounce bat against left-handers to avoid trying to pull the ball when he swings. Defensively, Pujols has won two Gold Glove Awards since moving to first base in 2004. He has credited his hitting ability partly <b>to</b> <b>guessing</b> <b>what</b> pitchers will do: ...|$|R
