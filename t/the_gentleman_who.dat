5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: <b>The</b> <b>gentleman</b> <b>who</b> argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{interview}} with Secretary of State Lord Sydney in March 1784, Matra amended his proposal to include convicts as settlers. Matra’s plan {{can be seen to}} have “provided the original blueprint for settlement in New South Wales”. A cabinet memorandum December 1784 shows the Government had Matra’s plan in mind when considering the creation of a settlement in New South Wales. The London Chronicle of 12 October 1786 said: “Mr. Matra, an Officer of the Treasury, who, sailing with Capt. Cook, had an opportunity of visiting Botany Bay, is <b>the</b> <b>Gentleman</b> <b>who</b> suggested the plan to Government of transporting convicts to that island”. The Government also incorporated into the colonisation plan the project for settling Norfolk Island, with its attractions of timber and flax, proposed by Banks’s Royal Society colleagues, Sir John Call and Sir George Young.|$|E

In contrast to her encyclopaedic knowledge of the social distinctions of London's street names, Jack's obscure parentage is subtly evoked. He defends himself against her [...] "A handbag?" [...] with the clarification, [...] "The Brighton Line". At the time, Victoria Station consisted of two separate but adjacent terminal stations sharing the same name. To the east was the ramshackle LC Railway, on the west the up-market LB—the Brighton Line, which went to Worthing, the fashionable, expensive town <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> <b>who</b> found baby Jack was travelling to at the time (and after which Jack was named).|$|E

500|$|On 20 April 1770, Smart {{was arrested}} for debt. On 11 January 1771, he was tried by Lord Mansfield, <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> <b>who</b> {{originally}} introduced Smart to Alexander Pope, and he was soon recommended to the King's Bench Prison. Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the [...] "Rules" [...] (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: [...] "Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having nothing to eat, I beg you to send me two or three shillings which (God willing) I will return, with many thanks, {{in two or three}} days." [...] On 20 May 1771, Smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work, Hymns, for the Amusement of Children.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 February 1832, {{empowered}} by Parliament through the Order-in-Council officially constituting the colony, a Legislative Council was formed, comprising the Governor, the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, the Surveyor-General and the Advocate-General.

2500|$|One {{historian}} summarized his complex {{personality and}} legacy with these words: [...] "He played many characters—the rich man of simple tastes, <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> <b>who</b> loathed gentlemanly C's, the passionate theorist of democracy whose personal conduct was suavely autocratic." [...] The interplay of democratic and patrician instincts, and especially his insistence on defending his positions when others found then indefensible, made him hard for his contemporaries to grasp. As one historian posed the question: [...] "How could a consensus form around one who exasperated his friends {{as often as}} he confounded his enemies." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{tour was}} a great {{disappointment}} for Australian cricket. The team won only nine of its 39 matches and were soundly beaten in the Test series, but the real difficulty was the indiscipline of some players. According to Wisden, quarrels began among the players during the opening match at Sheffield Park, Uckfield and Scott had [...] "neither the strength of character nor the experience as a leader that the difficulties of his position demanded". Scott and the team manager Ben Wardill {{spent a lot of}} time adjudicating quarrels and the stress of the captaincy impacted Scott's performances as a batsman. The 1887 edition of Wisden bemoaned the absence of Murdoch, saying: [...] "W. L. Murdoch, who was chief in the field of the three teams of 1880, 1882, and 1884, may not have exhibited all the qualities which go to make up that rare and valuable being, an ideal captain – but he certainly had a larger experience and a stronger will than <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> <b>who,</b> with the best of intentions, and the greatest sincerity of purpose, led the team of 1886".|$|E
2500|$|Upon his return, Reavis visited New York {{to renew}} his acquaintances with various {{political}} and business leaders. [...] Showing his recently acquired documents to these luminaries netted Reavis several useful endorsements. [...] James Broadhead, who in 1884 believed the claim would be denied, followed his examination [...] by proclaiming, [...] "The Peralta claim has been submitted to Mr. Conkling, Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Hurd who have pronounced it good. [...] I have {{associated with them}} in the case and my opinion coincides with theirs. [...] Mr. J. Addison Reavis is <b>the</b> <b>gentleman</b> <b>who</b> is pushing the claim and his is a man of remarkable energy and persistence." [...] Roscoe Conkling in turn stated [...] "I can say, however, that having been consulted ... and having made a somewhat careful examination of the ancient papers and other papers produces, of which there are many, and on the facts and history of the case, I find they all go to show Mrs. Reavis to be the person she believes herself to be, namely the lineal descendant of the original grantee." [...] In addition to the endorsement, Conkling introduced Reavis to Robert G. Ingersoll. [...] Ingersoll was so impressed by Peralta papers that he agreed to represent Reavis in his efforts to have the new claim confirmed.|$|E

[...] When the Water-miller comes on-stage to argue for rain to power his mill, he is joined by the Wind-miller who counter-argues for wind and no rain to power his own. [...] A lengthy debate ensues between the two Millers as to which of their mills is more useful than the other and therefore who should have their desired weather. [...] Female characters then enter the stage {{in the form of the}} Gentlewoman who essentially petitions for no weather so that when she leaves the house she is not exposed to the elements and her beauty is able to remain intact, and the Laundress who requires the heat of the sun to dry her clothes. [...] As with the Millers, their debate concerns who is the more deserving – is it a beautiful woman or an industrious one? [...] Their dialogue is interspersed throughout with the bawdy of Merry Report. [...] Finally, a young boy enters the stage asking for wintry weather that he may trap birds and have snowball fights with his friends.|$|E
