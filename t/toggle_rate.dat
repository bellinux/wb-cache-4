50|$|In {{integrated}} circuit design, dynamic logic (or sometimes clocked logic) is a design methodology in combinatory logic circuits, particularly those implemented in MOS technology. It is {{distinguished from the}} so-called static logic by exploiting temporary storage of information in stray and gate capacitances. It was popular in the 1970s and has seen a recent resurgence {{in the design of}} high speed digital electronics, particularly computer CPUs. Dynamic logic circuits are usually faster than static counterparts, and require less surface area, but are more difficult to design. Dynamic logic has a higher <b>toggle</b> <b>rate</b> than static logic but the capacitative loads being toggled are smaller so the overall power consumption of dynamic logic may be higher or lower depending on various tradeoffs. When referring to a particular logic family, the dynamic adjective usually suffices to distinguish the design methodology, e.g. dynamic CMOS or dynamic SOI design.|$|E

40|$|Bistable {{regulatory}} {{elements are}} important for nongenetic inheritance, increase of cell-to-cell heterogeneity allowing adaptation, and robust responses at the population level. Here, we study computationally the bistable genetic toggle switch-a small regulatory network consisting {{of a pair of}} mutual repressors-in growing and dividing bacteria. We show that as cells with an inhibited growth exhibit high stability of toggle states, cell growth and divisions lead to a dramatic increase of <b>toggling</b> <b>rates.</b> The <b>toggling</b> <b>rates</b> were found to increase with rate of cell growth, and can be up to six orders of magnitude larger for fast growing cells than for cells with the inhibited growth. The effect is caused mainly by the increase of protein and mRNA burst sizes associated with the faster growth. The observation that fast growth dramatically destabilizes toggle states implies that rapidly growing cells may vigorously explore the epigenetic landscape enabling nongenetic evolution, while cells with inhibited growth adhere to the local optima. This can be a clever population strategy that allows the slow growing (but stress resistant) cells to survive long periods of unfavorable conditions. Simultaneously, at favorable conditions, this stress resistant (but slowly growing?or not growing) subpopulation may be replenished due to a high switching rate from the fast growing population...|$|R

40|$|Resilient design {{techniques}} {{are used to}} (i) ensure correct operation under dynamic variations and to (ii) improve design performance (e. g., timing speculation). However, significant overheads (e. g., 16 % and 14 % energy penalties due to throughput degradation and additional circuits) are incurred by existing resilient design techniques. For instance, resilient designs require additional circuits to detect and correct timing errors. Further, {{when there is an}} error, the additional cycles needed to restore a previous correct state degrade throughput, which diminishes the performance benefit of using resilient designs. In this work, we describe an improved methodology for resilient design implementation to minimize the costs of resilience in terms of power, area, and throughput degradation. Our methodology uses two levers: selective-endpoint optimization (i. e., sensitivity-based margin insertion) and clock skew optimization. We integrate the two optimization techniques in an iterative optimization flow which comprehends <b>toggle</b> <b>rate</b> information and the trade-off between cost of resilience and margin on combinational paths. Since the error-detection network can result in up to 9 % additional wirelength cost, we also propose a matching-based algorithm for construction of the error-detection network to minimize this resilience overhead. Further, our implementations comprehend the impacts of signoff corners (in particular, hold constraints, and use of typical vs. slow libraries) and process variation, which are typically omitted in previous studies of resilience trade-offs. Our proposed flow achieves energy reductions of up to 21 % and 10 % compared to a conventional (with only margin used to attain robustness) design and a brute-force implementation (i. e., a typical resilient design, where resilient endpoints are (greedily) instantiated at timing-critical endpoints), respectively.

The second algorithm, Enhanced Traffic Situation Awareness on the Airport Surface with Indications and Alerts (SURF IA), was designed to increase flight crew awareness of the runway environment and facilitate an appropriate and timely response to potential conflict situations. The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the performance of the aircraft-based CD&R algorithms during various runway, taxiway, and low altitude scenarios, multiple levels of CD&R system equipage, and various levels of horizontal position accuracy.

In order to reduce the number of unwanted (nuisance) alerts when taxiing across a runway, a buffer is needed between the hold line and the alerting zone so alerts are not generated when an aircraft is behind the hold line.

40|$|While {{technology}} scaling {{has presented}} many {{new and exciting}} opportunities, new design challenges have arisen. Smaller feature sizes have led to increased density and large variations in the delay and power characteristics of on-chip devices. Additionally, with the increasing desirability of low-power chips, decreasing power consumption has become a significant priority. Major sources of dynamic power consumption in modern chips include glitches (i. e., spurious signal transitions), the reduction of which are challenges to circuit designers. High-level synthesis has been touted {{as a solution to}} these problems, as it can both significantly reduce the number of man hours required for a circuit design, and offer greater opportunities for optimization of design goals, by raising the level of abstraction. In this thesis, we present two resource binding and allocation algorithms that take advantage of the optimization opportunities available at the higher level of abstraction. The first is a new variation-aware high-level synthesis binding and module selection algorithm, named FastYield, which takes into consideration multiplexers, functional units, registers, and interconnects. FastYield connects with the lower levels of the design hierarchy through its inclusion of a timing-driven floorplanner guided by a statistical static timing analysis engine which is used to modify and enhance the synthesis solution. FastYield is able to incorporate spatial correlations of process variations in its optimization, which are shown to affect performance yield. FastYield is shown to achieve a significant reduction in clock period, and significant gain in performance yield, when compared to a variation-unaware and layout-unaware algorithm. The second is a glitch-aware, high-level binding algorithm for power, area, and multiplexer reduction targeting field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), called HLPower.

40|$|Advances in {{semiconductor}} {{process technology}} {{have resulted in}} various aging issues in field operation of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits. For example, HCI (Hot carrier injection), BTI (Bias Temperature Instability), TDDB (Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown) are well-known aging phenomena, and they can increase the circuit delay resulting in serious reliability problems. In order to avoid system failures caused by aging, recent design usually sets a certain timing margin in operational frequency of the circuit. However, {{it is difficult to}} determine the size of the proper timing margin because of the difficulty of prediction of its aging speed in actual use that is related to operational environment. Pessimistic prediction may result in performance sacrificing although it will improve the reliability of the system. BIST-based field test is a promising way to guarantee the reliability of the circuit through detecting the aging-induced faults during the circuit operation. However, the field test has a limitation on test application time, which makes it difficult to achieve high test quality. Therefore an effective test application method at field is required. In addition to the requirement of short test application time, the BIST-based field test requires performing at-speed testing in order to detect timing-related defects. However, it is well known that power dissipation during testing is much higher than that in normal circuit operation. Because excessive power dissipation causes higher IR-drop and higher temperature, it results in delay increase during testing, and in turn, causing false at-speed testing and yield loss. While many low power test methods have been proposed to tackle the test power issue, inadequate test power reduction and lower fault coverage still remain as important issues. Moreover, low power testing that just focuses on power reduction is insufficient. When the test power is reduced to a very low level, a timing-related defect may be missed by the test, and a defective circuit will appear to be a good part passing the test. Therefore, appropriate test power control is necessary though it was out of considering in the existing methods. In this dissertation, we first proposed a new test application to satisfy the limitation of short test application time for BIST-based field test, and then we proposed a new low power BIST scheme that focuses on controlling the test power to a specified value for improving the field test quality. In chapter 3, a new field test application method named “rotating test” is presented in which a set of generated test patterns to detect aging-induced faults is partitioned into several subsets, and apply each subset in one test session at field. In order to maximize the test quality for rotating test, we proposed test partitioning methods that refer to two items: First one aims at maximizing fault coverage of each subset obtained by partitioning. Second one aims at minimizing the detection time interval of all faults in rotating test to avoid system failures. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed partitioning methods. In chapter 4, we proposed a new low power BIST scheme which can control the scan-in power, scan-out power and capture power while keeping test coverage at high level. In this scheme, a new circuit called pseudo low-pass filter (PLPF) is developed for scan-in power control, and a multi-cycle capture test technique is employed to reduce the capture power. In order to control scan-out power dissipated by test responses, we proposed a novel method that selects some flip-flops in scan chains at logic design phase, and fills the selected flip-flops with proper values before starting scan-shift operation so as to reduce the switching activity associated with scan-out. The experimental results for ISCAS- 89 and ITC- 99 benchmark circuits show that significant scan-in power reduction rate (the original rate of 50 % is reduced to 7 ~ 8 %) and capture power reduction rate (the original rate of 20 % is reduced to 6 ~ 7 %) were derived. With the scan-out controlling method, the scan-out power can be reduced from 17. 2 % to 8. 4 %, which could not be achieved by the conventional methods. Moreover, in order to control the test power to the specified rate to accommodate the various test power requirements. A scan-shift power controlling scheme was also discussed.

40|$|Guarded {{evaluation}} {{is a power}} reduction technique that involves identifying sub-circuits (within a larger circuit) whose inputs can be held constant (guarded) at specific times during circuit operation, thereby reducing switching activity and lowering dynamic power. The concept {{is rooted in the}} property that under certain conditions, some signals within digital designs are not "observable" at design outputs, making the circuitry that generates such signals a candidate for guarding. Guarded evaluation has been demonstrated successfully for custom ASICs; in this work, we apply the technique to FPGAs. In ASICs, guarded evaluation entails adding additional hardware to the design, increasing silicon area and cost. Here, we apply the technique in a way that imposes minimal area overhead by leveraging existing unused circuitry within the FPGA. The LUT functionality is modified to incorporate the guards and reduce <b>toggle</b> <b>rates.</b> The primary challenge in guarded {{evaluation is}} in determining the specific conditions under which a sub-circuit's inputs can be held constant without impacting the larger circuit's functional correctness. We propose a simple solution to this problem based on discovering gating inputs using "non-inverting paths" and trimming inputs using "partial non-inverting paths" in the circuit's AND-Inverter graph representation. Experimental results show that guarded evaluation can reduce switching activity by as much as 32 % for FPGAs with 6 -LUT architectures and 25 % for 4 -LUT architectures, on average, and can reduce power consumption in the FPGA interconnect by 29 % for 6 -LUTs and 27 % for 4 -LUTs. A clustered architecture with four LUTs to a cluster and ten LUTs to a cluster produced the best power reduction results. We implement guarded evaluation at various stages of the FPGA CAD flow and analyze the reductions. We implement the algorithm as post technology mapping, post packing and post placement optimizations. Guarded Evaluation as a post technology mapping algorithm inserted the most number of guards and hence achieved the highest activity and interconnect reduction. However, guarding signals come with a cost of increased fanout and stress on routing resources. Packing and placement provides the algorithm with additional information of the circuit which is leveraged to insert high quality guards with minimal impact on routing. Experimental results show that post-packing and post-placement methods have comparable reductions to post-mapping with considerably lesser impact on the critical path delay and routability of the circuit...|$|R
