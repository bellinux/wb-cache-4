25|$|The RSM marches {{around to}} the front of the Escort and, {{followed}} by the Ensign, approaches the Colour Party. Having saluted the colour with his sword, the Sergeant-Major takes it from the Colour Sergeant, freeing him to change and then slope arms. The RSM turns, marches to the Ensign, and presents the colour to him. The Ensign salutes the colour with his sword, sheathes the sword without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the colour, and takes possession of it.|$|E
60|$|Melbury nodded an affirmative, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the candle.|$|E
60|$|Mr. d'Alcacer, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> them, bent {{low over}} the deck chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is annoying," [...] said Denton, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> the brutes before him. [...] "Of {{course the}} shepherds won't {{come out of}} the city for hours yet. Naturally these dogs don't quite make us out." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the almost}} equally silent Horne Fisher {{suddenly}} spoke, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> brooding <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Dockwrath, not <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from <b>off</b> the Leeds and Halifax Chronicle. [...] "It is coldish. Waiter, {{bring me}} a cigar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} it these two hours," [...] said a grey-headed gentleman, {{speaking}} without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the newspaper. [...] "There is a cabinet sitting now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{breaks the}} Law--" [...] said Moreau, <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> his victim, and turning towards us (it {{seemed to me}} there was a touch of exultation in his voice).|$|E
6000|$|For {{some moments}} Ralph did not speak. He was evidently stunned. Presently he recovered, and, passing {{his hand over}} his brow, but never <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the {{handsome}} face of his former friend, he said in a low tone-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can do as}} you like, my dear," [...] Colonel Askerton {{had said}} on the {{previous}} evening to his wife. He had listened to all she had been saying without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from <b>off</b> <b>his</b> newspaper, though she had spoken with much eagerness.|$|R
5000|$|He will {{perhaps be}} best {{remembered as a}} [...] "super-sub", having earned wide acclaim for a habit of coming into matches late on as a {{substitute}} and scoring goals. Alex Ferguson remarked that Solskjær has a knack of {{sitting on the bench}} and studying the game without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> the action. Reflecting on this aspect of his career years later, Solskjær said: [...] "I had to think about myself, how can I do the most damage for the opposition if I come on? I sat there and I studied football games but I didn't exactly analyse their strikers. ... Instead I would pay attention to what the defenders and full-backs were doing wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|Within, it {{was hung}} round with pots and pans; {{and on one}} side was a little looking-glass, {{where he used to}} shave; and on a small shelf were his shaving tools, and a comb and brush. Fronting the stove, and very close to it, was a sort of narrow shelf, where he used to sit with his legs spread out very wide, to keep them from scorching; and there, with his book in one hand, and a pewter spoon in the other, he sat all that Sunday morning, {{stirring}} up his pots, and studying away at the same time; seldom <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> the page. Reading must have been very hard work for him; for he muttered to himself quite loud as he read; and big drops of sweat would stand upon his brow, and roll off, till they hissed on the hot stove before him. But on the day I speak of, it was no wonder that he got perplexed, for he was reading a mysterious passage in the Book of Chronicles. Being aware that I knew how to read, he called me as I was passing his premises, and read the passage over, demanding an explanation. I told him it was a mystery that no one could explain; not even a parson. But this did not satisfy him, and I left him poring over it still.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gandara, {{you are not}} drinking," [...] {{said one}} of the gauchos, turning to him. He shook his head {{slightly}} without speaking or <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> my face; whereupon the man who had spoken smiled and resumed his conversation with the others.|$|E
60|$|Having got {{upon his}} feet to emphasise his {{concluding}} words, Young John sat down again, and fell to rolling his green packet on his right leg; never <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Clennam, but surveying him with a fixed look of indignant reproach.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Lyle seated {{himself by}} the Duchess, and {{encouraged}} by her amenity, and speaking in whispers, became animated and agreeable, occasionally patting the lap-dog. Coningsby {{stood by the}} singers, or talked with them when the music had ceased: and Henry Sydney looked over a volume of Strutt's Sports and Pastimes, occasionally, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the volume, calling the attention of his friends to his discoveries.|$|E
60|$|He had {{proceeded}} {{about fifty}} {{yards or so}} when, just as he turned a winding in the path, he found himself {{face to face with}} an old buffalo-bull, fast asleep, and lying down not ten yards off. To drop on one knee and level his piece was the work of an instant, but unfortunately he snapped a dry twig in doing so. The eyes of the huge brute opened instantly, and he had half risen before the loud report of the gun rang through the thicket. Leaping up, Tom Brown took advantage of the smoke to run back a few yards and spring behind a bush, where he waited to observe the result of his shot. It was more tremendous then he had expected. A crash on his right told him that another, and unsuspected, denizen of the thicket had been scared from his lair, while the one he had fired at was on his legs snuffing the air for his enemy. Evidently the wind had been favourable, for immediately he made a dead-set and charged right through the bush behind which our hero was concealed. Tom leaped on one side; the buffalo-bull turned short round and made another dash at him. There was only the remnant of the shattered bush between the two; the buffalo stood for a few seconds eyeing him furiously, the blood streaming down its face from a bullet-hole between the two eyes, and its head garnished with a torn mass of the bush. Again it charged, and again Tom, unable to get a favourable chance for his second barrel, leaped aside and evaded it with difficulty. The bush was now trampled down, and scarcely formed a shadow of a screen between them; nevertheless Tom stood his ground, hoping to get a shot at the bull's side, and never for a single instant <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> him. Once more he charged, and again our hero escaped. He did not venture, however, to stand another, but turned and fled, closely followed by the infuriated animal.|$|R
60|$|The two men shook hands. Kendricks as yet had {{scarcely}} taken <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Herr Freudenberg's face.|$|R
60|$|He took <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> {{the road}} and glanced down at her curiously. His smile was self-confident, exultant.|$|R
60|$|Miss Joan Stacey, dark, with a drawn {{face and}} hair prematurely touched with grey, walked {{straight}} {{to her own}} desk and set out her papers with a practical flap. The mere action rallied everyone else to sanity. If Miss Joan Stacey was a criminal, she was a cool one. Father Brown regarded her for some time with an odd little smile, and then, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her, addressed himself to somebody else.|$|E
6000|$|Powell on <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the old gentleman noticed Captain Anthony, swarthy as an African, by {{the side}} of Flora whiter than the lilies, take his {{handkerchief}} out and wipe off his forehead the sweat of anguish-- like a man who is overcome. [...] "And no wonder," [...] commented Mr Powell here. Then the captain said, [...] "Hadn't you better go back to your room." [...] This was to Mrs Anthony. He tried to smile at her. [...] "Why do you look startled? This night is like any other night." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} there entered the room, {{from the glass}} door, the same {{young man who had}} ushered Tancred into the apartment. He brought a letter to Sidonia. Lord Montacute felt confused; his shyness {{returned}} to him; he deplored the unfortunate interruption, but he felt he was in the way. He rose, and began to say good-morning, when Sidonia, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the letter, saw him, and waving his hand, stopped him, saying, 'I settled with Lord Eskdale that you were not to go away if anything occurred which required my momentary attention. So pray sit down, unless you have engagements.' And Tancred again seated himself.|$|E
60|$|Alec did {{not take}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> George. Walker saw what was coming {{and looked down at}} the ground.|$|R
60|$|Peter Rabbit {{appeared}} {{to be interested in}} just one thing, Paddy's tail. He couldn't keep <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> it.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he glanced}} round, and {{perceived}} that the figures he had, as he believed, scarcely taken <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> were missing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{attend to}} this, Julian. I {{am going to}} pass from my memory of what {{happened}} a week ago to my memory of what happened five minutes since. You were present; I {{want to know if}} you heard it too." [...] He paused, and, without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Julian, pointed backward to Mercy. [...] "There is the lady who is engaged to marry me," [...] he resumed. [...] "Did I, or did I not, hear her say that she had come out of a Refuge, and that she was going back to a Refuge? Did I, or did I not, hear her own to my face that her name was Mercy Merrick? Answer me, Julian. My good friend, answer me, for the sake of old times." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{shook his}} head with mournful regret and threw another handful of fuel on the fire. The burst of clear flame lit up his broad, dark, and {{pock-marked}} face, where the big lips, stained with betel-juice, looked like a deep and bleeding gash of a fresh wound. The reflection of the firelight gleamed brightly in his solitary eye, lending {{it for a moment}} a fierce animation that died out together with the short-lived flame. With quick touches of his bare hands he raked the embers into a heap, then, wiping the warm ash on his waistcloth--his only garment--he clasped his thin legs with his entwined fingers, and rested his chin on his drawn-up knees. Lakamba stirred slightly without changing his position or <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the glowing coals, on which they had been fixed in dreamy immobility.|$|E
60|$|As {{he looked}} {{steadily}} at the savage {{he observed that}} his gaze was one of intense horror, and it suddenly {{occurred to him that}} the Indian supposed he was a ghost! Acting upon this supposition, Martin advanced his face slowly towards that of the Indian, put on a dark frown, and stood for a few seconds without uttering a word. The savage shrank back and shuddered from head to foot. Then, with a noiseless step, Martin retreated slowly backward towards the door and passed out like a spectre--never for a moment <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> those of the savage until he was lost in darkness. On gaining the forest he fled with a beating heart to his former retreat; but his fears were groundless, for the Indian firmly believed that Martin's spirit had visited his hut and carried away provisions for his journey to the land of spirits.|$|E
60|$|Arthur seemed fascinated. He {{could not}} take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the loathsome thing. He watched it slowly heave with even motion.|$|R
60|$|These were Auld Lichts, {{and when}} {{they found that the}} {{minister}} would not take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> them, they obeyed, all save Rob Dow.|$|R
60|$|The warper did not for {{a moment}} take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> a {{contrivance}} with pirns in it that was climbing {{up and down the}} whirring mill.|$|R
6000|$|A big, foaming sea {{came out}} of the mist; it made for the ship, roaring wildly, and in its rush it looked as mischievous and discomposing as a madman with an axe. One or two, shouting, {{scrambled}} up the rigging; most, with a convulsive catch of the breath, held on where they stood. Singleton dug his knees under the wheel-box, and carefully eased the helm to the headlong pitch of the ship, but without <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the coming wave. It towered close-to and high, like a wall of green glass topped with snow. The ship rose to it as though she had soared on wings, and for a moment rested poised upon the foaming crest {{as if she had been}} a great sea-bird. Before we could draw breath a heavy gust struck her, another roller took her unfairly under the weather bow, she gave a toppling lurch, and filled her decks. Captain Allistoun leaped up, and fell; Archie rolled over him, screaming:--"She will rise!" ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{there was}} a silence; but still, somehow, Colligan seemed to stay longer than usual. Every now and then Barry would for a moment look full in his face, and almost {{instantly}} drop his eyes again. He was trying to mature future plans; bringing into shape thoughts which had occurred to him, in a wild way at different times; proposing to himself schemes, with which his brain had been long loaded, but which he had never resolved on,--which he had never made palpable and definite. One thing he found sure and certain; on one point {{he was able to}} become determined: he could not do it alone; he must have an assistant; he must buy some one's aid; and again he looked at Colligan, and again his eyes fell. There was no encouragement there, but there was no discouragement. Why did he stay there so long? Why did he so slowly sip that third glass of wine? Was he waiting to be asked? was he ready, willing, to be bought? There must be something in his thoughts--he must have some reason for sitting there so long, and so silent, without speaking a word, or <b>taking</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the fire.|$|E

6000|$|Pan did {{not answer}} to the suggestion. [...] "Mac, {{what do you say}} to that?" [...] he queried, sharply, but he never took <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Purcell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] said Mr. Kennedy. Then {{he turned}} to his newspaper, and did not take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> it as long as his wife {{remained}} with him.|$|R
50|$|At {{the school}} play, Dutch can't take <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Naomi. A teacher, Sara Harper, now loves Henry but {{can tell he}} still has {{feelings}} for his long-absent wife.|$|R
