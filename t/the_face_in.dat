5|$|Allen {{signed with}} the Kansas City Chiefs {{for the third time}} in 2006, but he again didn't make their final roster. Allen was signed to the {{developmental}} roster of the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League in July 2006, and he played six games with them that season. Following his debut game, Allen was fined $300 due to an incident that involved BC Lions linebacker Carl Kidd punching Allen twice in <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> May 2007, Allen announced his retirement to pursue his music career.|$|E
5|$|He {{suffered}} a broken nose following Daniel Sturridge elbowing him in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the following game, and subsequently missed the FA Cup semi-final. However, he recovered to play four further Premier League matches. Portsmouth were relegated in 20th {{position at the}} end of the season, having been deducted nine points for entering into administration. Despite uncertainty over whether the club would be able to continue as a business, Smith remained at the club. He started their first match of the 2010–11 season on 7 August 2010, a match in which Portsmouth were only able to name four of their permitted seven substitutes.|$|E

5|$|Stela 2 is {{situated}} some {{distance to the}} west of the Main Plaza in Group C, in Plaza B, in front of a small temple. This stela was photographed by Teoberto Maler in the first decade of the 20th century. The stela depicts king Yajawte' K'inich, it shows dancing figures on its east face. On its west face it depicts a figure sculpted using the so-called X-ray style found on Ik-style ceramics, which depicts <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> profile wearing a mask that has been cut away to show the face underneath.|$|E
5|$|Telangiectasia (small {{vascular}} malformations) {{may occur}} in the skin and mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. The most common problem is nosebleeds (epistaxis), which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips, the nose and the fingers, and on the skin of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.|$|E

5|$|Ninety {{seconds after}} Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' {{players and coaches}} were huddled at midcourt, {{attempting}} to calm down Wallace (Tayshaun Prince was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Artest {{was lying on the}} table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him in the chest. Artest jumped off the table, ran into the stands, and grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle stood up to try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head. Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who was not dressed for the game due to injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones. More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.|$|E
5|$|The Moscow militsiya {{sealed off}} {{downtown}} Moscow during the funeral on 15 November. Large avenues were tightly guarded {{by the police}} and the Moscow military garrison. The soldiers, who {{stood in front of the}} House of the Unions, wore black-edged red armbands. The House of the Unions was decorated by numerous red flags and other communist symbols. Brezhnev's body lay in state for three days at the House of the Unions. On the third day the coffin was placed on an artillery carriage towed by an olive-green BRDM-2 armored vehicle of the Red Army—led by dozens of wreaths as well as Brezhnev's decorations carried by Soviet military personnel and other mourners—to the Lenin Mausoleum on the Red Square, where it was greeted by speeches by Andropov; Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov; Anatoly Alexandrov, the President of the Academy of Sciences; and a factory worker. After the speeches, pallbearers, led by Andropov and Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, carried the coffin to another location close to the mausoleum. It was here that Brezhnev's family made their farewell. Before the body was laid to rest Viktoria kissed Brezhnev on <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> accordance with Russian traditions. As Brezhnev's body was lowered into the grave a military squad saluted while an orchestra played the Soviet national anthem. According to Time magazine Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of Soviets.|$|E

25|$|Lucio Russo {{has said}} that Plutarch, in his work On <b>the</b> <b>Face</b> <b>in</b> the Moon, was {{reporting}} some physical theories that we consider to be Newtonian and that these may have come originally from Hipparchus; {{he goes on to}} say that Newton may have been influenced by them.

25|$|The Chief's rock faces, {{especially}} the Grand Wall, exhibit the unique textural patterns which {{result from the}} process of granitic exfoliation. This is the natural means by which large, high-quality granite formations weather, erode, and age. Rather than crumbling and slowly wearing away, large flakes of granite tend to shear off and drop from <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> layers. On impact with the ground below, the shattered flakes become boulders and talus.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} whether {{the detection of}} frontal, ¾, and profile face views differs from their categorization as <b>faces.</b> <b>In</b> Experiment 1, we compared three tasks that required observers to determine {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>face,</b> but varied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extents to which participants had to search for <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> simple displays and in small or large scenes to make this decision. Performance was equivalent for all of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> views <b>in</b> simple displays and small scenes, but it was notably slower for profile views when this required <b>the</b> search for <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> extended scene displays. This search effect was confirmed in Experiment 2, in which we compared observers’ eye movements with their response times to <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> visual scenes. These results demonstrate that <b>the</b> categorization of <b>faces</b> at fixation is dissociable from <b>the</b> detection of <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> space. Consequently, we suggest that face detection should be studied with extended visual displays, such as natural scenes...|$|R
