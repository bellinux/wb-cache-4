40|$|In this study, liver {{samples of}} the European otter (Lutra lutra), great {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax carbo), and European catfish (Silurus glanis) from along the Loire River (France) were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), trace elements (lead, cadmium, copper, and mercury), Cs- 134, and Cs- 137. Organochlorine compounds were found in 100 % of the samples. Residue level of PCBs in these predators was the highest followed by DDTs and endosulfan, and maximal PCB values reached 1. 61, 1. 96, and 0. 28 mg/kg wet weight for cormorants, otters, and catfish, respectively. DDTs, endosulfan, and lindane were the abundant pesticides in the livers of these predators. Concentrations of copper, lead, and cadmium in the livers of top predators were generally low; a potentially toxic level of lead was found in only one cormorant (34. 9 mg/kg dry weight). Mean mercury concentrations in cormorant, otter, and catfish livers were 5. 47, 4. 68, and 2. 71 mg/kg dry weight, respectively, and exceeded <b>toxic</b> <b>thresholds</b> for more than 40 % of the cormorants.

Concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn were measured in liver and kidneys of free-living bank voles (Myodes ex-Clethrionomys glareolus) along a metallic soil pollution gradient in autumn (2006) and spring (2007, 2008). Body contition and somatic indices, as well as proportions of individuals showing higher renal Cd and Pb than <b>toxic</b> <b>thresholds,</b> were calculated to assess potential metal-induced stress. Bank voles accumulated MTE and concentrations of non-essential metals reached high values (up to 266 and 1085 µg. g- 1 dw for Cd and Pb, respectively). We found inter-annual and inter-seasonal variations in MTE levels, but these differences were metal- and organ-dependent. Results were more contrasted for Cd and Zn than for Pb. While Pb in both liver and kidneys exhibited inter-seasonal variations (spring < autumn), Cd and Zn showed different patterns among organs and variations between years with no straightforward seasonal effect. The proportion of individuals exceeding <b>toxic</b> <b>thresholds</b> and the relationships between internal concentrations and body condition or somatic indices did not significantly differ between seasons or years. In an ERA perspective, these results question the interpretation of a single measure of MTE concentrations over time.

40|$|The {{influence}} of Cd application {{on the growth}} and various biochemical processes in Mung bean (Phaseobus aureus Roxb.) seedlings was studied quantitatively. Applied cadmium reduced the growth of roots (endogenous <b>toxic</b> <b>threshold</b> value of 25 mu g/g dry wt.), the growth of hypocotyls (endogenous <b>toxic</b> <b>threshold</b> value of 10 mu g/g dry wt.), epicotyls (threshold value approx. 1. 5 mu g/g dry wt.) and leaves (endogenous <b>toxic</b> <b>threshold</b> value +/- 5 mu g/g dry wt.). The tissue permeability of hypocotyl segments was reduced when the endogenous Cd concentration exceeded about 25 mu g/g dry wt. Cadmium reduced pigment synthesis above an endogenous concentration of 5 mu g/g dry wt. and sterol synthesis in the roots above 25 mu g/g dry wt. It also increased the stigmasterol-sitosterol ratio in the roots and induced a redistribution of sugars. In the roots an increase of polyunsaturated fatty acids was observed above an endogenous concentration of approximately 100 mu g/g dry wt. Results on polyamine synthesis were most pronounced, the synthesis of putrescine in the roots being enhanced by about 600 % at the highest Cd concentration applied (100 mu M). Putrescine increased above an endogenous Cd concentration of 27 mu g/g dry wt. of the roots. The most sensitive parameters to be measured in using Mung bean seedlings as bio-indicators are the growth reduction of the roots, the pigment reduction per leaf, and especially the accumulation of putrescine in the roots that occurs before any growth reduction can be seen.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that Mn toxicity to crops may occur in acid soils and under waterlogging, {{but there is little}} information on <b>toxic</b> <b>thresholds</b> in soils. This study was set-up to derive <b>toxic</b> <b>thresholds</b> for plant growth in soils and to relate toxicity of Mn to the Mn speciation in soils. Toxicity of Mn to barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was assessed for three soils (pH 4. 7 – 6. 7) freshly amended with Mn(II) salt using root elongation and plant growth tests. A 50 % yield reduction occurred at a shoot concentration of 3500 mg kg– 1, which was reached at a soil solution concentration of 360 mg Mn L− 1 or a total Mn concentration in soil between 500 (low pH) and 2500 mg kg− 1 (high pH soil). Waterlogging of the soil during plant growth marginally increased Mn uptake in the high pH soil but did not {{have a significant effect on}} the total soil Mn-based toxicity thresholds. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) spectra were collected for unamended soils and for soils amended with MnCl 2 near the 50 % inhibition dose. The soils were incubated either at field capacity or were waterlogged for 7 d or 2 mo with or without addition of organic matter. Waterlogging had no effect on Mn speciation in the low pH soil (pH 4. 7), in which Mn was mainly as Mn(II). In the unamended soils with pH > 6, waterlogging reduced Mn(III/IV) to Mn(II), and increased the solubility of Mn. However, in soils amended with MnCl 2, the added Mn remained for a large part as Mn(II), even under aerobic conditions, explaining why waterlogging had little effect on the toxicity of Mn. Addition of hay promoted reduction of Mn(III/IV)) while peat decreased reduction rates. This study showed that Mn toxicity can be related to the solubility of Mn, which is strongly dependent on pH and on kinetically controlled redox reactions. Maria C.

The AC treatments resulted in a significant decrease in HOC concentrations in pore water, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, macrophytes, and fish. In 6 months, PAC treatment caused a reduction of accumulation of polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) in fish by a factor of 20, bringing pollutant levels below <b>toxic</b> <b>thresholds.</b> All AC treatments supported growth of fish, but growth was inhibited in the PAC treatment, which was likely explained by reduced nutrient concentrations, resulting in lower zooplankton (i. e., food) densities for the fish.

Two soils were amended with up to 29 % BF slag (containing 800 mg V kg(- 1)) and equilibrated outdoors for 10 months before conducting a barley shoot growth assay. Additional soil samples were spiked with dissolved vanadate(V) for which assays were conducted two weeks (freshly spiked) and 10 months (aged) after spiking. The BF slag vanadium was dominated by vanadium(III) as shown by V K-edge XANES spectroscopy. In contrast, results obtained by HPLC-ICP-MS showed that vanadium(V), the most toxic vanadium species, was predominant in the soil solution. Barley shoot growth was not affected by the BF slag additions. This was likely due to limited dissolution of vanadium from the BF slag, preventing an increase of dissolved vanadium above <b>toxic</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The difference in vanadium bioavailability among treatments was explained by the vanadium concentration in the soil solution.

Forty-five patients undergoing shoulder surgery were randomly assigned into three groups to receive single dose wound infiltration with 30 mL saline (group S) or ropivacaine 7. 5 mg/mL (groups R 2 and R 3. 75) after skin closure. Postoperatively, patients received a continuous wound infiltration with saline (group S), ropivacaine 2 mg/mL (group R 2) or ropivacaine 3. 75 mg/mL (group R 3. 75) for 48 h. Supplemental pain relief was provided by IV patient-controlled analgesia with the opioid piritramide. At 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, and 48 h postoperatively visual analogue scale (VAS) values (0 - 100 mm), piritramide requirements and side effects were registered. Plasma levels of ropivacaine were measured preoperatively and at 24 h and 48 h after surgery. Until 48 h VAS values were smaller in group R 3. 75 compared with group S (group R 3. 75, 8 +/- 9 mm; group S, 31 +/- 14 mm; P < 0. 005), whereas 4 h and 48 h postoperatively VAS values were even smaller in group R 3. 75 compared with group R 2 (P < 0. 05).

The evacuation areas are based on current best estimates of propellant evaporation rates from various areas of spill puddles. These rates are used together with a continuous point-source, bi-normal model of plume dispersion. The {{rate at which the}} toxic plume disperses is based on a neutral atmospheric condition. This condition, which results in slow plume dispersion, represents the widest range of weather parameters which could occur during the day and nighttime periods. Evacuation areas are defined by the ground level boundaries of the plume within which the concentrations exceed the <b>toxic</b> <b>Threshold</b> Limit Value (TLV) or in some cases the Emergency Exposure Limit (EEL) ...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Although {{considered}} safe, no pharmacokinetic data of high dose, {{high volume}} local infiltration analgesia (LIA) with ropivacaine {{without the use}} of a surgical drain or intra-articular catheter have been described. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the maximum total and unbound ropivacaine concentrations (Cmax) and corresponding times to maximum concentration (Tmax) of a single shot ropivacaine (200 ml 0. 2 %) and 0. 75 mg epinephrine (1000 μg mL- 1) when used for LIA. Methods: In this prospective cohort study twenty patients were treated with LIA of the knee for primary total knee arthroplasty. Plasma samples were taken at 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 240, 360 minutes and at 24 hours after tourniquet release, in which total and unbound ropivacaine concentrations were determined. Results: Results are given as mean (SD); median (range). Maximum total ropivacaine concentration was 1. 06 (0. 36); 1. 00 (0. 61 - 2. 26) μg mL- 1, corresponding Tmax was 311 (227); 240 (40 - 1440) minutes after tourniquet release (Figure 1). The highest measured unbound ropivacaine concentration was 0. 13 μg mL- 1. Conclusions: Maximumtotal and unbound serum concentrations of ropivacaine remained well below the assumed <b>toxic</b> <b>thresholds</b> of 4. 3 and 0. 56 μg mL- 1, respectively, for systemic toxicity.

40|$|Background: Although {{considered}} safe, no pharmacokinetic data of high dose, {{high volume}} local infiltration analgesia (LIA) with ropivacaine {{without the use}} of a surgical drain or intra-articular catheter have been described. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the maximum total and unbound ropivacaine concentrations (C-max, C-u max) and corresponding maximum times (T-max, T-u max) of a single-shot ropivacaine (200 ml 0. 2 %) and 0. 75 mg epinephrine (1000 g/ml) when used for LIA in patients for total knee arthroplasty. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 20 patients were treated with LIA of the knee for primary total knee arthroplasty. Plasma samples were taken at 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 240, 360 min and at 24 h after tourniquet release, in which total and unbound ropivacaine concentrations were determined. Results: Results are given as median [IQR]. Highest ropivacaine concentration (C-max) was 1. 06 mu g/ml [0. 34]; highest unbound ropivacaine concentration (C-u max) was 0. 09 mu g/ml [0. 05]. The corresponding time to reach the maximum concentration for total ropivacaine was 312 min [120] after tourniquet release, and for the unbound fraction 265 [110] min after tourniquet release. Conclusion: Although great inter-individual variability was found between the maximum ropivacaine concentrations, both maximum total and unbound serum concentrations of ropivacaine remained well below the assumed systemic <b>toxic</b> <b>thresholds</b> of 4. 3 and 0. 56 mu g/ml...|$|R
40|$|Background. The Akaki River in Ethiopia {{has been}} found to contain {{elevated}} levels of several metals. Our objectives were to characterize metals exposures of residents living near the Akaki River and to assess metal levels in their drinking water. Methods. In 2011, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 101 households in Akaki-Kality subcity (near the Akaki River) and 50 households in Yeka subcity (distant to the Akaki River). One willing adult in each household provided urine, blood, and drinking water sample. Results. Urinary molybdenum (p < 0. 001), tungsten (p < 0. 001), lead (p < 0. 001), uranium (p < 0. 001), and mercury (p = 0. 049) were higher in Akaki-Kality participants compared to Yeka participants. Participants in both subcities had low urinary iodine; 45 % met the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for being at risk of moderate iodine deficiency. In Yeka, 47 % of households exceeded the WHO aesthetic-based reference value for manganese; in Akaki-Kality, only 2 % of households exceeded this value (p < 0. 001). There was no correlation between metals levels in water samples and clinical specimens. Conclusions. Most of the exposures found during this investigation seem unlikely to cause acute health effects based on known <b>toxic</b> <b>thresholds.</b> However, toxicity data for many of these metals are very limited. 26681962 PMC 467064...|$|R
