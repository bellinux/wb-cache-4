5|$|On 4 January 2017, Walker, who {{was still}} {{recovering}} from the injury sustained while playing in India, signed a 18 month long deal with Scottish League Two club Edinburgh City. He scored his first goal for the club in a league match against Montrose in February. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> his fifteenth goal of his career. He said that <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the better}} goals of his career. Walker was appointed as the club captain in May. He also simultaneously signed a contract keeping him in the club till May 2020.|$|E
5|$|A Ellis {{had not yet}} {{reached the}} bench to be {{replaced}} by an extra attacker (he even attempted to return to stop the puck) and thus <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> credited as an official goal against Ellis, as opposed to an empty-net goal.|$|E
50|$|A {{person with}} promotion-focus {{orientation}} {{is more likely}} to remember the occasions where <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> pursued by using eagerness approaches and less likely to remember occasions where <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> pursued by vigilance approaches. A person with prevention-focus orientation {{is more likely to}} remember events where <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> pursued by means of vigilance than if it was pursued using eagerness approaches.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> {{to attain}} <b>the</b> highest [...] "natural point." [...] In other words, {{regardless}} of what man-made structures have been placed on top, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to stand atop the highest [...] "natural point." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> term <b>goal</b> {{may also}} {{refer to the}} {{structure}} in which <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> scored. <b>The</b> ice hockey <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> rectangular in shape; the front frame of <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> made of steel tube painted red (or another color depending on the league) and consists of two vertical goalposts and a horizontal crossbar. A net {{is attached to the}} back of the frame to catch pucks that enter <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> and also to prevent pucks from entering it from behind. <b>The</b> entire <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> considered an inbounds area of the playing surface, and it is legal to play the puck behind <b>the</b> <b>goal.</b> Under NHL rules, the opening of <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> 72 in wide by 48 in tall, and the footprint of <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> 44 in deep.|$|R
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{disputes}} over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not turn on the red light indicating a goal after a Canadian score. After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent the entire team off the bench to ensure <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> counted. A similar incident during game eight led to the melee that Eagleson was involved in.|$|E
5|$|Brahmousin cattle are {{a hybrid}} {{purebred}} breed of Brahman and Limousin first {{created in the}} USA in the late 1970s. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to blend {{the best of the}} Limousin and Brahman traits to create a breed that has reproductive efficiency, mothering ability, good muscling and growth traits, and is adaptable to varying environmental conditions. Brahmousin are now bred in the USA, Indonesia, El Salvador and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Drogba {{started the}} 2005–06 season by scoring two {{goals in a}} Community Shield win over Arsenal. His {{reputation}} was marred amidst accusations of cheating during Chelsea's 2–0 win over Manchester City. Replays showed that he had used his hand to control the ball before scoring the second of his two goals. This occurred just a week after a similar incident against Fulham where <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> disallowed.|$|E
50|$|Trial mode. In point trial mode, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to earn as {{many points}} as {{possible}} in a battle. In victory trial, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to use <b>the</b> assigned army to win as many stages as possible.|$|R
50|$|The {{result of}} {{evaluating}} a goal against a constraint logic program <b>is</b> defined if <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> proved. In this case, {{there exists a}} derivation from the initial pair to a pair where <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> empty. <b>The</b> constraint store of this second pair is considered {{the result of the}} evaluation. This is because the constraint store contains all constraints assumed satisfiable to prove <b>the</b> <b>goal.</b> In other words, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> proved for all variable evaluations that satisfy these constraints.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> {{structure}} {{consists of}} a horizontal crossbar suspended 10 ft above the ground, with two vertical goalposts 18 ft apart extending vertically from {{each end of the}} crossbar. In American football <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> centered on each end line; in Canadian football <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> centered on each goal line.|$|R
5|$|Early in July, the Dodd campaign's {{strategy}} to use {{social networking sites}} was documented by the press. The campaign uses the network MyLifeBrand which allows Dodd supporters {{to be linked to}} other users from other social networking websites. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to bring supporters together and attract new supporters.|$|E
5|$|Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute and Friedman {{hosted a}} series of {{conferences}} from 1986 to 1994. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to create a clear definition of economic freedom and a method for measuring it. Eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide economic freedom, Economic Freedom in the World. This annual report has since provided data for numerous peer-reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1945 Hitler and his generals {{launched}} Operation North Wind (Unternehmen Nordwind). <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> {{to break}} through the lines of the US 7th Army and French 1st Army to support the southern thrust in the Ardennes offensive, the final major German offensive of the war. After limited initial gains by the Germans, the Americans halted the offensive. By 25 January, Operation North Wind had officially ended.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> {{a medical}} diagnostic, then {{histology}} applications will often {{fall into the}} realm of digital pathology or automated tissue image analysis, which are sister fields of bioimage informatics. The same computational techniques are often applicable, but <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> medically- rather than research-oriented.|$|R
50|$|CrowdFundEDU has a {{flexible}} funding approach, {{which means that}} fundraisers receive the contributions {{whether or not their}} funding <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> reached by <b>the</b> deadline. CrowdFundEDU charges 5% to the fundraiser if <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> reached and 9% if <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> not reached.. <b>The</b> difference in fees is to encourage fundraisers to set a realistic goal.|$|R
50|$|If any figure or goalie breaks when a <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> scored, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> valid.|$|R
5|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international experts recommended that the tram company should not choose that solution. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to decrease the weight so the trams could operate with less-powerful motors, giving a lower cost. The first prototype was a full-scale model of a tram, built at Homansbyen Depot in 1935, using an undercarriage from disused horsecars.|$|E
5|$|Žigić's only {{start at}} the 2006 World Cup came in the last fixture, when his team had already been {{eliminated}} after losing the first two group matches. He scored early {{in the first half}} off a long ball from Stanković against Côte d'Ivoire– <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> Serbia-Montenegro's first of the tournament– but the match ended in a 3–2 defeat.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} seven {{companies}} began the development of USB in 1994: Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, and Nortel. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to make it fundamentally easier to connect external devices to PCs by replacing the multitude of connectors {{at the back of}} PCs, addressing the usability issues of existing interfaces, and simplifying software configuration of all devices connected to USB, as well as permitting greater data rates for external devices. A team including Ajay Bhatt worked on the standard at Intel; the first integrated circuits supporting USB were produced by Intel in 1995.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more accurate model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more accurate protein structure model.|$|E
5|$|At first glance, dazzle {{seems an}} {{unlikely}} form of camouflage, {{drawing attention to}} the ship rather than hiding it. The approach was developed after Allied navies were unable to develop effective means to hide ships in all weather conditions. The British zoologist John Graham Kerr proposed the application of camouflage to British warships in the First World War, outlining what he {{believed to be the}} applicable principle, disruptive camouflage, in a letter to Winston Churchill in 1914 explaining <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to confuse, not to conceal, by disrupting a ship's outline. Kerr compared the effect to that created by the patterns on a series of land animals, the giraffe, zebra and jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E

5|$|Giggs scored partway {{through the}} second half of extra time. Picking up {{possession}} on the halfway line after a loose pass from Patrick Vieira, he dribbled past the entire Arsenal back line before shooting just under goalkeeper David Seaman's bar. Giggs ran celebrating towards the United fans, and United held on to beat the Gunners 2–1. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> the last ever scored in a FA Cup semi-final replay, as they were abolished the following season.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, Jeremiah Horrocks {{published}} a reasonably accurate {{model of the}} Moon's motion in which the Moon was assumed to follow a precessing elliptical orbit. A sufficiently accurate and simple method for predicting the Moon's motion would have solved the navigational problem of determining a ship's longitude; in Newton's time, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to predict the Moon's position to 2' (two arc-minutes), which would correspond to a 1° error in terrestrial longitude. Horrocks' model predicted the lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc-minutes; for comparison, {{the diameter of the}} Moon is roughly 30 arc-minutes.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, an Australian-based company OnTilt Designs Pty Ltd won a multi-year {{contract}} {{to become the}} official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design {{would return to the}} tradition of the 1970s and 1980s where the bracelet was a heavy piece of unadorned metal. American jewelry designer Steve Soffa was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to create a bracelet that somebody would actually want to wear every day. In 2011, OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the WSOP Circuit rings.|$|E
50|$|Before play begins, {{the players}} {{agree on the}} number of links {{necessary}} to win the game. A game of Brain Chain takes approximately 30 minutes if <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> four links in a row, an hour if <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> five links, or 90 minutes if the winning condition is a six-link chain.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{progress}} in multiple traits <b>is</b> difficult when <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> clearly defined.

50|$|The {{analysis}} of ctDNA after extraction requires {{the use of}} various amplification and sequencing methods. These methods can be separated into two main groups based on whether <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to interrogate all genes in an untargeted approach, or if <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to monitor specific genes and mutations in a targeted approach.|$|R
