5|$|After awakening, Jon Snow {{is greeted}} by Davos Seaworth and Melisandre. When asked by Davos {{what he can}} remember, Jon says he remembers only his {{assassination}} but nothing from being dead. Melisandre tells Jon that her religion prophesies the return of a heroic prince and suggests that this prince may not be Stannis, as she first thought, but Jon. Jon enters the courtyard {{to meet with the}} wildlings. He meets with and embraces Tormund Giantsbane and Dolorous Edd, Tormund saying the Wildlings <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> god.|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, Dr. Frank Menetrez, {{a former}} Editor-in-Chief of the UCLA Law Review, {{published}} {{an analysis of}} the charges made against Finkelstein by Dershowitz, finding no merit in any single charge and concluding that Dershowitz had misrepresented matters. In a follow-up analysis he concluded that he could find 'no way of avoiding the inference that Dershowitz copied the quotation from Twain from Peters's From Time Immemorial, and not from the original source', as Dershowitz claimed. In an interview given for the film [...] in 2009, Dershowitz said of Finkelstein: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Jew. He's Jewish only on his parents' side." ...|$|E
500|$|Meeting {{the rest}} of Pam's family and friends, Greg still feels like an outsider. Despite efforts to impress the family, Greg's {{inadvertent}} actions make him {{an easy target for}} ridicule, disdain and anger: He accidentally breaks Debbie's nose during a volleyball mishap; uses a malfunctioning toilet that floods the Byrnes' back yard with sewage; sets the wedding altar on fire and inadvertently leads Jack to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> marijuana user. He also feels inferior to Kevin, Pam's ex-fiance who, unlike him, receives nothing but warmth and friendliness from Jack. Later, Greg loses Jinx and replaces him with a feral cat whose tail he spray paints to make him look like Mr. Jinx while desperately seeking Jack's approval.|$|E

500|$|He then {{played for}} the Indios de Mayagüez in the Puerto Rico winter league, and as a {{foreign-born}} player (of Cuban heritage) for Team Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Series. [...] Twins general manager Bill Smith said in December: [...] "I give Danny Valencia credit. He's down in Puerto Rico right now playing winter ball, {{and trying to get}} better.... You always want an underdog guy, somebody to step up when presented with an opportunity." [...] Hector Otero, the Twins scout who signed Valencia and who was the general manager of the Mayagüez club, said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> talented player. He definitely can throw. He worked on his defense–worked extra before games–and everyone knows he can swing the bat." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving Firestone in 1920, Willkie joined leading Akron {{law firm}} Mather & Nesbitt, which {{represented}} several local public utilities. Although he quickly {{gained a reputation}} as a leading trial lawyer, he was especially noted for presenting utility cases before the Ohio Public Utilities Commission. In 1925, he became president of the Akron Bar Association. One of Willkie's clients, Ohio Power & Light, was owned by New York-based Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C), whose chairman, B.C. Cobb, noticed him. Cobb wrote to the senior partner of Willkie's firm, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> comer and we should keep an eye on him." [...] In 1929, Cobb offered Willkie a salary of $36,000 to be corporate counsel to C, a job which would involve a move to New York, and Willkie accepted.|$|E
500|$|Mold {{was popular}} with other cricketers. The Times said: [...] "Apart {{from the burning}} {{question}} of throwing, not a word could be said against him. He was liked by all his brother professionals, and popular wherever he played." [...] However, his achievements were always qualified by suspicion over the legality of his bowling action, even before he was no-balled by Phillips. A batsman who played against him when he first appeared for Northamptonshire said: [...] "If he is fair {{he is the best}} bowler in England, but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> worse thrower than ever Crossland [...] was." [...] Mold's Times obituary stated: [...] "He was a deadly fast bowler, but, all through his career, even his best feats in the cricket field were spoken of with something of apology".|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Del Naja is {{responsible}} for creating the artwork attributed to the noted graffiti artist Banksy. In a 2017 segment on the Distraction Pieces podcast, guest DJ Goldie commented on Bansky's work: 'Give me a bubble letter {{and put it on}} a T-shirt and write “Banksy” on it and we’re sorted. We can sell it now... No disrespect to Robert, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over.' The last name of the 'Robert' mentioned was never given, but because of Goldie's friendship with Del Naja, it is highly possible Del Naja was being referenced.|$|E
2500|$|Bukharan Jews {{started moving}} to Corona in the 1990s. Five Bukharan Jewish {{families}} moved to LeFrak City in 1991; this number {{had grown to}} over 500 by 1995, and nearby apartment buildings held hundreds more. Bukharan Jews began worshiping at Tifereth Israel in the mid-1990s, holding their own services in the synagogue basement. Despite the fact that Tifereth Israel was an Ashkenazi synagogue, and the Bukharan Jews followed Sephardic law and customs, the groups initially co-existed peacefully. Conflict arose, however, {{in the spring of}} 1997, after Amnun Khaimov arrived as the Bukharans' rabbi. According to then-synagogue-president, 82-year-old Benjamin Fried, [...] "They came and wanted to take the place over". Tifereth Israel's members wanted the Bukharans {{to help pay for the}} synagogue's upkeep, but Khaimov said that Bukharans were poor and could not afford to do so. Irwin Goldstein, who in 1997 had been Tifereth Israel's cantor for eight years, felt that [...] "the rabbi's overwhelming presence, and followers, threaten to drown what remain of the Ashkenazic tradition at the synagogue". They believed that the Bukharans were hoping to start praying in the main sanctuary, relegating Tifereth Israel's members to the basement. Questions were also raised about Khaimov himself; all agreed he was qualified as a ritual slaughterer, but some doubted his rabbinic credentials. Yitzchak Yehoshua, the Chief Rabbi of the Bukharan Rabbinical Council of America, stated [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good butcher maybe, but he is no rabbi".|$|E

2500|$|Olivia Cooke from Heat said [...] "Danny Dyer being a {{cast member}} of EastEnders seems like such an obvious {{thing we can}} hardly believe it's taken until now for it to happen." [...] Inside Soap noted that Christmas in EastEnders is [...] "always an {{explosive}} time", so the Carters' arrival was [...] "perfectly timed", {{and said it would}} be [...] "a welcome gift for Shirley and Tina", going on to say, [...] "We can't wait for this new era in the Vic to kick off!" [...] All About Soap said they were [...] "very excited" [...] that Shirley's family were being introduced and taking over The Queen Victoria. Inside Soap Kate White said she [...] "can't wait to see the impant the Carters have on their new manor, as well as seeing Danny in action behind that bar." [...] Rosie Gizauskas from Now said Dyer's casting was [...] "the best idea ever", adding, [...] "this will totally work. I literally can't wait to see original East End geezer Danny in [...] his spiritual home. [...] This was meant to be." [...] Yahoo! TV UK said that Dyer joining EastEnders would be [...] "interesting" [...] because he [...] "tends to divide viewers into those who think he's a ridiculous posturing fool and those who think he's a ridiculous posturing fool who can also act." [...] Ben Dowell from the Radio Times thought the description of Mick sounded like comedian Al Murray's Pub Landlord character. Former EastEnders cast member Scott Maslen, who played Jack Branning, said of Dyer's casting in the show: [...] "He will go there, give a bit of banter and he will embrace it, but it'll be a challenge for him. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good fit for the character and he would do really well in it." ...|$|E
