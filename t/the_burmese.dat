5|$|The {{invasion}} {{began on}} 22 September 1283. Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief {{of the invasion}} force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> fort at Ngasaunggyan. <b>The</b> <b>Burmese</b> chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) <b>The</b> <b>Burmese</b> withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{independence}} from Britain in 1948, Burma had been fighting against ethnic unrest and Chinese Nationalist Kuomingtang irregulars, and several Burmese Army officers had trained in Australia in the 1950s. A Burmese staff officer, Major Muang Muang, later requested the assistance of Serong or another Australian officer. As a result Serong was sent to Burma as a counter-insurgency instructor with <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> armed forces, lecturing senior officers {{for a few months}} in 1957 before returning to Australia. Serong subsequently advocated the dispatch of a small team of Australian officers to assist in training <b>the</b> <b>Burmese,</b> but this did not occur. At the request of Muang Muang, Serong returned to Burma in 1960, serving in Rangoon as a strategic adviser to <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> armed forces. Muang Muang had resigned in early 1961, and as a consequence Serong's influence was limited from this time, During this period he worked to prepare <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> for a border war against China. While in Burma Serong's expertise brought him {{to the attention of the}} US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and as a result he was later invited to supervise counter-insurgency programs in Vietnam. In February 1962 he wrote to Pollard, by then CGS, to suggest the deployment of a small team of Australian officers under his command to South Vietnam to work with the US advisory group there. Soon after <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> Army staged a coup, seizing control and moving the country towards communist China, after which Serong made arrangements to leave.|$|E

5|$|The {{casus belli}} {{have been stated}} as a Burmese attempt to expand their {{territory}} eastwards after a political crisis in Ayutthaya {{as well as an}} attempt to stop Siamese incursions into the upper Tenasserim coast. The war, according to <b>the</b> <b>Burmese,</b> began in January 1547 when Siamese forces conquered the frontier town of Tavoy (Dawei). Later in the year, <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> forces led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein retook the Upper Tenasserim coast down to Tavoy. Next year, in October 1548, three Burmese armies led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung invaded Siam through the Three Pagodas Pass. <b>The</b> <b>Burmese</b> forces penetrated up to the capital city of Ayutthaya but could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. But <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the return of two important Siamese nobles (the heir apparent Prince Ramesuan, and Prince Thammaracha of Phitsanulok) whom they had captured.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} initially met little resistance, as <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> {{forces were}} {{too large for}} the small guard posts around the border. Upon hearing of <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> invasion, Maha Chakkraphat mobilized his kingdom, then gathered his forces at Suphanburi, a town just west of Ayutthaya. When Tabinshwehti and his army arrived at the walled town of Kanchanaburi, they found it completely deserted. About a month into the invasion, mid-November 1548, the King of Burma then continued his march eastward, capturing the villages of Ban Thuan, Kaphan Tru and Chorakhe Sam Phan. <b>The</b> <b>Burmese</b> continued their advance and captured the ancient town of Uthong {{as well as the}} villages of Don Rakhang and Nong Sarai and closing in on Suphanburi. When <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> attacked the town, Siamese defenders could not withstand the onslaught and retreated towards Ayutthaya. Tabinshwehti ordered his army southeast along two canals, and crossed the Chao Phraya river near Phong Phaeng. From here he encamped his army directly north of the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya on a field called the Lumpli plain.|$|E

As planned, the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E

5|$|In January 1287, {{the embassy}} arrived at Beijing, and was {{received}} by the Yuan emperor. <b>The</b> <b>Burmese</b> delegation formally acknowledged Mongol suzerainty of their kingdom, and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country. (Indeed, the tribute was no longer nominal.) In exchange, the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops. For the emperor, the Burma campaign was the only bright spot; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly. He {{did not want to}} invest more troops pacify the rest of the kingdom. He preferred a vassal ruler. <b>The</b> <b>Burmese</b> embassy arrived back at Hlegya in May 1287, and reported the terms to the king.|$|E
5|$|Maha Chakkraphat, {{being unable}} to repel <b>the</b> <b>Burmese,</b> {{sent a message to}} his {{son-in-law}} Maha Thammaracha at Phitsanulok, ordering his vassal to come to his aid by bringing an army southwards towards Ayutthaya and if possible to engage the enemy in battle. Thammaracha quickly mobilized his forces {{and with the help of}} the Governor of Sawankhalok, marched southward with a large army to attack <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> rear. Upon hearing of this and on the advice of Bayinnaung; Tabinshwehti decided to withdraw, abandoning the mission altogether. His decision was compounded by news from Burma that the Mons, who had never been entirely subjugated by the Taungoo dynasty, rebelled in the absence of the king. Other factors included the scarcity of supplies and sickness in his army, which was not prepared for a long siege.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat at}} Ngasaunggyan broke {{the back of}} Burmese defenses. <b>The</b> <b>Burmese</b> army lost several {{thousand}} men as well as senior commanders.

The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found {{the heat of the}} searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan.|$|E

5|$|At any rate, the {{remaining}} Siamese forces retreated. Tabinshwehti readied his army for a siege of the Siamese capital. He made his camp {{north of the}} city, with his headquarters at Klum Dong, and had his commanders encamp in strategic places surrounding the city walls, Bayinnaung at Phaniat, the Viceroy at Ban Mai Makham, and the Governor of Bassein at the plain of Prachet. <b>The</b> <b>Burmese</b> would not, however, take the Siamese capital so easily.|$|E
5|$|Ayutthaya sat on {{an island}} {{surrounded}} by three rivers—the Lopburi River to the north, the Chao Phraya River {{to the west and}} south, and the Pa Sak River to the east, forming a formidable natural moat. The Chao Phraya basin where Ayutthaya is situated was low and prone to flooding—especially intense during the rainy season when torrential waters flowed in great quantity from the north along the Lopburi River. This flood would begin approximately in July and end somewhere between October and November, giving Tabinshwehti only five months to capture Ayutthaya—otherwise his camp grounds and supply routes would be flooded. There was also the possibility that the flood could trap his forces. The low, swampy area around the city was laced with numerous canals thronging with gun boats armed with cannon to repulse any attempt at an attack on the city. Also, <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> had only small cannon that they had brought with them, while the Siamese had large cannon mounted along the city walls. <b>The</b> <b>Burmese</b> had the city surrounded, but without the ability to cross the rivers or breach the city walls with cannon fire, were left to camp around it instead, while the interconnected waterways to the north and south made it fairly easy to resupply the defenders in the city. Fifty Portuguese mercenaries, who had elected Galeote Pereira as their captain, defended the weakest part of the city wall for Maha Chakkraphat. Unable to take the city conventionally, Tabinshwehti offered bribes to these defenders. The Portuguese reacted with derision, and refused. When a Siamese commander heard of this, he swung open the gates of the city and dared <b>the</b> <b>Burmese</b> King to bring the money—a dare that was ignored.|$|E
