5|$|By 07:40, {{all five}} hijackers were aboard the flight, {{scheduled}} to depart at 07:45. Mohamed Atta sat in business class seat 8D with Abdulaziz al-Omari in 8G and Suqami in 10B. Waleed al-Shehri and Wail al-Shehri sat {{in first class}} seats 2B and 2A. At 07:46, one minute behind schedule, the aircraft received clearance to push back from Gate B32, and was cleared to taxi to the runway at 07:50. The aircraft began its <b>takeoff</b> <b>run</b> from Logan International Airport at 07:59 from runway4R.|$|E
25|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred when}} KLM 4805 initiated its <b>takeoff</b> <b>run</b> while Pan Am 1736, shrouded in fog, {{was still on}} the runway and about to turn off onto the taxiway. The impact and ensuing fire killed everyone on board the KLM jet and most of the occupants of the Pan Am, leaving only 61 survivors from the aircraft's front section.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the {{investigation}} the AAIB was made aware of a similar incident eight years before the loss of G-BNMT. A Short 360 operated by a different airline suffered a dual engine power loss while on its <b>takeoff</b> <b>run.</b> The source of the problem was found to be the accumulation of ice and snow during operation in sub-zero temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|Agellos M.70, {{powered by}} a [...] Colombo S.53 engine, had among the three {{shortest}} <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs</b> and demonstrated the shortest landing distance {{of any of the}} 53 entrants, stopping in only 50 meters (164 feet). Overall, the point system placed the M.70 in the ninth starting position, allowing Agello to start with an 11-minute handicap.|$|R
50|$|Twin Pratt & Whitney PW-150C {{turbines}} turn propellers {{with eight}} blades, {{to power the}} STOL aircraft for <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs</b> as short of less than 3,000 feet (1 km). The aircraft is designed to carry as much as 20000 lb for a 3200 nmi km range carrying beneath its 1315 sq ft of high-mounted wings.|$|R
50|$|The {{well-established}} {{military presence}} in the region has led to many film appearances, the earliest being the practice <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs</b> by Doolittle Raiders for Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, shot at Peel Field, an auxiliary field at Eglin Field, in 1944. Some scenes in the 1949 film Twelve O'Clock High, another film about World War II, were also shot at Eglin.|$|R
25|$|During April 1941, the C.200s of 374° Squadriglia {{became the}} first unit to be {{stationed}} on the North African mainland. Further units, including 153° Gruppo and 157° Gruppo, were stationed on the mainland as Allied air {{power in the region}} increased in capability and numbers, such as the Hurricane and the P-40 Warhawk. According to Cattaneo, the C.200 performed well under the conditions of the desert climate, particularly due to its high structural strength and short <b>takeoff</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1937, Earhart and {{her crew}} flew {{the first leg}} from Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii. In {{addition}} to Earhart and Noonan, Harry Manning and Mantz (who was acting as Earhart's technical advisor) were on board. Due to lubrication and galling problems with the propeller hubs' variable pitch mechanisms, the aircraft needed servicing in Hawaii. Ultimately, the Electra {{ended up at the}} United States Navy's Luke Field on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor. The flight resumed three days later from Luke Field with Earhart, Noonan and Manning on board. During the <b>takeoff</b> <b>run,</b> Earhart ground-looped, circumstances of which remain controversial. Some witnesses at Luke Field including the Associated Press journalist on the scene said they saw a tire blow. Earhart thought either the Electra's right tire had blown and/or the right landing gear had collapsed. Some sources, including Mantz, cited pilot error.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{losses to}} enemy fighters forced the {{reintroduction}} of a rear gunner; early Il-2s were field modified by cutting {{a hole in}} the fuselage behind the cockpit for a gunner sitting on a canvas sling armed with a 12.7mm UBT machine gun in an improvised mounting. The semi-turret gun mount allowed the machine gun to be fired at angles of up to 35° upwards, 35° to starboard and 15° to port. Tests showed that maximum speed decreased by between 10 and 20km/h (6.2–12.4mph) and that the two-seater was more difficult to handle because the center of gravity was shifted backwards. At the beginning of March 1942, a production two-seat Il-2 with the new gunner's cockpit began manufacturer tests. The second cockpit and armament increased all-up weight by 170kg (374lb) so the flaps were allowed to be deployed at an angle of 17° to avoid an over-long <b>takeoff</b> <b>run.</b> The new variant had a lengthened fuselage compartment with an extended canopy offering some protection from the elements. Unlike the well-armoured cockpit of the pilot compartment with steel plating up to 12mm (0.47in) thick behind, beneath and on both sides as well as up to 65mm thick glass sections, the rear gunner was provided with 6mm (.23 in) thick armour, effective only against rifle-calibre rounds.|$|E
50|$|Floats inevitably impose extra {{drag and}} weight, {{rendering}} floatplanes slower and less manoeuvrable during flight, with a slower rate of climb, relative to aircraft equipped with wheeled landing gear. Nevertheless, air races devoted to floatplanes attracted {{a lot of}} attention during the 1920s and 1930s, most notably {{in the form of the}} Schneider Trophy, not least because water takeoffs permitted longer <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs</b> which allowed greater optimization for high speed compared to contemporary airfields.|$|R
25|$|The GA-1 {{were sent}} to Kelly Field, Texas, in early 1923 for service tests with the only US aerial attack formation, the 3rd Attack Group. These tests showed the {{aircraft}} to be unacceptable. They had poor visibility and performance, particularly in rate of climb, maneuverability, and range. The aircraft suffered from noise and vibrations caused by the 3/16-inch (4.75mm)-thick armor. <b>Takeoff</b> <b>runs</b> were very long {{by the standards of}} the day. The GA-1s were extremely unpopular with the pilots conducting the evaluation.|$|R
50|$|Seeking {{to avoid}} the {{aerodynamic}} drag induced by floats in seaplanes of floatplane design, Ing Giovanni Pegna of the Piaggio company designed a very unusual seaplane to represent Italy in the 1929 Schneider Trophy race. A cantilever shoulder-wing monoplane, known both as the Piaggio P.7 and the Piaggio-Pegna P.c.7, his design floated up to its wings on its long, slender, watertight fuselage with the wings resting on the water, and employed twin high-incidence hydrofoils to get itself off the water during <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was to be}} a delta-winged fighter with a watertight hull and twin retractable hydro-skis for takeoff and landing. When stationary or moving slowly in the water, the Sea Dart floated with the trailing edge of the wings touching the water. The skis were not extended until the aircraft reached about [...] per hour during its <b>takeoff</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
500|$|At about 2:55 pm, the four-engine Electra {{turboprop}} {{began its}} <b>takeoff</b> <b>run</b> to the west. At {{some point during}} the <b>takeoff</b> <b>run</b> or initial climb, the number three engine failed and caught fire. The crew continued the takeoff and climb, per standard procedure, using power from the remaining three engines. The pilot radioed the control tower declaring an emergency, and the control tower cleared the flight for an immediate landing. The number three engine was engulfed in flames as the crew retracted the flaps and maneuvered the plane into a left turn back to the runway. The plane entered a 30–45 degree bank, then rapidly lost altitude and crashed into hilly terrain about [...] west-southwest of the runway, above the village of San Jerónimo. [...] The fuel on board caught fire and all aboard perished except the copilot, 26 year old Juan Loo, who was found in the wreckage of the cockpit badly burned but alive. Two farm workers were killed on the ground.|$|E
500|$|Costs {{continued}} to rise, {{which led to}} concerns at both company and government upper management levels, and the aircraft was also falling short {{of many of the}} requirements laid out in OR.343, such as takeoff distance and combat radius. As a cost-saving measure, a reduced specification was agreed upon, notably reductions in combat radius to , the top speed to Mach 1.75 and <b>takeoff</b> <b>run</b> up increased from [...]|$|E
50|$|The few 234Bs entered {{service in}} autumn and {{impressed}} their pilots. They were fairly fast and completely aerobatic. The long <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs</b> led to several accidents; {{a search for}} a solution led to improved training as well as the use of twin HWK-built, jettisonable liquid fueled monopropellant Starthilfe pioneering RATO units, one mounted under each outer wing. The Jumo 004 engines were always the real problem; they suffered constant flameouts and required overhaul or replacement after about 10 hours of operation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the transient dynamic {{analysis of the}} B- 52 aircraft carrying the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster drop test vehicle (SRB/DTV). The NASA structural analysis (NASTRAN) finite element computer program {{was used in the}} analysis. The B- 52 operating conditions considered for analysis were (1) landing and (2) braking on aborted <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs.</b> The transient loads for the B- 52 pylon front and rear hooks were calculated. The results can be used to establish the safe maneuver envelopes for the B- 52 carrying the SRB/DTV in landings and brakings...|$|R
50|$|The Ca.165 was {{comparable}} in useful load (570 kg/1,257 lb vs. 575 kg/1,268 lb) and weapons (2 × 12.7 mm/0.5 in, 1 × 7.7 mm/0.303 in) to the CR.42, {{but it was}} 200 kg (441 lb) heavier with less wing surface, so it had wing loading of 113 kg/m compared to 99 for the CR.42; and that, coupled with the less effective controls, made the Ca.165 less agile. Despite these shortcomings, the Ca. 165's minimum speed was lower (114 km/h/71 mph vs 122 km/h/76 mph), allowing for shorter <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs</b> and slightly better low-speed performance.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} Pierce Field is largely unknown, and the exact date of {{construction}} of Pierce Field is undetermined. It was constructed {{in a similar manner}} to a fully equipped base with three 4,000-foot runways, a large parking ramp, at least one hangar and numerous support buildings. It was possibly used by then-Lt Col Jimmy Doolittle in 1942 as one of several practice sites on the greater Eglin Field complex for the short <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs</b> needed for his B-25 bomber crews to conduct their carrier-launched raid on Japan.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{are equipped with}} retractable skis that allow the aircraft to land on snow and ice {{as well as on}} conventional runways. The aircraft have provisions for using jet-assisted-takeoff (JATO) rockets, four {{on each side of the}} aircraft, that are used when the LC-130 operates from rough, unprepared snow surfaces or when shorter <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs</b> are needed. Originally the expended rocket bottles were jettisonable, but due to several accidents which occurred when a bottle detached from the aircraft during takeoff, the mounting provisions were changed so that the bottles could not be released in the air.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{following}} {{the breaking of}} the sound barrier, first by experimental aircraft, then military aircraft, a supersonic passenger aircraft was thought feasible. By the early 1970s however, opposition led to bans on commercial supersonic flight in Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, West Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Canada and the United States. The choice of routes available was limited as supersonic flight was only possible outside built up areas, primarily over water, and few airfields were large enough for their <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs.</b> It was also clear that the aircraft was costly to build, and used more fuel per passenger per kilometer than other commercial aircraft at a time of rapidly rising fuel prices.|$|R

50|$|Today, much of {{the former}} USAF {{airfield}} remains, including the 10,000' runway built by SAC in the 1950s. Many dispersal pads for jet bombers remain, the large USAF hangar is still in use, along with the aircraft parking ramp on the south side.

2500|$|The {{propulsion}} {{system of the}} B-36 was unique, with six 28-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-4360 'Wasp Major' radial engines mounted in an unusual pusher configuration, rather than the conventional four-engine, tractor propeller layout of other heavy bombers. The prototype R-4360s delivered a total of [...] While early B-36s required long <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs,</b> this situation was improved with later versions, delivering a significantly increased power output of [...] total. Each engine drove a three-bladed propeller, [...] in diameter, mounted in the pusher configuration, {{thought to be the}} second-largest diameter propeller design ever used to power a piston-engined aircraft. This unusual configuration prevented propeller turbulence from interfering with airflow over the wing, but could also lead to engine overheating due to insufficient airflow around the engines, resulting in inflight engine fires.|$|R
2500|$|On 2 September 1947, the P.1040 prototype, VP401, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Hawker N.7/46 after the related naval specification, conducted its maiden flight from RAF Boscome Down, piloted by Bill Humble. Three days later, VP401 flew to Farnborough to continue trials. A month after the first flight, the existence of the P.1040 was revealed to the general public. Early flight trials encountered aerodynamic-related teething problems, such as airframe vibrations and tail buffeting, which led to a redesign of the rear jetpipe fairings and the addition of a bullet-shaped anti-shock body on the tail to correct these issues. Other minor issues were addressed, including high stick forces and windshield distortion; VP401 needed long <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs</b> which were attributed to the [...] "low-thrust" [...] Nene 1.

2500|$|The {{intention}} {{was to have the}} Pellet flying a month before the race, but the aircraft sank at its first launch on 23 July 1923. It next flew on 26 September 1923, a day before the race. Inevitably, this flight revealed some problems, chiefly of trim and cooling, and that night a new radiator and propeller were fitted. It set off in the morning to the trials, but on the <b>takeoff</b> <b>run,</b> baulked by a small boat, the aircraft began porpoising and was wrecked.

50|$|Compared to the Northrop F-5, the Canadian CF-5 {{had several}} {{modifications}} {{to make it}} more suitable for operating in Canadian Forces theaters of operations. In order to address complaints about long <b>takeoff</b> <b>runs,</b> the Canadair version featured a two-position nose landing gear; compressed it operated like the original, but extended (before takeoff) it raised the nose and thereby increased the angle of attack and increased lift. The system reduced takeoff distance by almost 20%. A midair refueling probe was installed, Orenda built General Electric J85-15 engines with 4,300 lbf (19 kN) thrust were used, and a more sophisticated navigation system was added. The nose of the CF-5 was also interchangeable with a specially designed reconnaissance set with four cameras in it. Over the course of its life, it received many upgrades to its avionics and capabilities.|$|R
