25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever got <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> And I would fight against it vehemently. The {{effort to try to}} impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style. It basically says we're {{not going to let you}} keep talking about the things you want to talk about and the market wants to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was sitting}} at my desk {{examining}} the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn't that I believed I could make it work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, {{but it was all}} I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd keep coming back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{does not}} approve of the luxury of my surroundings," [...] he answered. [...] "He {{declined}} <b>to</b> write at <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> or <b>to</b> sit in <b>my</b> room." ...|$|R
60|$|Twelve o'clock arrived; {{the bell}} rang for a {{suspension}} of labour; the workpeople went off to their dinners; Steighton, too, departed, desiring me to lock the counting-house door, and take the key with me. I was tying up a bundle of papers, and putting them in their place, preparatory <b>to</b> closing <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> when Crimsworth reappeared at the door, and entering closed it behind him.|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} for me <b>to</b> leave <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> at that moment. We arranged to put off the walk until after dinner. During the meal, I observed that not Minna only, but her mother also, appeared {{to be out of}} spirits. Mr. Keller and Fritz probably noticed the change as I did. We were all of us more silent than usual. It was a relief so find myself with the lovers, out in the cheerful street.|$|R
60|$|I went quickly <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> {{unlocked}} it, {{and took}} out a photograph.|$|E
60|$|I'm {{going to}} stick close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> for a month, now, hoping to write a small book.|$|E
60|$|Are {{you willing}} to swear that you don't go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> when I'm away to read my letters? Come, Jenny, answer that question.|$|E
60|$|One Sunday afternoon, having {{walked the}} {{distance}} of half a league to the Protestant church, I came back weary and exhausted; and taking refuge in my solitary sanctuary, the first classe, I was glad to sit down, and <b>to</b> make of <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> a pillow for my arms and head.|$|R
50|$|As I lay on {{the floor}} on my back, the brick wall behind <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> blew out. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion. The wall fell on my legs; I could not feel them. I thought they were gone. The office filled with smoke, dust, and tear gas. What {{happened}} was that the blast first blew in the window and then traveled up an air shaft from the first floor <b>to</b> behind <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> We had had tear gas canisters on the first floor. The blast set them off so that the air rush that came up through the shaft brought the tear gas with it and also collapsed the wall.|$|R
6000|$|On {{reaching}} my Elm Street {{home the}} next day, I {{was surprised and}} deeply gratified <b>to</b> find on <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> a letter from William Dean Howells, in which he said: [...] "I am at the Palmer House. I hope you will {{come to see me}} soon, for I start for Kansas on a lecture trip in a few days." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{breath of}} fresh air did me good. I {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and was able once more to assume my habitual dignity and presence of mind.|$|E
60|$|He {{drew his}} chair nearer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and I leaned forward, with my {{elbows on the}} table, the finger-tips of one hand in contact {{with those of the}} other.|$|E
60|$|I walked {{deliberately}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> {{took out}} such {{of its contents}} as were my own property, put them in my pocket, locked the desk, and placed the key on the top.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{decline to}} answer further," [...] replied the master quickly, {{although}} his color had changed at the name. [...] "I decline to {{say another word}} on the matter until this mystery is cleared up--until I know who dared <b>to</b> break into <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> and steal <b>my</b> property, {{and the purpose of}} this unheard-of outrage. And I demand possession of those letters at once." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Bernard Ingham, {{the former}} press {{secretary}} to Margaret Thatcher, Wilberforce {{was a normal}} cat for whom Thatcher once bought [...] "a tin of sardines in a Moscow supermarket". Ingham was allergic to cats and {{did his best to}} avoid Wilberforce. [...] "Bloody Wilberforce used <b>to</b> sit under <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> and I would have a fit of sneezing. I hate cats", he said.|$|R
5000|$|Psychological {{accuracy}} is {{a hallmark of}} Mason’s fiction, and his fourth novel, [...] "History of a Pleasure Seeker" [...] (2011), is {{a treasure trove of}} insight and humour. An Oprah Pick of the Month, the story of a dashing young man’s adventures through the gilded age is “is the best new work of fiction <b>to</b> cross <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> in many moons.” (Jonathan Yardley, Washington Post) [...] In his “beautifully turned, classical style” (New York Times Book Review) Mason takes the lid off a privileged family and shows how sex, while not necessarily the same thing as love, can be a potent force for good.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, if you please, madam," [...] {{the clerk}} answered. [...] "I {{must go back}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> There are many arrivals just now. Will you allow me to send you something--a little brandy, perhaps?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is it," [...] Captain Bayley said, with a sigh. [...] "Alice, go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> {{open the}} inner compartment, {{and there you}} will see the fellow to it." [...] Alice did as he requested.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless I {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> in {{the expectation}} that the Mexican excitement was only a flurry and that the magazine {{would be able to}} complete the publication of the manuscript within the year. My harvest was not destroyed; it was only delayed.|$|E
60|$|April 1.--A pretty {{first of}} April truly; the hills white with snow, I myself as bilious as a dog. My noble guests left about noon. I wrote letters, as if I had not bile enough in my bosom already, {{and did not}} go out to face the snow wreaths till half-past two, when I am {{resolved}} to make a brush for exercise. There will be fine howling among the dogs, for I am about <b>to</b> shut <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> Found Mrs. Skene disposed to walk, so I {{had the advantage of}} her company. The snow lay three inches thick on the ground; but we had the better appetite for dinner, after which we talked and read without my lifting a pen.|$|R
6000|$|Two hours {{have passed}} since Mr. Franklin left me. As soon as his back was turned, I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> writing <b>desk</b> <b>to</b> start the story. There I have sat {{helpless}} (in spite of my abilities) ever since; seeing what Robinson Crusoe saw, as quoted above--namely, the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our own strength {{to go through with}} it. Please to remember, I opened the book by accident, at that bit, only the day before I rashly undertook the business now in hand; and, allow me to ask--if THAT isn't prophecy, what is? ...|$|R
5000|$|Coming {{out from}} a 5-month major {{depressive}} episode {{in the spring of}} 2006, Lieberman documents it in his first [...] "concept" [...] CD Melancholia Falling, his 11th CD released 31 October 2006.Syd Nathan of the Good Times Magazine said of Melancholia: [...] "Perhaps the most bizarre recording ever <b>to</b> come across <b>my</b> <b>desk...</b> being an old fashioned concept album as it deals with the Rabbi's recent bout of depression and coming with an actual warning against suicide on the cd itself, as the main character takes his life, this is totally convoluted".|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are right. I'll go {{with you}} to the car, and then I must go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> for six hours of hard work. Put this behind you," [...] he said tenderly. [...] "It does no good to suffer over the inevitable. Forget those men!" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{returning}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> I laid {{my head on}} my arms, {{nor would}} I speak to him for two days afterwards. He pained and chagrined me. His affection had been very sweet and dear--a pleasure new and incomparable: now that this seemed withdrawn, I cared not for his lessons.|$|E
6000|$|... "Soit!" [...] was his response; and, {{gathering}} his {{flowers in}} his arms, he flashed out of classe; while I, consigning my work, scissors, thimble, and the neglected little box, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> swept up-stairs. I don't {{know whether he}} felt hot and angry, but I am free to confess that I did.|$|E
60|$|April 23.--- Dined at Lady Davy's with Lord and Lady Lansdowne, {{and several}} other fashionable folks. My keys were sent <b>to</b> Bramah's with <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> so I {{have not had the}} means of putting matters down {{regularly}} for several days; but who cares for the whipp'd cream of London society? Our poor little Johnnie is extremely ill. My fears have been uniform for this engaging child. We are in God's hands. But the comfortable and happy object of my journey is ended,--Seged, Emperor of Ethiopia,[175] was right after all.|$|R
60|$|I have at {{this moment}} got Pickwick and his friends on the Rochester coach, {{and they are going}} on swimmingly, in company with a very {{different}} character from any I have yet described, who I flatter myself will make a decided hit. I want to get them from the ball to the inn before I go to bed; and I think that will take me until one or two o'clock at the earliest. The publishers will be here in the morning, so you will readily suppose I have no alternative but <b>to</b> stick at <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|R
40|$|Judge James K. Logan {{has taught}} {{me a great deal}} about how to lead a well-integrated {{professional}} life. My mind 2 ̆ 7 s ear can hear Judge Logan 2 ̆ 7 s voice admonishing me <b>to</b> clear <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> of correspondence and other chores before tackling the day 2 ̆ 7 s task of writing. I also hear Judge Logan telling me to develop an expertise in one of the private law areas so that my inclination for government intervention will not be marginalized for failure to consider the private reaction of the regulated. Judge Logan takes tremendous interest in the lives of his clerks. He showed us by example that there need not be a sharp dichotomy between the professional and personal spheres. It was fitting that Judge Logan married Jennifer Brown and me just two years ago in my parents 2 ̆ 7 house in Kansas City...|$|R
6000|$|I {{staggered}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and {{sat there}} in a deep study. My blind inveteracy returned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?--my hired clerk? What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, {{that he will be}} sure to refuse to do? ...|$|E
60|$|I put Tittums in {{my pocket}} and {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> I forgot her for the moment, and when I looked I found that she had squirmed {{out of my pocket}} on to the table and was trying to swallow the pen; then she put her leg into the ink-pot and upset it; then she licked her leg; then she swore again--at me this time.|$|E
60|$|I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> {{took out}} the last letter I had written {{and gave it to}} him in silence. While he read it I stood in a shadowy corner and watched him, {{wondering}} if life could always be as sweet as this. When he had finished he turned to me and held out his arms. I went to them as a bird to her nest, and with his lips against mine the old feud was blotted out forever.|$|E
6000|$|March 18.--I {{like the}} hermit life {{indifferent}} well, nor would, I sometimes think, break my heart, were I {{to be in}} that magic mountain where food was regularly supplied by ministering genii,[277] and plenty of books were accessible without the least intervention of human society. But this is thinking like a fool. Solitude is only agreeable when the power of having society is removed to a short space, and can be commanded at pleasure. [...] "It is not good for man to be alone." [...] It blunts our faculties and freezes our active virtues. And now, <b>my</b> watch pointing <b>to</b> noon, I think after four hours' work I may indulge myself with a walk. The dogs see me about <b>to</b> shut <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and intimate their happiness by caresses and whining. By your leave, Messrs. Genii of the Mountain library, if I come to your retreat I'll bring my dogs with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mention it}} because I'd no idea you were interested. Daddy loves old things, and I sent it home {{so he would}} have it on his return. By freight. You are away at the Shop all day, you know, so I asked Uncle Eben to get me a big box, which he brought <b>to</b> <b>my</b> room. The <b>desk</b> fitted it nicely. I nailed on the cover myself, and Uncle Eben {{took it to the}} freight office for me. See; here's the receipt, in my pocket-book." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Make-believe. Make-believe." [...] The phrase and Britten's squat {{gestures}} haunted me as I walked homeward alone. I went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{room and}} stood before <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> and surveyed papers and files and Margaret's admirable equipment of me.|$|R
