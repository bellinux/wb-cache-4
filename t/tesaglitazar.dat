Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that the dual PPARα/γ agonist <b>tesaglitazar</b> reduces atherosclerosis in a mouse model of hyperlipidemia by reducing both lipid content and inflammation in the aorta. However, much of the underlying mechanism of <b>tesaglitazar</b> in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains less clear. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether <b>tesaglitazar</b> attenuates NAFLD and atherosclerosis development in diabetic low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (LDLr-/-) mice. Female LDLr-/- mice (3 weeks old) were induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) injection to develop an animal model of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM). The mice were randomly divided into two groups: diabetic group (untreated diabetic mice, n= 15) and <b>tesaglitazar</b> therapeutic group (n= 15, 20 µg/ kg/day oral treatment for 6 weeks). Fifteen LDLr-/- mice were fed with an HFD as the control group. <b>Tesaglitazar</b> decreased serum glucose and lipid levels compared with the diabetic mice. <b>Tesaglitazar</b> significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions, lipid accumulation in the liver, macrophage infiltra-tion, and decreased total hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride content compared to the diabetic mice. In addition, <b>tesaglitazar</b> reduced inflammatory markers at both the serum and mRNA levels.

Whole body glucose disposal rate () and hepatic glucose output (HGO) were assessed under basal fasting and hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic clamp conditions using [3, 3 H]glucose. Indices of tissue specific glucose utilization () were measured at basal, physiological, and supraphysiological levels of insulinemia using 2 -deoxy-D-[2, 6 - 3 H]glucose. Finally, whole body and tissue specific FFA and glucose utilization and metabolic fate were evaluated under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions {{using a combination of}} [U- 13 C]glucose, 2 -deoxy-D-[U- 14 C]glucose, [U- 14 C]palmitate, and [9, 10 - 3 H]-(R) -bromopalmitate. <b>Tesaglitazar</b> improved whole body insulin action by greater suppression of HGO and stimulation of compared to obese controls.

40|$|Background and purpose: We have {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α/γ agonist on the progression of pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions in APOE* 3 Leiden. cholesteryl ester transfer protein (E 3 L. CETP) transgenic mice. Experimental approach: E 3 L. CETP mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 11 weeks to induce atherosclerosis, followed by a low-cholesterol diet for 4 weeks to obtain a lower plasma total cholesterol level of ∼ 10 mmol·L- 1. Mice were divided into three groups, which were either killed before (baseline) or after an 8 week treatment period with low-cholesterol diet without (control) or with the PPARα/γ agonist <b>tesaglitazar</b> (10 μg·kg - 1 ·day- 1). Atherosclerosis was assessed in the aortic root. Key results: Treatment with <b>tesaglitazar</b> significantly reduced plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, CETP mass and CETP activity, and increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. At baseline, substantial atherosclerosis had developed. During the 8 week low-cholesterol diet, atherosclerosis progressed in the control group with respect to lesion area and severity, whereas <b>tesaglitazar</b> inhibited lesion progression during this period. <b>Tesaglitazar</b> reduced vessel wall inflammation, as reflected by decreased monocyte adhesion and macrophage area, and modified lesions to a more stabilized phenotype, with increased smooth muscle cell content in the cap and collagen content. Conclusions and implications: Dual PPARα/γ agonism with <b>tesaglitazar</b> markedly improved the atherogenic triad by reducing triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and increasing high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and additionally reduced cholesterol-induced vessel wall activation.

Methods and Results: Gene expression microarray profiles were obtained from primary human hepatocytes treated with EC 50 -aligned low, medium and high concentrations of the three treatments. A systems biology approach, Causal Network Modeling, was used to model the data to infer upstream molecular mechanisms that may explain the observed changes in gene expression. Aleglitazar, <b>tesaglitazar</b> and Pio/Feno each induced unique transcriptional signatures, despite comparable core PPAR signaling. Although all treatments inferred qualitatively similar PPAR-a signaling, aleglitazar was inferred to have greater effects on high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than <b>tesaglitazar</b> and Pio/Feno, due to a greater number of gene expression changes in pathways related to high-density and low-density lipoprotein metabolism. Distinct transcriptional and biologic signatures were also inferred for stress responses, which appeared to be less affected by aleglitazar than the comparators. In particular, Pio/Feno was inferred to increase NFE 2 L 2 activity, a key component of the stress response pathway, while aleglitazar had no significant effect.

40|$|A central aim in drug {{development}} {{is to ensure}} that the new drug is efficacious and safe in the intended patient population. Mathematical models describing the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) properties of a drug are valuable to increase the knowledge about drug effects and disease and can be used to inform decisions. The aim of this thesis was to develop mechanism-based PK-PD-disease models for important safety and efficacy biomarkers used in anti-diabetic {{drug development}}. Population PK, PK-PD and disease models were developed, based on data from clinical studies in subjects with varying degrees of renal function, non-diabetic subjects with insulin resistance and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), receiving a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α/γ agonist, <b>tesaglitazar.</b> The PK model showed that a decreased renal elimination of the metabolite in renally impaired subjects leads to increased levels of metabolite undergoing interconversion and subsequent accumulation of <b>tesaglitazar.</b> <b>Tesaglitazar</b> negatively affects the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and since renal function affects <b>tesaglitazar</b> exposure, a PK-PD model was developed to simultaneously describe this interrelationship. The model and data showed that all patients had decreases in GFR, which were reversible when discontinuing treatment. The PK-PD model described the interplay between fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and haemoglobin in T 2 DM patients. It provided a mechanistically plausible description of the release and aging of red blood cells (RBC), and the glucose dependent glycosylation of RBC to HbA 1 c. The PK-PD model for FPG and fasting insulin, incorporating components for β-cell mass, insulin sensitivity and impact of disease and drug treatment, realistically described the complex glucose homeostasis in the heterogeneous patient population.

40|$|International audienceSpecies-differential toxic {{effects have}} been {{described}} with PPARα and PPARγ agonists between rodent and human liver. PPARα agonists (fibrates) are potent hypocholesterolemic agents in humans while they induce peroxisome proliferation and tumors in rodent liver. By contrast, PPARγ agonists (glitazones) and even dual PPARα/γ agonists (glitazars) have caused idiosyncratic hepatic and nonhepatic toxicities in human without evidence of any damage in rodent during preclinical studies. The mechanisms involved in such differences remain largely unknown. Several studies have identified the major target genes of PPARα agonists in rodent liver while no comprehensive analysis has been performed on gene expression changes induced by PPARγ and dual PPARα/γ agonists. Here, we investigated transcriptomes of rat hepatocytes after 24 h treatment with two PPARγ (troglitazone and rosiglitazone) and two PPARα/γ (muraglitazar and <b>tesaglitazar)</b> agonists. Although, hierarchical clustering revealed a gene expression profile characteristic of each PPAR agonist class, {{only a limited number}} of genes was specifically deregulated by glitazars. Functional analyses showed that many genes known as PPARα targets were also modulated by both PPARγ and PPARα/γ agonists and quantitative differences in gene expression profiles were observed between these two classes. Moreover, most major genes modulated in rat hepatocytes were also found to be deregulated in rat liver after <b>tesaglitazar</b> treatment. Taken altogether, these results support the conclusion that differential toxic effects of PPARα and PPARγ agonists in rodent liver do not result from transcriptional deregulation of major PPAR target genes but rather from qualitative and/or quantitative differential responses of a small subset of genes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There {{are three}} {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) subtypes which are commonly designated PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma and PPAR beta/delta. PPAR alpha activation increases high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol synthesis, stimulates “reverse” cholesterol transport and reduces triglycerides. PPAR gamma activation results in insulin sensitization and antidiabetic action. Combined treatments with PPAR gamma and alpha agonists may potentially improve insulin resistance and alleviate atherogenic dyslipidemia, whereas PPAR delta properties may prevent {{the development of}} overweight which typically accompanies “pure ” PPAR gamma ligands. The new generation of dual-action PPARs—the glitazars, which target PPAR-gamma and PPAR-alpha (like muraglitazar and <b>tesaglitazar)</b> were on deck in late-stage clinical trials for sometime and were considered effective in reducing cardiovascular risk, but their long-term clinical effects were unknown. Thus glitazars offered a hope of {{a new approach to}} diabetes care addressing not just glycemia, but dyslipidemia and other components of the metabolic syndrome, though the side effect profile remains unknown. No human data is available, and so it remains highly speculative. The glitazars and on the newly published results for muraglitazar and <b>tesaglitazar.</b> “The PPAR-alpha is a good target and is being developed to yield more potent drugs that work through PPAR-alpha, and at the same time, improve on the PPAR-gamma.

Beyond these and other novel agents being developed to meet the challenge of the worldwide epidemic of diabetes, the central place of insulin in diabetes care cannot be forgotten.

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} (PPAR) agonists {{are used}} as adjunct therapy {{in the treatment of}} diabetes mellitus. Fibrates, including fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, benzafibrate, ciprofibrate, and clofibrate act on PPAR alpha to reduce the level of hypertriglyceridemia. However, agonists (ligands) of PPAR-beta/delta receptors, such as <b>tesaglitazar,</b> muraglitazar, ragaglitazar, imiglitazar, aleglitazar, alter the body's energy substrate preference from glucose to lipids and hence contribute to the reduction of blood glucose level. Glitazones or thiazolidinediones on the other hand, bind to PPAR-gamma receptors located in the nuclei of cells. Activation of PPAR-gamma receptors leads to a decrease in insulin resistance and modification of adipocyte metabolism. They reduce hyperlipidaemia by increasing the level of ATP-binding cassette A 1, which modifies extra-hepatic cholesterol into HDL. Dual or pan PPAR ligands stimulate two or more isoforms of PPAR and thereby reduce insulin resistance and prevent short- and long-term complications of diabetes including micro-and macroangiopathy and atherosclerosis, which are caused by deposition of cholesterol.

One mg of the dual PPAR α/γ agonist <b>tesaglitazar</b> was given once daily during six weeks to CKD patients, and to healthy subjects.

40|$|Background: Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} (PPAR) agonists reduce voluntary ethanol (EtOH) {{consumption in}} rat models and are promising therapeutics {{in the treatment}} for drug addictions. We studied the effects of different classes of PPAR agonists on chronic EtOH intake and preference in mice with a genetic predisposition for high alcohol consumption and then examined human genome-wide association data for polymorphisms in PPAR genes in alcohol-dependent subjects. Methods: Two different behavioral tests were used to measure intake of 15 % EtOH in C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice: 24 -hour 2 -bottle choice and limited access (3 -hour) 2 -bottle choice, drinking in the dark.

However, most have caused idiosyncratic hepatic or extrahepatic toxicities through mechanisms that remain largely unknown. Since the liver {{plays a key role in}} lipid metabolism, we analyzed changes in gene expression profiles induced by these two types of PPAR agonists in human hepatocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Primary human hepatocytes and the well-differentiated human hepatoma HepaRG cells were exposed to different concentrations of two PPARc (troglitazone and rosiglitazone) and two PPARa/c (muraglitazar and <b>tesaglitazar)</b> agonists for 24 h and their transcriptomes were analyzed using human pangenomic Agilent microarrays.

40|$|The {{development}} of covariate models within the population modeling program like NONMEM is generally a time-consuming and non-trivial task. In this study, a fast procedure to approximate {{the change in}} objective function values of covariate–parameter models is presented and evaluated. The proposed method is a first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) -based linear approximation {{of the influence of}} covariates on the model predictions. Simulated and real datasets were used to compare this method with the conventional nonlinear mixed effect model using both first-order (FO) and FOCE approximations. The methods were mainly assessed in terms of difference in objective function values (ΔOFV) between base and covariate models. The FOCE linearization was superior to the FO linearization and showed a high degree of concordance with corresponding nonlinear models in ΔOFV.

40|$|International audienceAlthough non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) is {{currently}} {{the most common form}} of chronic liver disease there is no pharmacological agent approved for its treatment. Since peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are closely associated with hepatic lipid metabolism, they seem to play important roles in NAFLD. However, the effects of PPAR agonists on steatosis that is a common pathology associated with NAFLD, remain largely controversial. In this study, the effects of various PPAR agonists, i. e. fenofibrate, bezafibrate, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, muraglitazar and <b>tesaglitazar</b> on oleic acid-induced steatotic HepaRG cells were investigated after a single 24 -hour or 2 -week repeat treatment. Lipid vesicles stained by Oil-Red O and triglycerides accumulation caused by oleic acid overload, were decreased, by up to 50 %, while fatty acid oxidation was induced after 2 -week co-treatment with PPAR agonists. The greatest effects on reduction of steatosis were obtained with the dual PPARα/γ agonist muraglitazar. Such improvement of steatosis was associated with up-regulation of genes related to fatty acid oxidation activity and down-regulation of many genes involved in lipogenesis. Moreover, modulation of expression of some nuclear receptor genes, such as FXR, LXRα and CAR, which are potent actors in the control of lipogenesis, was observed and might explain repression of de novo lipogenesis. CONCLUSION: Altogether, our in vitro data on steatotic HepaRG cells treated with PPAR agonists correlated well with clinical investigations, bringing a proof of concept that drug-induced reversal of steatosis in human can be evaluated in in vitro before conducting long-term and costly in vivo studies in animals and patients...|$|E

The thiazolidinediones (TZDs; e. g., pioglitazone) and fibrate (e. g., fenofibrate) drugs {{are used for}} the treatment of diabetes and dyslipidemia. These agents target the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, PPARγ and PPARα, which are transcription factors that influence glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and organ protection. In this study, we explored the effects of pioglitazone and other PPAR agonists to prevent gentamicin-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in mouse organ of Corti (OC) explants. Western blots showed high levels of PPARγ and PPARα proteins in mouse OC lysates. Immunofluorescence assays indicated that PPARγ and PPARα proteins are present in auditory HCs and other cell types in the mouse cochlea. Gentamicin treatment induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, caspase activation, PARP- 1 cleavage, and HC apoptosis in cultured OCs. Pioglitazone mediated its anti-apoptotic effects by opposing the increase in ROS induced by gentamicin, which inhibited the subsequent formation of 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (4 -HNE) and activation of pro-apoptotic mediators. Pioglitazone mediated its effects by upregulating genes that control ROS production and detoxification pathways leading to restoration of the reduced:oxidized glutathione ratio. Structurally diverse PPAR agonists were protective of HCs. Pioglitazone (PPARγ-specific), <b>tesaglitazar</b> (PPARγ/α-specific), and fenofibric acid (PPARα-specific) all provided > 90 % protection from gentamicin toxicity by regulation of overlapping subsets of genes controlling ROS detoxification.

This is an efficient way of learning about drugs and diseases from data collected in clinical trials. Identifying covariates which explain differences between patients {{is important to}} discover patient subpopulations at risk of sub-therapeutic or toxic effects and for treatment individualization. Stepwise covariate modelling (SCM) is commonly used to this end. The aim of the current thesis work was to evaluate SCM and to develop alternative approaches. A further aim {{was to develop a}} mechanistic PK-PD model describing fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, insulin sensitivity and beta-cell mass. The lasso is a penalized estimation method performing covariate selection simultaneously to shrinkage estimation. The lasso was implemented within NONMEM as an alternative to SCM and is discussed in comparison with that method. Further, various ways of incorporating information and propagating knowledge from previous studies into an analysis were investigated. In order to compare the different approaches, investigations were made under varying, replicated conditions. In the course of the investigations, more than one million NONMEM analyses were performed on simulated data. Due to selection bias the use of SCM performed poorly when analysing small datasets or rare subgroups. In these situations, the lasso method in NONMEM performed better, was faster, and additionally validated the covariate model. Alternatively, the performance of SCM can be improved by propagating knowledge or incorporating information from previously analysed studies and by population optimal design.

Dermal effects (including dermal thickness, collagen density, dermal expression of procollagen 1 and collagenase 13) and epidermal effects (including skin barrier function, epidermal proliferation, epidermal differentiation, and epidermal cytokines) were measured and compared. In photoaging murine skin, KR resulted in a significant recovery of dermal thickness as well as dermal fibroblasts, although it did not change dermal collagen density. KR increased the expression of dermal transforming growth factor (TGF) -β. The dermal effects of KR were explained by an increase in procollagen 1 expression, induced by TGF-β, and a decrease in MMP- 13 expression.

It is the only pan-PPAR activator {{with more than a}} quarter of a century of therapeutic experience with a good safety profile. Therefore, bezafibrate could be considered (indeed, as a "post hoc" understanding) as an "archetype" of a clinically tested pan-PPAR ligand. Bezafibrate leads to considerable raising of HDL cholesterol and reduces triglycerides, improves insulin sensitivity and reduces blood glucose level, significantly lowering the incidence of cardiovascular events and new diabetes in patients with features of metabolic syndrome. Clinical evidences obtained from bezafibrate-based studies strongly support the concept of pan-PPAR therapeutic approach to conditions which comprise the metabolic syndrome. However, from a biochemical point of view, bezafibrate is a PPAR ligand with a relatively low potency. More powerful new compounds with pan-PPAR activity and proven long-term safety should be highly effective in a clinical setting of patients with coexisting relevant lipid and glucose metabolism disorders. </p...|$|E
