25|$|The {{following}} morning, {{just before}} 7am, his wife Louise found his body hanged {{in the garage}} of his home. She telephoned the ambulance service at 7:08am and the police were also informed. They confirmed him as being dead and the police announced {{that they were not}} treating his death as suspicious. Although <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> not fully established, it was reported that Speed had died by suicide. His death was announced to the public by the Football Association of Wales a few hours later. An inquest into Speed's death convened on 29 November 2011. The inquest was adjourned until 30 January 2012.|$|E
25|$|Though all the {{communities}} had had partial success with gaining interest from African-Americans none {{had had to}} deal strongly with opposition in such matters {{and none of them}} had made a point of focusing on it as a priority. A national policy among Bahá'ís had started to form from work of Gregory meeting with Bahá'ís at Fisk University in 1934, a spiritual assembly in Nashville was elected in 1935, and a regional conference was proposed in 1936 to include a visit from the National Assembly. The development encountered the question of a high-profile series of integrated meetings. Indeed, one of the hotel's hosting one of the six resulting meetings objected and the Bahá'ís appeared to relent. W. E. B. DuBois noticed and initially was misinformed {{of the nature of the}} resolution to which then secretary of the national assembly Horace Holley responded that <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> not as DuBois understood them and that it was the hotel that had relented at the last minute - however a policy had been stated that, short of out of control reactions, integrated meetings should be held but in the case of over-reactions segregated meetings could be held with a longer term goal of fully integrated ones theoretically. But in this case the situation was avoided by the change in judgement of the hotel. All of the shifting options became mute when in 1938 a final policy was voiced - published under the title Advent of Divine Justice by Shoghi Effendi with a frank and prolonged discussion of the problem of race prejudice underscoring the short-term requirement and long term goal of complete integration and freedom from racial prejudice. All meetings were to be integrated and individuals to seek to adjust their habits in the matter. In addition, a matter of policy began that in tie votes in elections minorities were to be automatically given approval of the position. One result was the formation of a Race Unity Committee in 1940 with Louis Gregory and Dorothy Beecher Baker, a White descendent of abolitionists. A situation in the Atlanta Bahá'í community was resolved with integration even to the point of letting White people leave the religion if they couldn't accept the standard. Correspondence among South Carolinian communities buzzed with the development.|$|E

According to Charlottesville Police Capt. Gary Pleasants, Phi Kappa Psi has been cleared; [...] "We found no basis to believe that an incident occurred at that fraternity, so there's no reason to keep them suspended."

500|$|The {{competence}} and ethics {{of two of}} the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Before the autopsy was complete and toxicology results known, medical examiner Dr. Jerry Francisco declared the cause of death as cardiac arrhythmia, a condition that can be determined only in someone who is still alive. Allegations of a cover-up were widespread. While Presley's main physician, Dr. Nichopoulos, was exonerated of criminal liability for the singer's death, <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> startling: [...] "In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [...] more than 10,000 doses of sedatives, amphetamines and narcotics: all in Elvis's name." [...] His license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.|$|E
500|$|While officially {{the matter}} was {{considered}} closed, many individual MPs had doubts, although none openly expressed disbelief at this stage. Wigg later said that he left the House that morning [...] "with black rage in my heart because I knew what <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were.</b> I knew the truth." [...] Most newspapers were editorially non-committal; only The Guardian, under the headline [...] "Mr Profumo clears the air", stated openly that the statement should be taken at its face value. Within a few days press attention was distracted by the re-emergence of Keeler, in Madrid. She expressed astonishment at the fuss her absence had caused, adding that her friendship with Profumo and his wife was entirely innocent {{and that she had}} many friends in important positions. She claimed that she had not deliberately missed the Edgecombe trial but had been confused about the date. She was required to forfeit her recognizance of £40, but no other action was taken against her.|$|E

2500|$|Forsyth {{responded that}} under the {{separation}} of powers in the U.S. Constitution, the President could not influence the court case. He said that {{the question of whether the}} [...] "negroes of the Amistad" [...] had been enslaved in violation of the Treaty was still an open one, [...] "and this Government would with great reluctance erect itself into a tribunal to investigate such questions between two friendly sovereigns." [...] He noted that when <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> determined, they could be taken into account. He suggested that if the Court found for Spanish rights of property, the Africans would be returned to Cuba. At that point, Great Britain and Spain could argue their questions of law and treaties between them.|$|E

2500|$|In this case, {{the court}} quickly {{detected}} the plot and merely needed confirmation. [...] But what of cases where <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> not clear, or {{the decision was}} difficult? [...] It was these that provided the gravest difficulties with jury trials following the abolition of trial by ordeal. [...] Upon the calling of a general Court of Eyre, {{it was easy to}} assemble a thousand or more jurors, who could be questioned, and pronounce a prisoner guilty or not. [...] If the proceedings were instigated upon the delivery and indictment from a gaol, before a non-professional judge, most prisoners were coerced to put themselves upon the mercy of a jury trial, and forgo their ancient right to trial by ordeal. If they refused a jury trial, there was no option but to keep them in prison until they changed their mind.|$|E
2500|$|Colonel Hinkle rode to {{the church}} leaders in Far West and {{informed}} them of the offered terms.

Smith and the other leaders rode with Hinkle back to the Missouri militia encampment. [...] The militia promptly arrested Smith and the other leaders. [...] Smith believed that Hinkle had betrayed him, but Hinkle maintained his innocence and claimed that he was following Smith's orders. [...] To William Wines Phelps, a fellow Latter-day Saint and witness to the events, Hinkle wrote: [...] "When <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> laid before Joseph, did he not say, 'I will go'; and did not the others go with him, and that, too, voluntarily, so far as you and I were concerned?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2010 Los Zetas {{broke apart}} from the Gulf Cartel and both {{organizations}} began to turn their weapons against each other. The clash between these two groups first happened in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, and then expanded to Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros. The war then spread out through 11 municipalities of Tamaulipas, nine of them bordering the US state of Texas. Soon the violence generated between these two groups had spread to Tamaulipas' neighboring states of Nuevo León and Veracruz. In the midst of violence and panic, local authorities and the media tried to minimize the situation and claim that [...] "nothing was occurring," [...] but <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> impossible to cover up. Confrontations between these two groups have paralyzed entire cities in broad daylight. Several witnesses claimed {{that many of the}} municipalities throughout Tamaulipas were [...] "war zones," [...] and that many businesses and houses were burned down, leaving areas in [...] "total destruction." [...] The bloodbath in Tamaulipas has caused thousands of deaths, but most of the shootings and body counts often go unreported.|$|E

2500|$|On November 17, 2008, it was {{reported}} that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil suit against Mark Cuban relating to alleged insider trading in the shares of Mamma.com, now known as Copernic. A stock dilution occurred shortly after a trade in June 2004, giving hints of inside knowledge {{at the time of the}} trade, and Cuban allegedly was saved from a loss of $750,000. The SEC claimed that Cuban ordered the sale of his holdings in Mamma.com after he had been confidentially approached by the company to participate in a transaction likely to dilute shares of current shareholders. Cuban disputed the charges, saying he had not agreed to keep the information secret. On his blog, Cuban contended <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> false and that the investigation was [...] "a product of gross abuse of prosecutorial discretion". DealBook, a section of The New York Times, reported through an anonymous source that Cuban believed the investigation was motivated by an SEC employee having taken offense to his interest in possibly distributing the film Loose Change.|$|E
2500|$|The {{theoretical}} {{issue that}} soon held center stage {{was the matter}} of taxation without representation. Benjamin Franklin had raised this {{as far back as}} 1754 at the Albany Congress when he wrote, [...] "That it is suppos’d an undoubted Right of Englishmen not to be taxed but by their own Consent given thro’ their Representatives. That the Colonies have no Representatives in Parliament." [...] The counter to this argument was the theory of virtual representation. Thomas Whately enunciated this theory in a pamphlet that readily acknowledged that there could be no taxation without consent, but <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> that at least 75% of British adult males were not represented in Parliament because of property qualifications or other factors. [...] Members of Parliament were bound to represent the interests of all British citizens and subjects, so colonists were the recipients of virtual representation in Parliament, like those disenfranchised subjects in the British Isles. [...] This theory, however, ignored a crucial difference between the unrepresented in Britain and the colonists. [...] The colonists enjoyed actual representation in their own legislative assemblies, and the issue was whether these legislatures, rather than Parliament, were in fact the sole recipients of the colonists' consent with regard to taxation.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson's {{announcement}} of the incidents involving the destroyers did not mention that SOG vessels had been conducting operations within the same geographic area as the Maddox immediately before, and during, that cruise. Neither did he mention that on 1 and 2 August Laotian aircraft, flown by Thai pilots, had carried out bombing raids within North Vietnam itself or that a SOG agent team had been inserted into the same relative area and had been detected by the North Vietnamese. Hanoi, which may have assumed {{that all of these}} actions signaled an increased level of U.S. aggression, decided to respond (in what it claimed as its territorial waters). Thus, the three P-4s were ordered to attack the Maddox. The second incident, in which Maddox and Turner Joy were claimed to be attacked, never took place. Although some confusion reigned {{at the time of the}} second attack, <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> clear to the administration by the time it went to Congress to obtain the resolution. When confronted by Senator Wayne Morse (who had discovered the existence of SOG's 34-Alpha raids), McNamara lied to him, stating [...] "Our Navy played absolutely no part in, was not associated with, and was not aware of any South Vietnamese actions." [...] Yet both Commander in Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC) and he were well aware of the possible connections, at least insofar as they might have existed in the minds of the Hanoi leadership. These events were not disclosed until the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1970.|$|E
6000|$|The {{opinions}} of the Judges were taken in the House of Lords, on the 19th of March, 1715, upon two questions which had been argued in arrest of judgment, grounded chiefly on {{the practice of the}} courts below. To the first the Judges answered,--"It is necessary that there be a certain day laid in such indictments, on which <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> alleged to be committed; and that alleging in such indictments that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> committed at or about a certain day would not be sufficient." [...] To the second they answered, [...] "that, although a day certain, when <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> supposed to be done, be alleged in such indictments, yet it is not necessary upon the trial to prove <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> to <b>be</b> committed upon that day; but it is sufficient, if proved to be done on any other day before the indictment found." ...|$|R
