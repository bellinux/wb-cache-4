5|$|Some House Republicans were {{critical}} of Thorne-Begland's {{lying to the}} Navy about his homosexuality, stating that his violation of the military's code of conduct made him unfit for a judgeship. Delegates also stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> Thorne-Begland's homosexuality and previous history of activism would influence his rulings on the bench.|$|E
5|$|They toured Australia in February 2009 {{as part of}} the St Jerome's Laneway Festival. In April 2009, manager Martin Pike {{announced}} a pause in the band's career together for the time being. After 19 years, he said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> it was time to take a rest and move on to new projects.|$|E
5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} only use nonviolent means of {{protest against the}} company. Many union members practiced this method of civil disobedience and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road blockades. However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the anger <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E
6000|$|So <b>that</b> again <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> assured and glad, [...] Soon as {{they issued}} {{forth from the}} dead air, [...] Where every sight and thought had made them sad.|$|R
50|$|More {{traditional}} lyrics in {{the realm}} of positive relationships and religion were aided with clean in-line production. The band also noted <b>that</b> while <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> pressured at times, it was a welcome change of pace, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> never intend to leave their roots; only expand them.|$|R
5000|$|Eugène Casalis later {{remarked that}} the trekkers had humbly asked for {{temporary}} rights {{while they were}} still few in number, but <b>that</b> when <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> [...] "strong enough to throw off the mask" [...] they went back on their initial intention.|$|R
5|$|Former {{chairman}} Eggert Magnússon {{made clear}} his ambition for West Ham {{to move to}} the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Summer Olympics, a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> it was a logical move for the Government {{as it was in the}} borough of Newham.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 poll {{conducted}} by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia's flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could recall {{the words of the}} first line of the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could not identify the anthem's first line. Overall, only 25% of respondents said they liked the anthem.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{intended}} to make Sawyer look like less of a belligerent, as he had generally acted as the antagonist in previous episodes. It also {{set the stage for}} the love triangle between Kate, Sawyer, and Jack. The episode was first broadcast in the United States on November 10, 2004, earning 18.44 million viewers. It received mostly positive reviews, although a few reviewers discussed aspects of the episode <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> did not blend in well with the rest of the episode and series.|$|E
60|$|So {{sheltered}} were <b>they,</b> indeed, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> scarce <b>felt</b> {{the wind}} that was howling above them, and were as comfortable beneath their boat {{as they had been}} in their hut by the river side.|$|R
6000|$|... "But suppose," [...] {{continued}} Ruth, [...] "that {{there were}} great {{difficulties in the}} way of doing <b>that,</b> and <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> as much objection to receive gratuitous victuals as money, what would you do then? you would not let them starve, would you?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a general}} exodus the moment she appeared. The Richmond yokels {{did not like the}} look of <b>that</b> reticule. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{sufficient}} demand had already been made upon their scant purses, considering the meagerness of the entertainment, and they dreaded being lured to further extravagance.|$|R
5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Ferrari exited FOTA, the Formula One Teams Association, {{following}} prolonged {{debate over}} {{the implementation of the}} controversial Resource Restriction Agreement, though Red Bull team principal Christian Horner reaffirmed his team's commitment to cost-cutting measures and highlighting the team's concerns over certain loopholes in the Resource Restriction Agreement <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> teams and manufacturers would willingly exploit. One week later, Sauber also left the organisation, though the Swiss team did not publicly give a reason for ending their membership. In February 2012, Red Bull Racing's sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso was also reported as having left the organisation since the first schism in December.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{proposed that}} the municipality buy shares for NOK150,000. When the issue was debated in the municipal council on 9 June, it met with resistance from representatives from Tranby in the west of Lier, who stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that the railway would have no impact on them, and that the municipality should only buy shares for NOK75,000. It resulted in a compromise where the municipality bought shares for NOK100,000. A year later, the municipality purchased shares for an addition NOK30,000. The other major shareholders were Drammen Municipality with NOK30,000, Buskerud County Municipality with NOK50,000 and private investors, who supplied NOK174,050.|$|E
50|$|The Ministry of Education {{decided to}} ban the street parties in 1899. The rector V I Sergeevich warned that partying {{students}} would be arrested for hooliganism. The students were appalled as they had already decided to be more restrained <b>that</b> year. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> humiliated because the notice {{was published in the}} papers too.|$|R
5000|$|He died in mysterious {{circumstances}} - he {{was found}} murdered most probably by Pazhassi partisans in revenge. It is also {{said that it was}} English who did <b>that</b> as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> he had outlived his utility, and also as a punishment for espionage he did for rebel Raja for nearly 12 years.|$|R
60|$|The sound which {{broke from}} our men could scarce {{be called a}} cheer. <b>That</b> which <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> as <b>they</b> sank {{exhausted}} on the blood of their comrades {{may not have been}} elation. My own feeling was of unmixed wonder as I gazed at a calm profile above me, sharp-cut against the moon.|$|R
5|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by contemporary music critics, {{many of which}} praised Carey's large spanning vocal range, {{as well as its}} gospel influence <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was missing on most of Music Box. Aside from its critical acceptance, the song achieved strong worldwide chart positions and peaked at number twelve on the US Billboard Hot 100, but became her first single to miss out the top-ten. Additionally, it peaked at number five in Canada and topped the singles charts in Finland and the Netherlands. The song attained a top-twenty peak position in Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} the premier's chair Dunderdale {{was faced with}} an ongoing dispute between the province's doctors and government over contract negotiations. In November, 14 doctors announced their resignations over the government's latest offer of a 31percent wage increase <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was not enough. At her swearing in as premier Dunderdale stated that earlier that week she had asked Health Minister Jerome Kennedy and Finance Minister Tom Marshall {{to meet with the}} Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association (NLMA) later that day to work out a resolution to the dispute. After the meeting Dunderdale announced she hoped to have a deal signed with the province's doctors before Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
60|$|One more {{reference}} {{was made}} {{to the state of}} things between them late that night, when Elizabeth had gone to her room, and the two young men had stumbled off to bed in such a state of sleep <b>that</b> <b>they</b> hardly <b>felt</b> the floor beneath their feet after a day's shooting.|$|R
50|$|In 1886, the {{authorities}} of Prussia prepared {{a new policy}} of Germanisation of the provinces with a Polish population. According to Heinrich Tiedemann, {{the author of the}} plan, the reason why all earlier attempts at bringing more German settlers to the province failed was <b>that</b> <b>they</b> allegedly <b>felt</b> uncertain and alien there.|$|R
50|$|Lars Seier Christensen and Kim Fournais formed Midas Fondsmæglerselskab {{after meeting}} in London {{in the early}} 1990s. Christensen {{was working as a}} broker for Gerald Metals at the time while Fournais worked at the now defunct Lannung Bank. The two said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> both <b>felt</b> like <b>they</b> had found their {{business}} soul mate.|$|R
5|$|His signing by the Steelers {{caused a}} social media {{backlash}} by many Steeler fans, with some {{saying that they}} would never support the team again. Fans who supported or were indifferent about the signing called such fans fair weather fans, and also cited that the Steelers have several players with questionable pasts, most notably Roethlisberger and James Harrison. The Animal Rescue League of Western Pennsylvania made a subtle jab at the team on Twitter by saying that they were now more proud to support the Pittsburgh Penguins and subsequently moved an upcoming fundraiser event from Heinz Field to Consol Energy Center. Steelers president Art Rooney II defended the Vick signing on KDKA-TV, saying <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that Vick had proven himself since being released from prison. The Steelers had considered signing Vick in 2009—both Vick and Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin are from the same part of Virginia and know each other well personally—but decided against it due to potential backlash since Vick at the time hadn't proven himself following his release from prison.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, {{parliament}} {{started a}} new process to consider Heimdal as the primary airport, {{in part because the}} airlines and the Civil Aviation Administration stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> Værnes was insufficient. However, higher costs—due to bad ground conditions and existing infrastructure at Værnes, valuated at NOK 150 million—caused parliament to support Værnes. Construction of the new runway therefore commenced in January 1959, with the work subcontracted to Selmer. First the artificial peninsula was built, then the delta of the Stjørdal River was moved, before a tunnel was built around the highway and railway. Finally, the runway could be built on top, and construction completed on 21 October 1961. In 1963, the airport had 115,000 passengers, increasing to 195,000 the following year. That year, SAS started using the Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft on their route.|$|E
5|$|Lydia first {{appears in}} March 2009 {{as a friend}} of Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood). She orders Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson) to fire Sarah after her sister Persephone Hart tells her that Sarah hit her. Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) steals Lydia's handbag and she accuses Josh's girlfriend Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies). She decides not to press charges against Theresa. Amy accuses Lydia and Josh of having an affair. Josh tells her she is a lesbian and Amy hits her. Amy later apologises, however is still jealous of Lydia and Josh's relationship. At Josh's {{birthday}} party, Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) assumes that Lydia and Sarah are a couple. Sarah and Lydia then become friends. In late March, after agreeing to dance with Sarah during one of the classes, Lydia kisses her. Sarah denies it when Lydia claims <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> something. Sarah then shows more of an interest in Lydia.|$|E
60|$|He sat down, and two men, whose {{acquaintance}} he {{had made}} during his stay there, lounged across to him. Trade was slack in the province then, and both wore very threadbare jean. There was also a significant moodiness in their gaunt faces which suggested <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had <b>felt</b> the pinch of adversity.|$|R
60|$|But he rose, all the same, to {{meet her}} on the old level, and he began at once {{to talk to her}} of the subject he had been {{discussing}} with her aunt. He said frankly <b>that</b> <b>they</b> both <b>felt</b> she had unjustifiably turned her back upon possibilities which she ought not to neglect.|$|R
60|$|To this Andrea made {{an answer}} {{suitable}} to his greater information, and the discourse took its usual direction toward {{the means of}} doing something to relieve the two functionaries from the stigma <b>that</b> <b>they</b> mutually <b>felt</b> now rested on their sagacity, and that, too, as this sagacity might be considered conjointly or individually.|$|R
5|$|Now {{settled into}} Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers {{began looking for}} a {{suitable}} producer. One person in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded in contrast to individuals they had worked with in the past even though Rubin previously turned down the band's offer to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak who would die of a heroin overdose a year later. Eventually, the band decided Rubin {{would be the best}} choice as a producer, and therefore hired him to produce what would become Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> confident to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> it would be too boring for a player to have to sit and stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E
5|$|Because And Yet It Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E
25|$|The {{case had}} a strong impact on the neighbourhood, {{the city and the}} entire nation. Teenagers {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> no longer <b>felt</b> safe in their communities. Polls showed that over half the country's parents were more afraid for their children than before. In addition, an increased number of women said <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> unsafe being outside after dark.|$|R
50|$|Manwaring said <b>that,</b> after <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> more secure, “I went to New York {{and took}} a {{graduate}} course at Columbia University and had a very pleasant and profitable summer.” The next few years were perhaps the best of Manwaring’s tenure, with old structures being renovated and new ones added. In 1941, a year before his sixty-fifth birthday, Hyrum suggested to school authorities <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should all prepare for his retirement from the presidency on <b>that</b> birthday. <b>They</b> agreed but, of course, events intervened.|$|R
2500|$|They {{shared a}} concern about recent {{developments}} in children's literature and society's attitudes towards children. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> older children's literature had been moving closer to adult literature, and that the book had taken them [...] "further than [...] ever been taken before" [...] towards <b>that</b> end. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> it necessary to address [...] "meaningful violence" [...] and [...] "the strongest of human passions" [...] in the novel, because these were [...] "the preoccupations with which our children are, we know, at the moment filled." ...|$|R
