2500|$|It is New Year's Eve in {{the year}} 2000. In the dead of night, a drunken man, Jacob Narracott, sees a strange {{procession}} making its way down the hill from the church.

2500|$|Archbishop John R. Roach, {{president}} of the US Catholic bishops, called Sands's death [...] "a useless sacrifice". The Ledger of 5 May 1981 under the headline [...] "To some he was a hero, to others a terrorist" [...] claims that the hunger strike made Sands [...] "a hero among Irish Republicans or Nationalists seeking the reunion of Protestant-dominated and British-ruled Northern Ireland with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic to the south". The Ledger cited Sands as telling his friends: [...] "If I die, God will understand" [...] {{and one of his}} last messages was [...] "Tell everyone I'll see <b>them</b> <b>somewhere,</b> sometime".|$|E

[...] Note: Ida Tarbell in her extensive study of lynchings had already established that few lynchings were of black men who attacked white women; many more were committed to defeat an economic competitor or suppress a man behaving too independently.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To Where You Came From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series Anderson says that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If you come here illegally, I don't care about your story, first thing you do is you turn around and go back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give <b>them</b> <b>somewhere</b> safe to be. But I don't want them to come to Australia in boats." ...|$|E

60|$|For a time, however, nothing happened, {{although}} {{we could hear}} <b>them</b> talking <b>somewhere</b> near the cattle kraal, about {{a hundred and fifty}} yards away.

2500|$|The short-form {{names of}} {{clinical}} trials and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, {{as well as}} many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as names within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of mnemonic reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in medicine include the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) and the CHARM trial (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity). The fact that RAS syndrome is often involved, as well as that the letters often don't entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the achetypal form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some moral impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the [...] of clinical trial acronyms, as with gene and protein symbols, is simply to have a syntactically usable and recallable short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not memorized. It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of [...] "cutesy" [...] examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short name's chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a name, rather than being a [...] and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been (1) that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document, [...] and (2) that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as 3 different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain <b>them</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication. At least one study has evaluated the citation impact and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others, finding both good aspects (mnemonic help, name recall) and potential flaws (connotatively driven bias).|$|E

But the papers went on talking, and so he allowed that maybe if he didn't go he mightn't ever have another chance to see a balloon; and next, he found out that Nat Parsons was going down to see it, and that decided him, of course. He wasn't going to have Nat Parsons coming back bragging about seeing the balloon, and him having to listen to it and keep quiet. So he wanted me and Jim to go too, and we went.|$|R
