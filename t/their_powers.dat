After absorbing all <b>their</b> <b>powers,</b> she and Mikhail are transported to another world and Mikhail destroys the monster Zero transforms into. With this, the flower's magic is sealed away, although Accord speculates that Zero might have survived and would reappear in some form.

5|$|Aronofsky was set {{to direct}} an HBO series pilot called Hobgoblin.

He {{was set to}} work on the project with Pulitzer Prize winning author Michael Chabon and his wife Ayelet Waldman. In June 2013, it was announced that HBO had dropped the show and Aronofsky had pulled out, as well.|$|E
5|$|Artists and {{craftsman}} operated as corporations (guilds) {{rather than}} as individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage {{of all the people}} of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E
5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near complete control over the government. Despite the vast reach of <b>their</b> <b>powers,</b> however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} the populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the sans-culottes, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E

5|$|During dinner, {{the family}} is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an {{argument}} about {{what they should be}} doing with them. Aliens Kang and Kodos see {{this as an opportunity to}} strike Earth, and an alien invasion unfolds. Realizing none of <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit Professor Frink. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the Game Engine where all video games are made. After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them The Simpsons Games player's guide to teach them how to better use <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid Captain McCallister in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they rescue Cletus from the aliens.|$|E

Dash and Violet are spotted and chased {{by a number of}} Syndrome's guards, but fend them off with <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> before reuniting with their parents; however, Syndrome captures them, leaving them imprisoned on Nomanisan while he follows the rocket to Metroville.|$|E
5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of distinctions between magic users: clerics, who draw <b>their</b> <b>power</b> from {{elemental}} sources and frequently come into conflict with one another; druids, who draw <b>their</b> <b>power</b> from nature (or what's left of it) and are often the most vocal and violent opponents of defilers; defilers, who draw <b>their</b> <b>power</b> from sacrificing the lifeforce inherent in all things to fuel their spells, including their own at times; preservers, more commonly referred to as mages or wizards, who draw <b>their</b> <b>power</b> from the lifeforce of plants {{in the same way as}} defilers, but do not draw enough energy to kill the plants; and psionicists, who draw <b>their</b> <b>power</b> from <b>their</b> own minds, and technically are not mages, as magic and psionics are two completely different forces. Psionicists are often considered the most 'pure' as <b>their</b> <b>power</b> doesn't come from external sources, though power-hungry psionicists frequently become defilers. Sorcery is almost unheard of, though it has been noted in dragon-descended individuals and those that would transform themselves into dragons.|$|R

5|$|In series 2, {{the format}} {{consists}} of six rounds with eight contestants. This time, {{they do not}} have to choose their colour prior to the start of a round and can hold their nerve. In each of the first three rounds, the eight contestants watch a series of stunts, sporting challenges or performances. They'll then use their judgement to predict the outcome or have <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> of observation tested. Either way, the contestants must strike their buzzer and pick either red or black.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, the eight have grown {{accustomed}} to their connection and help each other on a daily basis. They learn more about Homo sensorium (the scientific name of sensates), the history and goals of BPO, the role of Angelica in it, <b>their</b> <b>powers,</b> and how to temporarily suspend them. They also meet other sensates, not {{all of whom are}} friendly. At the same time, Jonas attempts to both aid them and look after himself after being captured by Whispers, who is now involved in a cat-and-mouse game with Will, each of them trying to outsmart the other.|$|E
5|$|The Incredibles is a 2004 American computer-animated superhero film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Brad Bird, produced by Pixar Animation Studios, and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

Mr. Incredible's desire to help people draws the entire family into a battle with Syndrome, a former fan who now plots to wipe out all superheroes with his killer robot.|$|E
50|$|LDCs {{normally}} buy <b>their</b> <b>power</b> from larger companies, sometimes ones dedicated {{solely to}} wholesale supply. They re-sell {{it to the}} smaller customer. Larger customers typically buy <b>their</b> <b>power</b> directly from the wholesaler, and do not use the LDC.|$|R

5|$|The Powerpuff Girls is an American superhero {{animated}} {{television series}} created by animator Craig McCracken for Cartoon Network. The show centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three girls with superpowers, {{as well as}} their father, the brainy scientist Professor Utonium, who all live in the city of Townsville. The girls are frequently called upon by the town's childlike and naive mayor to help fight nearby criminals using <b>their</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The novel—Grossman's first—was written {{during his}} tenure as a video game designer. The book uses characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} associated with comic books and superhero fiction, but is written entirely in prose. The story explores how superheroes cope with <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> and interact with one another. The potential motivations and perspectives of supervillains are also examined. Grossman's book has been variously described as clever, engaging, and fun—but overstuffed with comic book tropes. An audiobook was released along with the hardcover edition, while a movie has been in development since 2008.|$|E
5|$|After {{penetrating}} Ganon, {{the four}} Links firmly seal him inside the Four Sword, bringing chaos and horror to an end. Peace returns to Hyrule, {{the souls of}} the knights are freed from their torment, and the people celebrate as all traces of evil that plagued Hyrule are vanquished. With Ganon defeated and sealed inside, Link returns the Four Sword that sealed darkness away back to its resting pedestal and the four Links become one again. After the battle, The Maidens of the Shrine use <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> and create a barrier, which is strong enough for the Four Sword to rest before the six maidens leave. Thus, Link's journey has ended and both he and Zelda leave the Sanctuary as Darkness fades away and Light endures in the Land of Hyrule, bringing peace and prosperity.|$|E

However, both officers are killed when the Mysterons use <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> over matter to engineer the crash of their Spectrum Patrol Car (SPC). From Scarlet and Brown's corpses, the Mysterons create two reconstructions, which are capable of perfectly imitating their biological templates and whose only programmed purpose is to execute the threat against the President. As a first assassination attempt, Brown's duplicate physically explodes after arriving with the President at the Maximum Security Building; although the tower is completely destroyed, the President escapes with his life by activating an emergency door seconds before the detonation.|$|E
5|$|During the Bahraini {{uprising}} of 2011, the Khawalid brothers {{objected to}} {{compromise with the}} opposition and instead preferred crackdown. After a failed round of negotiations led by the CP, the Khawalid brothers led the crackdown, described as the widest in Bahrain's modern history. The Commander in Chief of the army, Khalifa bin Ahmed, was given wide authority with the announcement of martial law; he led a main crackdown operation, presided over military courts and made several interviews with regional and local media. Another Al Khawalid involved in the crackdown was the then-director of the National Security Agency, which {{was found to be}} responsible for arbitrary arrests and systematic torture. The crackdown empowered the Khawalid brothers faction further and marginalized the CP, who found himself and allies stripped from <b>their</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|E
5|$|From its foundation, the Court of Chancery could {{administer}} estates, {{due to its}} {{jurisdiction over}} trusts. While the main burden in the 16th century fell on the ecclesiastical courts, <b>their</b> <b>powers</b> over administrators and executors was limited, regularly necessitating the Court of Chancery's involvement. Before the Statute of Wills, many people used feoffees to dispose of their land, something that fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Lord Chancellor anyway. In addition, in relation to the discovery and accounting of assets, the process used by the Court of Chancery was far superior to the ecclesiastical one; as a result, the Court of Chancery was regularly used by beneficiaries. The common law courts also had jurisdiction over some estates matters, but their remedies for problems were far more limited.|$|E
