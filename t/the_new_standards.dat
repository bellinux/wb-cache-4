5|$|Due to the {{failures}} of the ratings agencies, European regulators obtained new powers to supervise ratings agencies. With the creation of the European Supervisory Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which became the EU's single credit-ratings firm regulator. Credit-ratings companies have to comply with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> or will be denied operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the opening of}} the American branch, various trade arrangements were made with other film companies, including American Mutoscope and Biograph, the Warwick Trading Company, the Charles Urban Trading Co., Robert W. Paul's studio, and Gaumont. In these negotiations, a print sale price of 0.15 per foot was standardized across the American market, which proved useful to Méliès. However, later price standardizations by the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 hastened Méliès's financial ruin, as his films were impractically expensive under <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards.</b> In addition, in the years following 1908 his films suffered from the fashions of the time, as the fanciful magic films he made were no longer in vogue.|$|E
5|$|By 301, {{however, the}} system was in trouble, {{strained}} by a new bout of inflation. Diocletian therefore issued his Edict on Coinage, an act re-tariffing all debts so that the nummus, the most common coin in circulation, would be worth half as much. In the edict, preserved in an inscription {{from the city of}} Aphrodisias in Caria (near Geyre, Turkey), it was declared that all debts contracted before 1 September 301 must be repaid at the old standards, while all debts contracted after that date would be repaid at <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards.</b> It appears that the edict was made in an attempt to preserve the current price of gold and to keep the Empire's coinage on silver, Rome's traditional metal currency. This edict risked giving further momentum to inflationary trends, as had happened after Aurelian's currency reforms. The government's response was to issue a price freeze.|$|E

50|$|The {{water quality}} in the Mahomet Aquifer is high in {{dissolved}} minerals and iron, which is typical of all groundwater. Neither of these pose a human health risk. One contaminant that is of concern is naturally occurring arsenic. The arsenic leaches from oxidized pyrite. Concentrations can range from 20 to 70 parts per billion (ppb), which exceeds <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> adopted by <b>the</b> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Panno and Korab, 2000). <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> is 10 ppb.

25|$|In November 2013, three safety {{regulation}} groups, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety and the National Tripartite Action Plan, agreed {{to look into}} adopting a new unified set of workplace safety standards for clothing manufacturing factories. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> would call for increased training of factory inspectors. The inspections would {{be carried out by}} two different inspectors with their experience in the field each being a minimum of five years and combining for a minimum total of 20 years. They would also regulate the spacing of exits making sure that there are ways to escape the building from multiple sides and the amount of machinery on each floor will have a cap allowing easy access to each exit.|$|E
25|$|Measurement of {{protection}} factors of negative pressure full face masks with high-efficiency filters {{in the laboratory}} revealed a risk of decrease in protective properties to a small values. Therefore, {{the use of such}} respirators has been limited to the values 50 or 100 PEL in the United States. However, the experts in the UK believed that the quality of their masks is higher than American masks, and were allowed to use up to 900 OEL. But the study showed that the value of the protection factor of > 900 has been achieved in practice infrequently. Minimum protection factors of 3 different models of full facepiece respirators were 11, 18 and 26. So, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> limit usage of these respirators up to 40 OEL in UK (after this study).|$|E

This {{was the first time that}} the Japanese government had tried to regulate the lifespan of nuclear power plants. When safety and maintenance of the plant meet regulatory guidelines, the operator could request for an extension. Safety standards against earthquakes, tsunamis and other disasters would be revised with the new knowledge and technology in protective measures.

25|$|Parliament {{approved}} {{double track}} from Oslo to Ljan in 1916. Construction took its time and opened in two stages, from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924 and from Oslo Ø to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929. South of Ljan the line crossed the Ljan Viaduct, {{which could not}} be upgraded to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards.</b> A new double-tracked line had to be built around, which opened on 15 February 1925. By the 1930s the railway was meeting increased competition from buses and trucks. Although slower, they offered more pick-up locations than the train. NSB therefore decided that the Østfold Line, and especially the section closest to Oslo, needed to receive increased capacity, electric traction and more stations. Double tracking continued southwards, opening to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and to Ski on 14 May 1939. Meanwhile, NSB introduced gasoline railcars which stopped at the new flag stops.|$|E
25|$|The even stricter {{emissions}} standards {{which were}} to be introduced in 1975 {{as part of a}} staggered program of cleaning the air proved problematic for kei car manufacturers. This was particularly hard for Daihatsu and Suzuki, which focused on two-stroke engines. Tiny Suzuki was worse off, with the company's entire production consisting of two-stroke kei cars. Daihatsu, though, had both the engineering backing and powerful connections of their large owner, Toyota, to aid them in meeting the new requirements. All manufacturers of kei cars were clamoring for relaxing the dimension conditions, claiming that the emissions standards could not be met with a functional 360-cc engine (though Subaru's SEEC-T-equipped Rex proved it possible). In the end, the Japanese legislature relented, increasing the overall length and width restrictions by 200mm and 100mm, respectively. Engine size was increased to 550cc, taking effect from January 1, 1976. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> were announced on 26 August 1975, leaving very little time for manufacturers to update their offerings.|$|E

25|$|The {{large number}} of public school {{buildings}} in the Los Angeles area displayed mixed responses to the shaking, and those that were built after {{the enforcement of the}} Field Act clearly showed the results of the reformed construction styles. The Field Act was put into effect just one month following the destructive March 1933 Long Beach earthquake that damaged many public school buildings in Long Beach, Compton, and Whittier. The Los Angeles Unified School District had 660 schools consisting of 9,200 buildings {{at the time of the}} earthquake, with 110 masonry buildings that had not been reinforced to meet <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards.</b> More than 400 portable classrooms and 53 wood frame pre-Field Act buildings were also in use. All these buildings had been previously inspected with regard to the requirements of the Act, and many were reinforced or rebuilt at that time, but earthquake engineering experts recommended further immediate refurbishment or demolition after a separate evaluation was done after the February 1971 earthquake, and within a year and a half the district followed through with the direction with regard to about 100 structures.|$|E
25|$|By the 1952 season, the {{university}} decided to de-emphasize sports.

As a result, 15 returning players could not meet <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> and lost their scholarships. But Unitas maintained his scholarship by taking on a new elective: square dancing. In 1952 Coach Camp switched the team to two-way football. Unitas not only played safety or linebacker on defense and quarterback on offense but returned kicks and punts on special teams. The Cards won their first game against Wayne State, and then Florida State in the second game. Unitas completed 16 of 21 passes for 198 yards and three touchdowns. It was said that Unitas put on such a show at the Florida State game that he threw a pass under his legs for 15 yards. The {{rest of the season}} was a struggle for the Cards, who finished 3–5. Unitas completed 106 of 198 passes for 1,540 yards and 12 touchdowns in his sophomore year.|$|E
