40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> is a a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It {{is widely}} available around the world, with indications for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, periarticular disorders, and strains and sprains. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies of patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over 6 hours using standard methods. This type of study {{has been used for}} many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of single dose oral <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> in acute postoperative pain, and any associated adverse events. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to June 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We planned to use area under the "pain relief versus time" curve to derive the proportion of participants with <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> experiencing at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, using validated equations; to use number needed to treat to benefit (NNT); the proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period; time to use of rescue analgesia; information on adverse events and withdrawals. MAIN RESULTS: Not one of eleven studies identified by the searches and examined in detail studied oral <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> against placebo in patients with established postoperative pain and therefore no results are available. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of evidence of efficacy for oral <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> in acute postoperative pain, its use in this indication is not justified at present. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies is lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully.

The drug was given subcutaneously every 24 hours during the entire immobilisation period. Immobilised animals not treated with drugs and normal animals were used as controls. In the non-drug treated immobilised animals articular cartilage showed evidence of surface damage accompanied by synovial hypertrophy and effusion. Proteoglycan concentrations were reduced in cartilages of these joints and the incorporation of 35 SO 2 - 4 into macromolecular proteoglycans was higher than in cartilages of non-immobilised controls. Gel filtration chromatographic studies of both resident and 35 S labelled proteoglycans isolated from immobilised joint cartilage showed reduced aggregation and the presence of degraded proteoglycan subunit species.

40|$|AbstractBackground:The {{relationship}} between oxidative stress and osteoarthritis (OA) {{has been widely}} investigated. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels are useful markers of oxidative stress. Because {{of the importance of}} oxidative stress markers in the pathogenesis of OA, treatment might involve modification of these markers to control oxidative stress. Objective:The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effects of 2 conventionalNSAIDs on markers of oxidative stress in patients with OA of the knee. Methods:This 3 -week, prospective, randomized, open-label, active- and placebo-controlled study was conducted at the Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey. Adult patients with clinically and radiographically diagnosed moderate OA of the knee who were previously untreated were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: flurbiprofen 100 mg PO (tablets) BID, <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> 300 mg PO (tablets) BID, or placebo tablets BID. Patients were evaluated using clinical assessment and laboratory testing before treatment (week 0; baseline) and at the end of week 3. The primary end points were the differences in serum MDA, NO, and SOD levels versus placebo. Clinical parameters-pain at rest and on motion-were evaluated using a 10 -cm visual analog scale (0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable). The duration (in minutes) of morning stiffness was recorded by patients, using patient diaries. The differences between treatment groups were assessed using multivariate analysis. Results:Thirty-nine patients (20 women, 19 men; mean [SD] age, 59. 0 [11. 3]years) were included in the study. Mean serum MDA and NO levels were significantly decreased at 3 weeks compared with baseline in the 2 active-treatment groups (all, P < 0. 001); these values remained statistically similar to baseline in the placebo group. Serum SOD levels were increased significantly from baseline in the 2 active-treatment groups (both, P < 0. 001), but not in the placebo group. No significant differences in serum MDA and NO levels were found between the group receiving flurbiprofen and that receiving <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid.</b> Serum SOD levels were significantly higher in the flurbiprofen group compared with the <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> and placebo groups (both, P < 0. 01). The mean (SD) score for pain at rest was significantly lower at 3 weeks compared with baseline with flurbiprofen and <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> (both, P < 0. 001), but not with placebo. The mean score for pain on motion was significantly reduced from baseline values only with <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> (P < 0. 001). The duration of morning stiffness was significantly shorter at 3 weeks compared with baseline in all 3 study groups (all, P < 0. 001). The mean scores for pain on motion and duration of morning stiffness were significantly reduced with <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> compared with placebo (both, P < 0. 05). The study had some limitations (ie, small sample size, no blinding, the short duration of the study, and the weak correlation between serum and synovial fluid levels of NO). Conclusions:In this comparison of the effects of 3 weeks of treatment withflurbiprofen 100 mg BID and <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> 300 mg BID in patients with knee OA, both treatments effectively reduced serum MDA and NO levels compared with placebo.

40|$|SUMMARY. <b>Tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug {{which also}} has hypouriceamic effect. Studies involving 10 healthy volunteers were designed to investigate the mode of this effect. We postulate that the site of action of <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> is at the cell membrane, the mechanism being an interference with the transport of uric acid from intra- to extra-cellular fluid thus limiting its passage into the plasma. The same mechanism acting on renal tubular cells impedes reabsorption thereby increasing uric acid clearance. The main pathogenic mechanism of gout in-volves the deposition of urate crystals in the tissues. These crystals originate from supersatu-rated urate solutions in the body fluids.

In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were presented to help interpret the experimental results. Resonance Raman and DFT calculation results revealed that the deprotonated <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> (TPA–) form was the primary species that is photoexcited in a near neutral PBS aqueous solution. The fs-TA experimental data indicated that the lowest lying excited singlet state S 1 underwent an efficient intersystem crossing process (ISC) to quickly transform into the lowest lying excited triplet state T 1 that then undergoes decarboxylation to generate a triplet biradical species (TB 3). ns-TA and ns-TR 3 results observed a protonation process for TB 3 to produce a neutral species (TBP 3) that then decayed via ISC to produce a singlet TBP species that further reacted to make the final product (DTPA). A comparison of the present results for TPA– with similar results for the deprotonated form of ketoprofen (KP–) in the literature was done to investigate how the thiophene moiety in TPA– that replaces one phenyl ring in KP– affects the reaction mechanism and photochemistry of these nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ...|$|E

40|$|Patients {{diagnosed}} with diabetes are prescribed {{a large number}} of medications for appropriate therapy, increasing risk of side effects or drug interactions. Metformin, a guanidine derivative is commonly used as a drug of choice for the treatment of non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. There are a number of interactions reported for metformin. On the other hand, NSAIDs are generally used for the treatment of pain, fever and inflammation, particularly arthritis. Since the former drug is used in long term therapy, it may be co-administered with other drugs. In the present paper, we investigated the in-vitro availability of metformin in presence of commonly used NSAIDs, like diclofenic sodium, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, meloxicam and <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid.</b> These studies were carried out using modified BP 2007 dissolution test apparatus in simulated body environments at 37 °C. These drug interactions were analyzed by UV/ VIS spectroscopy and the effect on the availability of both metformin and NSAIDs in presence of each other was calculated by applying simultaneous equation which was derived by modifying Beers law. The interactions were further studied by RP-HPLC with mobile phase consisting of methanol and water (80 : 20 v/v) maintained at a flow rate of 1 mLmin- 1 at isobestic point 241 nm (metformin, diclofenac sodium, flurbiprofen, <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid,</b> ibuprofen, meloxicam and mefenamic acid) respectively The results showed that the in vitro availability of NSAIDs and metformin owing to interaction was depressed through the formation of charge transfer complexes which was found to be associated with inter- and intra-molecular rearrangement of the electronic cloud of the interacting drugs.

As a result, micturition pain showed 86 % improvement on the 1 st day after starting administration, and it is thought that the concurrent use of this product with an antibiotic can probably remove the patients' complaints quickly and prevent the meaningless administration of antibiotics due to the persistence of symptoms and, subsequently, there is the possibility of shortening the period of administration...|$|E
40|$|An ovine {{model of}} early {{osteoarthritis}} was induced in 12 adult merino sheep by subjecting them to medial meniscectomy. Twelve weeks after surgery, {{the animals were}} randomly {{divided into two groups}} of 6 each. Group A received 20 mg/kg/day of sustained-release <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> (TA); group B received no drug. After 12 weeks of therapy all animals were sacrificed, and joints were opened under sterile conditions. Full-depth cartilage plugs were removed from the medial and lateral femoral condyles, patella, and trochlear groove. The tibial plateaux cartilage was sampled from the same areas; however, cartilage normally protected from the meniscus was examined separately from unprotected cartilage. Cartilage plugs were maintained in culture in Hams F 12 media and 10 % fetal calf serum for 72 hours. During the last 48 hours of culture, (SO 42 -) -S- 35 was incorporated into cartilage proteoglycans (PGs). Incorporation of (SO 42 -) -S- 35 into PGs was generally higher in animals receiving TA. However, this finding was only statistically significant for the patella and tibial cartilages normally protected by the menisci...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—NSAIDs {{are widely}} used to {{alleviate}} the symptoms of OA. It remains controversial as to what effects these agents have on the progression of OA. In vitro studies showed several types of NSAIDs (e. g., sodium salicylate, indomethacin) inhibited the synthesis of cartilage matrix component, but some types of NSAIDs (e. g., aceclofenac, meloxicam, nimesulide) increased the matrix component synthesis and protected the chondrocytes against apoptosis, while others (e. g., piroxicam) had no effects. Studies in animal models verified that NSAIDs had favourable or detrimental action on OA progression, even the same NSAID (e. g., naproxen, <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid)</b> had reverse effects on articular cartilage in different studies. Preliminary clinical trials revealed some NSAIDs such as indomethacin had a negative influence on joint structure, other NSAIDs such as diclofenac and naproxen had no acceleration of radiographic damage to OA within 2 -years of treatment. So far, there are no convincing data to show the widely used NSAIDs and recommended selective COX- 2 inhibitor have favourable effects on cartilage. Therefore, it is necessary and valuable to clarify {{the effects of these}} NSAIDs on cartilage in patients with OA using validated non-invasive methods such as MRI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Certain {{drugs are}} known to elicit {{photosensitivity}} side effects. A satisfactory under-standing of the involved mechanistic aspects is necessary to anticipate the photosensitizing potential. We have used <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> (TPA), a photosensitizing nonsteroidal antiinflam-matory drug, to illustrate the methodology followed to address this problem. After studying the photophysical and photochemical properties of TPA, the attention has been directed towards the reactivity of its lowest lying π−π * triplet with biomolecules. Photosensitized lipid peroxidation occurs by a mixed type I (radicals) and type II (singlet oxygen) mecha-nism. In the case of proteins, the photosensitized reactions include Tyr, Trp, and His pho-todegradation, protein–protein photocrosslinking and drug–protein photobinding. This involves direct quenching of the drug triplet by the amino acid residues (Tyr and Trp) or by oxygen, followed by singlet oxygen oxidation (His and Trp). With DNA, the studies have included comet assay, induction of single-strand breaks in supercoiled DNA, and reaction with 2 '-deoxyguanosine and thymidine. Product studies, together with time-resolved meas-urements, {{have shown that the}} fastest reaction occurs with purine bases, by a mechanism involving both radical and singlet oxygen processes. The employed methodology can be o...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} for separating free 35 SO 4 [...] from 35 SO 4 labelled proteoglycans synthesised by rabbit articular chondrocytes cultured {{in the presence}} of excess 35 SO 4 [...] . The procedure uses the low solubility product of barium sulphate to remove, by precipitation, free 35 SO 4 [...] from culture medium. Optimum recovery of 35 SO 4 labelled proteoglycans was achieved after papain digestion to release 35 SO 4 -glycosaminoglycans, and addition of chondroitin sulphate before the precipitation step. Using this assay, we studied the effect of six drugs-indomethacin, diclofenac, sodium pentosan polysulphate, glycosaminoglycan polysulphate ester, <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid,</b> and ketoprofen-on the secretion into the medium of labelled proteoglycans by lapine chondrocytes. The six drugs were tested at 0. 1, 1, 10, 50, and 100 micrograms/ml over four consecutive 48 hour culture periods. A consistent concentration-response pattern was found for the four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) studied. Generally they inhibited proteoglycan secretion at 50 and 100 micrograms/ml but had no effect at lower concentrations. Inhibition of secretion was strongest with indomethacin and diclofenac at 50 and 100 micrograms/ml. In contrast with the NSAIDs studied, the two sulphated polysaccharides (sodium pentosan polysulphate and glycosaminoglycan polysulphate ester) at low concentrations increased proteoglycan secretion by chondrocytes, with maximal stimulation occurring at 1 microgram/ml. Sodium pentosan polysulphate, but not glycosaminoglycan polysulphate ester, showed inhibitory activity at 50 and 100 micrograms/ml...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionCervicofacial {{cellulitis}} (CFC) is {{a severe}} {{infection of the}} subcutaneous cellular tissue, {{and is one of}} the most serious head and neck infectious emergencies. In a series of 70 cases treated between 2007 and 2012, we noticed a strong correlation between use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and evolution of head and neck infections toward CFC, including two cases of necrotic CFC extending to the mediastinum, which were fatal. Material and methodsThe cases included in the series comprised patients admitted to emergency and requiring hospitalization due to the severity of presenting symptoms. There were 70 such cases of CFC between 2007 and 2012; cases managed on an outpatient basis were excluded, as were cases of orbital CFC, CFC of sinus origin and mastoiditis. ResultsEighty percent of patients took NSAIDs, on self-medication or by prescription (community physician, dentist, pharmacist). The most frequent molecules were <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid</b> and diclofenac. CFC extension was restricted in most cases to the maxillary and/or ipsilateral subhyoid region, with 5 cases of lower cervical extension and 2 of mediastinal involvement, which both proved fatal. ConclusionCFC is a severe infection that can be life-threatening, and represents a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency. Among other risk factors, use of NSAIDs is frequently reported; these should therefore be used with caution if at all in head and neck infection, especially of odonto-stomatological origin...|$|E
40|$|Rats were {{sensitized}} with azobenzene arsonate-conjugated acetyl {{bovine serum}} albumin. An allergic inflammation was induced in the preformed air pouch in the dorsum of the sensitized rats by injecting the antigen dissolved in a 2 % {{sodium carboxymethyl cellulose}} solution into the air pouch. Time course changes of vascular permeability, accumulated pouch fluid volume and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels in the pouch fluid were compared in sensitized and non-sensitized rats to characterize the allergic inflammatory reaction. Effects of three cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin, diclofenac sodium and <b>tiaprofenic</b> <b>acid)</b> on vascular permeability and accumulated pouch fluid volume 4 and 24 h after the immunological challenge injection were examined to elucidate a possible role of PGE 2 in the inflammatory response. Four h after initiating the allergic reaction, although the level of PGE 2 in the pouch fluid reached a high level, the vascular permeability response, measured over the period 3. 5 - 4 h, was not suppressed by treatment with the three cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and neither was the pouch fluid volume measured over the period 0 - 4 h. However, vascular permeability and accumulated pouch fluid volume at 24 h were suppressed by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. These observations suggest that in this model, endogenous PGE 2 does not affect oedema formation measured at 4 h. However, oedema formation measured at 24 h may be dependent on PGE 2 generation...|$|E
