5|$|Narayan's writing {{style was}} often {{compared}} to that of William Faulkner since both their works brought out the humour and energy of ordinary life while displaying compassionate humanism. The similarities also extended to their juxtaposing of the demands of society against the confusions of individuality. Although <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> subjects was similar, their methods were different; Faulkner was rhetorical and illustrated his points with immense prose while Narayan was very simple and realistic, capturing the elements all the same.|$|E

5|$|Both Guitar Hero and Rock Band, {{a similar}} series of games {{developed}} by Harmonix (who originally developed Guitar Hero), {{have altered the}} video game and music industries. For video games, the introduction of Guitar Hero has led rhythm games {{to become one of}} the industries' largest growing markets. The series has also sparked the creation of both commercial and independently developed games with similar gameplay mechanics as well as learning tools using a real guitar in place of the controller. Older artists featured in Guitar Hero and Rock Band have experienced a surge in the popularity of their music, and the games have been seen as a way for younger audiences to experience the classic rock songs featured in the games. Newer bands and unsigned artists have also found success by being included in the game. This has led several bands to actively seek placement of their songs within the games. The impact of Guitar Hero on the music industry has caused music publishers to re-evaluate <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> music licensing and their relationship with the video game industry.|$|E
5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why {{there appeared to be}} so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this. They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{played only}} a limited, supporting role during the 1st Division's repulse of the German counter-attack at Lagnicourt in mid-April, and following this the battalion's next major action came in early May {{when it was}} involved in the Second Battle of Bullecourt. The day before the attack, the battalions of the 1st Brigade, despite being due for rest, had been attached to the 2nd Division, and they were subsequently employed to provide work parties to release reserves among the 2nd Division units to take part directly in the fighting. Having not yet recovered its losses from the fighting around Hermies, and being subjected to artillery bombardment during <b>their</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the front, the 2nd Battalion entered the line on 4 May with just 16 officers and 446 other ranks, subsequently relieving the 24th Battalion. As the Germans attempted to force the Australians back, the 2nd Battalion was moved around a number of times to shore up the line, until units of the 5th Division came up to relieve those of the 1st Brigade on 8 May.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{study is}} to assess undergraduates’ {{characteristics}} of learning and <b>their</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning and studying, which provide a valuable estimation of their improvement percentages in their academic performance at the university. One hundred and sixty undergraduates from a particular degree programme {{in this study were}} selected {{based on the results of}} their academic performances for the past several semesters. The undergraduates’ individual results were then converted into percentages of improvement. A survey method using questionnaires was employed. The questionnaire focussed on the undergraduates’ characteristics as learners and approaches which they used to learning and studying while undergoing the programme of study. The results of the questionnaires were analysed according to categories, such as the individual's characteristics as learners and <b>their</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning. A correlation matrix was used in order to study how these characteristics of the learners and <b>their</b> <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> learning affect the undergraduates’ academic performance improvement (in percentages). Measurement of variance inflation factors (VIF) was also carried out to examine any significant multicollinearity between the independent variables. Based on the statistical value established, a model of estimating undergraduates’ academic performance improvement was formulated using multiple regression analysis. With this research, we found that we are able to estimate the individual undergraduates’ academic improvement percentage that reflects the characteristics of learners and <b>their</b> specific <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> studies...|$|R
