Thermal conductivity of the HPT-processed samples were measured using picosecond time domain thermoreflectance.

50|$|Today, most potters are {{familiar}} with tenmoku glaze in a reduction firing. But to get oil spot effects, stiff tenmokus need to be fired in oxidation. This relies on a very simple chemical principle that, once understood, leads to successful firings. Red iron oxide (Fe2O3) acts as a refractory in oxidation but it can easily be changed to a flux {{in the form of}} black iron oxide (FeO), in reduction. Most potters {{are familiar}} with this property but for oil spots, we are interested in iron’s ability to self-reduce. At approximately cone 7 (2250 °F or 1232 °C), ferric iron (Fe2O3) cannot maintain its trigonal crystalline structure and rearranges to a cubic structure, magnetite (Fe3O4), which further reduces to become ferrous (FeO). This is called <b>thermal</b> <b>reduction,</b> and what this means in layman’s terms is that, when it is sufficiently heated, the red iron oxide used in the glaze recipe will naturally let go of an oxygen atom. As the liberated oxygen bubbles rise {{to the surface of the}} glaze, they drag a bit of the magnetite with them and deposit it on the surface. A rough black spot is left on the glaze surface that is a different color than the surrounding glaze, due to the larger concentration of iron oxide in that small area and its subsequent re-oxidization during cooling.|$|E

While thermal transport in silicon nanomeshes {{has been previously}} interpreted by phonon wave effects due to interference with periodic structures, as well as phonon particle effects including backscattering, the dominant mechanism responsible for <b>thermal</b> conductivity <b>reductions</b> below classical predictions still remains unclear. Here we isolate the wave-related coherence effects by comparing periodic and aperiodic nanomeshes, and quantify the backscattering effect by comparing variable-pitch nanomeshes. We measure identical (within 6 % uncertainty) thermal conductivities for periodic and aperiodic nanomeshes of the same average pitch, and reduced thermal conductivities for nanomeshes with smaller pitches. Ray tracing simulations support the measurement results. We conclude phonon coherence is unimportant for thermal transport in silicon nanomeshes with periodicities of 100 nm and higher and temperatures above 14 K, and phonon backscattering, as manifested in the classical size effect, {{is responsible for the}} <b>thermal</b> conductivity <b>reduction...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractGeomechanical {{stability}} {{issues may}} arise due to induced thermal stresses because CO 2 will generally reach the storage formation at a temperature {{lower than that}} of the reservoir. Cold injection will form a cold region around the injection well, which will induce <b>thermal</b> stress <b>reduction.</b> We simulate cold CO 2 injection in deep saline formations in a normal faulting stress regime and investigate under what conditions thermal stresses may jeopardize the caprock sealing capacity by studying the effect of the heterogeneity of the thermal expansion coefficient between the reservoir and caprock. Furthermore, we use an elastoplastic constitutive model to account for inelastic deformation related to fracture instability. We find that the temperature difference should be limited in the presence of very stiff reservoirs, because the <b>thermal</b> stress <b>reduction</b> is proportional to the product of the rock stiffness, the temperature difference and the thermal expansion coefficient. Simulation results show that inelastic strain occurs in the cooled region within the reservoir, but fracture instability does not propagate into the caprock in the considered normal faulting stress regime. However, the cooled region of the lower portion of the caprock may experience yielding if the thermal expansion coefficient of the caprock is larger than that of the reservoir, because the <b>thermal</b> stress <b>reduction</b> in the caprock becomes larger than in the reservoir, which increases the deviatoric stress. Nevertheless, irreversible strain caused by cooling within the caprock are limited to a small region of the lower portion of the caprock and thus, the overall sealing capacity of the caprock is not compromised, so CO 2 leakage is unlikely to occur because of cooling...|$|R
