40|$|A Virtual Organisation (VO) is a {{temporary}} alliance of autonomous, diverse, and geographically dispersed organisations, where the participants pool resources, information and knowledge {{in order to meet}} common objectives. This requires dynamic security policy management. We propose an authorisation policy management model called recognition of authority (ROA) which allows dynamically trusted authorities <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>authorisation</b> policies for VO resources. The model supports dynamic delegation of authority, and the expansion and contraction of organizations in a VO, so that the underlying authorisation system is able to use existing user credentials issued by participating organisations to evaluate the users access rights to VO resources...|$|E

30|$|We use a two-step {{procedure}} {{to reduce the}} occurrence of state inconsistency in state-based schedules. First, we use a method of clock synchronization <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> clock drifts. Thereafter, we use a method <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> sampling frequency drifts of the stations.|$|R
50|$|A phasor is {{a network}} of {{capacitors}} and variable inductors used <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> relative amplitude and phase of the current being distributed to each tower in a directional array. A typical phasor has separate controls <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> phase of the current going to each tower, adjustable power divider controls, and a common point impedance matching network <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> system input impedance to 50 ohms with no reactance without disturbing the phase or amplitude of the tower currents.|$|R

50|$|Further {{problems}} {{occurred with}} the approval of the ETCS system. So in the course of test and acceptance runs, software errors and <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> track configuration data have been observed. After the elimination of <b>the</b> errors, <b>authorisation</b> to use <b>the</b> ETCS system could be given on 10 September 2015.|$|R
5000|$|A shim is {{a device}} used <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> {{homogeneity}} of a magnetic field. Shims received their {{name from the}} purely mechanical shims used <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> position and parallelity of the pole faces of an electromagnet. Coils used <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> homogeneity of a magnetic field by changing the current flowing through it were called [...] "electrical current shims" [...] because of their similar function.|$|R
