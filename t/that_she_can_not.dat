Grimm also notes that the production is based on the premise that a prostitute is a prostitute by choice, does not want reform and infers <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be reformed. Grimm's review stated that the great production was even more detrimental with a metaphor that stated a well-dressed criminal was less likely to be suspected than a poorly dressed criminal.|$|E
500|$|Ayane {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a top-tier character {{in many of the}} games she is playable in, especially in the DOA fighting games where she was noted for being very unpredictable and confusing for the opponent as well as fast and hard to counter. Previewing the original Dead or Alive for the PlayStation, Computer & Video Games opined she [...] "has an unusual floaty kind of fighting style, but has some great moves. Her quick punches make stringing combos together easy, and her throws are great for hitting people into the Danger Zone" [...] (an interactive feature within some arenas). In Prima Games' official guide for Dead or Alive Ultimate (a remake version of Dead or Alive and Dead or Alive 2), Eric Mylonas declared Ayane the [...] "tougher of the two siblings" [...] as she [...] "brings strings of blindingly fast combos into play and has devastating holds and throws." [...] Mylonas wrote Ayane has a major weakness in <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> stop moving without becoming [...] "an easy prey," [...] and she may not be favored by those who prefer [...] "huge, over-the-top moves," [...] but for a [...] "more patient sort, there's probably no better character in the game." [...] According to GameSpy's guide to Ultimate by Andrew Alfonso, Ayane's key moves include her high kick—which is [...] "a lot" [...] better than Kasumi's—with another move so powerful [...] "it's almost unfair to use it." [...] He also noted how she can be actually more effective with her back turned towards her opponent, {{despite the fact that the}} characters cannot block when facing away from an enemy. In his guide to Dead or Alive 3, Alfonso wrote Ayane is a very unpredictable and quick attacker, even more than in the previous games in the series, and should be played primarily for her backwards position, hers being the best such stance of all the characters in the game. Ayane's speed and deceiving attacks make her a [...] "pretty good" [...] partner for slower fighters for tag team battles, but her primary partners are other ninja characters.|$|E

6000|$|I am {{now going}} to intrust you my dear Charlotte with a secret which has long {{disturbed}} the tranquility of my days, and which is of a kind to require the most inviolable Secrecy from you. Last Monday se'night Matilda and I accompanied Lady Lesley to a Rout at the Honourable Mrs Kickabout's; we were escorted by Mr Fitzgerald who is a very amiable young Man in the main, tho' perhaps a little singular in his Taste--He {{is in love with}} Matilda--. We had scarcely paid our Compliments to the Lady of the House and curtseyed to half a score different people when my Attention was attracted by the appearance of a Young Man the most lovely of his Sex, who at that moment entered the Room with another Gentleman and Lady. From the first moment I beheld him, I was certain that on him depended the future Happiness of my Life. Imagine my surprise when he was introduced to me by the name of Cleveland--I instantly recognised him as the Brother of Mrs Marlowe, and the acquaintance of my Charlotte at Bristol. Mr and Mrs M. were the gentleman and Lady who accompanied him. (You do not think Mrs Marlowe handsome?) The elegant address of Mr Cleveland, his polished Manners and Delightful Bow, at once confirmed my attachment. He did not speak; but I can imagine everything he would have said, had he opened his Mouth. I can picture to myself the cultivated Understanding, the Noble sentiments, and elegant Language which would have shone so conspicuous in the conversation of Mr Cleveland. The approach of Sir James Gower (one of my too numerous admirers) prevented the Discovery of any such Powers, by putting an end to a Conversation we had never commenced, and by attracting my attention to himself. But oh! how inferior are the accomplishments of Sir James to those of his so greatly envied Rival! Sir James {{is one of the most}} frequent of our Visitors, and is almost always of our Parties. We have since often met Mr and Mrs Marlowe but no Cleveland--he is always engaged some where else. Mrs Marlowe fatigues me to Death every time I see her by her tiresome Conversations about you and Eloisa. She is so stupid! I live in the hope of seeing her irrisistable Brother to night, as we are going to Lady Flambeaus, who is I know intimate with the Marlowes. Our party will be Lady Lesley, Matilda, Fitzgerald, Sir James Gower, and myself. We see little of Sir George, who is almost always at the gaming-table. Ah! my poor Fortune where art thou by this time? We see more of Lady L. who always makes her appearance (highly rouged) at Dinner-time. Alas! what Delightful Jewels will she be decked in this evening at Lady Flambeau's! Yet I wonder how she can herself delight in wearing them; surely she must be sensible of the ridiculous impropriety of loading her little diminutive figure with such superfluous ornaments; is it possible <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> know how greatly superior an elegant simplicity is to the most studied apparel? Would she but Present them to Matilda and me, how greatly should we be obliged to her, How becoming would Diamonds be on our fine majestic figures! And how surprising it is that such an Idea should never have occurred to HER. I am sure if I have reflected in this manner once, I have fifty times. Whenever I see Lady Lesley dressed in them such reflections immediately come across me. My own Mother's Jewels too! But I will say no more on so melancholy a subject--let me entertain you with something more pleasing--Matilda had a letter this morning from Lesley, by which we have the pleasure of finding that he is at Naples has turned Roman-Catholic, obtained one of the Pope's Bulls for annulling his 1st Marriage and has since actually married a Neapolitan Lady of great Rank and Fortune. He tells us moreover that much the same sort of affair has befallen his first wife the worthless Louisa who is likewise at Naples had turned Roman-catholic, and is soon to be married to a Neapolitan Nobleman of great and Distinguished merit. He says, that they are at present very good Freinds, have quite forgiven all past errors and intend in future to be very good Neighbours. He invites Matilda and me to pay him a visit to Italy and to bring him his little Louisa whom both her Mother, Step-mother, and himself are equally desirous of beholding. As to our accepting his invitation, it is at Present very uncertain; Lady Lesley advises us to go without loss of time; Fitzgerald offers to escort us there, but Matilda has some doubts of the Propriety of such a scheme--she owns it would be very agreable. I am certain she likes the Fellow. My Father desires us not to be in a hurry, as perhaps if we wait a few months both he and Lady Lesley will do themselves the pleasure of attending us. Lady Lesley says no, that nothing will ever tempt her to forego the Amusements of Brighthelmstone for a Journey to Italy merely to see our Brother. [...] "No (says the disagreable Woman) I have once in my life been fool enough to travel I dont know how many hundred Miles to see two of the Family, and I found it did not answer, so Deuce take me, if ever I am so foolish again."So says her Ladyship, but Sir George still Perseveres in saying that perhaps in a month or two, they may accompany us. Adeiu my Dear Charlotte Yrs faithful Margaret Lesley.|$|E

40|$|Want to {{know not}} just what makes rockets go up but how to do it optimally? Optimal control theory has become such an important field in {{aerospace}} engineering that no graduate student or practicing engineer {{can afford to be}} without a working knowledge of it.  This is the first book that begins from scratch to teach the reader the basic principles of the calculus of variations, develop the necessary conditions step-by-step, and introduce the elementary computational techniques of optimal control.  This book, with problems and an online solution manual, provides the graduate-level reader with enough introductory knowledge so <b>that</b> he or <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only read the literature and study the next level textbook but can also apply the theory to find optimal solutions in practice. No more is needed than the usual background of an undergraduate engineering, science, or mathematics program: namely calculus, differential equations, and numerical integration. Although finding optimal solutions for these problems is a complex process involving the calculus of variations, the authors carefully lay out step-by-step the most important theorems and concepts. Numerous examples are worked to demonstrate how to apply the theories to everything from classical problems (e. g., crossing a river in minimum time) to engineering problems (e. g., minimum-fuel launch of a satellite).  Throughout the book use is made of the time-optimal launch of a satellite into orbit as an important case study with detailed analysis of two examples: launch from the Moon and launch from Earth.  For launching into the field of optimal solutions, look no further!...|$|R

40|$|Esta pesquisa teve como objetivo compreender a vivência de ser mãe, através da adoção, no caso de mulheres férteis cujo companheiro é infértil. Partiu-se do referencial fenomenológico-existencial, utilizando-se como instrumento metodológico a narrativa. Os resultados mostraram que a maternidade permanece como um dos principais papéis femininos, bem como que a adoção pode ser pensada como alternativa para realizar o desejo de ser mãe e, ao mesmo tempo, agradar o marido, garantindo a continuidade daquela relação amorosa. Através dos cuidados maternos, a mulher pode se realizar como mãe, acarretando novo sentido para sua vida, embora a ausência da gravidez seja motivo de frustração e/ou sofrimento. Ao final, o estudo enseja reflexões de que, para se realizar como mãe, a mulher não precisa, necessariamente, gerar filhos, sendo a maternidade uma das inúmeras possibilidades que lhe são apresentadas, que ela pode escolher, ou não, realizar. This article {{refers to}} a {{research}} which aimed to understand {{the experience of being}} mother through adoption in the case of fertile women, but whose partner is infertile.

Through motherly care, the woman can achieve plenitude as a mother, what brings a new meaning for her live, although the pregnancy absence brings a frustration feeling and/or suffering.

40|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, it is very human that one {{sometimes}} feels dissatisfied with things <b>that</b> he or <b>she</b> gets in life. However, it will be uncommon if one always feels dissatisfied with everything <b>that</b> he or <b>she</b> gets in life. Due to this fact, this thesis is a study about human's dissatisfaction towards his or her life. In Madame Bovary, Emma Bovary {{is a woman who}} always feels dissatisfied with whatever she has in life- That is why the thesis writer is curious to analyze the reasons that makes Emma Bovary dissatisfied with her marriage and the results of her dissatisfaction itself. Therefore, this thesis intends to prove that there is a reason that causes Emma Bovary's dissatisfaction towards her marriage and that her dissatisfaction finally leads her to her two adulteries. The analysis is done first by studying Emma Bovary's uncommon nature, that are her excessive romanticism and extravagance, which is moreover supported by her neurotic tendency as the only reason of her dissatisfaction towards her marriage. Secondly, the analysis is also done by uncovering Emma's adulteries as the results of her dissatisfaction towards her marriage. Furthermore, {{in order to make the}} analysis on the reason of why Emma is dissatisfied with her marriage, the thesis writer uses two related meanings, those are neuroticism and romanticism to explain Emma's unusual nature. Through the analysis, the thesis writer finds out that Emma's inability to differentiate between the dream world and the reality of her life brings her misery throughout her life. Furthermore, Emma's running away from all her problems causes a moral degradation to her since she will ignore any rule and norm to get all the things <b>that</b> <b>she</b> desires and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> get from her marriage with Charles...|$|R
