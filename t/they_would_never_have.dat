5|$|Brock {{sent the}} twelve mutineers {{and the seven}} deserters to Quebec for court martial. The mutineers had planned to jail all the {{officers}} (save Sheaffe, who was to be killed) and to cross the Niagara River into the U.S. at Queenston. Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that {{they were forced to}} such measures by the severity of Sheaffe's command. They said if they had continued under Brock's command, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> taken such action. Brock was evidently upset by the news that the conspirators had been shot. In a botched execution, the firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance, so that the condemned men were not killed instantly.|$|E
5|$|As the new line-up (with Wright) toured {{throughout}} North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was, on occasion, close by. The bassist had forbidden any {{members of}} Pink Floyd from attending his concerts, which were generally in smaller venues than those housing his former band's performances. Waters also issued a writ for copyright {{fees for the}} band's use of the flying pig, and Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to the balloon's underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. By November 1987, Waters gave up, and on 23 December a legal settlement was finally reached at a meeting on Astoria. Mason and Gilmour were allowed use of the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity, and Waters would be granted, among other things, rights to The Wall. However, Waters claimed that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> the level of success that they had during his tenure again.|$|E
25|$|Another loss followed, {{a humiliating}} one to Lancashire in the inaugural Twenty20 match, before winning {{a close second}} game, against Nottinghamshire Outlaws at Trent Bridge. Three losses {{in the middle of}} the group stage sent them {{virtually}} out of the tournament, though, as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> qualified with four losses. However, their Twenty20 wounds were quickly healed, with three victories – in the County Championship, the National League and the C Trophy semi-final. They moved into the top three on 23 July when they beat Leicestershire by six wickets, coming back from a first-innings deficit of 179 runs.|$|E

5000|$|Right {{from the}} start, the Auswärtiges Amt was very {{socially}} exclusive. To join, one needed a university degree, preferably in jurisprudence {{and needed to}} prove that one had a considerable private income. In 1880, a candidate had {{to prove that he}} had a private income of at least 6,000 marks/annum in order to join; by 1900, the requirement was 10,000 marks/annum and by 1912, a candidate needed at least 15,000 marks/annum to join. This requirement explains why so many German diplomats married richer women because without the wealth of their wives <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> been able to join the Auswärtiges Amt.|$|R

However, Perón objects and says {{that if it was}} not for her, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> {{achieved}} as much as they have ("She Is a Diamond"). But he also concedes she {{will not be able to}} keep working for long as she will soon succumb to her cancer. Even so, Eva is determined to run for vice-president, and Perón fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists she can continue, despite her failing health ("Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet").|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the {{football}} rivalry between Argentina and Brazil {{can be traced to}} before football became so popular in both countries. Today, few remember wars and other political confrontations between both countries, and only recall matches, victories, goals and other sport-related incidents. Their rivalry is found in almost all sports, but a men's football match between Argentina and Brazil is one that neither side wants to lose, and often acquires more importance than the championship within which it takes place. To exemplify the intensity of this rivalry, one only needs to remember that after the 1946 incidents (see below), the two teams did not play against each other for ten years; either team would decline to play a given cup so that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> to play against the neighboring country.|$|E
25|$|While {{the current}} round of legal {{questions}} have been settled in the courts, controversy {{about the effects of}} the agreement has increased in 2015. The Coachella Valley Water District and the Imperial Irrigation District have disputed a petition filed by the latter organization that calls for the state and other authorities to restore the ecological stability of the Salton Sea. As of April 2015, a state task force has agreed to examine the petition and potentially respond to the ecological concerns cited. An envoy from the Imperial Irrigation District is discussing the petition with the state government, as there have been concerns that the state's promises to assist the IID in providing mitigation water to the Salton Sea region have been vague and unfulfilled. The QSA required the state to identify a Salton Sea restoration plan and include funding, though nothing has yet been approved. Imperial Irrigation District officials have asserted that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> agreed to the QSA without assistance from other government agencies.|$|E

Lewis and Clark followed horses through impassable rapids since migrating horses are known to follow along rivers.

Although he seems to like helping Rapunzel adjust to her new royal life, he eventually starts to feel he doesn't belong with her and runs away, to Rapunzel's isolated tower in the deepest parts of the forest. In Episode 11, it is revealed that, as a baby, his mother had sent him to safety on a lily-pad to escape a ravenous snake that was pursing them. As his mother was eaten by the snake, he had floated down a waterfall, where he heard [...] young Rapunzel singing. He climbed her tower but was still being followed by the snake which infected him with its lethal venom. It was then that the young Rapunzel used the light-based, healing magic of her blond hair to return him to life. She welcomed the infant chameleon as her best friend, that way <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> to be alone again.|$|E
500|$|Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, {{producers}} at Universal Pictures, independently {{heard about}} Peter Benchley's novel Jaws. Brown came across {{it in the}} literature section of lifestyle magazine Cosmopolitan, then edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave {{a detailed description of}} the plot, concluding with the comment [...] "might make a good movie". The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was [...] "the most exciting thing that they had ever read" [...] and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished. They purchased the movie rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.|$|E

The girls enjoyed talking with fellow nurses at the hospital, women <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> met {{if not for the}} war, and knew the names of their children and their family stories. On one occasion, when a lady in waiting who usually picked up the girls from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, the two girls decided to go shopping in a store when they had a break. They ordered the carriage driver to stop in a shopping district and went into a store where they were not recognized because of their nursing uniforms. However, they discovered that they didn't know how to buy anything because they had never used money. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to go about purchasing an item from a store. Yet other stories tell of a regular salary of nine dollars the girls received each month, and how they used it to purchase such items as perfume and notepaper. They had also been shopping with their Aunt, Olga Alexandrovna and Olga had visited shops on a trip to Germany with her sister Tatiana ...|$|E
500|$|The Rolling Stones {{needed to}} find a new guitarist, and the {{recording}} sessions for the next album, Black and Blue (UK 2; US 1) (1976) in Munich provided an opportunity for some hopefuls to work while trying out for the band. Guitarists as stylistically disparate as Peter Frampton and Jeff Beck were auditioned as well as Robert A. Johnson and Shuggie Otis. Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist Rory Gallagher later claimed that they had played without realising they were being auditioned, and both agreed that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> joined. American session players Wayne Perkins and Harvey Mandel also tried out but Richards and Jagger had a preference for the band to remain purely British. When Ronnie Wood auditioned, everyone agreed that he was the right choice. He had already recorded and played live with Richards, and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track [...] "It's Only Rock 'n Roll". He had earlier declined Jagger's offer to join the Stones, because of his commitment to the Faces, saying [...] "that's what's really important to me". Faces' lead singer Rod Stewart {{went so far as to}} say he would take bets that Wood would not join the Stones.|$|E
500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E
