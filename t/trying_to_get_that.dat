[...] Kurtzman stated he [...] "was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get...</b> <b>that</b> Henry Mancini feel to the story". [...] "Thelonius Violence" [...] appears first in the book, but {{was one of the}} last stories to be completed. [...] It remained a favorite of Kurtzman's, as he [...] "had control of this story.

500|$|Valene's storyline in {{her first}} two episodes on Dallas focuses on the {{rebuilding}} of her relationship with estranged ex-husband Gary Ewing. When Valene arrives in Texas to find her daughter, Lucy Ewing, she is brought back into {{the drama of the}} Ewing family. Upon arrival, she is reunited with Gary with whom she slowly falls back in love. Once Dallas became a hit, series creator David Jacobs proceeded to launch a spin-off series titled Knots Landing, which would feature Valene and Gary prominently. The actress had strong input on how they would create her character outline. She recalled, [...] "I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I {{was supposed to be}} in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
500|$|Feargus Urquhart, Obsidian's CEO, {{explained}} why {{they chose to}} use a crowd funding model for Pillars of Eternity instead of the traditional developer and publisher arrangement: [...] "What Kickstarter does is let us make a game that is absolutely reminiscent of those great games, since <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> funded through a traditional publisher would be next to impossible." [...] In an interview, Josh Sawyer said that being free {{of the limitations of}} a publisher would enable them to [...] "delve into more mature subject matter slavery, hostile prejudice (racial, cultural, spiritual, sexual), drug use and trade, and so on will all help flesh out the story". Obsidian was said to be inspired by InXile Entertainment's success of using Kickstarter to fund Wasteland 2. Chris Avellone said during the project's announcement that if the campaign were to succeed, Pillars of Eternity would become a franchise. He also ruled out a possible console port of the game, saying, [...] "Those [...] limitations affect RPG mechanics and content more than players may realize (especially for players who've never played a PC RPG and realize what's been lost over the years), and often doesn't add to the RPG experience." [...] Nevertheless, the game was successfully ported to consoles later. Additionally, he has pledged to write a novella set in the game world.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} Albarn went to Mali, {{he was taken}} to a {{landfill}} where he saw people [...] "taking every little bit, a little bit of fabric to the fabric regenerators, or the metal and the cans to the ironsmiths and the aluminium recyclers, and it goes on and {{by the time you get}} to the road, they're selling stuff." [...] When Albarn went to a landfill outside London to record the sound of seagulls for the album, he noticed a [...] between the way the two countries dealt with rubbish. [...] "They've got more snakes... like adders, grass snakes, slow worms, toads, frogs, newts, all kinds of rodents, all kinds of squirrels, a massive number of squirrels, foxes, and obviously, seagulls. [...] This is part of the new ecology. And for the first time I saw the world in a new way. I've always felt, I'm trying to get across on this new record, the idea that plastic, we see it as being against nature but it's come out of nature. We didn't create plastic, nature created plastic. And just seeing the snakes like living in the warmth of decomposing plastic bags. They like it. It was a strange kind of optimism that I felt... but <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> into pop music is a challenge, anyway. But important." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{except that}} there being no will I {{inherited}} everything, or shall do so.

6000|$|For a {{time after}} that Kipps {{certainly}} pretended to be quite desperately drunk and unable to walk and Chitterlow entered into the pretence and supported him.

The chilly way in which [...] "Shalford" [...] glittered in the moonlight printed itself with particular vividness on his mind. It appeared to Kipps that that establishment was closed to him for evermore. Those gilded letters, in spite of appearances, spelt FINIS for him and exile from Folkestone. He would never do wood-carving, never see Miss Walshingham again. Not that he had ever hoped to see her again. But this was the knife, this was final. He had stayed out, he had got drunk, there had been that row about the Manchester window dressing only three days ago.... In the retrospect he was quite sure that he was perfectly sober then and at bottom extremely unhappy, but he kept a brave face on the matter nevertheless, and declared stoutly he didn't care if he was locked out.|$|E
