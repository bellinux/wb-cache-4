5000|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography involves injecting a short-lived radioactive <b>tracer</b> <b>isotope</b> into the blood. When the radioisotope decays, it emits positrons which are detected by the machine sensor. The isotope is chemically {{incorporated into a}} biologically active molecule, such as glucose, which powers metabolic activity. Whenever brain activity occurs in a given area these molecules are recruited to the area. Once the concentration of the biologically active molecule, and its radioactive [...] "dye", rises enough, the scanner can detect it. About one second elapses from when brain activity begins to when the activity is detected by the PET device. This is because it takes {{a certain amount of}} time for the dye to reach the needed concentrations can be detected. Functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI is a form of the traditional MRI imaging device that allows for brain activity to be observed in real time. An fMRI device works by detecting changes in neural blood flow that is associated with brain activity. fMRI devices use a strong, static magnetic field to align nuclei of atoms within the brain. An additional magnetic field, often called the gradient field, is then applied to elevate the nuclei to a higher energy state. When the gradient field is removed, the nuclei revert to their original state and emit energy. The emitted energy is detected by the fMRI machine and is used to form an image. When neurons become active blood flow to those regions increases. This oxygen-rich blood displaces oxygen depleted blood in these areas. Hemoglobin molecules in the oxygen-carrying red blood cells have different magnetic properties depending on whether it is oxygenated. By focusing the detection on the magnetic disturbances created by hemoglobin, the activity of neurons can be mapped in near real time. Few other techniques allow for researchers to study temporal dynamics in real time.|$|E

Radioautography of sections of bone and cartilage that had been fixed in formalin indicated that the <b>tracer</b> <b>isotope</b> was present throughout the entire epiphysis. Its concentration therein was highest initially at the epiphyseal-diaphyseal junction where the more mature cartilage cells were present.

Information about relative flux through pathways is encoded by the distribution of 13 C isotopomers in an intermediate pool such as glutamate. This information is commonly decoded either by mass spectrometry or by measuring relative multiplet areas in a 13 C NMR spectrum. We demonstrate here that groups of glutamate 13 C isotopomers may be quantified by indirect detection of protons in a 2 D HMQC-TOCSY NMR spectrum and that fitting of these data to a metabolic model provides an identical measure of the 13 C fractional enrichment of acetyl-CoA and relative anaplerotic flux to that given by direct 13 C NMR analysis. The sensitivity gain provided by HMQC-TOCSY spectroscopy will allow an extension of 13 C isotopomer analysis to tissue samples not amenable to direct 13 C detection (∼ 10 mg soleus muscle) and to tissue metabolites other than glutamate that are typically present at lower concentrations...|$|E

The results supported the first hypothesis and gave some support to the second.

40|$|Permeability {{characteristics}} of the membrane lesion generated by the terminal complement proteins are considered {{in light of recent}} observations that the measured diffusion of solute across complement-damaged membranes does not conform to the "doughnut hole" model of a discrete transmembrane pore formed by the inserted C 5 b- 9 complex. By using the measured kinetics of steady-state <b>tracer</b> <b>isotope</b> diffusion of nonelectrolytes across resealed erythrocyte ghost membranes treated with C 5 b- 9, a new transport model is developed. This model considers the apparent membrane lesion strictly in terms of the operational criteria of a functional conducting pathway for the observed diffusing solute, independent of a priori assumptions about the geometry or molecular properties of the membrane lesion. With this definition of the unit membrane lesion and the assumption that the exclusion size of the conducting pathway varies directly with the multiplicity of bound C 5 b- 9 (as suggested by previous measurements under conditions of varying input of C 5 b- 9), numerical estimates of te apparent permeability of the complement-damaged membrane to four diffusing nonelectrolytes are derived.

Implications of these results are discussed in terms of current molecular models for the mechanism of membrane damage by the complement proteins...|$|E

Our experiment, part of the EARTHTIME initiative, directly links the tracer calibration to first-principles measurements of mass and purity that are all traceable to SI units, thereby quantifying the accuracy and precision of U-Pb dates in absolute time. The calibration incorporates new more accurate and precise purity measurements {{for a number of}} commonly used Pb and U reference materials, and requires inter-relating their isotopic compositions and uncertainties. Similar methods can be used for other isotope systems that utilize multiple isotopic standards for calibration purposes. We also detail the inter-calibration of three publicly available U-Pb gravimetric solutions, which can be used to bring the same first-principles traceability to in-house U-Pb tracers from other laboratories. Accounting for uncertainty correlations in the <b>tracer</b> <b>isotope</b> ratios yields a tracer calibration contribution to the relative uncertainty of a 206 Pb/ 238 U date that is only half of the relative uncertainty in the 235 U/ 205 Pb ratio of the tracer, which was historically used to approximate the tracer related uncertainty contribution to 206 Pb/ 238 U dates.

The fate of the <b>tracer</b> <b>isotope</b> was measured in litter and soil, {{as well as in}} the soil fauna, and for each taxa, we calculated the proportion of N in the animal derived from the labelled substrate. Of the original N contained in the litter, 20 % to 41 % was lost after 9 months at Leinefelde, and only 10 % at Sorø. This loss was counterbalanced by the incorporation of 24 % to 31 % external N at Leinefelde, and 31 % at Sorø, partly originating from fungal colonisation of the added litter. The proportion of N assimilated from the labelled litter by the different soil animals varied in relation to their mobility and feeding preferences. Large and mobile soil animals, especially predators, derived on average less 15 N because they were also able to feed outside the labelled litter boxes.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In this {{proposed}} isotopic dilution method, {{the activities of}} target isotope-analytes are determined relative to the known activity of an <b>isotope</b> <b>tracer</b> that is added in the initial stage of analysis {{in order to determine}} the chemical yield. A key aspect of activity calculation, undertaken on the basis of new mathematical approaches, is the splitting of a complex spectrum obtained by liquid scintillation (LS) counting into its separate individual reference spectra, corrected for the sample quench-ing parameter. This method avoids applying alternative techniques for chemical yield determination, such as gravimetry, var-ious modifications of optical methods (SF, AAS, AES), or γ spectrometry. Based on our experience, it is possible to formulate the following criteria to select <b>tracer</b> <b>isotopes</b> for LS spectrometry: absence (or negligible content) in analyzed samples, suf-ficiently long half-life (at least 1 month), and, most importantly, minimal overlapping of the spectra of the isotopes to be deter-mined.
