40|$|The {{effect of}} screw {{geometry}} on the pullout strength of an {{anterior cruciate ligament}} reconstruction is well documented. The effect of a truly <b>tapered</b> <b>screw</b> has not been previously investigated. Thirty bovine knees in right and left knee pairs were collected. Superficial digital flexors from the hind legs of sheep were harvested to form a quadruple tendon graft. For each knee pair, one tendon graft was fixed using a <b>tapered</b> <b>screw</b> (n= 15) {{and the other with}} a non-tapered screw (n= 15). Interference screws were manufactured from stainless steel, and apart from the tapered or non-tapered profile were identical. The screws were inserted into a tibial tunnel already containing the tendon graft. The interference fit was tested by extensile load to failure tests. The insertion torque of the screws and first sign of load to failure (by pullout) of the interference fit were recorded. Results were analysed using paired t-tests. The results indicated that <b>tapered</b> <b>screws</b> have significantly higher resistance to interference failure (p= 0. 007) and insertion torque (p< 0. 001) than non-tapered screws. The improved biomechanical performance of <b>tapered</b> <b>screws</b> demonstrated in this study may translate into superior clinical results, particularly at the tibial attachment of hamstring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and also of hamstring fixation to the medial femoral condyle for patella instability.

The applications of FSW process are found in several industries such as aerospace, rail, automotive and marine industries for joining aluminium, magnesium and copper alloys. The FSW process parameters such as rotational speed, welding speed, axial force and attack angle play vital roles in the analysis of weld quality.

40|$|The {{influence}} of surface quality, in particular surface topography and implant material, was evaluated by inserting titanium- and hydroxylapatite plasma-sprayed coated implants into the maxilla of 10 goats. Three types of plasma-spray coatings {{were applied to}} <b>tapered,</b> <b>screw</b> shaped implants; titanium plasma-spray coating (TPS), titanium plasma-spray coating with additional acid passivation (TPSA) and a bilayered coating (TPS/HA) consisting of titanium plasma-spray coating (TPS) and a hydroxylapatite part (HA). In addition, as-machined implants (TiM) were used as control. A total of 40 implants were inserted according a balanced split plot design. At {{the end of a}} 3 -month healing period, it appeared that 5 implants (2 TPS, 1 TPSA, 1 TPS/HA and 1 TiM) were lost. Histological examination revealed a stronger bone response to TPS/HA coated implants. Even the TPS/HA coated implants induced bone formation {{on the part of the}} implant inserted into the sinus. No signs of delamination of the TPS coatings were visible. The HA part of the dual coating showed signs of degradation. Histomorphometrical analysis confirmed these findings. A significant difference in bone contact (P < 0. 05) was measured between the TPS/HA coated implants and the other types of implants. Linear regression (r = 0. 27) showed no correlation between the inscrew values at the base line and the bone contact measurements 3 months after healing.

30|$|Although the {{reduction}} in RTVs was observed after mechanical cyclic loading, no screw loosening occurred after 2, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading, which it assumed represents 3 [*]years of function in worse scenario setting according to ISO 14801 in vivo [23]. Our study presents similar results to those of Binon and McHugh, who reported that the 30 -N-cm insertion torque can maintain screw-joint stability in 3 [*]years of simulated function [34]. The reduction of screw preload after 2, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading was 42.74 %. This {{is considered to be}} relatively low and might be because of the implant-abutment connection design [39]. The eccentric force has little effect on the screw preload under functional loading because the contacting part of the cone connection helps to provide frictional resistance and mechanical stability [7, 8]. Moreover, the Octatorx lobular anti-rotational design help produce little micromovement in the joint system under load [9]. The screw design also has an effect on the screw preload [39]. Paepoemsin et al. [31] found that the retaining <b>tapered</b> <b>screws</b> of their implants maintained higher preload efficiency than did the flat head screws of the implants before and after cyclic loading (P[*]<[*] 0.05). In our study, RTVs were constant from 50, 000 [*]cycles of loading to 1, 800, 000 [*]cycles. This result is not in agreement with those of Khraisat et al. [40], who concluded that 1, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading significantly affected the RTVs of CeraOne abutment external hex implants compared with 500, 000 [*]cycles of loading. This might be because different types of implant-abutment connections were used. In external connections, implant-abutment stability is obtained primarily by the tension of the screws [4]. Therefore, the screw preload in external connections is affected by the cyclic loading more than in internal connections.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Tapered {{implants}} {{are thought}} to result in equivalent long-term stability and marginal peri-implant bone height in comparison to cylindrical implants. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare the primary stability and osseointegration of a novel bone-level tapered-wall implant to a control bone-level cylindrical implant with exactly the same surface characteristics, in a direct side-by-side comparison in an animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mandibular premolars and first molars were extracted in 11 G. ttingen minipigs, and healing was allowed for 3 months. Six implants were placed with a 4 -week surgical lag time between hemimandibles (three per side), and either immediately loaded (first implantation time point) or submerged (second implantation time point). Eight-mm-long × 4. 1 -mm-diameter titanium screw-type bone-level implants with tapered (two per side) and cylindrical bodies (one per side) were used (Institut Straumann); insertion torque and implant stability were measured, and the soft tissue was closed. Standardized radiographs were taken at implant placement and at sacrifice. Following a healing period of 1 month from the last surgical intervention (8 weeks total healing time for loaded implants; 4 weeks total healing time for nonloaded implants), the animals were sacrificed and mandibular blocks were harvested for nondecalcified histologic and histomorphometric analysis. RESULTS: All implants were integrated radiographically and osseointegrated histologically. Maximum insertion torque measurements and implant stability quotient values showed no significant difference between tapered and cylindrical implants. Histomorphometric analysis also resulted in comparable bone-to-implant contact values between the implant types and similarly limited marginal peri-implant bone resorption; no significant differences were observed regarding all the evaluated parameters between the groups, regardless of the loading regime.

40|$|Introduction It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the release of metal debris due to mechanical wear, fretting and corrosion at the head-stem taper junction may contribute to the high revision rates of MOM-THAs [1, 2]. A peer reviewed, semi-quantitative corrosion and fretting scoring system of the femoral stem and head tapers using visual assessment, was developed by Goldberg et al. [3]. This method involves assigning scores on a scale of 1 (no visible signs of corrosion or fretting) to 4 (severe corrosion or fretting) based on the prevalence of black debris, pits or etch marks (corrosion) and fretting scars. However, this method has not been validated and the reproducibility of such a measure is unknown. Furthermore, whilst scoring a component allows the examiner to quickly quantify the appearance of taper surface damage in the form of corrosion or fretting, it is unclear as to how this relates to the actual volume of material loss at the taper. The aims of this study were to: (1) determine the inter-observer variability of the visual scoring method for the assessment of corrosion and fretting of MOM-THA taper junctions; (2) determine the prevalence and severity of corrosion and fretting at the taper junction; (3) determine the strength of correlation between corrosion and fretting scores and the actual volume of material lost at the taper junction. Methods Macroscopic and stereomicroscopic examinations of the head taper surface of 150 retrieved MOM-THA implants were performed by two experienced independent observers using methods previously defined [3] to assess corrosion and fretting. Both observers were blinded to all other clinical and component data. A Leica M 50 microscope with x 40 magnification was used to examine each surface. The visual appearance of fretting was considered as regions of the taper surface that were damaged with small scars running perpendicular to the circumferential machine lines of the <b>taper</b> <b>screw</b> thread. The visual appearance of corrosion was defined as regions of discolouration or dullness on the taper surface or the presence of black debris, pits or etch marks. The prevalence of corrosion and fretting was quantified using a scoring scale of 1 (none) to 4 (severe), as described previously [3]. Corrosion and fretting scores were assigned to the distal and proximal regions of the taper surface, Figure 1. Overall scores for corrosion and fretting were then assigned to each taper following assessment of each surface as a whole. The volume of material loss at each of the taper surfaces was measured using a Talyrond 365 (Hobson, Leicester, UK) roundness measuring machine, using a published method [4]. The corrosion score relating to the overall surface of each taper was plotted against the measured volume of material loss. All statistical analysis was performed using Stata/IC version 12. 1 [StataCorp, College Station, TC, USA] and throughout a p value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Cohen’s weighted Kappa statistic (κ) was used to measure the inter-observer agreement of the Goldberg scores [5]. Kappa values were assessed using the criteria described by Landis and Koch where κ ≤ 0 = poor, 0. 01 to 0. 20 = slight, 0. 21 to 0. 40 = fair, 0. 41 to 0. 60 = moderate, 0. 61 to 0. 80 = substantial, 0. 81 to 1 = almost perfect [6]. Neither the volumetric measurement data nor corrosion scores were normally distributed. Therefore, to determine the strength of correlation between the two, we used the Spearman Rank test.

40|$|Introduction. Ectodermal Dysplasias are a {{heterogeneous}} group of inherited disorders characterized by dysplasia of tissues of ectodermal origin (hair, nails, teeth, skins and glands). Clinically, {{it may be}} divided into two broad categories: the X-linked hypoidrotic form and the hidrotic form. Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (H. E. D) is characterized by the triad oligo-anodontia, hypotricosis, hypo-anhydrosis (Christ-Siemens-Tourane syndrome). The incidence of HED is about 1 / 100, 000. Mutation in the actodysplasin-A (EDA) and ectodysplasin-A receptor (EDAR) genes are responsible for X-linked and autosomal HED. The clinical features include sparse, fine hair, missing or conical-shaped teeth, decreased sweat and mucous glands, hypoplastic skin, and heat intolerance with exercise or increased ambient temperature. Complete or partial anodontia and malformation of teeth are the most frequent dental findings. Incisors and canines are often conical-shaped while primarily second molars, if present, are mostly affected by taurodontism. Treatment is supportive and includes protection from heat exposure, early prosthetic rehabilitation, skin, hair ear, nose and nail care, and genetic counseling for family planning. The diagnosis of HED in the neonatal and early infancy period may be difficult since sparse hair and absent teeth are normal finding at this age. In childhood the diagnosis is more easily {{made on the basis of}} history and clinical examination. Dental abnormalities are the most common complaint. Prosthetic rehabilitation has been recommended as an essential part of the management of HED because is important from functional, esthetic, and psychological standpoint. A team approach that includes input from a pediatric dentist, an orthodontist, a prosthodontist, and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is necessary for a successful outcome. Conventional prosthodontic rehabilitation in young patient is often difficult because of the anatomical abnormalities of existing teeth and alveolar ridges. The conical shaped teeth and “knife-edge” alveolar ridges result in poor retention and instability of dentures. Moreover, denture must permit jaws expansion and a correct pattern of growth. Materials and Methods. Complete removable dentures were provided to allow for normal physiological development and a corrected masticatory function. Initial maxillary and mandibular impressions were made with smallest stock trays and irreversible hydrocolloid and then final impressions ware made with light-bodied polysulfide rubber base impression material. A base of autopolymerizing resin was constructed and a wax rim was added to the base. The patient’s vertical dimension of occlusion was established by assessing phonetic and esthetic criteria. Preliminary occlusal relations were recorded, and the mandibular cast was mounted on the articulator. Acrylic resin teeth specific for children dentures were selected and mounted. The dentures were tried in and, after proper adjustments, were inserted. The patients were monitored clinically every month to fit prostheses. Cephalometric radiographs were taken every 6 month with the prostheses in place in order to evaluate correct pattern of growth. Cephalometric measurements were realized and used to evaluate the effect of rehabilitation on craniofacial growth. Cephalometric measurements of sound patients were compared with ED patients. After two month expander screws (three-way screw in the upper denture and two-way the lower one) were inserted in each denture in order to permit the expansion of the denture and the jaws growth. Where conical teeth were present, composite crown were realized and luted to improve the esthetic and phonesis. In order to improve retention the placement of endosseous implants was carried out. TC 3 D Accuitomo was performed and a resin model of mandibular bone of the patient was realized. At the age of 11 years two implants were inserted into anterior mandible in a child with anodontia. Despite a remarkable multi-dimensional atrophy of the mandibular alveolar process, the insertion of two <b>tapered</b> <b>screw</b> implants (SAMO Smiler, diameter 3. 8, length 10 mm).

Treated patients showed normal cephalometric measurement. Early rehabilitation is able to prevent the prognatissm of the mandibula.

40|$|Effectiveness {{of active}} flow control for twin- tail buffet {{alleviation}} is investigated. Tangen- tial leading-edge blowing (TLEB) and flow suction along the vortex cores (FSVC) of the lead- ing {{edges of the}} delta wing are used to delay the vortex breakdown flow upstream of the twin tail. The combined effect of the TLEB and FSVC is also investigated. A parametric study {{of the effects of}} the spanwise position of the suction tubes and volumetric suction flow rate on the twin-tail buffet response are also investigated. The TLEB moves the path of leading-edge vortices laterally towards the twin tail, which increases the aero- dynamic damping on the tails. The FSVC effectively delays the breakdown location at high angles of attack. The computational model consists of a sharp-edged delta wing of aspect ratio one and swept-back flexible <b>twin</b> tail with <b>taper</b> ratio of 0. 23.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dynamic rolling {{oscillations}} of delta-wing/twin-tail configuration on twin-tail buffet response is investigated. The computational model {{consists of a}} sharp-edged delta wing of aspect ratio one and swept-back flexible <b>twin</b> tail with <b>taper</b> ratio of 0. 23. The configuration model is statically pitched at 30 deg. angle of attack and then forced to oscillate in roll around the symmetry axis at a constant amplitude of 4 deg. and reduced frequency of pi and 2 (pi). The freestream Mach number and Reynolds number are 0. 3 and 1. 25 million, respectively. This multidisciplinary problem is solved using three sets of equations on a dynamic multi-block grid structure. The first set is the unsteady, full Navier-Stokes equations, the second set is the aeroelastic equations for coupled bending and torsion vibrations of the tails, and the third set is the grid-displacement equations. The configuration is investigated for inboard position of the twin tails which corresponds to a separation distance between the twin tails of 33 % wing span. The computed results are compared {{with the results of}} stationary configuration, which previously have been validated using experimental data. The results conclusively showed that the rolling oscillations of the configuration have led to higher loads, higher deflections, and higher excitation peaks than those of the stationary configuration. Moreover, increasing the reduced frequency has led to higher loads and excitation peaks and lower bending and torsion deflections and acceleration...|$|R
40|$|The buffet {{response}} of the flexible twin-tail/delta wing configuration, a multidisciplinary problem, is solved using three sets of equations on a multi-block grid structure. The first set is the unsteady, compressible, full Navier-Stokes equations which are used for obtaining the flow-field vector and the aerodynamic loads on the twin tails. The second set is the coupled aeroelastic equations which are used for obtaining the bending and torsional deflections of the twin tails. The third set is the grid-displacement equations which are used for updating the grid coordinates due to the tail deflections. The computational model {{is similar to the}} one used by Washburn et. al. which consists of a delta wing of aspect ratio one and <b>twin</b> tails with <b>taper</b> ratios of 0. 23. The vortex of the twin tails are located at the wing trailing edge. The configuration is pitched at 30 deg angle of attack, and the freestream Mach number and Reynolds number are 0. 3 and 1. 25 million, respectively. With the twin tails fixed as rigid surfaces, the problem is solved for the initial flow conditions. Next, the problem is solved for the twin tail response for uncoupled bending and torsional vibrations due to the unsteady loads produced by the vortex breakdown flow of the leading-edge vortex cores. The configuration is investigated for three spanwise positions of the twin tails; inboard, midspan and outboard locations. The computational results are validated and are in very good agreement with the experimental data of Washburn, et. al...|$|R
40|$|At the University of Pretoria's Fluoropolymer Laboratory, an {{important}} long-term {{project is the}} development of a waste polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) depolymerisation process where TFE can be produced, purified and polymerised to reproduce pure PTFE. At the start of this project, the process consisted of a batch depolymerisation system, a sub-zero distillation column, and a polymerisation reactor system. The batch depolymerisation system could not produce enough gas per session to operate the downstream processes efficiently. The main aim of this investigation was to adapt the batch depolymerisation system to enable continuous depolymerisation by designing, implementing and testing a continuous PTFE screw feeder. With the screw feeder in place, the operating limits, with regard to temperature, pressure, and Teflon® PTFE 807 N feed rate, were determined. The effects of temperature and pressure on the tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and octafluorocyclobutane (OFCB) fractional composition were examined and the optimum operating conditions to maximise these products were determined statistically. An investigative approach was used in designing the hopper system. The optimum hopper wall angle and Teflon® PTFE 807 N feed mixture was determined experimentally by testing four hopper angles, pure Teflon® PTFE 807 N, and two Teflon® PTFE 807 N mixtures (Teflon® PTFE 807 N mixed with larger, compressed Teflon® PTFE 807 N, particles in a 70 : 30 wt % and 50 : 50 wt % ratio) and two motor speeds. At all of the hopper angles and Teflon mixture configurations, rat-hole formation prevented the feeder from producing a constant flow rate. A hopper wall angle of 20 ° (to the vertical) together with plain Teflon® PTFE 807 N were selected, as these two variables together helped to delay the formation of rat-holes the most. A stirrer was inserted in the hopper to negate the rat-holing problem. The continuous feeder was successfully designed, manufactured, calibrated, and installed. The feeder consists of a wedge-shaped hopper with a constant pitch, a <b>tapered</b> shaft <b>screw</b> and is capable of providing a maximum Teflon® PTFE 807 N flow rate of approximately 20 g·min- 1 for up to 40 min. Experimental test runs of the continuous depolymerisation system indicated that the minimum operating reactor temperature was 650 °C due to heat transfer and or rate of reaction limitations. The maximum flow rate of Teflon® PTFE 807 N was determined to be 11 g·min- 1 for the current reactor system. The maximum operating temperature and pressure were limited to 750 °C and 40 kPa, respectively, to avoid operating conditions that could lead to the increased production of PFIB. A three-level full factorial experimental design was used to determine the temperature and pressure effects on the fractional distribution of TFE, HFP, and OFCB under steady operating conditions. For pressure control purposed no carrier gas was used. The PTFE flow rate and experimental run time were kept constant at 11 g·min- 1 and 15 min, respectively. The pressure in the system was regulated manually by constricting the flow of product gas out of the system. A maximum TFE mole percentage of 97 % was achieved at operating conditions of 650 °C and 2 kPa. The maximum HFP mole percentage (31 %) was observed at operating conditions of 750 °C and 20 kPa. A maximum of 55 % was observed at 750 °C and 40 kPa for OFCB. Statistical analysis of the continuous depolymerisation results indicate that TFE formation is highly sensitive to changes in pressure, with higher TFE yield fractions achieved at low pressures. The production of OFCB is highly sensitive to pressure, whereas the formation of HFP is equally affected by pressure and temperature changes. However, changes in pressure have a larger effect on the HFP production than temperature when operating at pressures lower than approximately 20 kPa. At higher pressures the sensitivity has the inverse affect, with temperature having a larger effect. As opposed to TFE, an increase in temperature and pressure leads to an increase in the HFP and OFCB concentration. To achieve a TFE mole percentages of 95 % and higher, the operating temperature of the system has to be kept in the range of 650 °C 720 °C, together with a system pressure of 2 kPa or less. Within the operating range of 730 °C 750 °C and 35 kPa 40 kPa a mole percentage of 50 % and higher can be expected for OFCB. A mole percentage of 19 % and higher can be expected for HFP in the operating range of 744 °C 750 °C and 32 kPa 40 kPa. It was determined through a kinetic analysis of the system, that the residence time of the product gas in the reactor has a large effect on the production of HFP, with an increase in residence time leading to a sharp increase in the HFP concentration and a decrease in the OFCB and TFE concentrations. Analysis of the determined product specific kinetics indicate that the predominant HFP production pathway at low residence times (&# 060 3 s) is via the reaction of TFE with difluorocarbenes. At higher residence times the dominant reaction pathway is the dissociation OFCB. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. Chemical EngineeringMEngUnrestricte...|$|R
