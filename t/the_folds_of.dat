5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. <b>The</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E
5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. <b>The</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where they spread out.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> {{ribonuclease}} A (RNase A) {{has been}} extensively studied by characterizing the disulfide containing intermediates using different experimental conditions and analytical techniques. So far, some aspects still remain unclear such as {{the role of the}} loop 65 - 72 in <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> pathway. We have studied <b>the</b> oxidative <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> a RNase A derivative containing at position 67 the substitution Asn [...] > isoAsp where the local structure of the loop 65 - 72 has been modified keeping intact the C 65 -C 72 disulfide bond. By comparing <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> behavior <b>of</b> this mutant to that of the wild-type protein, we found that the deamidation significantly decreases <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> rate and alters <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> pathway <b>of</b> RNase A. Results presented here shed light {{on the role of the}} 65 - 72 region in <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> process <b>of</b> RNase A and also clarifies the effect of the deamidation on the folding/unfolding processes.

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point strongly toward {{the importance of}} highly alpha-helical intermediates in <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> all globular proteins, regardless of their native structure. However, experimental refolding studies demonstrate no observable alpha-helical intermediate during refolding of some beta-sheet proteins and have dampened enthusiasm for this model <b>of</b> protein <b>folding.</b> In this study, beta-sheet proteins were hypothesized to have potential to form amphiphilic helices at a period of < 3. 6 residues/turn that matches or exceeds the potential at 3. 6 residues/turn. Hypothetically, such potential {{is the basis for}} an effective and unidirectional mechanism by which highly alpha-helical intermediates might be rapidly disassembled during folding and potentially accounts for the difficulty in detecting highly alpha-helical intermediates during <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> some proteins. <b>The</b> presence of this potential was confirmed, indicating that a model entailing ubiquitous formation of alpha-helical intermediates during <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> globular proteins predicts previously unrecognized features of primary structure. Further, <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> fatty acid binding protein, a predominantly beta-sheet protein that exhibits no apparent highly alpha-helical intermediate during folding, was dramatically accelerated by 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol, a solvent that stabilizes alpha-helical structure. This observation suggests that formation of an alpha-helix can be a rate-limiting step during <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> a predominantly beta-sheet protein and further supports the role of highly alpha-helical intermediates in <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> all globular proteins...|$|R

Elasto-plastic materials, such as paper sheets during <b>the</b> (fast) <b>folding</b> under increasing confinement force, are expected to obey the scaling force-diameter relation derived for elastic manifolds. However, in experiments with paper strips of different geometry, we observed the crossover from packing of one-dimensional strings to folding two dimensional sheets only, because the fractal dimension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> <b>folded</b> elasto-plastic sheets is the thickness dependent due to the strain relaxation after a confinement force is withdrawn.

These results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> Top 7 is significantly less cooperative than <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> similarly sized naturally occurring proteins, suggesting that <b>the</b> cooperative <b>folding</b> and smooth free energy landscapes observed for small naturally occurring proteins are not general properties of polypeptide chains that fold to unique stable structures but are instead a product of natural selection...|$|R
