5|$|In 1976, three {{collectors}} {{discovered a}} T206 Wagner that featured Wagner {{in a different}} pose, never seen {{in any of the}} other cards. Although a Library of Congress expert said the paper on <b>the</b> <b>card</b> dated back to 1910, the three men decided to submit <b>the</b> <b>card</b> for a water test, using chemicals to determine the card's authenticity. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> broke apart, and as a result, <b>the</b> <b>card</b> was dismissed as a fake.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Gretzky sold <b>the</b> <b>card</b> to Wal-Mart and Treat Entertainment for $500,000. The two {{companies}} {{intended to use}} <b>the</b> <b>card</b> as the grand prize in a promotional contest. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for <b>the</b> <b>card</b> was held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave <b>the</b> <b>card</b> to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> so she decided to consign <b>the</b> <b>card</b> to an auction later on. She consigned <b>the</b> <b>card</b> to Christie's, a New York-based auction house better known for selling famous artworks.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, Alan Ray {{came back}} into the picture, {{claiming}} that he had proof <b>the</b> <b>card</b> had been doctored by Mastro at one point after the initial $25,000 trade in 1985. He had a photograph of <b>the</b> <b>card</b> taken before the transaction with Mastro and claimed that <b>the</b> <b>card</b> in the photo looked significantly different from the photo of Gretzky's card. He sent the comparison of the two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on <b>the</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Generals Order, {{there are}} six {{different}} type of <b>card</b> categories, namely <b>the</b> character <b>card,</b> <b>the</b> event/strategy <b>card,</b> <b>the</b> special <b>card,</b> <b>the</b> equipment <b>card,</b> <b>the</b> advantageous <b>card,</b> and <b>the</b> command/order <b>card.</b> Any deck can only have up to 3 of <b>the</b> exactly same <b>card.</b>|$|R
50|$|Overall, <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> form a {{key part}} of the series. Players on the online website can only collect all the clues through the use of <b>the</b> <b>cards,</b> and in later series can only unlock the {{missions}} by having <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cards</b> in <b>the</b> first series often had puzzles and riddles to solve.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cards</b> are re-themed, and <b>the</b> sliver <b>card</b> is {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> yellow <b>card.</b>|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} {{complaints}} when customers' cards cease {{to work as}} a result of placing <b>the</b> <b>card</b> in proximity to metal or physically damaging <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> In such cases Metro guarantees that the fund balance on <b>the</b> <b>card</b> will be transferred to a new card. However, customers have complained that WMATA has not been processing such balance transfers promptly.|$|E
5|$|For tourists, a Singapore Tourist Pass {{contactless}} smartcard may be purchased. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> may {{be bought}} at selected TransitLink Ticket Offices and Singapore Visitors Centres. The tourists may retrieve their deposit by returning <b>the</b> <b>card</b> {{to the ticket}} offices or visitors centres within 5 days from the date of issue.|$|E
5|$|Making or {{recording}} a payment using <b>the</b> <b>card</b> for public transport or purchases at Octopus-enabled retailers {{can be done}} by holding <b>the</b> <b>card</b> against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away. The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second. When using the MTR system, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate their cards again at the exit point.|$|E
50|$|As {{indicated}} earlier, {{the game}} {{can either be}} played with all <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> laid out or with <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> overlapping each other. As laying <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> out can be a space-waster, it is suggested to overlap <b>the</b> <b>cards,</b> covering each <b>card</b> half <b>the</b> way through and leave a gap (whenever it occurs) as it should when new cards are dealt; that way, when a gap occurs, {{it is easy to}} spot <b>the</b> available <b>cards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The game of Redakai has {{two sets}} of rules, a set of [...] "Basic rules" [...] which plays much like a simple <b>card</b> game where <b>the</b> top <b>card</b> of a deck is flipped face-up to compare powers and another set of rules that utilize the full text on <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cards</b> are made of plastic instead of paper and use a system where several parts of <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are clear to allow {{portions}} of <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> behind them to be revealed, much like the Wizards of the Coast game Hecatomb. <b>The</b> <b>cards</b> also use images created with lenticular printing.|$|R
50|$|Casinos {{offering}} the jackpot generally have <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> shuffled by a card shuffling machine - <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are then removed and dealt {{out by the}} dealer, or croupier. Independent and small casinos generally have the croupier shuffle <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> by hand.|$|R
5|$|SmarTrip cards {{comply with}} the ISO/IEC 14443 Type B standard. A {{microchip}} contained within <b>the</b> <b>card</b> stores its value, {{as well as the}} rider’s most recent entry and exit points, and a unique identifier. However, the unique identifier is not linked to a person’s name or identity, unless one registers <b>the</b> <b>card</b> online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should <b>the</b> <b>card</b> be lost, stolen, or damaged. The unique identifier also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers to subsidize employee transportation costs tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to their cards.|$|E
5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for <b>the</b> <b>card</b> itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for <b>the</b> <b>card</b> and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for <b>the</b> <b>card</b> and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). There is a difference between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value, while CharmCard can store up to $200.|$|E
5|$|The Lothian 'Ridacard' bus pass is a {{pre-paid}} plastic smartcard giving unlimited {{travel on}} regular daytime and night bus services, {{as well as}} Edinburgh Trams services. It is purchased initially from a Transport for Edinburgh Travelshop, where the owner's picture is incorporated on <b>the</b> <b>card</b> to prevent misuse. Once purchased, <b>the</b> <b>card</b> can be placed onto an on-board reader, which reads the contactless chip in the smartcard. Cards can be credited for a weekly, 4 weekly or annual period. A warning is displayed on the last five days of validity. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> can then be topped up at Transport for Edinburgh Travelshops or Pay Point equipped retailers.|$|E
50|$|The game {{starts with}} one of the players dealing <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cards</b> are usually dealt counter-clockwise.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>cards</b> are reshuffled {{and game}} play simply {{continues}} {{with the next}} clockwise player dealing <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
50|$|A skilled cheat {{can deal}} <b>the</b> second <b>card,</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>card,</b> <b>the</b> second from bottom <b>card,</b> and <b>the</b> middle <b>card.</b> <b>The</b> {{idea is to}} cull, or to find <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> one needs, place them at the bottom, top, or any other place the cheat wants, then false deal them to oneself or one's confederate.|$|R
5|$|The {{circumstances}} {{regarding how}} Ray came into {{possession of the}} Gretzky T206 Wagner have been shrouded in mystery. He tried to avoid answering any questions regarding the matter but, in a 2001 interview, claimed to have received it from a relative, whose name he did not disclose. Inside the memorabilia community, there was speculation that <b>the</b> <b>card</b> had been cut from a printing sheet during the deal made with Mastro. Mastro has told colleagues in the memorabilia circuit that he purchased <b>the</b> <b>card</b> from a printer, which was not Ray's profession. Ray personally stated that Mastro might {{have been doing this}} to prevent others from trying to trace <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> Some also claim that Mastro bought <b>the</b> <b>card</b> from Sevchuk, not Ray.|$|E
5|$|The multi-coloured Personalised card is {{available}} on registration. The name and, if opted, {{a photo of the}} holder are imprinted on the cards. They can function automatically as a Child, Adult, or Elder card by recognising the cardholder's age stored on <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> hence accounting for different concessionary fares. As of 2003, there were 380,000 holders of Personalised Octopus cards. In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card, this card {{can be used as a}} key card for access to residential and office buildings. If a Personalised card is lost, the holder may report the loss by phone to prevent unauthorised use of <b>the</b> <b>card.</b> A refund would then be issued to the holder of <b>the</b> <b>card</b> for the deposit and the value that remained on <b>the</b> <b>card</b> three hours after the loss is reported, minus a HK$30 card cost and a HK$20 handling fee.|$|E

50|$|To {{make the}} game more complex, {{if there are}} fewer than 10 players, before starting, remove from <b>the</b> deck <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> higher than 10n + 4 (where n {{is the number of}} players). E.g. with 5 player you will use only <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> from 1 to 54, {{excluding}} <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> from 55 to 104, with 7 player only <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> from 1 to 74 are used. The other rules are unchanged.|$|R
5000|$|If the row where <b>the</b> played <b>card</b> must {{be placed}} already {{contains}} 5 <b>cards</b> (<b>the</b> player's <b>card</b> is <b>the</b> 6th), the player must gather <b>the</b> 5 <b>cards</b> on <b>the</b> table, leaving only <b>the</b> 6th <b>card</b> in their place {{to start a new}} row. <b>The</b> gathered <b>cards</b> must be taken separated and never mixed with <b>the</b> hand <b>cards.</b> <b>The</b> sum of the number of cattle head on <b>the</b> gathered <b>cards</b> will be calculated {{at the end of the}} round.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: MasterCard logo used corporately and on <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> from 1997 to 2006, and on <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> {{only until}} July 14, 2016.|$|R
5|$|A player (or a pair), {{who wins}} {{at least one}} trick {{receives}} an ability to gain more round points upon declaring <b>the</b> <b>card</b> combinations. In Tute in Pairs the declarations can be performed {{until the end of}} round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two cards are left in the deck.|$|E
5|$|After {{purchasing}} or adding {{value to}} a multi-ride card, <b>the</b> <b>card</b> balance is valid for 45 days counted {{from the day}} of first use. The ticket is good for 8 rides. The multi-ride card provides a discount of about 21% off the full fare of a reserved Standard Seat. Non-registered and registered multi-ride tickets {{can be purchased at}} the ticket windows of all THSRC stations. Upon first purchase of a multi-ride ticket, a card deposit fee of NT$100 is required (refundable if <b>the</b> <b>card</b> is returned). The registered multi-ride ticket is limited to personal use by the registered cardholder.|$|E
5|$|During the deal, {{each player}} {{receives}} eight cards. After the last card is dealt, one more card is drawn. It indicates which suit becomes the trump. <b>The</b> <b>card</b> is placed {{perpendicular to the}} stock, at the bottom.|$|E
5000|$|If any of <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> have {{a higher}} score (In {{ascending}} order: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A) than <b>the</b> neutral <b>card,</b> then <b>the</b> highest <b>card</b> wins.|$|R
50|$|To {{increase}} {{the proportion of}} hands with uneven distributions, some play that <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are shuffled only {{at the start of}} a session and after a bid of abundance or higher, while others play that <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are never reshuffled after the opening deal. <b>The</b> <b>cards</b> are simply gathered together by the new dealer and the player to the dealer's right cuts. One variant allows for a -1 penalty for any player who reflexively shuffles <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> way <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> {{respond to}} such {{personal}} inquiries {{is subject to}} various theories. Many tarot users believe that <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are <b>the</b> ones providing the answers. Others would state that there are agents (e.g. angels or fairies) who guide <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> From a psychological point of view, {{there are those who}} believe that the person themselves is the one making the connections between <b>the</b> <b>cards.</b> Such people believe that tarot is useful either because it is a way to let one's subconscious speak (after Freud), or because of meaningful coincidences between the situation or question at hand and <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> (synchronicity, after Jung).|$|R
5|$|Effective October 1, 2013, {{the price}} of <b>the</b> <b>card</b> was reduced to $2, the rebate program was discontinued, and the maximum {{permitted}} negative balance upon exit was set at $1.50, with riders who would exceed this being required to use the Exitfare machines to add value to their cards.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Robert Edward Auctions was {{scheduled}} to begin an auction of a T206 Honus Wagner that was once owned by actor Charlie Sheen. Sheen had loaned <b>the</b> <b>card</b> to the All Star Cafe where it was stolen and later recovered by the FBI. It is graded PSA 1.|$|E
5|$|In {{the only}} women's match {{scheduled}} on <b>the</b> <b>card,</b> Eve defended the WWE Divas Championship against the former champion, Maryse. Eve {{had won the}} championship on the April 12 episode of Raw, and {{in the weeks that}} followed she was attacked by Maryse, who was attempting to get revenge.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>cards</b> of Revised like <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> of <b>the</b> {{preceding}} Unlimited Edition all had white borders, no expansion symbol, and {{the artist}} credit at the bottom left. However, <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> were far paler than their Unlimited counterparts, and the three-dimensional beveling of <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> was cropped out. This gave <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> an appearance that was widely criticized as [...] "washed out" [...] and even unprofessional. The beveling was returned in 4th Edition, and the colors were much more vibrant in that set. The large print run meant that Revised basic lands were so numerous and common that it was uncommon to find any other lands in decks until several years later.|$|R
50|$|Before {{performing}} the trick, the magician secretly notes <b>the</b> bottom <b>card</b> of <b>the</b> deck. Then, he puts <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> {{behind his back}} and turns <b>the</b> top <b>card</b> face up. While showing <b>the</b> bottom <b>card</b> to <b>the</b> audience (and announcing its value) he notes the value of <b>the</b> top <b>card</b> which is facing him. The next time he puts the deck behind his back, he moves <b>the</b> top <b>card</b> to <b>the</b> bottom (turning it over in the process, so that it will face the right way) and turns <b>the</b> new top <b>card</b> face up. Again, he announces the value of <b>the</b> bottom <b>card</b> while seeing <b>the</b> value of the face up top card. This can be repeated as long as is desired. When the magician desires to stop, he will move the face up top <b>card</b> to <b>the</b> bottom (turning it over) and leave <b>the</b> top <b>card</b> face down, and make one last announcement of <b>the</b> bottom <b>card's</b> value. All of <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are now facing the same direction and there is nothing for the audience to find if <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> are examined.|$|R
25|$|Counting outs – {{this method}} {{consists}} of counting <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> still in <b>the</b> deck, which {{in combination with}} <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> <b>the</b> player already has can give the player a potentially winning hand.|$|R
