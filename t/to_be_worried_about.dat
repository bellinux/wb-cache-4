5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care about these people in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> what might happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Levy {{took over}} as Senior Partner from Weinberg, and built Goldman's trading {{franchise}} once again. It is Levy who is credited with Goldman's famous philosophy of being [...] "long-term greedy", which implied {{that as long as}} money is made over the long term, trading losses in the short term were not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about.</b> At the same time, partners reinvested almost all of their earnings in the firm, so the focus was always on the future. That same year, Weinberg retired from the firm.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} on February 7, 2010, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Palin if she supported repeal of [...] "don't ask, don't tell", the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, [...] "I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent {{of his time in}} the State of the Union on national security issues. And I say that because there are other things <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> right now with the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now. To put so much time and effort and politics into it– unnecessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism {{has also}} {{been seen as a}} primary source {{that can be used to}} examine freemasonry in Europe. Even though Freemasonry became a target in the {{paranoid}} literature that blamed the revolution partly on the activities of Masons, the work still had some historical value in regards to the group. Margaret Jacob argues that Barruels writings [...] "offer a point of departure for understanding the relationship between the Continental Enlightenment, as it was lived in the clubs, societies, and lodges of the eighteenth century, and the outbreak of the democratic revolutions in the late 1780s in Amsterdam, Brussels, and most important, Paris." [...] She believes that if readers can look past the paranoia within the text, it can provide information about how Freemasons were treated during the revolution. Jacob also sees value in the text because Barruel argued for a distinction between English Freemasonry and its Continental counterpart. Barruel believed that his allegations against the Continental Freemasons did not apply to the respectable English Freemasons. The activities of the English Freemasons were not the things that needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about.</b> He distinguishes between the circumstances of the French and the English and shows that the language used in each situation was important. He believes that the Masonic language about equality, liberty, and fraternity bears relation to the radical and democratic phase of the French Revolution and to Jacobin language. From the book, Margaret Jacob salvages the realization that language is important and that it can have a social force all of its own.|$|E

[...] It didn't appear to Herbert, however, that Mrs. Brooks exhibited any extravagant joy over the occurrence, and she almost instantly retired with her daughter into the sitting-room, linking her arm in Cherry's, and, as it were, empanoplying her with her own invulnerable shawl. Herbert went to his room more dissatisfied with himself than ever.|$|E
