5|$|However, {{right after}} Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became {{chairman}} of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers and thus editor-in-chief of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literární noviny, which under Novotny had been filled with party loyalists. Goldstucker tested the boundaries of Dubček’s devotion to {{freedom of the press}} when he appeared on a television interview as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the union. On 4 February, in front of the entire nation, he openly criticized Novotny, exposing all of Novotny’s previously unreported policies and explaining how they were preventing progress in Czechoslovakia.|$|E

5|$|Rosenberg {{was granted}} {{a room in the}} palace to use for fortune telling, which the king made sure was stocked with alcohol, as they enjoyed {{drinking}} together.

One month later, Rosenberg was reappointed by order of the king and the following month the head of customs resigned. Archibald Scott Cleghorn, the king's brother-in-law, was appointed as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> customs. Between March and May 1887, Rosenberg was paid $300, ostensibly for working as a guard at the Customs Office, although it was alleged that Rosenberg's position was a sinecure.|$|E

5|$|The growing {{unrest in}} Portugal culminated on April 25, 1974, when the Carnation Revolution, a {{peaceful}} leftist military coup d'état in Lisbon, ousted the incumbent Portuguese government of Marcelo Caetano. Thousands of Portuguese citizens left Mozambique, and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> government, General António de Spínola, {{called for a}} ceasefire. With the change of government in Lisbon, many soldiers refused to continue fighting, often remaining in their barracks instead of going on patrol. Negotiations between the Portuguese administration culminated in the Lusaka Accord signed on September 7, 1974, which provided for a complete hand-over of power to FRELIMO, uncontested by elections. Formal independence was set for June 25, 1975, the 13th anniversary {{of the founding of}} FRELIMO.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state, Ibrahim Babangida, {{declared}} himself president and {{commander in chief}} of the armed forces and of the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E

5|$|After the Boss rescues Kinzie {{from her}} nightmare, she devises {{a plan to}} crash the simulation, which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running, thus {{weakening}} the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter. Working together, the remaining Saints manage to overload the simulation, shutting it down just as the Boss escapes. Assaulting Zinyak's ship, the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers {{they had in the}} simulation, and confronts Zinyak in his throne room. While the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and the Boss battle each other. With help from the Saints, the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious. Impressed, the Zin forces surrender to the Boss, who becomes <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the Zin Empire.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Periyar in 1973, {{conferences}} were held throughout Tamil Nadu for a week in January 1974. The same year Periyar's wife, Maniyammai, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the Dravidar Kazhagam, {{set fire to the}} effigies of 'Rama', 'Sita' and 'Lakshmana' at Periyar Thidal, Madras. This was in retaliation to the Ramaleela celebrations where effigies of 'Ravana', 'Kumbakarna' and 'Indrajit' were burnt in New Delhi. For this act she was imprisoned. During the 1974 May Day meetings held at different places in Tamil Nadu, a resolution urging the Government to preserve 80 percent of jobs for Tamils was passed. Soon after this, a camp was held at Periyar Mansion in Tiruchirapalli to train young men and women to spread the ideals of the Dravidar Kazhagam in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{arrived in}} the United States in February 1935, and joined the faculty at Cornell University on a salary of $3,000. Bethe's {{appointment}} {{was part of a}} deliberate {{effort on the part of}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> its physics department, Roswell Clifton Gibbs, to move into nuclear physics. Gibbs had hired Stanley Livingston, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence, to build a cyclotron at Cornell. To complete the team, Cornell needed an experimentalist, and, on the advice of Bethe and Livingston, recruited Robert Bacher. Bethe received requests to visit Columbia University from Isidor Isaac Rabi, Princeton University from Edward Condon, University of Rochester from Lee DuBridge, Purdue University from Karl Lark-Horovitz, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from Francis Wheeler Loomis, and Harvard University from John Hasbrouck Van Vleck. Gibbs moved to prevent Bethe from being poached by having him appointed as a regular assistant professor in 1936, with an assurance that promotion to professor would soon follow.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Fey {{suggested}} a pilot episode for a situation {{comedy about a}} cable news network to NBC, which rejected it. The pilot was reworked to revolve around an SNL style series, and was accepted by NBC. She {{signed a contract with}} NBC in May 2003, which allowed her to continue in her position within SNL as head writer at least through the 2004–2005 television season. As part of the contract, Fey was to develop a prime-time project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal. The pilot, directed by Adam Bernstein, centered on Liz Lemon, the head writer of a variety show on NBC, and how she managed her relationships with the show's volatile stars and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the network. In October 2006, the pilot aired on NBC as 30 Rock. Although the episode received generally favorable reviews, it finished third in its timeslot.|$|E
5|$|In early 1148, Foliot {{accompanied}} Theobald of Bec to the Council of Reims, {{even though}} the archbishop had been forbidden to attend by King Stephen; Foliot was presumably with Theobald when the archbishop used a small fishing boat in his escape from England to the continent. Robert de Bethune, the Bishop of Hereford, died at the Council of Reims, and Foliot was nominated by Pope Eugene III to fill the Diocese of Hereford, which was held by the Angevin cause. Theobald was behind the appointment, having urged it on the pope. It appears likely that before his consecration Foliot gave assurances {{that he would not}} swear fealty to Stephen. He was consecrated Bishop of Hereford on 5September 1148 at Saint-Omer by Archbishop Theobald. The other English bishops present at Reims—Hilary of Chichester and Josceline de Bohon—refused to help with the consecration, claiming it was contrary to custom for an English bishop to be consecrated outside England. Another of the bishops' concerns was that the pope had infringed Stephen's right to a say in the election. After his consecration Foliot swore fealty to Henry of Anjou, the son of the Empress and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the Angevin party.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> G-2, Major General Clayton L. Bissell, at {{the urging}} of Groves and Furman, decided to create a new, even larger Alsos Mission for western Europe in March 1944. Pash assumed command of the new unit upon its {{official}} creation by the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, on 4 April. The military staff for the new mission were selected by Bissell on Pash's advice. Lieutenant Colonel George R. Eckman became the deputy commander. Captain Henry A. Schade was appointed {{as the head of the}} naval contingent. Groves and Vannevar Bush, the head of OSRD, selected the scientific staff, and appointed Samuel Goudsmit, a University of Michigan physicist with a good command of several western European languages, as its head. Goudsmit had not been working on the Manhattan Project, and therefore could not reveal any of its secrets if captured. The British considered creating their own rival mission, but in the end agreed to participate as a junior partner. Three Dutch and one Norwegian officer also served with the Alsos Mission. By the end of August it had seven officers and 33 scientists.|$|E
