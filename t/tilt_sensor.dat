500|$|In 2003, the Wario {{franchise}} {{introduced a}} new series of games, the first of which was [...] for the Game Boy Advance. The game's premise involved Wario's decision to open a game development company to make money, creating short [...] "microgames" [...] instead of full-fledged games. The title's gameplay focused on playing a collection of microgames in quick succession. Mega Microgames! was later remade as [...] for the GameCube; it featured the same microgames but lacked a story mode and focused more on multi-player. In 2004, two sequels were released for the game. The first was the Game Boy Advance title , which used the cartridge's <b>tilt</b> <b>sensor</b> to allows microgames to be controlled by tilting the handheld left and right. The second was the Nintendo DS release , which incorporates the DS's touch screen and microphone in its gameplay. One of the Wii's launch games in 2006 was , which used the Wii Remote's motion sensing technologies in a variety of ways. The Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi have offered two new releases, 2008's , which can be downloaded with the DSiWare service and uses the DSi's built-in front camera in its gameplay, and the 2009 Nintendo DS game WarioWare D.I.Y., which allows players to create microgames.|$|E
2500|$|... 2.	The {{position}} of the cart [...] relative to track center is stabilized by slightly modulating the null angle (the angle error that the control system tries to null) by the {{position of}} the cart, that is, null angle [...] where [...] is small. [...] This makes the pole want to lean slightly toward track center and stabilize at track center where the tilt angle is exactly vertical. [...] Any offset in the <b>tilt</b> <b>sensor</b> or track slope that would otherwise cause instability translates into a stable position offset. [...] A further added offset gives position control.|$|E
2500|$|During E3 2016, PDP and Harmonix {{unveiled}} new hardware {{that was}} released alongside the Rock Band Rivals expansion. A new guitar controller {{based on the}} Fender Jaguar features improvements to the strum bar and <b>tilt</b> <b>sensor,</b> while its neck can fold down for easier storage. An optional rechargeable battery pack and charging stand for the Jaguar controller was also unveiled. A new full band bundle featuring Rock Band 4 and the Rivals expansion, a Jaguar guitar and a drumkit shipped alongside the digital release of the Rivals expansion in late 2016. With the PDP-supplied instruments, Harmonix {{will be able to}} offer the instrument-and-game bundles at lower cost than on the game's initial release; for example, the game and guitar bundle on release initially had a MSRP of $120, but the new bundle will be priced at $90. While part of this reduction in cost is attributed to the age of the game, Sussman stated that several factors relating to PDP's manufacturing and business models allows them to offer the packages at a more competitive price point.|$|E

2500|$|At launch, Mad Catz {{handled the}} global production, sales, and {{promotion}} of the retail game, while Harmonix handled the digital content and sales. Mad Catz developed updated guitar and drum controllers for Rock Band 4; the company noted that while it {{did not want to}} [...] "reinvent the wheel", the controllers still featured technical improvements, such as reduced wireless latency and a more sensitive <b>tilt</b> <b>sensor</b> on the guitar. Guitars feature switches that have much longer lifetimes compared to previous controllers, while the drum controller included reinforced pads to prevent damage to the sensor, and includes a double-bass kick setup out of the box. The drum kit can be expanded with an optional set of three hit-sensitive pads that act as cymbals, which allow the player to use the game's [...] "Pro Drum" [...] mode as introduced in Rock Band 3; in this mode, certain gems will be marked as cymbal hits instead of drum hits, requiring the player to make that distinction to score points. The microphone had also been redesigned, and is able to sample at a higher rate to help with the vocal improvisation sections. [...] At PAX East, a special Penny Arcade-themed guitar with artwork of Gabe was made available as a limited edition exclusive.|$|E
2500|$|The SSP {{contained}} {{a number of}} sensors designed to determine the physical properties of Titan's surface {{at the point of}} impact, whether the surface was solid or liquid. An acoustic sounder, activated during the last 100 meters of the descent, continuously determined the distance to the surface, measuring the rate of descent and the surface roughness (e.g., due to waves). The instrument was designed so that if the surface were liquid, the sounder would measure the speed of sound in the [...] "ocean" [...] and possibly also the subsurface structure (depth). During descent, measurements of the speed of sound gave information on atmospheric composition and temperature, and an accelerometer recorded the deceleration profile at impact, indicating the hardness and structure of the surface. A <b>tilt</b> <b>sensor</b> measured pendulum motion during the descent and was also designed to indicate the probe's attitude after landing and show any motion due to waves. If the surface had been liquid, other sensors would also have measured its density, temperature, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, electrical properties (permittivity and conductivity) and refractive index (using a critical angle refractometer). [...] A penetrometer instrument, that protruded 55mm past the bottom of the Huygens descent module, was used to create a penetrometer trace as Huygens landed on the surface by measuring the force exerted on the instrument by the surface as the instrument broke though the surface and was pushed down into the planet by the force of the probe landing itself. [...] The trace shows this force as a function of time over a period of about 400 ms. [...] The trace has an initial spike which suggests that the instrument hit one of the icy pebbles [...] on the surface photographed by the DISR camera.|$|E

Pitch and roll are measured using two identical heat transfer based <b>tilt</b> <b>sensors</b> while yaw {{is derived from}} an original electromechanical compass.

Contrary to systems based on gyroscopes, the proposed device outputs the absolute values of the three Euler's angles. All sensors (i. e. the magnetometers, the thermal <b>tilt</b> <b>sensors,</b> and the z-axis accelerometer) are fabricated simultaneously using a cheap one-step auto-aligned post process (Front Side Bulk Micromachining), thus addressing consumer markets for very low-cost applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{laboratory}} evaluation of three types of electrolytic <b>tilt</b> <b>sensors</b> as potential candidates for model attitude or angle of attack (AOA) measurements in wind tunnel tests are presented. Their performance was also compared with that from typical servo accelerometers used for AOA measurements.

Compared with the servo accelerometer, their accuracies are about one order of magnitude worse and each of them cost about two-thirds less. Therefore, the sensors are unsuitable for AOA measurements although they are less expensive. However, the potential for other applications exists where the errors resulting from roll interaction, vibration, and response time are less, and sensor temperature can be controlled...|$|R
