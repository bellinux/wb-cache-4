5|$|After 1485, the Duchy {{took the}} castle back into direct control, and by 1546 {{it was in}} poor repair.

5|$|The {{chemicals}} in the red-colored zone include an aromatic quinone, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. The quinone is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought <b>to</b> <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular DNA repair following exposure of the organism to UV-damage, such radiation protectants are often found in lichens and in extremophilic situations and are essential for survival.|$|E
5|$|Although some {{scholars}} mention {{a possibility of}} future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue <b>to</b> <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world. English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world. Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} nineteenth century, Megalosaurus {{was seen as}} the typical {{carnivorous}} dinosaur. If remains were found that were not deemed sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate genus, often single teeth, these were classified under Megalosaurus, which thus began <b>to</b> <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> wastebasket taxon, a sort of default genus. Eventually, Megalosaurus contained more species than any other non-avian dinosaur genus, most of them of dubious validity. During the twentieth century, this practice was gradually discontinued; but scientists discovering theropods that had been mistakenly classified under a different animal group in older literature, still felt themselves forced to rename them, again choosing Megalosaurus as the default generic name.|$|E

5|$|Early in the Second World War, a German bomber {{destroyed}} {{much of the}} captain's quarters, {{forcing the}} incumbent, William Birdwood, to move to Hampton Court Palace. Two 6-inch naval guns were mounted {{in front of the}} castle between 1940 and 1944, manned by 337 Battery of 563 Coast Regiment. The castle operated as a Battery Operating Post– one of the first-floor rooms in the keep became the Battery Office— and provided accommodation. In 1951, the castle officially ceased <b>to</b> <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> residence and was passed to the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works. Restoration work was carried out during the 1950s, largely removing the remaining 18th-century modifications on the seaward side of the castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1381 the Peasants' Revolt {{broke out}} in England, during which Gaunt was {{targeted}} by the rebels as an especially hated member of the administration.

Nations may hold {{a portion of their}} reserves as deposits with the institution. It also serves as a forum for central bank cooperation and research on international monetary and financial matters. The BIS also operates as a general trustee and facilitator of financial settlements between nations.|$|E

5|$|In July and August, the 9th Armoured Brigade {{worked in}} support of the 4th and 10th Indian Infantry Divisions in the central {{mountains}} south east of Florence, on the approach to the Gothic Line. In August, the order was received that all men with over 4½ years service overseas should be repatriated, and this reduced the regiment's strength by half. This made it impossible <b>to</b> <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fighting unit and it was withdrawn from the line of battle. In October 1944, the regiment returned to England to train replacements for armoured regiments still fighting in Europe. It continued in this role until 1946, although the pace slowed after victory in Europe in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya, which {{contains}} {{the tomb of}} Amir Taybars, was built in 1309. Originally intended <b>to</b> <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> complementary mosque to al-Azhar it has since been integrated {{with the rest of}} the mosque. The Maliki and Shāfi‘ī madh'hab were studied in this madrasa, though it now is used to hold manuscripts from the library. The only surviving piece from the original is the qibla wall and its polychrome mihrab. Al-Maqrizi reported that the madrasa was used only for studying the Shāfi‘ī while the historian Ibn Duqmaq reported that one of the liwans in the madrasa was reserved for Shāfi‘ī teachings while the other was for Maliki teachings.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was no longer}} regarded as being adequate <b>to</b> <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> courthouse by 1840, during the Government of Sir Henry Bouverie, and that year the Civil Courts were moved to Auberge d'Auvergne.

5|$|The low {{concentration}} of calcium in the cytosol allows calcium ions <b>to</b> <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> second messenger in calcium signaling. Here, a signal {{such as a}} hormone or an action potential opens calcium channels so that calcium floods into the cytosol. This sudden increase in cytosolic calcium activates other signalling molecules, such as calmodulin and protein kinase C. Other ions such as chloride and potassium may also have signaling functions in the cytosol, {{but these are not}} well understood.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} role of EFS as a CAS-family member function is transmission of integrin-initiated signals from the extracellular matrix to downstream effectors, leading to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and changes in motility and invasion. The SH3 domain {{is a point of}} contact with polyproline sequences on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). or the related kinase PTK2B, also known as RAFTK/Pyk2/CAKβ. Typically, phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of CAS proteins by FAK or PTK2B creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of a SRC-family protein, which then hyper-phosphorylates the substrate domain, allowing the CAS protein <b>to</b> <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> scaffold for other proteins including CRK proteins and C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAP1. PTP-PEST, a soluble protein tyrosine phosphatase that is ubiquitously expressed in mice both during embryonic development and in adult tissues, opposes FAK and PTK2B activity, as it dephosphorylates PTK2B, FAK and CAS family members, among other proteins. The PTP-PEST proline-rich sequence 332PPKPPR337 has been shown to interact directly with the SH3 domain of members of EFS and another CAS protein, NEDD9.|$|E
5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with victuals (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The casks used for storage on the Mary Rose have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, {{the wreck of the}} Mary Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master carpenter's chest, for example, contained a backgammon set, a book, three plates, a sundial, and a tankard, goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.|$|E
