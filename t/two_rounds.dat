5|$|The first <b>two</b> <b>rounds</b> {{were played}} Thursday {{and the final}} <b>two</b> <b>rounds</b> on Friday. Strong's fine results in the first <b>two</b> <b>rounds</b> put him on 149, tied for second place with Ray, two strokes behind the second round leader, Vardon, who stood at 147. Strong's play was {{remarkable}} for its steadiness, rather than any particular brilliancy, as he methodically hit fairways and greens and seldom found himself in trouble. Strong beat or tied eventual winner Francis Ouimet in rounds 1, 2 and 4. A disappointing third round 82, however, ruined any chance he had to win the tournament and he would eventually finish on 310, +18 to par, for a ninth-place finish. He won $40 as {{his share of the}} purse.|$|E
