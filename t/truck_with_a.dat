5|$|Preparations {{began in}} January, with Madonna {{saying that the}} {{rehearsal}} was the most exhausting one {{in which she had}} ever participated. Costumes were designed by Riccardo Tisci, Givenchy, Miu Miu and Prada. The performance required 500 outfits, including customized costumes for the musical guests and assisting performers. The production team was allotted seven minutes to set up the stage, 12 minutes for the performance and eight minutes to take down the stage. The modular structure was assembled from a <b>truck,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large white fabric in front as media screens for Moment Factory. Projection mapping was used by video-hardware manufacturer Barco, with films modified for the spectators and the television audience. The stadium was equipped with Sharpys lighting arrangements from Clay Paky, and the show used Sennheiser sound equipment.|$|E
25|$|The museum then rescued {{the body}} as a {{potential}} restoration project, moving it to the museum in 1989. Returning it to 1920s closed top condition, the reconstructed lower deck was mounted on a refurbished second hand Peckham P35 <b>truck,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new upper deck built from scratch. The restored tram entered service in July 2003. Following another overhaul, it returned to service in December 2014.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} field of {{evolutionary}} biology, the concept of a fitness landscape has also gained importance in evolutionary optimization methods such as genetic algorithms or evolution strategies. In evolutionary optimization, one tries to solve real-world problems (e.g., engineering or logistics problems) by imitating the dynamics of biological evolution. For example, a delivery <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> number of destination addresses can take a large variety of different routes, but only very few will result in a short driving time.|$|E

25|$|Some heavy armored {{fighting}} {{vehicles were}} obtained, notably British Cromwell tanks (150 {{provided by the}} United Kingdom) and captured German tanks (44, of which 12 were Panthers). The 12th Regiment of Dragoons received 12 Cavalier tanks among other British equipment in April 1945. In other cases, FFI units used vehicles no longer favored by Allied forces, such as the U.S. M6 Fargo, a light <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> portee 37mm antitank gun. Finally, civilian vehicles and practically anything else in running condition were pressed into service and used until {{they could no longer}} be maintained.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, Tornado GR4 strike {{aircraft}} of No. 2 Squadron RAF began flying armed sorties over Iraq {{in support of}} Operation Shader, the UK's contribution to the Military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. On September 30, the aircraft flew their first bombing raids, engaging a heavy artillery position with a Paveway IV laser-guided bomb and an armed pickup <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Brimstone air-to-ground missile. Brimstone is the preferred weapon {{for these kinds of}} targets because it is the only air-launched low-fragmentation fire-and-forget weapon that is effective against moving targets that the allied inventory possesses.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August 2016, U.S. crewed and uncrewed {{aircraft}} {{carried out}} airstrikes on IS targets in Libya, {{responding to the}} U.N.-backed government's request to help push the militants from their former stronghold of Sirte (where several hundred IS fighters remain), in what U.S. officials described as {{the start of a}} sustained campaign against the extremist group in the city. President Barack Obama authorized the airstrikes after a recommendation by U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter; the strikes hit an IS tank and two vehicles that posed a threat to forces aligned with Libyan GNA (Government of National Accord). This was the third U.S. air strike against Islamic State militants in Libya, but this time U.S. officials said it marked the start of a sustained air campaign rather than another isolated strike, U.S. airstrikes will continue to target ISIL in Sirte in order to enable the GNA to make a decisive, strategic advance. U.S. AFRICOM command is overseeing the US effort, which is known as Operation Odyssey Lightning, AV-8B Harrier II assigned to the 22nd MEU flying off the USS Wasp conducted the airstrikes and uncrewed aircraft launched from undisclosed locations. Airstrikes continued, on 2 August, airstrikes hit a rocket launcher, an excavator and a pickup <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mounted recoilless rifle and on 3 August airstrikes struck a pickup <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mounted recoilless rifle; by 9 August the U.S. conducted 28 strikes against ISIS in Libya, with {{more than half of the}} strikes being conducted from uncrewed aircraft. By 16 August, U.S. airstrikes hit an IS vehicle and 4 militant positions in Sirte, bringing the number of U.S. airstrikes in Libya to 48. On 17 August, U.S. Africa Command officials announced on 16 August airstrikes on ISIS targets in Sirte struck 7 enemy fighting positions, 4 vehicle-borne bombs, 1 pickup <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mounted recoilless rifle, 12 enemy fighting positions and 1 command-and-control vehicle, bringing the total number of airstrikes in support of Operation Odyssey Lightning to 57. On 22 August, Stars and Stripes reported that U.S. Marine AH-1W SuperCobra helicopters participated in strikes against IS militants in Sirte on 20 and 21 August; a small detachment of US special forces in Sirte provided most of the targeting information for the airstrikes which were then relayed to U.S. forces through Libyan government troops. On 31 August, Stars and Stripes reported that in the past month, the U.S. military conducted 104 airstrikes against IS targets in Libya.|$|E

25|$|Velásquez began {{assisting}} {{his parents}} in the fields when he was four years old. His family traveled from the Southwest to Midwest each year, following the harvest season for various crops. They rode with other migrant workers in a pickup <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> canvas-covered bed, huddling around a can of hot ashes and covering themselves in blankets to stay warm. Often, the family would have only a single room for the parents and all their children. One winter, he and his siblings had gathered together for warmth while snow drifted into their one-room shack through gaps in the walls. The family's poverty worsened one year when an employer paid his father only half the wages he was owed. In 1954, his parents settled permanently in Gilboa, Ohio, where they worked in the fields {{in the summer and}} in a cannery during the winter. Baldemar knew almost no English when he entered the first grade, and struggled academically. He was a good athlete, playing several sports, but was often ridiculed for his Mexican American heritage. Velásquez led his first strike at the age of 12, helping pickers at his summer job win better wages. He began to excel in his studies in the eighth grade, making honor roll. He attended Pandora-Gilboa High School, where he participated in baseball, basketball, football, and track and field, and took college preparatory courses. His high school career guidance counselor advised him to only focus on industrial arts courses, but Velásquez refused.|$|E
500|$|Penalties {{for violating}} weight limits vary between states (bridge formula weight {{violations}} {{are treated as}} gross weight violations), as the states are responsible for enforcement and collection of fines. Some states, such as Connecticut, issue fines on a percentage basis (e.g. 20% overweight at $10 per [...] ), which means larger trucks pay higher fines. For example, a <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> legal gross limit of [...] that violates the limit by [...] would pay a fine of $500, while a <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> legal gross limit of [...] that violates the limit by 5,000pounds would pay a fine of $250. Other states, such as New York, issue fines on a per-pound basis (e.g., 5,000pounds overweight equals a $300 fine). Others, such as Massachusetts, impose a less complicated fine schedule whereby a vehicle that violates the limits by less than [...] is fined $40 per , while a violation over [...] pays $80 per [...] (e.g. [...] overweight equals a $200 fine).|$|E
500|$|The {{half-life}} of La-140 is 40.224 hours; it undergoes {{beta decay}} to stable cerium-140. It was prepared from barium-140, a common fission product {{isolated from the}} spent fuel from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory X-10 Graphite Reactor, and later, after 1948, also from the Hanford Site plutonium-239 producing nuclear reactors. Barium was isolated in a purpose-built hot laboratory in Oak Ridge and shipped in a lead pig to Los Alamos, where {{it was used to}} extract lanthanum. The Oak Ridge laboratory was the first laboratory where remote manipulators were used for work with radioactive materials.

500|$|After {{finding a}} shotgun in the farmhouse, they shoot the leprechaun several times. [...] When this has no effect, {{they attempt to}} flee the farm, but their truck's engine has been sabotaged by the leprechaun. After ramming the <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> go-kart, the leprechaun terrorizes the group until Ozzie reveals that he and Alex found the pot of gold. Tory recovers the bag from the well and gives it to the leprechaun. Believing the worst to be over, they leave for the hospital. While {{counting}} his gold, the leprechaun discovers that he is missing the gold piece Ozzie swallowed. Thinking that they have tricked him, he menaces them until Ozzie tells them about O'Grady, who {{was taken to a}} nursing home after his stroke.

Spinney returns with the Jeep, telling the others his friends are all dead. The Jeep hits another spike left in the ground, and Spinney is killed when he leaves the Jeep after dark. Moore and the agents are engulfed by the insects, which enter the vehicle through the air conditioning. They are found soon after and brought to a quarantined facility in Winthrop, Washington, {{where one of the}} scientists tells Mulder that the forest is being bombarded with pesticides and controlled fire in the hopes of eradicating the insects. Mulder asks the scientist what will happen if the efforts fail, but is simply told [...] "that is not an option." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} was the [...] "I Quit" [...] {{match for the}} WWE Championship, in which John Cena defended his title against JBL. Cena {{came out on the}} flatbed of a semi <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> DJ on a {{turntable}} mixing his theme song. During the match, both Cena and JBL were able to get in offense. One part of the match saw Cena backdrop JBL through the announce table. Shortly after, JBL hit Cena with a steel chair which caused Cena to bleed from his forehead. Back in the ring, JBL hit Cena with a Clothesline from Hell thrice. Cena later hit JBL with a Five Knuckle Shuffle and a FU. Later in the match, up the ramp area, Cena threw JBL face first through a television monitor. The match ended when JBL said [...] "I quit", as Cena prepared to hit him with an exhaust pipe, which came from the semi truck that was at the ramp area. As a result, Cena retained the WWE Championship. Despite the match being over, Cena then hit JBL with the exhaust pipe. Because of the amount of blood Cena lost, the pay-per-view was rated TV-MA on WWE Network On Demand.|$|E

500|$|Tom Dowd {{produced}} At Fillmore East; he {{had previously}} worked on their second studio album, Idlewild South. He had recently returned from Africa from working on the film Soul to Soul, and stayed in New York several days to oversee the live recording. [...] "It was a good <b>truck,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 16-track machine and a great, tough-as-nails staff {{who took care of}} business," [...] recalled Dowd. He gave the staff suggestions and noted the band had two lead guitarists and two drummers, [...] "which was unusual, and it took some foresight to properly capture the dynamics." [...] Things went smoothly until the band unexpectedly brought out saxophonist Rudolph [...] "Juicy" [...] Carter, an unknown horn player, and longstanding [...] "unofficial" [...] band member Thom Doucette on harmonica. [...] "I was just hoping we could isolate them, so we could wipe them and use the songs, but they started playing and the horns were leaking all over everything, rendering the songs unusable," [...] said Dowd. He rushed to Duane during the break to tell him to cut the horn players; while Duane loved the players, he put up no fight with Dowd. The final show was delayed because of a bomb scare, and did not end until 6 am.|$|E
500|$|... 1951 was the 50th {{anniversary of}} the fire department, and so the village held a week-long celebration {{beginning}} on July 1, 1950 with a morning service at the Briarcliff Congregational Church, a band concert at Law Park, and a Fourth of July parade with 5,500 spectators, with a march led by Fred Messinger, followed by eight ex-chiefs. The parade included Scarborough's first fire engine (the red hand-pumped 1901 truck), many bands, and twelve fire departments from Westchester County municipalities. The ex-chief's dinner that evening drew 85 guests. In that year, {{it was noted that}} there were not yet any resident deaths from fires within village boundaries. In the late 1950s, Edna O'Brien was the first; trapped in her house and surrounded by intense flames. In 1955, the department purchased a new pumper and a Mack hook-and-ladder <b>truck</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 75ft. ladder for $40,000 ($ in [...] ). Also in the mid 1950s, a new firehouse was decidedly needed, and more urgently when the weight of the then-new pumper and ladder trucks ruptured the municipal building's floor. For five years, the equipment was housed in Briarcliff and Ossining garages until late 1963, when the new firehouse and municipal offices building was completed. Also in the 1950s, additional sirens were installed for firemen outside of the central siren's range, both on Schrade and at the intersection of Long Hill and Scarborough roads, replacing a siren at Scarborough Presbyterian. During the 1960s the old municipal building's cupola bell, which the department used as a fire bell and which had tolled {{at the end of the}} World Wars, was moved to the front of the new firehouse.|$|E
500|$|The next {{development}} was {{the introduction of}} surface milling, which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year. Once an area had been drained, all vegetation {{was removed from the}} surface, and a thin layer of peat was removed by a mechanical harvester. It was stockpiled on the moors, and later loaded into wagons by a Hymec loader, to be bagged at the works. Most peat by this time was used for compost or in growbags. The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods, and the mesh-sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it. A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun, but by 1989, solid steel wagons were being fabricated, reusing the frames from the original wagons. All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990, with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards. Trains of the new wagons were much heavier, particularly when loaded with milled peat, and the existing locomotives were inadequate. Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives, and three machines were ordered from Schöma of Germany. Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990, and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991. Each consisted of a CHL-60G master unit, rated at [...] with a bonnet and cab, and a CHL-60T slave unit, looking more like a flat-bed <b>truck,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> second hydraulic motor. They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced, with the four-axle arrangement ensuring that the axle loading was low enough for the existing track, and they were very popular with their operators. By the late 1990s, they were wearing out, and enquiries were made, with a view to purchasing replacements. Alan Keef designed a Bo-Bo locomotive for use on the moors, but the cost was too great, and the company rebuilt two of the Schoma locomotive and slave units. The work included replacing the original 5-cylinder engines with 6-cylinder models, improving the sanding gear and driver's seating arrangements, and fitting a more reliable air-conditioning system for the cab. Lack of funds prevented the third Schoma being upgraded. They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005, and on Hatfield Moors until 2006. They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased, and were still there in 2008.|$|E
