25|$|Nuclear {{chemistry}} {{is the study}} of how subatomic particles come <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> nuclei. Modern Transmutation is a large component of nuclear chemistry, and the table of nuclides is an important result and tool for this field.|$|E
25|$|The first solid {{particles}} were microscopic in size. These particles orbited the Sun {{in nearly}} circular orbits {{right next to}} each other, as the gas from which they condensed. Gradually the gentle collisions allowed the flakes to stick <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> larger particles which, in turn, attracted more solid particles towards them. This process is known as accretion.|$|E

25|$|Apple has {{publicly}} asserted that NBC would only renew their contract if Apple {{agreed to a}} price increase of US$4.99 per episode, which they did not. NBC disputes that claim, claiming that Apple balked at NBC's request to package shows <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> wholesale pricing more flexible. NBC claims that they never asked to double the wholesale price and insisted that their shows would be sold by iTunes Store through early December. Other networks who sell their shows via iTunes did not follow suit. On December 1, 2007, NBC shows were pulled from iTunes Store.|$|E
25|$|DIBL and VT roll off: Because of the short-channel effect, channel {{formation}} {{is not entirely}} done by the gate, but now the drain and source also affect the channel formation. As the channel length decreases, the depletion regions of the source and drain come closer <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> the threshold voltage (VT) {{a function of the}} length of the channel. This is called VT roll-off. VT also becomes function of drain to source voltage VDS. As we increase the VDS, the depletion regions increase in size, and a considerable amount of charge is depleted by the VDS. The gate voltage required to form the channel is then lowered, and thus, the VT decreases with an increase in VDS. This effect is called drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL).|$|E
25|$|When Rick becomes {{involved}} with Steffy (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) in 2009, Ridge experiences anxiety and sleeps with Taylor after consuming pills. Ridge leaves Brooke and nearly marries Taylor, but returns to Brooke shortly after. In 2010, Taylor marries Whipple Jones III (Rick Hearst). That year, she purchases 25% of Forrester Creations worth $50 million, and when Steffy is fired by Ridge, Taylor signs over these shares to her daughter. In 2011, Whip and Taylor's marriage ends when he realizes she still loves Ridge. Stephanie and Thomas lie about Thomas sleeping with Brooke {{on an island}} they were stranded on. As a result, Ridge and Taylor get back <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it to the altar, but Stephanie confesses the truth, and Ridge reunites with Brooke. Taylor later begins romancing Thorne again, and exerts her power as trustee of Forrester Creations. In 2012, Taylor counsels Brooke's sister Katie Logan Spencer (Heather Tom) who is suffering from postnatal depression. Taylor says goodbye to best friend Stephanie before she dies from lung cancer. In 2013, Thomas loses out on the top position at Forrester Creations to Rick and wants to leave town; Taylor persuades Eric Forrester (John McCook) to help Thomas. Soon, Taylor and Eric become romantically involved and she moves into the Forrester mansion. Taylor discovers that Brooke slept with Katie's husband Bill Spencer, Jr. (Don Diamont) {{which resulted in a}} pregnancy (and miscarriage). Taylor reveals Brooke's secret at her birthday party in front of everyone, and abruptly leaves town afterward. In 2014, Taylor is now living Paris and has reunited with Thorne. The couple return to Los Angeles, but Aly (Ashlyn Pearce), now a teenager, heavily disapproves. Aly forgives Taylor for Darla's death and Taylor and Thorne return to Paris. After few months, Taylor returns to Los Angeles to visit some patients and tells Eric that she and Thorne broke up.|$|E

The village is situated on the 'High Suffolk' claylands, deposited on the Ice Ages over the chalk that underlies most of the county. This makes the area good for arable farming, because the clay binds the soil <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> it less prone to erosion.|$|R
5000|$|In a club deal, the {{investor}} group of private equity firms pools its assets <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> the acquisition collectively. The practice has allowed private equity to purchase {{larger and more}} expensive companies than each firm could acquire through its own private equity funds. By syndicating the equity ownership across a group of investment firms, each firm reduces its concentration {{and is able to}} maintain the diversification of its portfolio of investments.|$|R
500|$|After the {{unpleasant}} recording sessions {{for the proposed}} Get Back album (ultimately released in 1970 as Let It Be), Paul McCartney suggested to music producer George Martin that the group get <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> an album [...] "the way {{we used to do}} it", free of the conflict that had begun following the death of Brian Epstein and carried over to the sessions for the White Album. Martin agreed, but on the strict condition that all the group – particularly John Lennon – allow him to produce the record {{in the same manner as}} earlier albums and that discipline would be adhered to.|$|E
500|$|A {{month after}} the European tour concluded, the band {{embarked}} on its two-leg 2000 North American tour. On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said that [...] "playing, facing crowds, being together—it enabled us to start processing it." [...] On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Vedder {{took the opportunity to}} thank the many people who had helped the band come <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it to ten years. He noted that [...] "I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something." [...] After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released Touring Band 2000 the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.|$|E

If him and Greg and I can just stay <b>together,</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> sure we either all avoid or either all get in the same wrecks, then we'll probably be all right." [...] Earnhardt said he aimed to achieve his sixth victory at Talladega Superspeedway (where he had {{a large amount of}} fan support) in an effort to move ahead in the championship standings. Gordon, who had not won so far during 2008, felt that he could win the race, and employed a strategy where he would attempt to avoid being caught up in a multi-car collision. Johnson felt the AMP Energy 500 would be [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "a turning point in the chase".|$|E

He noted that [...] "I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something." [...] The tour's final night took place on November 6, 2000, in Seattle, Washington at KeyArena where the band performed for more than three hours. The European and North American tours were documented by a long series of official bootlegs, all of which were available in record stores as well as through the band's fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the Billboard 200 at the same time. Following the conclusion of the 2000 tour, the band released Touring Band 2000, a DVD which featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.|$|E
500|$|Fantasy Black Channels track listing and UK CD {{release date}} of 11 August 2008 were {{confirmed}} on 11 June. Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where {{they wanted to go}} on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it sound like one piece.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with reporters on August 21, 2012, Daniels {{announced}} that this would be the final season of the series. Daniels said, [...] "This year feels like the last chance to really go out <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> an artistic ending for the show that pays off {{a lot of the stuff}} that matters most to fans." [...] Daniels also said all the questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming it for so long, as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E

500|$|Burnley is {{the primary}} {{songwriter}} in the band. Music industry attorney and author Martin Frascogna writes that [...] "it's unmistakably clear that Burnley started the group, is the creative force behind the group and essentially dictates the group's decisions." [...] Bands such as Nirvana, Live, Bush, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Beatles have been cited as influences. Burnley remarked in 2009 that while the other band members did contribute, it was [...] "always left {{up to me to}} put all the pieces <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it so that it's even anything at all." [...] However, Burnley expressed how he considered Rauch to be his [...] "writing partner" [...] during Dear Agony, and that he looked forward to writing with him in the future. After joining the band in 2014 as part of the new lineup, Rauch provided writing contributions on Dark Before Dawn, writing the intro and outro tracks as well as riffs on two other tracks. Burnley revealed in 2015 that the whole band would write songs for Breaking Benjamin in the future, and that [...] "It just so happens that when they came on board for this album, I was already 95 percent done", adding, [...] "I'm really looking forward to writing the next one all together." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] {{garnered}} {{very positive}} reviews from most music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine for Allmusic was complimentary of the pop song, writing {{that it is}} [...] "giddy" [...] and [...] "delirious". Chris Younie for 4Music wrote that Aguilera is [...] "ramping up the romance and sexual energy" [...] on [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", which will make the listener {{need to take a}} cold shower. He also wrote that the listener should expect to hear [...] "lots of 'oooh', 'aah', and 'la la la' in her usual Mariah Carey-shrilling manner." [...] Sam Hine for Popjustice described the song as [...] "a welcome blast of upbeat pop following the rather serious start to the album. There are lots of good [...] "oooh" [...] "lalala" [...] hooky bits that all fit <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> a for an enjoyable listen." [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard described it as the [...] "standout song on Lotus" [...] which sees her [...] "at her most relaxed and playful." [...] He also noted that Secon's production takes [...] "precedence" [...] on the song. Annie Zaleski for The A.V. Club called it a [...] "dancehall-tinged, vibrant party jam," [...] while Sarah Rodman for The Boston Globe named it a [...] "kooky horn-and-yodel fest". Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "care-free" [...] and [...] "a bit cheeky." [...] Sarah Godfrey for The Washington Post praised Aguilera for sounding more like herself on the [...] "frenzied" [...] track. Jim Farber for Daily News wrote that [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] contains [...] "a can't-miss gimmick of a chorus". He also wrote that Aguilera [...] "hits the clubs in horny revenge." ...|$|E

A lot of the credit goes to the real comic ability of Telly Savalas (the best of the three would-be fathers) and Shelley Winters, who plays Phil Silvers' wife.

It has strong connections with natural language processing. NLP has produced technologies that teach computers natural language {{so that they may}} analyze, understand and even generate text. Topic tracking is one of the technologies that has been developed and can be used in the text mining process. The main purpose of topic tracking is to identify and follow events presented in multiple news sources, including newswires, radio and TV broadcasts. It collects dispersed information <b>together</b> <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> it easy for user to get a general understanding. In this paper, a survey of recent topic tracking techniques is presented...|$|R
