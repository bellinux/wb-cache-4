2500|$|Like Hollandaise sauce, {{there are}} several methods for the {{preparation}} of Béarnaise sauce. The most common preparation is a bain-marie method where a reduction of vinegar is used <b>to</b> <b>acidulate</b> the yolks. Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns (later strained out), with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice. [...] Others are similar. [...] Alternatively, the flavorings may be added to a finished Hollandaise (sans lemon juice). Joy of Cooking describes a blender preparation with the same ingredients. [...] A faux Béarnaise can be produced by adding capers and tarragon to a Hollandaise.|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the anticariogenic effect of {{acidulate}} solutions with low NaF concentration, using pH-cycling model and bovine enamel. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Enamel blocks were submitted to the surface microhardness (SMH) test and randomly divided in 12 experimental and one placebo groups. The blocks were submitted to pH cycling for 7 days, with daily applications once/day of 0. 05 % NaF and 0. 1 % NaF and twice/day of 0. 02 % NaF solutions. Four different pH: 4. 0, 5. 0, 6. 0 and 7. 0 were used. Next, SMH test was again used to determine the surface microhardness percentage change (%SMH). Data obtained for %SMH were homogeneous and passed through variance analyses and Tukey's test (5 %) as far as fluoride concentrations and pH. RESULTS:The results showed that pH influenced %SMH in 0. 02 % NaF and 0. 05 % NaF solutions with pH 4. 0, which had less mineral loss compared to pH 7. 0 (p 0. 05). A dose-response relationship was observed among the tested solutions, with better anticariogenic effect for the 0. 1 % NaF solution. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the addition of citric acid <b>to</b> <b>acidulate</b> mouth rinses reduce mineral loss...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} streptococci in milk is the cow's udder. The udder streptococci {{fall into two}} broad groups; those of the larger group agree in cultural characters and agglutination affinities with mastitis streptococci; the smaller group is composed of low acid-producing streptococci. The streptococci of the latter group produce clear zones of hemolysis about surface and deep colonies in horse blood agar plates. They attack dextrose, lactose, saccharose, and maltose, but do not ferment raffinose, inulin, mannite, or salicin. Acid production in dextrose {{by the members of}} this group is about the same as that produced by human streptococci under the same conditions. The limiting hydrogen ion concentration for these pleomorphic udder streptococci in dextrose serum bouillon is within the limits of the limiting hydrogen ion concentration observed by Avery and Cullen for human streptococci. All the streptococci from the vagina, saliva, skin, and feces have been non-hemolytic. Those from the saliva form a heterogeneous aggregation in which individuals fermenting raffinose, inulin, and mannite predominate. From the skin a characteristic streptococcus has been found. It produces acid in dextrose, lactose, saccharose, maltose, raffinose, mannite, and salicin, but fails <b>to</b> <b>acidulate</b> media containing inulin. The fecal streptococci are characterized by the formation of large amounts of acid in dextrose, lactose, saccharose, maltose, raffinose, inulin, and salicin. Mannite is not fermented. Neither the fecal nor the skin streptococci have been isolated from the bottled milk with any great frequency...|$|E
