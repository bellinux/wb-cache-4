A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below tantalum in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> dubnium.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Np and atomic number 93. A radioactive actinide metal, neptunium {{is the first}} <b>transuranic</b> <b>element.</b> Its position in the periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to it being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus. A neptunium atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons, of which seven are valence electrons. Neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air. The element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states, ranging from +3 to +7. It is radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lr (formerly Lw) and atomic number 103. It is {{named in honor}} of Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron, a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements. A radioactive metal, lawrencium is the eleventh <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> and is also the final member of the actinide series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Twelve isotopes of lawrencium are currently known; the most stable is 266Lr with a half-life of 11hours, but the shorter-lived 260Lr (half-life 2.7minutes) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new smoke detector is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E

5|$|Mendelevium was {{the ninth}} <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> to be {{synthesized}}. It was first synthesized by Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, Gregory Robert Choppin, Bernard G. Harvey, and team leader Stanley G. Thompson in early 1955 at the University of California, Berkeley. The team produced 256Md (half-life of 77 minutes) when they bombarded an 253Es target consisting {{of only a}} billion (109) einsteinium atoms with alpha particles (helium nuclei) in the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory's 60-inch cyclotron, thus increasing the target's atomic number by two. 256Md thus became the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time. In total, seventeen mendelevium atoms were produced. This discovery {{was part of a}} program, begun in 1952, that irradiated plutonium with neutrons to transmute it into heavier actinides. This method was necessary as the previous method used to synthesize transuranic elements, neutron capture, could not work {{because of a lack of}} known beta decaying isotopes of fermium that would produce isotopes of the next element, mendelevium, and also due to the very short half-life to spontaneous fission of 258Fm that thus constituted a hard limit to the success of the neutron capture process.|$|E
25|$|Einsteinium is a {{metallic}} synthetic element. On the periodic table, it {{is represented by}} the symbol Es and atomic number 99.

25|$|Curium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with the symbol Cm and atomic number 96. A radioactive metallic <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> of the actinide series, curium {{is produced by}} bombarding plutonium with alpha particles (helium ions) and was named after Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie.

A metallic radioactive <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> of the actinides, mendelevium is usually synthesized by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles {{and was named}} after the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, {{who was responsible for}} the Periodic Table. Mendelevium was co-discovered by Albert Ghiorso, Bernard G. Harvey, Gregory R. Choppin, Stanley G. Thompson, and Glenn T. Seaborg in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} metallic {{chemical element}} with the symbol Cf and atomic number 98. The element was first produced by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium ions) at the University of California, Berkeley. It was the sixth <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> to be synthesized. Californium {{is one of}} the highest atomic mass elements to have been produced in weighable amounts. It is named for the U.S. state of California and the University of California. Californium was co-discovered by Stanley G. Thompson, Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T. Seaborg in 1950.|$|E
25|$|The same year, his {{doctoral}} student James Chadwick discovered the neutron, which was immediately {{recognized as a}} potential tool for nuclear experimentation because of its lack of an electric charge. Experimentation with bombardment of materials with neutrons led Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie to discover induced radioactivity in 1934, which allowed the creation of radium-like elements at much less the price of natural radium. Further work by Enrico Fermi in the 1930s focused on using slow neutrons to increase the effectiveness of induced radioactivity. Experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons led Fermi to believe he had created a new, <b>transuranic</b> <b>element,</b> which was dubbed hesperium.|$|E

40|$|The fusion {{option is}} {{examined}} {{to solve the}} disposition problems of the spent nuclear fuel and the <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements.</b> The analysis of this report shows that the top rated solution, {{the elimination of the}} <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> and the long-lived fission products, can be achieved in a fusion reactor. A 167 MW of fusion power from a D-T plasma for sixty years with an availability factor of 0. 75 can transmute all the <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> and the long-lived fission products of the 70, 000 tons of the US inventory of spent nuclear fuel generated up to the year 2015. The operating time can be reduced to thirty years with use of 334 MW of fusion power, a system study is needed to define the optimum time. In addition, the fusion solution eliminates the need for a geological repository site, which is a major advantage. Meanwhile, such utilization of the fusion power will provide an excellent opportunity to develop fusion energy for the future. Fusion blankets with a liquid carrier for the <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> can achieve a transmutation rate for the <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> up to 80 kg/MW. y of fusion power with k{sub eff} of 0. 98. In addition, the liquid blankets have several advantages relative to the other blanket options. The energy from this transmutation is utilized to produce revenue for the system. Molten salt (Flibe) and lithium-lead eutectic are identified as the most promising liquids for this application, both materials are under development for future fusion blanket concepts. The Flibe molten salt with <b>transuranic</b> <b>elements</b> was developed and used successfully as nuclear fuel for the molten salt breeder reactor in the 1960 's...|$|R

500|$|McMillan had {{recently}} named the first <b>transuranic</b> <b>element</b> neptunium after the planet Neptune, {{and suggested that}} element 94, being the next element in the series, be named for what was then considered the next planet, Pluto.

Seaborg originally considered the name [...] "plutium", but later thought that it did not sound as good as [...] "plutonium". He chose the letters [...] "Pu" [...] as a joke, in reference to the interjection [...] "P U" [...] to indicate an expecially disgusting smell, which passed without notice into the periodic table. Alternative names considered by Seaborg and others were [...] "ultimium" [...] or [...] "extremium" [...] because of the erroneous belief that they had found the last possible element on the periodic table.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{long-lived}} waste. LFTRs can dramatically {{reduce the}} long-term radiotoxicity of their reactor wastes. Light water reactors with uranium fuel have fuel {{that is more}} than 95% U-238. These reactors normally transmute part of the U-238 to Pu-239, a long-lived isotope. Almost all of the fuel is therefore only one step away from becoming a transuranic long-lived element. Plutonium-239 has a half life of 24,000 years, and is the most common transuranic in spent nuclear fuel from light water reactors. Transuranics like Pu-239 cause the perception that reactor wastes are an eternal problem. In contrast, the LFTR uses the thorium fuel cycle, which transmutes thorium to U-233. Because thorium is a lighter element, more neutron captures are required to produce the transuranic elements. U-233 has two chances to fission in a LFTR. First as U-233 (90% will fission) and then the remaining 10% has another chance as it transmutes to U-235 (80% will fission). The fraction of fuel reaching neptunium-237, the most likely <b>transuranic</b> <b>element,</b> is therefore only 2%, about 15kg perGWe-year. This is a transuranic production 20x smaller than light water reactors, which produce 300kg of transuranics per GWe-year. Importantly, because of this much smaller transuranic production, {{it is much easier to}} recycle the transuranics. That is, they are sent back to the core to eventually fission. Reactors operating on the U238-plutonium fuel cycle produce far more transuranics, making full recycle difficult on both reactor neutronics and the recycling system. In the LFTR, only a fraction of a percent, as reprocessing losses, goes to the final waste. When these two benefits of lower transuranic production, and recycling, are combined, a thorium fuel cycle reduces the production of transuranic wastes by more than a thousand-fold compared to a conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactor. The only significant long-lived waste is the uranium fuel itself, but this can be used indefinitely by recycling, always generating electricity.If the thorium stage ever has to be shut down, part of the reactors can be shut down and their uranium fuel inventory burned out in the remaining reactors, allowing a burndown of even this final waste to as small a level as society demands. The LFTR does still produce radioactive fission products in its waste, but they don't last very long - the radiotoxicity of these fission products is dominated by cesium-137 and strontium-90. The longer half-life is cesium: 30.17 years. So, after 30.17 years, decay reduces the radioactivity by a half. Ten half-lives will reduce the radioactivity by two raised to a power of ten, a factor of 1,024. Fission products at that point, in about 300 years, are less radioactive than natural uranium. What's more, the liquid state of the fuel material allows separation of the fission products not only from the fuel, but from each other as well, which enables them to be sorted by the length of each fission product's half-life, so that the ones with shorter half-lives can be brought out of storage sooner than those with longer half-lives.|$|E
