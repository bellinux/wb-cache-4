But this was not the high output mine the Basinghall Mining Syndicate had seen itself running, and they announced production would cease in 1946. However, in the year to September 1946 the mine made its best profit to date, of £19,926. A steady development programme kept production constant, and with a good lead price the company was content to leave the mine open.|$|E

40|$|Sponsored Report (for Acquisition Research Program) Control {{of total}} {{ownership}} cost (TOC) {{is a continuing}} initiative to manage costs over the entire life cycle of a weapon system. There are several major categories of costs that contribute to Total Ownership Cost but the principal categories are (1) R&D, (2) Production, (3) Operating and Support, and (4) Disposal. System TOC {{is the same as}} Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and must be planned and controlled from requirements definition, system development, and sustainment''focusing on affordability, and cost to achieve required operational availability. The Program Manager (PM) is responsible for managing system TOC, with input from key stakeholders, such as the sponsor and users. This paper updates our work in 2003, addressing initiatives <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>cost,</b> congressional pressure <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>cost,</b> leadership guidance, <b>controls,</b> and incentives that can be employed to encourage emphasis on system affordability. There is some discussion of metrics <b>to</b> <b>control</b> life cycle <b>cost</b> and the requirements for databases to assist in estimating and comparing life cycle costs. The growing cost of software supportability and its impact on system TOC is also discussed, along with methodologies for reducing these costs. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|R
25|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>costs,</b> Honda {{decided not}} to include the electric-assist air {{conditioning}} compressor used in the Civic Hybrid. The Civic Hybrid's electric-assist allows the air conditioning compressor to continue running (using battery pack power) to maintain cabin temperature when the engine is shut off in Idle Stop mode. Instead, the Insight limits {{the duration of the}} Idle Stop mode during air conditioning use and restarts the engine, when needed, to maintain cabin temperature. However, when the Insight's ECON function is engaged, a longer Idle Stop time is invoked for improved fuel efficiency at the expense of rapid cabin cooling. In other words, the air conditioning stops whenever the car stops, as in stop-and-go traffic. During Idle Stop the blower continues to run albeit at a low speed.|$|E

25|$|For many years, California was {{the only}} state that did not use an exit {{numbering}} system. It was granted an exemption in the 1950s due to having an already largely completed and signed highway system; placing exit number signage across the state was deemed too expensive. <b>To</b> <b>control</b> <b>costs,</b> California began to incorporate exit numbers on its freeways in 2002—Interstate, U.S., and state routes alike. Caltrans commonly installs exit number signage only when a freeway or interchange is built, reconstructed, retrofitted, or repaired, and it is usually just tacked onto the top-right corner of an already existing sign. Newer signs along the freeways follow this practice as well. Most exits along California's Interstates now have exit number signage, particularly in rural areas. California, however, still does not use mileposts, although a few exist for experiments or for special purposes.|$|E
