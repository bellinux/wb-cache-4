50|$|<b>Tumble</b> <b>mustard</b> forms a tall (up to 5 ft) but delicate-looking plant, with slender, much-branched stems. Its stem {{leaves are}} divided into thin, linear lobes, while the basal leaves are broader and pinnately compound. The flowers are {{inconspicuous}} and only 1/4 inch wide. They have four usually yellow petals and four narrow, curved sepals. The seedpods are slender and long (2-4 inches). At maturity it dies, uproots, and tumbles in the wind, spreading its seeds.|$|E
50|$|Sisymbrium altissimum is {{a species}} of Sisymbrium. The plant is native to {{the western part of}} the Mediterranean Basin in Europe and Northern Africa and is widely {{naturalized}} throughout most of the world, including all of North America. It was probably introduced into North America by a contaminant crop seed. The plant grows in soils of all , even sand. The plant germinates in winter or early spring. The blooming time is lengthy, and after maturity the plant forms a tumbleweed. Common names of the plant include Jim Hill mustard, after James J. Hill, a Canadian-American railroad magnate, tall tumblemustard, tall mustard, <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard,</b> tumbleweed mustard, tall sisymbrium, and tall hedge mustard.|$|E

5000|$|McNab had {{tired of}} dealing with Midnight by 1920. He decided to try his luck using the horse for bucking at some nearby rodeos. In 1924, he entered Midnight in the rodeo in Calgary Stampede. Midnight was proclaimed the [...] "champion bucking horse of Western Canada." [...] During the 1920s, Midnight {{developed}} {{the reputation of being}} unrideable. Those attempting to ride him were usually thrown off in only 2 to 3 seconds. At that time, the target was to ride the horse for ten seconds. Then, in 1926, according to the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame, a cowboy who would some day be in the ProRodeo Hall of Fame rode Midnight in Montreal, Quebec. An article in the Calgary Herald also claims Pete Knight rode the horse. His name was Pete Knight. It was in the late 1920s that McNab sold Midnight to stock contractors Peter Welch and Strawberry Red Wall. The two were producers for Canadian rodeos. The pair then also acquired a smaller black horse called <b>Tumbling</b> <b>Mustard.</b> <b>Tumbling</b> <b>Mustard's</b> previous owner was a Sarcee Indian reservation. Not too long after that, the pair sold both horses to Colonel Jim Skew. Supposedly, he paid $250 for the horse but he was just [...] "too much horse" [...] for his show's riders. So, Skew turned around and sold both to producers Eddie McCarty and Vern Elliot. They hailed from Wyoming and Colorado. Verne and McCarty were a team who operated together. Verne was a notable rodeo producer and stock contractor who was inducted into ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1990. He was the last owner of the two horses.|$|R
40|$|The {{project has}} now {{completed}} two crop-years of experimentation. Four more crop-years {{are required for}} all crop rotations to complete a full cycle. This report covers the 2004 - 05 crop-year results. CBARC experiment (Moro) : Grain yields of winter wheat following fallow (conventional or chemical) produced significantly higher yields than yields of annual cropping systems involving winter wheat, spring wheat, spring barley, and winter pea following winter wheat. Downy brome populations increased in direct-seeded winter wheat, with the greatest increase in re-crop direct-seeded winter wheat. Rotation and herbicide applications were effective at reducing knotweed. Prickly lettuce and <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard</b> increased with <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard</b> increasing the most in spring crops. Root diseases caused by Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, Pythium, and root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus thornei, and P. neglectus) varied between treatments. Center of Sustainability (Heppner) : Continuous spring barley produced the highest grain yields followed by winter wheat following fallow (conventional or chemical). The lowest yield was obtained from continuous Alpowa spring wheat that was very susceptible to root-lesion nematodes. Objectives The project {{is now in the}} implementation phase. The objective of this phase is to establish and maintain long-term experiments that compare conventional wheat/fallow system with alternate cropping systems with potential crop management practices such as direct seeding that reduce wind and water erosion. Specific objectives include determining systems that • increase residue cover, • increase soil OM, • increase available soil moisture, • reduce wind and water erosion, • reduce soil water evaporation, • sustain soil productivity...|$|E
40|$|Land rolling soybean {{has become}} a common {{practice}} {{in some areas of}} northern Iowa. Land rolling pushes rocks and corn root balls down to the soil surface, improving combine harvest operations. However, land rolling field pea, barley, and summer fallow in eastern Montana essentially doubled density of several troublesome broadleaf weeds, including horseweed (also called marestail), kochia, Russian thistle, <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard,</b> prickly lettuce, and redroot pigweed. Iowa has different weed community and environments from Montana, and little is known how, or if, land rolling might influence weed community in Iowa. We conducted a replicated study on eleven Iowa farms on the influence of land rolling on soybean stand density, yield, and early-season weed density...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{interference}} of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus),downy brome (Bromus tectorum),and <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sisymbrium altissimum) with alfalfa was studied. Alfalfa was seeded {{with each}} of the four weeds on August 14 and September 15, 1981, and on April 13, 1982. Alfalfa also was seeded on August 27, 1981, with a mixture of the four weed species, and the weeds were allowed to grow with the crop during several intervals. The presence of weeds emerging with the crop in the fall reduced alfalfa yields in the first two cuttings in the spring. When alfalfa and each of the weeds were planted on August 14 (early seeding), barnyardgrass and downy brome were the most interfering weeds. In a later seeding (Sept. 15), the summer annual weeds (barnyardgrass and pigweed) were killed by frost in the fall and did not compete with the crop; downy brome and <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard</b> (winter annuals), however, became more aggressive than if allowed to emerge with the crop a month earlier. When alfalfa seeded on August 27 was kept weed free for approximately 65 days after emergence, no further weed control was needed for maximum forage yields in the spring. Conversely, the crop tolerated weeds that emerged with it if they were eliminated before the onset of winter. In the spring seedings, the four weeds interfered equally with the crop. Alfalfa needed to grow free of weeds from approximately the 17 th to the 39 th day after emergence to avoid forage yield and quality reductions. Weeds that emerged early with the crop reduced forage yields more than later-germinating weeds. Once the alfalfa developed a canopy capable of covering the soil, weeds emerging thereafter were suppressed by shading. The initial tolerance to the presence of weeds allows the farmer flexibility in the timing of the first weed control measure. This initial tolerance seems to indicate that interference is not significant until competition for light begins...|$|E
5000|$|About 3 {{years after}} retirement, Midnight died on November 5, 1936, at the Denver Rodeo. He was buried on the McCarty-Elliott Ranch in Johnstown, Colorado, originally. He was {{estimated}} to be around 20 years old. He was buried beneath a gravestone saying: [...] "Underneath this sod lies a great bucking horse. There never lived a cowboy he couldn't toss. His name was Midnight, his coat as black as coal. If there is a hoss-heaven, God please, rest his soul." [...] <b>Tumbling</b> <b>Mustard</b> was renamed to Five Minutes to Midnight. He also died on the ranch and was buried there. Later, both horses were moved and buried {{on the grounds of the}} National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Both horses were posthumously inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1979. On July 9, 1967, in recognition of Midnight, Jim McNab officially opened the Midnight Stadium in Fort MacLeod, Alberta.|$|R
40|$|Noxious weeds, {{improper}} grazing,frequent {{and intense}} wildfires, recreational activities, prolonged drought, mining, logging, and {{gas and oil}} exploration have degraded large areas within the Great Basin shrub-steppe of the western United States (Monsen andMcArthur 1995). Shrub-steppe, which is typically pop-ulated by native, perennial species, may now be dominated by exotic, weedy, annual species. For example, much of the Snake River Plains in southern Idaho is vegetated by cheat-grass (Bromus tectorum), Russian this-tle (Salsola iberica), and <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sisymbrium altissimum). Dominance by exotic annuals can dramatically influence plant commu-nity composition; alter water, nutri-ent and fire cycles; and decrease forage for wildlife and livestock (Mosley and others 1999). In many cases, Great Basin soils, and the native vegetation they sup-ported, have declined {{to the point where}} intense restoration efforts are now required to achieve a desired plant community. However, restoration of degraded shrub-steppe is challenging and fails more often than it succeed...|$|E
30|$|While the {{abundance}} of native plants at the Gillems Camp site had increased since measurements by Erhard (1979), {{there was still a}} dominance of invasive annuals such as cheat-grass and <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sisymbrium altissimum L.). Nevertheless, there was a low mortality of the native bunchgrasses and significant post-fire flowering. The removal of sheep and cattle grazing within the national monument in 1974 initiated a trend toward reestablishment of native plants in the monument, decreasing the dominance of cheatgrass that was evident in the late 1970 s (Erhard 1979). Although the reintroduction of the natural fire regime is a logical approach to the restoration of sagebrush ecosystems that have been degraded by anthropogenic disturbance, it is difficult to predict the response of the native flora to fire where there is a strong presence of highly competitive annuals. This study suggests that the native grasses should be able to persist following fire in mountain big sagebrush communities at Lava Beds National Monument, even in the more degraded areas.|$|E
40|$|Oregon {{is home to}} {{many members}} of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), native and {{non-native}} species of Cruci-fers, annual and perennial, common and rare. During the summer of 2009, while employed at the Burns District, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Harney County, I had the privilege of collecting seeds from some of Oregon’s most sensitive native mustard species. These seeds were needed for ongoing research in Switzerland, a project dedicated to finding biological control agents for use on non-native mustards classified as noxious in the Pacific Northwest. This article is the result of my independent research, prompted by my concern for one of these sensitive native species and its continued survival in Oregon. Most of Oregon’s non-native mustard species are common an-nuals we all know: yellow alyssum (Alyssum alyssoides), shepherd’s purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), field mustard (Brassica rapa), and <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sisymbrium altissimum). Others are perennials that are so invasive that the Oregon Department of Agriculture classifies them as noxious weeds: perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium), and hoary cress/white top (Lepidium draba). Biological control agents for these species must be tested {{to make sure that they}} will not damage rare native species, several of which grow in Oregon. Some of these rare species are Federally listed as Species of Concern and by the state of Oregon as Threatened. Many of Oregon’s rarest mustards are found only in the southeastern corner of the state, in remote, hard to find locations. Hairy wild cabbage (Caulanthus pilosus) is known to occur only in the Mickey Basin Hot Springs area near the Alvord Desert, while Cusick’s draba (Draba cusickii) is restricted to Steens Mountain near Kiger Gorge overlook and Rooster Comb Ridge. Thickstem wild cabbage (Caulanthus crassicaulis) grows near the Nevada-Oregon border at the northern edge of the Sheldon Nationa...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to determine the effectiveness of using targeted grazing and prescribed burning as tools to reduce fire hazards and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) dominance on rangelands in the northern Great Basin. A field study, with four grazing-burning treatments (graze and no-burn, graze and burn, no-graze and burn, and no-graze and no-burn), was conducted on a B. tectorum-dominated site near McDermitt, Nevada from 2005 - 2007. Cattle removed 80 - 90 % of standing biomass in grazed plots in May 2005 and 2006 when B. tectorum was in the boot (phenological) stage. Grazed and ungrazed plots were burned in October 2005 and 2006. Targeted grazing in May 2005 reduced B. tectorum biomass and cover, which resulted in reductions in flame length and rate of spread when plots were burned in October 2005. When grazing treatments were repeated on the same plots in May 2006, B. tectorum biomass and cover were reduced {{to the point that}} fires did not carry in grazed plots in October 2006. Fuel characteristics of the October 2005 burns were used to parameterize dry climate grass models in BehavePlus 3. 0, and simulation modeling indicated that grazing in spring (May) would reduce the potential for catastrophic fires during the peak fire season (July-August). The graze-and-burn treatment was more effective than grazing alone (graze and no-burn treatment) and burning alone (no-graze and burn treatment) in reducing B. tectorum cover, biomass, plant density, and seed density, and in shifting species composition from a community dominated by B. tectorum to one composed of a suite of species [including <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sisymbrium altissimum), clasping pepperweed (Lepidium perfoliatum), and Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda) ], with B. tectorum as a component rather than a dominant. A simulation study was designed to compare the cost-effectiveness of using cattle grazing and herbicide to create fuel breaks on B. tectorum-dominated landscapes in the northern Great Basin. Fuel characteristics from this targeted grazing study and from a Plateau® (Imazapic) herbicide study near Kuna, Idaho were used to parameterize fire behavior models and simulate flame lengths and rates of spread for the two fuel reduction treatments under peak fire conditions using BEHAVE Plus. Targeted grazing and Plateau® had similar reductions in flame length and rate of spread. Cattle grazing had high fixed costs (primarily fencing), and was more cost-effective than applications of Plateau® under five fuel loading scenarios except for three consecutive years of low fuel loads...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The {{sagebrush}} steppe ecosystem of the Columbia Plateau {{has become}} degraded {{by a long}} history of alternative land use and associated perturbations. Protection of remnant stands of intact sagebrush steppe currently relies upon their preservation within the nation's network of parks and protected-areas. The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, located in central Oregon, and Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, located in southeast Idaho provided a unique opportunity to examine the pattern of plant species distribution and invasion dynamics in two Columbia Plateau protected-area landscapes with a mixed history of alternative land management and protection. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and nonparametric multiplicative regression were applied to data from the National Park Service's Inventory and Monitoring program to investigate correlations of native and non-native plant species to environmental and landscape variables. Understanding how these patterns change at the landscape scale and identifying variation in these patterns between landscapes may improve efficacy in resource management planning. Principle native species reviewed included sagebrush species (Artemisia spp.), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), currants (Ribes spp.), desert sweet (Chamaebatiaria millefolium), dwarf goldenbush (Ericameria nana), green rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), bluegrass species (Poa spp.), sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda.), wheatgrass species (Agropyron spp.), Great Basin wildrye (Lymus cinereus), and squirreltail (Elymus elymoides). Principle non-native invasive species reviewed included cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae), and bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa), <b>tumble</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sisymbrium altissimum), and tansy mustard (Descurainia spp.). The distribution and relative cover of principle species within the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument were found correlated to combined effects of slope and aspect, representing a transition from steep south-facing slopes to steep north-facing slopes. Species cover and distribution were also found to be correlated to crop year precipitation, the amount of rain and snow falling between October and May. Individual species response along topographic gradients revealed higher relative cover of B. tectorum on the more xeric, south-facing slopes and an increase in the cover of P. spicata on more mesic, north-facing slopes. The relative cover of G. sarothrae and T. caput-medusae were found to increase with increasing crop year precipitation. The distribution and relative cover of principle species within Craters of the Moon National Monument were found correlated to a north to south spatial separation of sampling frames. This gradient represented a transition from higher elevation to lower elevation, decreasing moisture availability, and increasing proximity to alternative land use (i. e. grazing, agriculture) and transportation corridors. Individual species response along these topographic and environmental gradients revealed higher relative cover of non-native invasive species in southern portions of the monument and with positive correlation to the more xeric and disturbed portions of the Monument. The results of this study have increased the understanding of species cover distribution across environmental and topographic gradients within protected sagebrush steppe landscapes while providing insight into the applicability of resilience theory to Columbia Plateau ecology...|$|E
