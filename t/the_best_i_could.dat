25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E

In one, the cobbles are used every day by the cars, and kept up, and stuff like that. The other one— it's completely different ... <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do would be to describe it like this— they plowed a dirt road, flew over it with a helicopter, and then just dropped a bunch of rocks out of the helicopter! That's Paris–Roubaix. It's that bad— it's ridiculous." [...] - Chris Horner ...|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{recorded}} her {{scenes from}} January 6–8, 1996. She {{had a relationship}} with cast member Matthew Perry at the time and an audience member said about their on-screen kiss, [...] "Julia looked at Matt and said 'I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend'." [...] A sound recordist commented: [...] "I've seen screen kisses before but this was the best. They really went at it." [...] Roberts thought her appearance on the show was [...] "the most nerve-wracking thing" [...] she had done since auditioning for Pretty Woman. [...] "I wanted to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be. [...] is incredibly funny, and you want to inspire that same kind of joy that he does. Then at a certain point at lunch, you go, 'Well, it ain't gonna happen. I'll just try to be cute.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Protests were {{scheduled}} for the film's Italian premiere in Viareggio, Italy, by unspecified organizations. The protesters objected to the plotline of a Partisan collaborating with the Nazis. This runs directly counter to the accepted historical version of events, ruled by an Italian military court in 2005, that the Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre was entirely premeditated by the Germans with no reason except the aim to frighten the population.

However, Lee, unrepentant, stated [...] "I am not apologizing." [...] He told Italians there was [...] "a lot about your history you have yet {{to come to grips}} with. This film is our interpretation, and I stand behind it." [...] McBride, the novel's author, stated: [...] "As a black American, I understand what it's like for someone to tell your history... unfortunately, the history of World War Two here in Italy is ours as well, and this was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do... it is, after all, a work of fiction.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Rose Kennedy {{stated that}} she felt {{completely}} fulfilled as a full-time homemaker. In her 1974 autobiography, Times to Remember, she wrote, [...] "I looked on child rearing {{not only as a}} work of love and a duty, but as a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession in the world and one that demanded <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bring to it.....

2500|$|On 5 June 2012, {{lawyers for}} Black moved {{that the last}} {{remaining}} counts of conviction be vacated due to prosecutorial misconduct and his claim {{that he had been}} denied the right to have the defense counsel of his choice.

2500|$|At Darlington, {{while running}} {{in the top five}} with 3 laps to go, Busch got tapped from behind by Clint Bowyer and spun out, hitting a barrier head-on. Because of energy {{absorbing}} walls, Busch was uninjured, but waved angrily towards Bowyer under caution and showed discontent with Bowyer in post-race ceremonies. In regards to the incident with Bowyer, Busch said [...] "That was a terrible way to end {{what could have been a}} decent night. We struggled at times to get the balance of the Haas Automation Chevrolet right, but we kind of found our spot just past the halfway point and made slight adjustments the rest of the way. We called for a two-tire stop at the end hoping to gain some track position, but it seemed like everyone had the same idea. We gained a little, but the guys behind us all had four tires. I tried to hold them off <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> but someone (Bowyer) moved me out of their way and it ruined our night. I hate it for the team, but we keep learning each week and we will get better." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{just the}} trouble," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "But I did <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> under the circumstances. I didn't want the Indians to scalp him." ...|$|E
