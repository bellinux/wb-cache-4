He has advised on numerous city planning developments including those for Melbourne, London and New York. His work has often drawn on Copenhagen and its bicycle culture, <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> public space in city centres.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Hamilton hired Gordon Landsborough as an editor. Landsborough did {{his best}} <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the science fiction he was publishing, and was allowed to offer £1 per 1,000 words for {{selected}} material. He also was joined at Hamilton by H.J. Campbell, who {{was hired as a}} technical editor. Campbell was a London science fiction fan; he had been brought on by Hulton Press (publisher of the very successful comic the Eagle) to create a science fiction magazine, but the project had been abandoned before seeing print.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{destroying}} confiscated ivory, a government {{could choose to}} sell it, and put the funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those {{on the supply side}} in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life for human citizens.|$|E

5|$|The {{release of}} Pareh was {{followed}} by a shift in genres popularised by the local cinema. The Teng Chun, who– together with Balink– continued to be the only active filmmaker in the country until 1937, began focusing on more modern stories and those which would be popular with native audiences. Biran suggests that this was influenced by Pareh. Other filmmakers in the late 1930s, partially inspired by Pareh, began <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the audio in their films. Pane notes that, following Pareh, films produced domestically no longer centred around ethnic European casts.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, several {{projects}} went {{underway to}} improve the city water available to the tenants of Four Seasons Mall. Nearby Northwood Lake {{was included in the}} projects; as several channels between the lake and the mall had eroded. The channels affected in the projects provided water to nearly 285 acres of land in Plymouth. Several initiatives such as ponding, stream restoration, and flow restriction were considered <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the water. In mid 2015, all of the improvement projects were finalized following two years of channel work.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, stock {{abutments}} {{are used}} to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless {{of the type of}} adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{in modern}} Scotland {{encompasses}} all building in Scotland, between {{the beginning of}} the twentieth century and the present day. The most significant architect of the early twentieth century was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who mixed elements of traditional Scottish architecture with contemporary movements. Estate house design declined in importance in the twentieth century. In the early decades of the century, traditional materials began to give way to cheaper modern ones. After the First World War modernism and the office block began to dominate building in the major cities and attempts began <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> urban housing for the poor, resulted in a massive programme of council house building. The Neo-Gothic style continued in to the twentieth century but the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings.|$|E
5|$|From 21 June, the 2/12th Commando Squadron {{conducted}} patrols of {{the outlying}} areas of Labuan to clear them of any Japanese forces; {{up to this}} point the squadron had formed part of the 9th Division's reserve. Each troop of the squadron was assigned a different sector of Labuan, and by mid-July had completed its task. During these patrols the squadron killed 27 Japanese soldiers, mainly as part of repelling a raid on the BBCAU compound on 24 June, and captured a single prisoner. The 2/12th Commando Squadron was subsequently directed to undertake topographic work in order <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> maps of the island. The 24th Brigade's total combat casualties in its operations on Labuan were 34 killed and 93 wounded. The Australian soldiers counted 389 Japanese dead and took 11 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Funds were {{scarce in}} the 1760s {{but a number}} of {{improvements}} were made to the North Front defences and the sea wall from South Bastion to Europa Point, which was severely damaged by a great storm in 1766. Green spent several years reviewing the state of the fortifications and developing a plan to improve them. He sent a report to the Board of Ordnance in London in 1762 and another in 1768. The following year he travelled to London to present his conclusions to a commission appointed by William Pitt the Elder. He summed up his three principal aims as being to prevent a possible landing by sea; <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the garrison and its provisioning; and to keep the enemy at a distance with artillery.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 Palmer left Ziff-Davis and was {{replaced}} by Howard Browne, who was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about fantasy fiction. Browne briefly managed <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the fiction in Fantastic Adventures, and the period around 1951 has been described as the magazine's heyday. Browne lost interest when his plan to take Amazing Stories upmarket collapsed, and the magazine fell back into predictability. In 1952, Ziff-Davis launched another fantasy magazine, titled Fantastic, in a digest format; it was successful, and within a few months the decision was taken to end Fantastic Adventures in favor of Fantastic. The March 1953 issue of Fantastic Adventures was the last.|$|E
5|$|The English {{enjoyed a}} marked superiority over the Scots in cavalry, {{particularly}} with the resurgence of heavy cavalry with their use of demi-lancers. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies after Bannockburn in 1314. It was limited by the shortage of suitable horses. James V imported great horses and mares from Denmark in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> Scottish breading stock. In the mid-sixteenth century the Scots still lacked sufficient heavy cavalry. In their place they fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the Borders and usually wearing jacks of leather or mail, mounted on small horses and using light lances. As firearms became available they began to field relatively large numbers of mounted arquebusiers.|$|E

5|$|Keswick {{is in the}} lee of the Skiddaw group, {{the oldest}} group of rocks in the Lake District. These fells were formed during the Ordovician period, 488 to 443 million years ago; they form a {{triangle}} sheltering the town, reaching a maximum height of 931m on Skiddaw itself. To the west of Portinscale, to the south-west of the village of Thornthwaite, is Whinlatter Forest Park and Grisedale Pike. To the east, beyond Castlerigg stone circle, is St John's in the Vale, {{at the foot of the}} Helvellyn range, which is popular with ramblers starting from Keswick. In 2010, Electricity North West, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the conservation charity Friends of the Lake District invested £100,000 to remove power lines and replace them with underground cables, <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> scenery in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim is <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the service, {{the interaction between the}} service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E

5|$|The Family Stand {{was opened}} in the Main Stand in 1992, and manager John Ward ran the London Marathon to help raise funds for the project. Bootham Crescent first hosted a {{play-off}} match when York beat Bury 1–0 on 19 May 1993 in the Third Division play-off semi-final; the attendance of 9,206 was the ground's highest in seven years. During 1993–94 the Main Stand paddock was seated and covered, and the recent work to the stand cost £220,000. The ground's capacity fell to 9,459, including seating for 3,645, after the renovations to the David Longhurst and Main Stands. In May 1995, a new drainage system was installed for £11,000, <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the pitch during winter. New floodlights were installed in June 1995 {{at a cost of}} £122,000, and despite being shorter in height were twice as powerful as the original floodlights. A water tower was installed in the late 1990s, to further help the pitch quality.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh uplands {{were most}} suited to grazing {{animals such as}} sheep and goats, and the animals became {{associated}} with Wales. Sheep-farming {{on a large scale}} was introduced by Cistercian monks, largely for wool, but also for meat. By the start of the 16th century Welsh mutton was popular {{in the rest of the}} UK. Once modern synthetic fibres became more popular than wool, Welsh sheep were raised almost exclusively for meat. Towards the end of the 20th century, there were more than 11 million sheep in Wales. The most popular breed of sheep is the Welsh Mountain sheep which is notably smaller than other breeds but better-suited to the Welsh landscape and only rears one lamb, rather than the lowland breeds which rear two or more; the mountain sheep are regarded as having more flavoursome meat. Welsh farmers have started using scientific methods, such as artificial insemination or using ultrasound to scan a sheep's depth of fat, <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> their meat.|$|E

The movie's background music has reduced volume, following the emotional evolution of the charactersToncu combining the background music (recorded with, or without intention) {{and a series of}} effects characteristic to electronic music and musique concrète. However, a few distinct moments can be observed in the film's music, either composed by Andrei Toncu (Andrei imagining stealing the trolleybus), or already existing recordings, edited so that they would integrate into the movie's atmosphere (Elvis Presley's dedication is dynamically equalized to suggest the shift from one radio to another). Another scene in which multiple layers of sound were used was the radio show heard in Giani's car about the breeding of Memestra brassicae butterflies.|$|E
