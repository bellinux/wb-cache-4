500|$|Though Wenger has {{established}} Arsenal as UEFA Champions League regulars, {{he has yet}} to win the European Cup, or translated his domestic success in other continental competitions – often considered a blemish on his managerial career. Writer Michael Calvin argues despite the European failings, Wenger should still be considered one of the greats in football: [...] " [...] has been the best, most influential manager of the modern era. His job has involved managing change, and all the hypocrisy which comes with that. In a world where incoherence is routinely hailed as innovation, he has been a true visionary". Wenger's stubbornness to follow his idealistic vision of football has been heavily criticised during his second decade at Arsenal. In 2016, Henry Winter reasoned the Frenchman's methods no longer gave him an advantage over others, and he needed to adapt or resign. Winter also suggested the club was content with lucrative top-four finishes, and the manager needed tough individuals to challenge him. Ferguson however expressed admiration in Wenger's consistency and obstinate nature: [...] "He stays with what he believes in. And I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> do that are outstanding coaches".|$|E
500|$|According to writer Linda Ruth Williams, {{the music}} video {{attracted}} {{attention from the}} press because of [...] "the clash between Spears' wholesome image and Dark's unwholesome back catalogue." [...] A Spears representative spoke to the Sunday Sport and revealed, [...] "as far as I'm aware the director just does music videos. This is a video for young teenage girls and not sexy at all." [...] Dark responded to the negative reviews saying, [...] "I don't deny that I did , it's just that I also like {{people to know that}} I don't currently and haven't in a long time." [...] Billboard reporter Carla Hay also noted, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> buy records are too concerned about the background of the video's director." [...] Lucy O'Brien, author of She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul, noted that hiring Dark as the video director implied that Spears was not that innocent. Time journalists Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce said that Spears [...] "may be the queen of pop tartiness, but her new video, 'From the Bottom of My Broken Heart', is an entirely wholesome affair," [...] while Chris Ryan of MTV considered it [...] "a suitably soft-focus affair". The video was also added to MTV's 2000 Yearbook, a list with the [...] "biggest, best, most memorable music videos of every year since the beginning of MTV." ...|$|E

2500|$|James Keach had {{developed}} a script about the Jesse James Gang, The Long Riders, which United Artists were willing to finance if a suitable director were to be found.

Hill later said his [...] "code" [...] for the film was to keep [...] "the jokes funny and the bullets real. It is about moral choices.

2500|$|Rick Santorum, who {{was enjoying}} {{a surge in}} the polls {{following}} his narrow second-place finish in the Iowa Caucuses, clashed with Mitt Romney over comments he had made that the country didn't need a CEO or manager as President. Santorum said, [...] "We need a leader... someone who, has the experience {{to go out and}} be the commander-in-chief... The commander-in-chief of this country isn't a CEO. It's someone who has to lead... being the president is not a CEO... You've got to lead and inspire." [...] Romney responded, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> spend their life in Washington don't understand what happens out in the real economy. They think that people who start businesses are just managers. The chance to lead in free enterprise is extraordinarily critical to also being able to lead a state, like I led in Massachusetts and, by the way, lead the Olympics. My experience is in leadership." [...] Newt Gingrich then criticised Romney's record at Bain Capital, saying [...] "I'm very much for free enterprise... I'm not nearly as enamored of a Wall Street model where you can flip companies, you can go in and have leveraged buyouts, you can basically take out all the money, leaving behind the workers." [...] Romney replied, [...] "I'm not surprised to have The New York Times try and put free enterprise on trial. I'm not surprised to have the Obama administration do that, either. It's a little surprising from my colleagues on this stage." ...|$|E

[...] She had {{continued}} to look at him as she spoke—watching his faint appreciation of her upturned face, and her hair, where the light was always tangled, watching his brief self-examination {{to see if he could}} feel any truth in her words, watching till he broke into a little laugh which was rather more awkward and less satisfied than usual.
