In September 1969, GCTC created a working group to further study the idea, and some experiments were performed in their swimming pool {{near the end of}} that year. In 1970, cosmonauts Andriyan Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov visited NASA's new 75 ft-diameter pool at Marshall. Sevastyanov was even allowed to don a <b>training</b> <b>suit</b> and enter the pool. Following the visit, further interest in a similar facility began to grow within the Soviet space program.

5000|$|Competitive {{swimwear}} generally {{refers to}} the swimsuit, clothing, equipment and accessories used in the aquatic sports of swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, triathlon and water polo.Some swimsuits are designed specifically for swimming competitions where they may be constructed of a special low resistance fabric that reduces skin drag. For some kinds of swimming and diving, special bodysuits called [...] "diveskins" [...] are worn. These suits are made from spandex and provide little thermal protection, but they do protect the skin from stings and abrasion. Most competitive swimmers also wear special swimsuits including partial bodysuits, racerback styles, jammers and racing briefs to assist their glide through the water thus gaining a speed advantage.Unlike regular swimsuits, which are designed mainly for the aesthetic appearances, swimsuits designed to be worn during competitions are manufactured to assist the athlete in swim competitions. They reduce friction and drag in the water, increasing {{the efficiency of the}} swimmer's forward motion. The tight fits allow for easy movement and are said to reduce muscle vibration, thus reducing drag. This also reduces the possibility that a high forwards dive will remove a divers swimwear. Starting around 2000, in an effort to improve the effectiveness of the swimsuits, engineers have taken to designing them to replicate the skin of sea based animals, sharks in particular.In July 2009, FINA voted to ban non-textile (non-woven) swimsuits in competitive events from 2010. The new policy was implemented to combat the issues associated with performance enhancing swimsuits, hindering the ability to accurately measure the performance of swimmers. Subsequently, the new ruling states that men's swimsuits may maximally cover the area from the navel to the knee, and women's' counterparts from the shoulder to the knee.Some swimmers use a specialized <b>training</b> <b>suit</b> called drag suits to artificially increase drag during practice. Drag suits are swimwear with an outer layer of looser fabric - often mesh or nylon - to increase resistance against the water and build up the swimmer's endurance. They {{come in a variety of}} styles, but most resemble a looser fitting square-cut or swim brief.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The nursery active-wear uniform {{designs of}} Internet {{shopping}} malls are simple and similar; however, the lat-est children's wear trends (mostly composed of training jumpers and pants) {{do not reflect}} these qualities. Children's folk-lore plays (widely used in child education) have an instructive value for the emotional and intellectual development of a child. Nursery active-wear uniform designs applied to children's folklore's plays could be positive for the emotional devel-opment and specialized cultural education of children. We designed three nursery active-wear uniforms with three dif-ferent design concepts (casual, semi-formal and sporty) regardless of sex. The main color of the three nursery active-wear uniforms was yellow. We used three different chroma and values of yellow through three design concepts: Design I of a nursery active-wear uniform (a <b>training</b> <b>suit</b> style with a good activity), Design II of a nursery active-wear uniform (a semi suit style), and Design III of a nursery active-wear uniform (a sportswear style that reflected a sport wear trend). We expressed children's folklore plays {{in the pattern of}} a nursery active-wear uniform. The pattern was characterized as a pair of bears flying kites. This pattern was utilized in three nursery active-wear uniforms with the logo and name of the nursery. We modified the designs of active-wear nursery uniforms based on an evaluation of 33 special panels. We made three nursery active-wear uniforms for five-year olds.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Effects of a Novel Exercise <b>Training</b> <b>Suit</b> on Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Body Composition and Leg Strength Trevor Michael Curry The {{physiological}} responses to physical activity or exercise using external load carriage systems (LCS) {{in the form}} of weighted personal protective equipment, backpacks, or vests have biomechanical and human performance implications. It remains unclear whether a new unique LCS {{in the form of}} a weighted (5. 45 kg) full-bodied exercise suit can induce greater improvements in performance and body composition. Twenty-one healthy males (20 ± 3 years; 24. 9 ± 3. 6 body mass index (BMI); 25. 1 ± 6. 4 % total percentage body fat (% fat); 120. 1 ± 17. 3 kg lean mass; 146. 2 ± 35. 4 kg leg press 1 -repetition max; 1. 25 ± 0. 14 g·cm- 2 bone mineral density; 49. 5 ± 8. 53 mLO 2 ·kg- 1 ·min- 1 maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max)) were matched for VO 2 max and physical characteristics before being randomly allocated into an aerobic exercise intervention with or without the exercise suit using a treadmill at the Cal Poly Recreation Center. Participants jogged at 60 %- 70 % of their maximum heart rate for 30 min three times a week on nonconsecutive days for six weeks. Weight was recorded before and after each session while heart rates, blood pressures, and tympanic membrane temperatures were recorded incrementally during each session. Thereafter, VO 2 max and the same physical characteristics were measured and used to analyze the changes before and after the 6 -week program. The results indicate that there was no difference for the change in any of the variables measured during and between the exercise intervention. Future studies examining the effect of the exercise suit on these variables should strongly consider larger sample sizes and other subpopulations to gain the statistical power to measure the effects of the exercise suit...|$|E
