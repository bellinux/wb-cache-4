5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery {{because of the risk}} that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the ventilator and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable <b>to</b> <b>wean</b> herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{has been}} having drug-like {{withdrawals}} since Lois decided <b>to</b> <b>wean</b> him. He becomes so desperate {{that when he}} and Lois are at the park, he jumps on a woman breastfeeding her baby and greedily suckles on her, but is pulled off by Lois. One night, he then tries to milk Lois in her sleep. He pumps her breasts and succeeds, but spills and desperately tries licking it up. Stewie realizes how pathetic he is and accepts his weaning. He comes to Brian and informs {{that he is now}} off breast milk, but Lois has other plans. Lois allows Stewie to be breastfed again, thus delighting him.|$|E

40|$|It {{was aimed}} {{in this work}} to {{evaluate}} the productivity and efficiency of beef cows submitted <b>to</b> <b>weaning</b> of their calves at 76 days (early weaning) or at 148 days (weaning at conventional age) after calving during three consecutive years. It was evaluated pregnancy rate, birth and weaning, gain weight of the calves and cows at conventional weaning, weight at conventional weaning of calves and cows, production of weaned calves per cow and calf production index. Pregnancy rate in the herd submitted <b>to</b> early <b>weaning</b> (86. 34 %) was {{higher than in the}} conventional weaning (55. 5 %). Early weaning cows showed higher birth and weaning rates when compared <b>to</b> conventional <b>weaning</b> (83. 6 and 83. 6 % vs. 47. 5 and 44. 5 %, respectively) besides a higher production of calves (183 vs. 114). Early weaning cows produced 60. 5 % more calves than the conventional weaning cows. Conventional weaning calves gained more weight from birth <b>to</b> <b>weaning</b> (97. 9 vs. 83. 4 kg, respectively). Early weaning cows had more weight gain from calving <b>to</b> <b>weaning</b> (42. 5 vs. 18. 7 kg, respectively), and regarded to calf production index, they were more efficient (efficiency of the herds). At the average of the three years, the early weaning of the calves allows higher calving rates and <b>weaning</b> <b>to</b> the cows, in addition to a higher index of calf kilogram index produced in relation <b>to</b> <b>weaning</b> at conventional age...|$|R

5|$|Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid {{present in}} wild Cucurbita {{and in each}} member of the family Cucurbitaceae. Poisonous to mammals, it is found in {{quantities}} sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild Cucurbita and most ornamental gourds, with the exception of an occasional C.fraterna and C.sororia, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast <b>to</b> <b>wean</b> children. While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} low tail dock and {{generally}} unimproved anatomy, Jacob ewes are widely {{reputed to be}} easy-lambing. Jacobs are seasonal breeders, with ewes generally cycling in the cooler months of the autumn. They will begin to cycle during the first autumn following their birth and most often the ewe's first lamb is a single. Subsequent gestations will typically bear one or two lambs in the spring, and triplets are not unusual. The lambs will exhibit their spotting and horn characteristics at birth, with the horn buds more readily apparent on ram lambs. Lambs may be weaned at two months of age, but many shepherds do not separate lambs and allow the ewe <b>to</b> <b>wean</b> the lamb at about 4months of age. Jacob ewes are instinctively attentive mothers and are protective of their lambs. They are included in commercial flocks in England because of their ease of lambing and strong mothering instincts.|$|E

30|$|Weaning {{weight of}} calves {{is one of}} the {{important}} traits affecting net income in beef industry. Calf weaning weight is determined by the genetic potential of the calf for growth and the amount of milk received from the dam. Moreover, weight gain <b>to</b> <b>weaning</b> is indicative <b>to</b> maternal ability of the dams. Milk production in beef cattle is difficult to measure there by making any highly correlated trait an important tool in practical selection in beef production. Significant correlation between milk yield and weight gain of calves <b>to</b> <b>weaning</b> was reported for different cattle breed.|$|R

It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it {{on the basis that}} it usually involves the worship of other gods. Rabbis of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between a heifer's weaning weight and her fertility and weaning weight of&# 13; her calves was studied. Also investigated was the effect of dam amount of fat (DAF=dam weaning&# 13; weight/weaning height) on heifers' ability to breed and rebreed. This is similar to Body Mass Index&# 13; (BMI) calculated for humans. The relationship of dam's average daily gain from birth <b>to</b> <b>weaning</b> and&# 13; from <b>weaning</b> <b>to</b> finishing and DAF <b>to</b> calf <b>weaning</b> weight was studied also. These determine which&# 13; heifers should be kept as replacements. Data were collected from 816 heifers. Heavier animals had&# 13; higher conception rates. Average daily gain of the dam from birth <b>to</b> <b>weaning</b> and DAF had adverse&# 13; effects on calf weaning weight.

25|$|Evolutionary psychologists seek to {{understand}} psychological mechanisms by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might have served {{over the course of}} evolutionary history. These might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leaders. Consistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives. For instance, a mother may wish <b>to</b> <b>wean</b> her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspring. Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism. Like chimpanzees and bonobos, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances. In studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.|$|E
