In 1933, along with his great friend Kitani Minoru, Go Seigen developed and popularized the Shinfuseki that broke away from the traditional opening patterns. It is for <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> contribution that Go Seigen and Kitani Minoru are recognized as the fathers of modern go.|$|E

The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for [...] "a most interesting and artistic performance of <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> work".|$|E

In fitting recognition of the significance of <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> farm equipment, the LGU of Licab adopted [...] "Kariton Festival" [...] as the town's official festival.

Biologists have a word for <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> problem; they call it bionomics, or ecology." [...] He said that [...] "Steinbeck's bionomic interest is visible in all that he has done, from Tortilla Flat, in the middle Thirties, through his semi-biological Sea of Cortez, to his latest communiqu√©s as a war correspondent in England." [...] He characterized In Dubious Battle as [...] "an attempt to study a typical mid-depression strike in bionomic terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beijing National Stadium (BNS) was a {{joint venture}} among {{architect}}s Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of Herzog & de Meuron, project architect Stefan Marbach, artist Ai Weiwei, and CADG which was led by chief architect Li Xinggang. During their first meeting in 2003, at Basel, the group {{decided to do something}} unlike Herzog and de Meuron had traditionally designed. [...] "China wanted to have something new for <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> stadium," [...] Li stated. In an effort to design a stadium that was [...] "porous" [...] while also being [...] "a collective building, a public vessel", the team studied Chinese ceramics.

The stadium consists of two independent structures, standing 50 feet apart: a red concrete seating bowl and the outer steel frame around it.|$|E

Moreover, she added, it would give her great pleasure if Mr. Lancaster would come prepared to spend a couple of days at her house.

Other people might go and meet her at the station, but they would stay at home and see what happened. Even Mr. Perley thought it wise, under the circumstances, to do this.|$|E
