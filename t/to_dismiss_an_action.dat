40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was made for}} Lou D 2 ̆ 7 Alton 2 ̆ 7 s Information Policy class in the Faculty of Information 2 ̆ 6 Media Studies. It looks at {{the decision of the}} Supreme Court of Canada in Douez v Facebook Inc where the court declined <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>an</b> <b>action</b> brought against Facebook Inc for breach of privacy. The action was based on the B. C. Privacy Act and it was brought as a class action in B. C. Facebook sought to dismiss the action because of a 2 ̆ 2 choice of forum 2 ̆ 2 clause in its terms of service agreement which said that disputes will be brought in California courts. This presentation looks at the case in greater detail and also considers its implications for other consumer license agreements where terms often purport to supersede statutory rights.

Falling housing prices have led to borrowers possessing reduced equity, which is perceived as {{an increased risk of}} foreclosure in the eyes of lenders. On January 27, 2010, a federal judge refused <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>a</b> class <b>action</b> lawsuit against Chase for freezing HELOC loans.

5000|$|The term {{preliminary}} objection {{is used in}} Pennsylvania state court to refer to all motions made after the filing of a complaint but before the filing of an answer; {{preliminary objection}}s may be made [...] "in {{the nature of a}} demurrer" [...] (seeking <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>a</b> cause of <b>action</b> for legal insufficiency) or [...] "in the nature of a motion to strike" [...] (seeking to remove parts of a pleading for failure to abide by the technical rules), as well as various other means. As with the traditional demurrer, preliminary objections are regarded as pleadings. Preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer are governed by Rule 1028(a)(4) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2014, {{the company}} {{announced}} that it had changed its legal terms on its website to introduce an arbitration clause requiring all disputes with General Mills to be resolved in small claims court or arbitration {{and not as a}} participant in <b>a</b> class <b>action.</b> [...] The change was made shortly after a judge's March 26, 2014 denial of <b>a</b> motion <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>a</b> class <b>action</b> regarding the marketing of the company's Nature Valley brand products. [...] Users would be deemed to accept the terms by interacting with General Mills on its website in various ways, such as downloading coupons, subscribing to newsletters, or participating in Internet forums hosted on the website. [...] The New York Times stated that the agreement could be interpreted to additionally construe purchasing General Mills products at a grocery store or liking the company's Facebook page as assent to the terms; General Mills disclaimed that interpretation, calling it a [...] "mischaracterization". [...] The change in terms resulted in a massive backlash of protests via consumer groups and social media, and General Mills reverted the terms back to the original content after only a few days.|$|R
40|$|No {{coherent}} doctrinal statement {{exists for}} calculating open-market damages for securities fraud class actions. Instead, courts have tried {{in vain to}} fashion common-law deceit and misrepresentation remedies to fit open-market fraud. The result is a relatively ineffective system with a hallmark feature: unpredictable damage awards. This poses a significant fraud deterrence problem from both a practical and a theoretical standpoint. In 2005, the Supreme Court had the opportunity to clarify open-market damage principles and to facilitate earlier dismissal of cases without compensable economic losses. Instead, in Dura Pharmaceuticals v. Broudo, it further confused the damage issue by (1) perpetuating the idea that courts can tailor damages from common-law deceit and misrepresentation actions to remedy open-market fraud despite the practical disparities between the two and (2) opening the door to a new form of hypothetical losses where the stock price increases after an opportune disclosure of fraud. By increasing ambiguity in the law governing open-market damages, the Supreme Court may have inhibited securities fraud deterrence in two distinct ways. First, without a standard damage measure, courts have trouble determining whether plaintiffs suffered compensable economic loss from the initial pleadings, which means that a court may hesitate <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> even <b>an</b> <b>action</b> that does not plead a prima facie case of fraud. Second, corporate actors cannot weigh the costs of their potentially fraudulent behavior with any certainty. The Supreme Court’s insinuation that a new form of hypothetical losses might be recoverable further inhibits predictability and could have perverse effects on investor education and motivation. In Dura, the Court implied that an investor might be able to recover damages when a stock’s price does not increase as much as it might have absent the fraud. This suggests that plaintiffs might not be limited to traditional out-of-pocket losses. A number of intrinsic problems could result from compensating investors for more than their out-of-pocket losses. For example, providing investors with a double-recovery, one from the net stock price increase and one from class-action damages, could create a perverse incentive to invest purposefully in companies showing signs of fraud. Accordingly, to minimize these effects and to promote predictability, this Article suggests that courts should limit plaintiffs to their out-of-pocket losses and subject expert methodology for calculating damages to a Daubert inquiry. My intention in this Article is not to imply that simply limiting investors to their out-of-pocket losses will provide a quick “fix” for the ills of the securities class-action system. Instead, I hope to highlight some of the intrinsic problems that could result from compensating investors with a net gain and from stretching traditional common-law remedies to fit modern securities-fraud class actions. The out-of-pocket measure is the only common-law remedy that recognizes the distinctions between face-to-face transactions and open-market fraud, that complies with the loss causation requirement, and that limits plaintiffs to their actual damages. Restricting investors to out-of-pocket losses also advances optimal deterrence by increasing predictability through a clear doctrinal damage calculation...|$|R
