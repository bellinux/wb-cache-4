The rich C 5 resources from refinery in the south and east of Fushun, however, hold out the hope of C 5 utilization industrialization, an innovative method to Fushun energy issue. It has higher energy efficiency than traditional method and the production is easier to store and transport. In so doing, the energy demand of Fushun will be satisfied and the local area pollution will be decreased to minimum at least.

3000|$|Alcohols and ethers {{are used}} as oxygenated {{additives}} to motor fuels and as antiknock components in gasoline. They increase the octane number and reduce the emissions of gases to greenhouse effect (CO x [...] and NO x [...]). These oxygenated compounds have partially replaced the lead-based salts that are toxic and pollutant. Among the tertiary ethers, such as ethyl tertiary butyl ether, <b>tertiary</b> <b>amyl</b> ethyl ether and <b>tertiary</b> <b>amyl</b> methyl ether, MTBE is the oxygenated additive currently, {{the most widely used}} in the reformulated gasoline and also one of organic chemicals the most produced industrially [1]. However, the major drawback of this ether is its easy diffusion in the ground water, its slow biological breakdown and its unpleasant odour. The diisopropyl ether (DIPE) can be a potential candidate to substitute the MTBE. It has the advantage to increase the octane number and to have a lower vapour pressure. Various works proposed the synthesis of the DIPE from propene and water in a two-stage process [2], from a feed of acetone and hydrogen in a two-stage process [3] or one-step process [4] and from acetone feedstock [5]. The DIPE can be also synthesised either from a feed of propylene and water [6] or from a feed of propene and isopropanol over an acidic ion exchange resin like Amberlyst 15 [7]. The synthesis of the DIPE from the isopropanol decomposition was examined over aluminosilicates supported sulfopolyphenylketone (or polyphenylketone) [8] and over sulphated titania [9].|$|R
