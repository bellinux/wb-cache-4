5|$|In 1940, the New England Council elected Flanders president. The {{governors}} of the New England states had established this council to study industry and commerce in their states. Flanders’s role increased his awareness of <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>and</b> business assets in New England. He {{also tried to}} alert his peers to the prospect of U.S. involvement in the expanding Second World War.|$|E
5|$|It {{came to the}} Queen's {{attention}} that Frenchman Jean Laborde, who had been shipwrecked off Madagascar in 1832, was knowledgeable {{in the production of}} cannons, muskets and gunpowder. Ranavalona provided him with <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>and</b> materials to establish factories that met the material needs of her army, thereby ending the kingdom's dependence on Europe for modern weaponry.|$|E
5|$|Gerber set out {{to expand}} the Society's {{membership}} beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining; he was also unable to gain any financial support from the more affluent members of Chicago's gay community. Gerber sought out the support {{of people in the}} medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of their fear of ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, Gerber stated, The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or depraved. Some were blasé. Many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was the real spice of life. With this argument, they rejected our aims. We wondered how we could accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people. Gerber shouldered all of <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>and</b> financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, something he was willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort. The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals.|$|E

5|$|The 1980 {{election}} saw the Republicans capture {{not just}} the presidency but control of the Senate as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party {{for the first time}} in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss, but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism. He chose to become the ranking member of <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>and</b> Public Welfare Committee rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career. Kennedy became a committed champion of women's issues and of gay rights, and established relationships with select Republican senators to block Reagan's actions and preserve and improve the Voting Rights Act, funding for AIDS treatment, and equal funding for women's sports under Title IX. To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics important to him. Kennedy could not hope to stop all of Reagan's reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.|$|E
5|$|While American economists quickly {{abandoned}} disequilibrium models, European economists {{were more}} open to models without market clearing. Europeans such as Edmond Malinvaud and Jacques Drèze expanded on the disequilibrium tradition and worked to explain price rigidity instead of simply assuming it. Malinvaud (1977) used disequilibrium analysis to develop a theory of unemployment. He argued that disequilibrium in <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>and</b> goods markets could lead to rationing of goods and labor, leading to unemployment. Malinvaud adopted a fixprice framework and argued that pricing would be rigid in modern, industrial prices compared to the relatively flexible pricing systems of raw goods that dominate agricultural economies. Prices are fixed and only quantities adjust. Malinvaud considers an equilibrium state in classical and Keynesian unemployment as most likely. Work in the neoclassical tradition is confined as a special case of Malinvaud's typology, the Walrasian equilibrium. In Malinvaud's theory, reaching the Walrasian equilibrium case {{is almost impossible to}} achieve given the nature of industrial pricing.|$|E
