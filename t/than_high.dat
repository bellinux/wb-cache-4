5|$|Stowe's house, {{which was}} {{located on the}} bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats {{shuffling}} tourists from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home. One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less <b>than</b> <b>high</b> regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.|$|E
5|$|Post {{election}} {{polls showed}} that Humphrey lost the white vote with 38%, nine points behind Nixon, but won the nonwhite vote solidly, 85% to 12%, including 97% of African-Americans. African-Americans favored Humphrey {{because of his}} record on civil rights, and their desire to quickly end the war in Vietnam, where blacks were overrepresented. The racial divide in the election had widened since 1964, and was attributed to civil rights protests and race riots. Humphrey won 45% of the female vote, two points ahead of Nixon, but lost to the Republican among males, 41% to 43%. Voters with only a grade school education supported Humphrey 52% to 33% over Nixon, while Nixon won among both those with no higher education <b>than</b> <b>high</b> school (43% to 42%) and those who graduated from college (54% to 37%). Occupation demographics mirrored these numbers with manual-labor workers supporting Humphrey 50% to 37%, and with white-collar (47% to 41%) and professionals (56% to 34%) favoring Nixon. Humphrey won among young voters (under 30 years old) by 47% to 38%, and also edged Nixon among those between 30 and 49 years, with 44% to 41%. Nixon won among voters over 50 years, 47% to 41%. Catholics backed Humphrey with 59%, twelve points ahead of Nixon, but Protestants favored Nixon, 49% to 35%. Humphrey lost the Independent vote 31% to 44%, with 25% going to Wallace, and won a lower percentage among Democrats (74%) than Nixon won among Republicans (86%). This discrepancy {{was connected to the}} tough Democratic primary election that caused some former McCarthy, Kennedy or McGovern supporters to vote for Nixon or Wallace as a protest.|$|E

25|$|Neutrons, on {{the other}} hand, have no {{electric}} charge to cause repulsion, {{and are able to}} initiate a nuclear reaction at very low energies. In fact, at extremely low particle energies (corresponding, say, to thermal equilibrium at room temperature), the neutron's de Broglie wavelength is greatly increased, possibly greatly increasing its capture cross section, at energies close to resonances of the nuclei involved. Thus low-energy neutrons may be even more reactive <b>than</b> <b>high</b> energy neutrons.|$|E

25|$|Low solids (wet) digesters can {{transport}} material {{through the}} system using standard pumps that require significantly lower energy input. Low solids digesters require a larger amount of land <b>than</b> <b>high</b> solids due to the increased volumes associated with the increased liquid-to-feedstock ratio of the digesters. There are benefits associated with operation in a liquid environment, as it enables more thorough circulation of materials and contact between the bacteria and their food. This enables the bacteria to more readily access the substances on which they are feeding, and increases the rate of gas production.|$|E

They also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices, utilities and transport. They believed the Luftwaffe had failed in precision attack and concluded the German example of area attack using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over Germany.|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 19th century until the 1970s, {{this method of}} frame {{construction}} was favored because the lower temperatures of brazing (silver brazing in particular) had less of {{a negative impact on}} the tubing strength <b>than</b> <b>high</b> temperature welding, which can seriously weaken many steel alloys. Brazing thus allowed relatively thin walled, lightweight tubes to be used without loss of strength. However, recent advances in metallurgy have created steel tubing that is not adversely affected (or may even be improved) by high temperature welding. This has allowed both TIG and MIG welding to displace lugged steel construction, in large part because these methods lend themselves more easily to automation and reduce the cost by eliminating the lugs.|$|E
25|$|Ambiguity is {{one factor}} that affects {{whether or not a}} person assists another in need. In {{situations}} in which the bystander(s) are not sure if a person requires assistance (a high ambiguity situation), reaction time is slow (hearing a person fall but not sure if they are hurt). In low ambiguity situations (a person yelling out for help) reaction times for bystanders is quicker <b>than</b> <b>high</b> ambiguity situations. In some cases of high ambiguity, it can take a person or group up to 5 times as long before taking action than in cases of low ambiguity. The number of bystanders in each condition is not a significant factor. In these cases, bystanders determine their own safety before proceeding. Bystanders are more likely to intervene in low ambiguity, insignificant consequence situations than in high ambiguity, significant consequence situations.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 Claus Jungeblut {{reported}} that vitamin C treatment inactivates the polio virus in vitro, making it non-infectious when injected into monkeys. In 1937, Jungeblut injected polio into {{the brains of}} monkeys, and found that many more monkeys that also received vitamin C escaped paralysis than controls - the results seemed to indicate that low doses were more effective <b>than</b> <b>high</b> doses. A subsequent study by Jungeblut demonstrated that polio infected monkeys had lower vitamin C levels than others, and that the monkeys that escaped paralysis had the highest vitamin C levels. Jungeblut subsequently confirmed his findings in a larger study, finding that natural vitamin C was more effective than synthetic vitamin C, and as the disease progressed, larger and larger amounts of vitamin C were needed for therapeutic effect.|$|E
