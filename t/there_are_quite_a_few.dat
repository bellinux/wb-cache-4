25|$|Amphibians include {{numerous}} toads and frogs in the American Southwest. Toads {{which can}} be found in the region include: the Great Plains toad (Anaxyrus cognatus); the green toad (Anaxyrus debilis); the Arizona toad (Anaxyrus microscaphus); the New Mexico spadefoot (Spea multiplicata stagnalis); and the Colorado River toad (Incilius alvarius), also known as the Sonoran Desert toad. Frog representation includes: western barking frog (Craugastor augusti); the canyon tree frog (Hyla arenicolor); the Arizona treefrog (Hyla wrightorum); the western chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata); Chiricahua leopard frog (Lithobates chiricahuensis); and the relict leopard frog (Lithobates onca). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> salamanders throughout the region, including: the Arizona tiger salamander (Ambystoma mavortium nebulosum) and the painted ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii picta).|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{different}} dielectrics {{that can}} be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on {{the requirements of the}} circuit. Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball grid array (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> drug therapies {{that are}} {{possible}} for Parkinson's disease (ex. Sinemet). Since {{there is no}} cure for it, the patient will probably end up having to have surgery done to relieve some of the symptoms. When a patient has this procedure done, they are most likely going to receive a deep brain stimulation. So it will keep the brain stimulated even though the disease tries to disable it. Recently a study was performed to test if surgery helps the patients discover their symptoms post surgery than pre-surgery. They found that the symptoms were still present but the patients were more aware of their difficulties than before they had surgery. This shows that surgery does improve a patients speech perception, even though it might not cure their disease.|$|E

25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to state that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E
25|$|In theater, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{plays and}} musicals that have lesbian {{characters}} or focus on lesbian themes. One particular musical {{that has received}} a lot of recognition {{in the past few years}} is Fun Home. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Fun Home is a personal account of Alison Bechdel's self-discovery as a lesbian. The show also features themes of the decision to come out, having sex for the first time, and coming to terms with one's sexuality. Many of the songs in the show focus on these themes, such as the moment of recognition one knows they are gay, when they find gay role models, and the awkwardness and authenticity that comes with first time sex. This show stands out because it normalizes the lesbian experience and speaks of lesbian sex without the fetishation found in much other media platforms.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've {{never really}} classed {{myself as a}} lead player as such, {{but this is the}} first time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there are quite a lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E

500|$|The episode makes {{references}} to several real-life persons. The piano-playing satirist who annoys Bart is {{a reference to}} Mark Russell and/or Tom Lehrer. Bob Arnold, the corrupt congressman, tells Lisa that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> women senators, but Lisa asserts {{that there are only}} two. At the time of airing there were indeed only two female senators: Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Then-President George H. W. Bush is featured briefly in the episode. Shortly after it aired, Bush disparaged The Simpsons in a speech during his re-election campaign on January 27, 1992. At that point family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, so he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington: [...] "We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] As a result, Bush appeared in future episodes in a more negative light.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot {{praised the}} graphics, noting [...] "As {{good as the}} {{original}} Unreal looked, Unreal Tournament looks even better. The character models and skins look excellent, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> choices to make when designing your character." [...] He also praised the multiplayer gameplay, weapons and level design: [...] "The first-person shooter genre is fiercely competitive. But Unreal Tournament rises above the rest with its solid multiplayer performance, from its good weapon balance to its great level design." [...] The game was similarly reviewed by GameSpy, who concluded: [...] "Unreal Tournament raises the bar for first person teamplay games. The mutators, bots, teams, and sheer number of maps give the game an awesome depth and replayability. This game is stuffed with content and polished until it gleams." [...] British magazine PC Zone {{was pleased with the}} [...] "very intelligent" [...] bots, but criticized the [...] "truly terrible" [...] music. Allgame complimented the addictiveness of Assault mode, and the game's replay value, calling it [...] "a glowing, shining beacon in a sea of multi-player games." [...] Computer and Video Games found the game to have an [...] "excellent" [...] single-player mode, adding that with an average AI skill the player will [...] "progress with little serious effort, taking a thrilling ride through spectacularly atmospheric levels and increasing numbers of opponents." [...] Eurogamer echoed that sentiment, and commented that the game is playable on low-end systems.|$|E
