5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hills</b> <b>of</b> Euonymeia, {{together}} with the adjacent coastal promontory of Agios Kosmas {{are the two most}} important sites of Neolithic and Aegean Bronze Age development in the area of Athens prior to ca. 3000 BCE.

The commonality of findings in Agios Kosmas and Euonymeia suggests that the two settlements were functionally linked coastal and inland communities.|$|E

5|$|Burnside's {{road system}} was {{completely}} bitumenised during the 1960s and 1970s through government-sponsored roadworks programmes. Plans were also laid out {{to replace the}} winding and dangerous Mount Barker Road.

It was then to pass through Hazelwood Park and Beaumont, wind around <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>of</b> Waterfall Gully and then go over Eagle on the Hill to meet Crafers. The Burnside Council put much effort into this proposal, widening Linden Avenue (which runs north-west to south-east) {{in preparation for the}} highway. The proposal was eventually rejected in favour of upgrading Mount Barker Road and Linden Avenue remained a huge out-of-place road running through an otherwise peaceful suburb.|$|E

They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one could tell them where Wyatt was buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 1967, {{a patrol}} from Bravo Company became engaged with an NVA force of unknown size north of Hill 861.

North Vietnamese forces were driven out of the area around Khe Sanh after suffering 940 casualties. The Marines suffered 155 killed in action and 425 wounded. To prevent NVA observation of the main base at the airfield (and their possible use as firebases), <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding Khe Sanh Valley had to be continuously occupied and defended by separate Marine elements.|$|E
