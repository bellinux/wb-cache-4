Shulgin went on to develop a new synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff used <b>the</b> <b>substance</b> in his practice in small doses as an aid to talk therapy.

Then <b>the</b> deposited <b>substances</b> are detected simultaneously on each of the electrodes.
