An {{example of the}} former {{would be the case}} of an engineer facing a difficult professional decision, who, while sitting in a cinema, heard a voice saying, ‘loudly and distinctly’: ‘You can’t do it, you know’. [...] He adds: ‘It was so clear and resonant that I <b>turned</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my companion who was gazing placidly at the screen I was amazed and somewhat relieved when it became apparent that I was the only person who had heard anything.’ ...|$|E

60|$|She {{then did}} <b>turn,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{him for a}} moment without speaking; a certain {{suspicion}} looming in her eyes, as if suggested by his perceptible want of ease.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nay, {{that you}} must ask your pilot; for while talking to me, the old man would <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the stranger, every minute, as if {{watching}} for signals how to steer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{like the}} spirit of a shadow, isn't it?" [...] whispered Anne. [...] "You can see it so plainly {{haunting}} your side when you look ahead; but when you <b>turn</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it--it's gone." ...|$|R

50|$|In response, Labiche <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> {{the murdered}} hostages. Then, without a word, {{he turns back}} to von Waldheim and shoots him. Afterwards he limps away, leaving the corpses and the art treasures where they lie.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{it is no}} secret," [...] said Marian, <b>turning,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her steadily. [...] "All {{the world}} knows it. I have left your brother; and I {{do not know whether}} I am still his wife, or whether I am already divorced." ...|$|R
6000|$|Re-enter CONSTANT softly with a {{bunch of}} keys in his hand. On [...] his way to the cabinet he <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> NAPOLEON. Seeing [...] the glass and a strangeness in the EMPEROR, he {{abandons}} his [...] object, rushes out, and is heard calling.|$|R

60|$|The {{young lady}} <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> her watch. She rises {{with an air}} of one who waits, and is almost {{at the end of her}} patience.
