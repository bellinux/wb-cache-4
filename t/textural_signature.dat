This method increased the discrimination between upland and flooded vegetation. Because the fluvial channel in the investigated site is oriented either parallel or perpendicular to radar illumination, the study resulted in {{better understanding of the}} <b>textural</b> <b>signature</b> of the double-bounce effect of microwave energy at river margins.

Ten training areas were selected from the data set, three of which consisted entirely of first-year ice, four entirely of multilayer ice, and three of new ice in open leads in the process of freezing. A simple gradient operator was used to characterize the radiometric texture in each training region in terms {{of the degree to which}} radiometric gradients are oriented. New ice in leads has a sufficiently high proportion of well-oriented features to distinguish it uniquely from first-year ice and multiyear ice. The predominance of well-oriented features probably reflects physical processes by which new ice accumulates in open leads. Banded structures, which are evident in aerial photographs of new ice, apparently give rise to the radiometric signature observed, in which the trend of brightness temperature gradients is aligned parallel to lead trends. First-year ice and multiyear ice, which have been subjected to a more random growth and process history, lack this banded structure and therefore are characterized by signatures in which well-aligned elements are less dominant...|$|E

The kyanite-free samples have garnet and staurolite in equilibrium, where garnets show euhedral texture and have flat compositional profile. On the other hand, the kyanite-bearing sample shows equilibrium assemblage of garnet-kyanite-staurolite along with muscovite and biotite. In this case, garnet has an inclusion rich core with a distinct grain boundary, which was later overgrown by inclusion free euhedral garnet. Garnet cores are rich in Mn and Ca, while the rims are poor in Mn and rich in Fe and Mg, suggesting two distinct generations of growth. However, the compositional profiles and <b>textural</b> <b>signature</b> of garnets suggests the same stage of P -T evolution {{for the formation of}} the inclusion free euhedral garnets in the kyanite-free gneisses and the inclusion free euhedral garnet rims in the kyanite-bearing gneiss. Muscovites from the four samples have consistent K-Ar ages, suggesting the cooling age (∼ 10 Ma) of the gneisses.

Grain-size {{characteristics}} (by laser granulometry) and foraminiferal assemblages have been established for silts accumulated in five, dissimilar tidal palaeochannels of mid or late Holocene age in the Severn Estuary Levels, representative of muddy tidal systems. For purposes of general comparison, similar data were obtained from a representative active tidal inlet in the area, but all of these channels {{have been subject to}} human interference and are not relied upon as a model for environmental interpretation. Although the palaeochannel deposits differ substantially in their bedding characteristics and stratigraphical relationships from the level-bedded salt-marsh platform and mudflat deposits with which they are associated, and although the channel environment is distinctive morphologically and hydraulically, no critical textural differences could be found between the channel deposits and the associated facies. Similarly, no foraminiferal assemblages distinctive of a tidal channel were encountered. Instead, the assemblages compare with those from mudflats and salt-marsh platforms. It is concluded that the sides of the subfossil channels carried some vegetation, as was observed to be the case in the modern inlet. An alternative approach is necessary if concealed palaeochannel deposits are to be recognized in muddy systems from limited numbers of subsurface samples. Although the palaeochannels afforded no characteristic <b>textural</b> <b>signature,</b> they yield transverse grain-size patterns pointing to coastal movements during their evolution.

40|$|Post-caldera eruptions of Santorini, Greece, {{over the}} past 3000 years {{resulted}} {{in the formation of}} the Kameni Islands, which comprise a series of compositionally similar dacitic lava flows. Each lava flow has a distinct population of partially-crystalline mafic enclaves, which we propose were derived from the break-up of a layer of replenishing magma responsible for triggering the eruption. Five of the recent flows (erupted in 1570, 1939, 1940, 1941 and 1950) include enclaves of essentially identical andesitic bulk compositions, which formed by crystallization of originally aphyric melts prior to eruption. Detailed examination of angles subtended at the junctions between pairs of plagioclase grains demonstrates that enclaves from each flow have a characteristic <b>textural</b> <b>signature,</b> with distinct differences in the extent of quench-related modification of the original population of dihedral angles formed by impingement of growing grains. These variations suggest that the temperature difference between the host dacite and the replenishing andesite at the time of layer overturn and eruption differed between flows. The uniformity of major element compositions of both the replenishing magma and the host dacitic lava flows demonstrates that the critical parameter in determining the timing of layer-overturn is the pre-eruptive H 2 O content of both host dacite and replenishing magma. We suggest that the replenishing magma responsible for two of the three eruptions in the period 1939 - 1941 was significantly wetter than that responsible for the later 1950 eruption. The enclaves with the least amount of quench-related modification occur in the 1570 flow. We suggest that in this case the intruding magma was relatively dry. © 2005 Cambridge University Press...|$|E
40|$|Banded iron-formations (BIFs) are {{chemically}} precipitated {{sedimentary rocks}} in which Fe-rich bands or laminae alternate with Fe-poor ones. They formed {{within a specific}} time-span of the geological record. Their occurrence is restricted between 2. 3 and 1. 9 Ga, and characterises virtually all the major Precambrian-aged sedimentary basins of the world. The Precambrian Transvaal Basin in Griqualand West, South Africa, is noted for its well-developed BIF units. The Kuruman and Griquatown BIFs comprising the Asbesheuwels Subgroup (up to 1000 m thick) are the best known and thickest of these. As far as metallogenesis is concerned, the Kuruman BIF is of major importance, for it carries the world's largest crocidolite (blue asbestos) deposits. The uppermost, youngest member of iron-formation deposition in the Griqualand West Sequence {{is represented by the}} Voëlwater BIF. The direct association between the latter and the giant Mn-deposits of the Kalahari Field, renders the Voëlwater association unusual, if not unique, in the geological record. The Voëlwater BIF represents a typical example of the so-called "Superior-type", and in the area of study it has undergone late-diagennetic to low-grade metamorphic processes. This is evident from the mineralogical composition and <b>textural</b> <b>signature</b> of the various BIF lithologies. Specifically, the minerals that make up the Voëlwater BIF are mainly chert(quartz), Fe-oxides (magnetite and hematite), Fe-silicates (greenalite, stilpnomelane, minnesotaite, riebeckite, Fe-mica), Fe-carbonates (members of the dolomite-ankerite series and siderite), calcite and pyrite. Soft-sediment deformation structures and shear-stress indicators are abundant in carbonate-rich and granular, silicate-rich BIF lithologies respectively. The bulk chemical composition of the study rocks is relatively simple and is characterised by the abundance of essentially three elements, namely Si, Fe, and Ca, which make up more than 90 % of the total chemical composition of the Voëlwater BIFs. The detrital component of the study rocks is negligible. Mn-enrichments characterise all the transitional lithologies towards the interbedded Mn-orebodies, as well as the well-developed, hematitic BIF-unit between the Ongeluk lavas and the lower Mn-horizon. In terms of trace element composition, no significant enrichments or depletions, were encountered, except for some unusually high values of Sr and Ba and Co in carbonate-rich and Mn-rich lithologies respectively. Geochemical comparisons on the basis of major, trace and light rare-earth element composition verified the similarity between the Voëlwater BIF and other major Superior-type BIFs of the world (e. g. Kuruman, Griquatown, Sokoman, Biwabik, Gunflint, Mara-Mamba, Brockman, etc.). The processes that {{led to the formation of}} the Voëlwater BIFs may have been very similar to the ones described in various genetic models proposed in recent years. They would have involved a combination of: i. hydrothermal processes related to mid-ocean ridge (MOR) or hot-spot activity that acted as major iron suppliers; ii. storm-mixing in stratified oceans (bottom, anoxic, Fe⁺² reservoir-thermo- pycnocline zone-upper, mixed, SiO₂-saturated layer), largely dictated by seasonal changes and contemporaneous volcanism; iii. periodic, convection-driven upwelling mechanisms acting as major Fe-precipitators; and, iv. organic carbon productivity that was responsible for the anoxic diagenesis of the initial sediment. However, the origin of Fe and Mn for the genesis of the Voëlwater sediments was difficult to explain with typical convection-cell models in active mid-ocean ridges, in contrast to previous hypotheses. Instead, large-scale endogenous processes in the form of magma convection, underplating, differentiation and associated degassing, may have played a critical role in the supply of metals for the formation of large amounts of BIFs in the Precambrian. The present study of the Voëlwater BIF also bears strong implications regarding the metallogenesis of Mn in the Precambrian. The common association of Mn with carbonate-bearing sediments, the transitional character of the Voëlwater BIF towards carbonate lithologies (Mooidraai dolomites) and the critical timing of the deposition of the former in terms of the Precambrian atmospheric-lithospheric- hydrospheric evolution, may be important indicators for the exploration of large Mn-deposits in Precambrian sedimentary basins of the world. ...|$|E

The textural features are computed from sum and difference histogram and gray-level difference vector statistics defined at various pixel displacement distances derived from Landsat multispectral scanner data. Polar cloudiness, snow-covered mountainous regions, solid sea ice, glaciers, and open water have distinguishable texture features. This suggests that textural measures can be successfully {{applied to the}} detection of clouds over snow-covered mountains, an ability of considerable importance for the modeling of snow-melt runoff.

40|$|Topographic {{information}} {{is required for}} many Earth Science investigations. For example, topography is {{an important element in}} regional and global geomorphic studies because it reflects the interplay between the climate-driven processes of erosion and the tectonic processes of uplift. A number of techniques have been developed to analyze digital topographic data, including Fourier texture analysis. A Fourier transform of the topography of an area allows the spatial frequency content of the topography to be analyzed. Band-pass filtering of the transform produces images representing the amplitude of different spatial wavelengths. These are then used in a multi-band classification to map units based on their spatial frequency content. The results using a radar image instead of digital topography showed good correspondence to a geologic map, however brightness variations in the image unrelated to topography caused errors. An additional benefit to the use of Fourier band-pass images for the classification is that the <b>textural</b> <b>signatures</b> of the units are quantative measures of the spatial characteristics of the units that may be used to map similar units in similar environments...|$|R

These outcrops contain mineral and <b>textural</b> <b>signatures</b> that require interaction of, and possibly formation from, water. Many distinct layers are visible in the remote sensing data (e. g. Figure 1) and no work has ever characterized the full set of these materials that cover an area > 3 105 km 2 spanning 20 of longitude. Thus, whatever water-related process(es?) altered, and possibly formed, the rocks at the Opportunity landing site extended over a vast region of Mars. Yet many questions remain to be answered, such as: (1) in what capacity did water form and alter the deposits?, (2) what are the temporal and spatial relations with other major events known from ancient Mars?, and (3) would this type of environment have been conducive {{to the development of}} life? To address these questions we are completing a detailed geologic, stratigraphic, and thermophysical properties study of this widespread terrain. Specifically, we are drafting a 1 : 2 M-scale geological map covering the full extent of these water-related deposits.

On Earth, microbial populations have repeatedly adapted to low pH and both episodic and chronic water limitation, suggesting that, to a first approximation, the Meridiani plain {{may have been}} habitable during {{at least part of}} the interval when deposition and early diagenesis took place. On the other hand, the environmental conditions inferred for Meridiani deposition would have posed a challenge for prebiotic chemical reactions thought to have played a role in the origin of life on Earth. Orbital observations suggest that the combination of sulfate minerals and hematite found in Meridiani rocks may be unusual on the martian surface; however, there is reason to believe that acidity, aridity, and oxidizing conditions were broadly distributed on ancient Mars.

40|$|The {{timescales}} {{over which}} magmas in large silicic systems are reactivated, assembled and stored remains a fundamental question in volcanology. To address this question, we study timescales from Fe–Mg interdiffusion in orthopyroxenes and Ti diffusion in quartz from the caldera-forming 1200 km 3 Kidnappers and 200 km 3 Rocky Hill eruptions from the Mangakino volcanic centre (Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand). The two eruptions {{came from the}} same source area, have indistinguishable 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages (∼ 1. 0 Ma) and zircon U–Pb age spectra, but their respective deposits are separated by a short period of erosion. Compositions of pumice, glass and mineral species in the collective eruption deposits define multiple melt dominant bodies but indicate that these shared a common magmatic mush zone. Diffusion timescales from both eruptions are used to build on chemical and <b>textural</b> crystal <b>signatures</b> and interpret both the crystal growth histories and the timing of magma accumulation. Fe–Mg interdiffusion profiles in orthopyroxenes imply that the three melt-dominant bodies, established through extraction of melt and crystals from the common source, were generated within 600 years and with peak accumulation rates within 100 years of each eruption. In addition, a less-evolved melt interacted with the Kidnappers magma, beginning ∼ 30 years prior to and peaking within 3 years of the eruption. This interaction did not directly trigger the eruption, but may have primed the magmatic system. Orthopyroxene crystals with the same zoning patterns from the Kidnappers and Rocky Hill pumices yield consistently different diffusion timescales, suggesting a time break between the eruptions of ∼ 20 years (from core–rim zones) to ∼ 10 years (outer rim zones). Diffusion of Ti in quartz reveals similarly short timescales and magmatic residence times of < 30 years, suggesting quartz is only recording the last period of crystallization within the final eruptible melt. Accumulation of the eruptible magma for these two, closely successive eruptions was accomplished over centuries to decades, in contrast to the gestation time of the magmatic system of ∼ 200 kyr, as indicated by zircon age patterns. The magmatic system was able to recover after the Kidnappers eruption in only ∼ 10 – 20 years to accumulate enough eruptible melt and crystals for a second ∼ 200 km 3 eruption. Our data support concepts of large silicic systems being stored as long-lived crystal mushes, with eruptible melts generated over extraordinarily short timescales prior to eruption...|$|R
40|$|In the {{transitioning}} agricultural {{societies of}} the world, food security {{is an essential}} element of livelihood and economic development with the agricultural sector very often being the major employment factor and income source. Rapid population growth, urbanization, pollution, desertification, soil degradation and climate change pose a variety of threats to a sustainable agricultural development and can be expressed as agricultural vulnerability components. Diverse cropping patterns may help to adapt the agricultural systems to those hazards in terms of increasing the potential yield and resilience to water scarcity. Thus, the quantification of crop diversity using indices like the Simpson Index of Diversity (SID) e. g. through freely available remote sensing data becomes a very important issue. This however requires accurate land use classifications. In this study, the focus is set on the cropping system diversity of garden plots, summer crop fields and orchard plots which are the prevalent agricultural systems in the test area of the Fergana Valley in Uzbekistan. In order to improve the accuracy of land use classification algorithms with low or medium resolution data, a novel processing chain through the hitherto unique fusion of optical and SAR data from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel- 1 platforms is proposed.

40|$|Processes {{that operate}} at {{planetary}} surfaces {{have the potential}} to record a history of planetary evolution in the form of sedimentary rocks. This is important because our experience on Earth shows that sediments and sedimentary rocks are the dominant archive of high-resolution proxies of present and past tectonic, climatic, and biological processes. Our understanding of the evolution of Earth’s very ancient climate and paleobiological records derives from detailed examination of the mineralogical, <b>textural,</b> and geochemical <b>signatures</b> preserved in the sedimentary rock record. Sedimentary rocks were first recognized on Mars less than a decade ago (Malin and Edgett, 2000). Recent interpretations of data collected by the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft have confirmed the surprising abundance of these sedimentary rocks, the past role of water on the martian surface, and the similarity—in some cases—to sedimentary rocks formed on Earth. Thick sulfaterich deposits invite comparison to terrestrial evaporites (Grotzinger et al., 2005). In other cases, clay-rich strata are interpreted as the terminal deposits of source-to-sink systems with well-developed fluvial networks in the upper reaches of watersheds that date back to a much wetter period in Mars’ earliest history (Ehlmann et al., 2008; Metz et al., 2009). However, these Earth-like depositional systems contrast with other deposits that may be unique in the Solar System: for example, vast terrains as large as Earth’s continents covered by thick veneers of strata that may derive entirely from settling out of wind-transported dust (Bridges et al., 2010). Whatever their origin, {{it is now clear that}} the sedimentary rocks of Mars represent a new frontier for research. Mars science is in its golden era of exploration—the past decade of orbiter and landed missions has produced an extraordinary amount of new data relevant to the analysis of sediments and sedimentary rocks, and robust international programs exist for future missions. To help stimulate discussion of these data, the First International Conference on Mars Sedimentology and Stratigraphy was convened in El Paso, Texas, in April 2010. The contents of this white paper represent the most significant findings of the conference, with additional information provided by the coauthors, and focus on seven key questions for future investigation by the sedimentary geology community...|$|R
40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. Cancer therapies have evolved continuously, with the newest class being immunotherapies targeting the PD‐L 1 /PD‐ 1 pathway. This pathway is often overexpressed in malignancies, which allow the aberrant cells to evade the body’s natural immune response that would normally eliminate them. The novel therapies currently being investigated are monoclonal antibodies that target either the PD‐L 1 on the tumor cell or the PD‐ 1 on the lymphocyte. Considering there are significant toxicities with these therapies, namely gastrointestinal and endocrine adverse effects, a predictive tool that could allow physicians which patients are likely to respond to these immunotherapies could spare patients unnecessary therapy and potential economic harm. Since repetitive imaging of patients with cancer is necessary to monitor treatment response, advanced imaging analysis techniques on standard of care images, such as CT scans may provide insights into tumor patterns that could help to predict treatment response. Quantitative texture analysis (QTA) of computed tomography scans {{has been used in}} various settings to examine tissue heterogeneity as a predictive biomarker of response; we hypothesized that QTA may have potential value in predicting tumor response to immunotherapy. We performed a QTA on standard of care CT scans from patients to determine if a unique <b>textural</b> imaging <b>signature</b> could be identified that would serve as a predictive biomarker for response to PD‐L 1 /PD‐ 1 therapies in subjects with solid tumor malignancies in the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. This study examined the diagnostic standard of care CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CT CAP) at baseline and follow‐up, which were acquired as part of routine clinical care for tumor staging and treatment response in 20 subjects whose personal health care information was removed prior to analysis. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn around all identifiable tumor lesions on baseline CT scans provided that tumors were of reasonable size (> 10 mm in diameter) and conspicuity. CT texture analysis was performed on these lesions to obtain a histogram readout of tumor texture based upon tissue densities on a per pixel bases. The output values from the QTA platform provided an estimate of tumor signal properties as expressed as the mean pixel density, standard deviation, entropy, kurtosis, skewness, and mean positive pixel values. Each subject was designated as achieving either a RECIST based treatment response or not. Statistical modeling was then conducted using regression techniques. There was no identifiable signature when examining all of the lesions together, but there were statistically significant correlations noted between QTA and RECIST responses for lung‐based lesions. The QTA derived mean pixel density parameter was a major component of separating out responders from non‐response. Of the 14 lung lesions (8 responder vs. 6 nonresponder) {{there was a significant difference}} in the mean density with a threshold cutoff of 11. 91 (p < 0. 0001). A Mann‐Whitney U‐test was performed on the total data set yielding a Z statistic of 2. 6 (p= 0. 0092). Despite the relatively small number of patients in this initial study, there were promising findings regarding the mean density of lesions, suggesting that texture analysis can be used to predict if patients respond to PD‐L 1 /PD‐ 1 inhibitors.

L 1972; Groat, Carter et al. 1985; Enami, Suzuki et al. 1993; Perseil and Smith 1995; Della Ventura, Bellatreccia et al. 1999; Piccoli, Candela et al. 2000). It is also characterised by very sluggish diffusion of these elements, and as such it has the ability to resist most sub-solidus alteration. These characteristics make titanite a prime candidate for the ability to preserve a record of the petrogenetic processes which formed the igneous rocks in which it is found. In order to assess titanite’s ability to serve as a petrogenetic tool, a textural and geochemical study of titanite from different igneous environments was undertaken. The Ross of Mull Granite is an igneous complex located on the south west coast of the Isle of Mull, Scotland. It is a Caledonian age pluton that displays evidence of magma-mixing processes at depth and also contains notable amounts of titanite. Samples of different host granite and diorite enclave lithologies and relationships were documented and collected in order to asses the ability of titanite to retain evidence of magma-mixing processes within its compositional zoning. Titanite from the Ross of Mull Granite displays a large variety of textural features, both with respect to crystal shape and compositional zoning. The variation of the trace elements observed in titanite is a direct reflection of the compositional zoning pattern. Melts that are enriched in particular trace elements pass on that signature to the titanites. If melts of significantly contrasting chemistries mix or mingle, then titanite may record any significant instance of trace element diffusion between the melts. More importantly, there doesn’t need to be a transfer of trace elements between mingling/mixing melts for titanite to record evidence of the interaction. If the melts are of significantly different oxygen fugacities, then titanite may become destabilised and partially dissolve. This dissolution may only be temporary, but {{it may be difficult to}} tell if it was a product of increasing heat of the melt of if it was due to a change in oxygen fugacity. Titanite however, may record evidence of the cause of dissolution based on the nature of re-growth. As shown by some of the titanites within the Ross of Mull Granite, re-growth following a period of dissolution may be attributed to a change in oxygen fugacity if the new titanite growth is characterised by unusually low REE content. This is related to the nature of trace element incorporation in the titanite structure; REE are taken up due to coupled substitution mechanisms involving tetravalant Al and Fe. If a melt becomes reduced then the activity of ferric Fe will also be reduced, thus inhibiting the ability of titanite to take up REE by affecting the activity of the coupled substitution (Wones 1989; Piccoli, Candela et al. 2000). Titanite from the ROMG is largely characterised by compositional zoning that reflects the trace element chemistry of one of the end-member lithologies (host granite or dioritic enclaves), or has compositional zoning that reflects the changing conditions of the magmatic environment, namely: changes in melt composition, changes in temperature and pressure and changes in oxidation of the magma. In the case of the ROMG, all of these changes were wholly, or in part, brought about by magma mixing processes. Another way in which titanite reflects processes of petrogenesis is that it has been found to reflect the degree of homogenisation of the melt from which it has crystallised. To further asses the ability of titanite serve as a petrogenetic tool, a study was made of the characteristics of titanite from the volcanic environment. The Fish Canyon Tuff, from the San Juan volcanic field, Colorado, USA, was chosen as a suitable candidate for study due to its well documented nature; it is the largest known pyroclastic eruption to be documented. The Fish Canyon tuff also contains numerous phenocrysts of titanite. Eruption of the Fish Canyon Tuff is thought to have been brought about by the thermal rejuvenation of a batholith-sized magma chamber which had previously cooled to a rigid crystal mush (Bachmann and Bergantz 2003). The main conclusion from the study of titanites from the Fish Canyon Tuff and is that evidence for the thermal rejuvenation of the magma chamber by a mafic melt prior to eruption is preserved in the <b>textural</b> and chemical <b>signature</b> preserved in the compositional zoning of the titanites as dissolution and re-growth textures. This study illustrates that titanite is able to not only preserve evidence of magma mixing processes occurring at depth, but it is also able to preserve evidence of similar processes all the way through to the volcanic environment...|$|R
40|$|Os nefelina sienitos miasquíticos a intermediários do Maciço Alcalino Poços de Caldas (MAPC), em especial o tipo da Pedreira, possuem {{enclaves}} microgranulares félsicos e máficoultramáficos intrigantes. O nefelina sienito da Pedreira (NeS) pode ser divido em duas fácies texturais: uma de granulação média-grossa a grossa (NeS-g), outra de granulação média-fina a fina (NeS-f). O NeSg possui, mais comumente, enclaves microgranulares félsicos (EMF), de composição fonolítica. Estes enclaves podem envolver enclaves menores, máfico-ultramáficos, gerando enclaves duplos. O NeSf apresenta mais tipicamente enclaves microgranulares máfico-ultramáficos (EMM), ora com feições de rompimento em estado plástico, ora com bordas angulosas e lineares. Diques de composição fonolítica cortam o NeS-g. As rochas estudadas neste trabalho são constituídas por nefelina, feldspato alcalino e clinopiroxênio. Como fase acessória, têm-se titanita, magnetita e biotita-flogopita. Apatita ocorre também como mineral acessório, com exceção para o NeS-g. No NeS-g, no NeS-f e nos EMF, o clinopiroxênio possui duas fases texturais: uma prismática, verde (egirina-augita) que também pode ter núcleo róseo/incolor (diopsídio, mais comum no NeS-f e no EMF); outra fibrosa, também verde, porém fortemente pleocroica (egirina). Os EMM são constituídos essencialmente por diopsídio, com M(médio) ~ 80. Quando porfirítico, o enclave possui macrocristais de diopsídio róseo/incolor (#mg~ 0, 9) imersos numa matriz de diopsídio verde (#mg~ 0, 8), ambos prismáticos. Magnetita dos NeS possui pouca variação, com teores baixos de Ti, diferente da magnetita dos enclaves. A assinatura química da nefelina dos EMM é equivalente à do NeS-f, com mais Fe 3 + e menos K em relação ao NeS-g. Feldspato alcalino tende a ser mais potássico nos EMF e apresenta maior variação composicional nos EMM (Ab 10 - 33 Or 72 - 80). Biotita está presente somente nos EMF e flogopita somente nos EMM. O padrão de elementos terras raras (ETR) do clinopiroxênio róseo/incolor do NeS-f é semelhante ao do EMM. Egirina-augita e egirina possuem enriquecimento em ETR pesados. Os enclaves máfico-ultramáficos são ultrabásicos, classificados como tefritos/basanitos (Le Bas et al., 1986) ou nefelinitos/ankaratritos (De La Roche et al., 1980), enquanto as rochas félsicas são intermediárias, correspondentes a fonolitos ou nefelina sienitos, dependendo da granulometria. Os diques e o NeS-f são peralcalinos, enquanto o EMF, o NeS-g e os EMM são peralcalinos/metaluminosos. As rochas ultramáficas/ultrabásicas, aflorantes na porção noroeste do Maciço Alcalino Poços de Caldas (Ulbrich et al., 2002), possuem padrões de ETR que indicam que estas rochas podem estar geneticamente ligadas aos enclaves máfico-ultramáficos. De uma forma geral, as características estruturais, texturais e químicas das rochas estudadas corroboram com a hipótese de coexistência de pelo menos dois magmas distintos: um félsico sienítico insaturado outro ultramáfico/ultrabásico, que teriam interagido e formado os os EMM e o NeSf, principalmente. Enquanto num estágio posterior de cristalização do magma, porém ainda em estado plástico, o dique teria se colocado, com parcial absorção da rocha pelos nefelina sienitos, formando os EMF. The miaskitic {{to intermediate}} nepheline syenites of Poços de Caldas Alkaline Massif, especially the Pedreira type, have intriguing felsic and mafic-ultramafic microgranular enclaves. The Pedreiras nepheline syenite type (NeS) {{can be divided}} into two textural facies: one that is medium-coarse to coarse grained (NeS-c) and the other that varies between medium-fine to fine grained (NeS-f). It is common among the NeS-c microgranular felsic enclaves (MFE) with phonolitic composition. These enclaves may develop smaller ones maficultramafic, generating double enclaves. The NeS-f usually presents mafic-ultramafic enclaves (MME), sometimes showing disrupted features in plastic stage and sometimes angular and linear edges. Phonolitic dykes cut the NeS-c. The rocks studied in this work are formed by nepheline, alkali-feldspar and clinopyroxene. The accessory phase is characterized by titanite, magnetite and biotite-phlogopite. In exception to the NeS-c, apatite also occurs as an accessory mineral. In the NeS-c, NeS-f and MFE, the clinopyroxene presents two textural phases: a green prismatic one (aegirine-augite), which also may have a pinkish/colourless core (diopsyde, which is common in the NeS-f and MFE); the other one is fibrous, also green, however with strongly pleocroism (aegirine). Essencially, the MME are formed by diopsyde, with M(medium) ~ 80. When porphyritic, the enclave has macrocrystals of pinkish/colourless diopsyde (with mg#~ 0, 9) in a green diopsyde (mg#~ 0, 8) matrix, both prismatic. In the NeS, the magnetite varies little: with low levels of Ti, differently from the enclaves magnetite. The chemical signature of the nepheline in the MME equals to the one present in the NeS-f and has more Fe 3 + and less K when compared to the NeS-c. The alkaline feldspar in the MFE has more potassium in its structure and presents a higher compositional variation in the MME (Ab 10 - 33 Or 72 - 80). It is also noticeable that biotite is a component only to the MFE, while the phlogopite occurs in the MME. The rare earth elements (REE) pattern in the pinkish/colourless clinopyroxene of the NeS-f is similar to the MME. Both aegirine-augite and aegirine present an enrichment regarding the heavy REE. The MME are ultrabasic, classified as tephrite/basanite (Le Bas et al., 1986) or nephelinite/ankaratrites (De La Roche et al., 1980), while the felsic rocks are intermediate, corresponding to phonolite and nepheline syenite, depending on the grain size. The dykes and the NeS-f are peralkaline, while the MFE, NeS-c and the MME are peralkaline/metaluminous. The ultrabasic/ultrapotassic rocks, outcropping in the northwestern portion of the PCAM (Ulbrich et al., 2002), have REE patterns wich indicate that these rocks may be genetically related to mafic-ultramafic enclaves. Generally, the structural, <b>textural</b> and chemical <b>signatures</b> of the rocks studied in this work confirm the hypothesis of the coexistence of at least two different magmas: a syenitic undersaturated felsic one and a ultramafic/ultrabasic one, and their interaction resulted in the MME and, above all, the NeS-f. While in a late stage of magma cristalization, but still in the plastic state, the dike would be placed, with partial absorption of the rock by the nepheline syenite, resulting in the EMF...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{research}} {{focuses on}} clast and crystal-specific studies to investigate the pre- and syn-eruptive magmatic processes of two supereruptions in the TVZ: the 1. 21 Ma Ongatiti (> 500 km 3) and the 1. 0 Ma Kidnappers (~ 1200 km 3), together with the smaller (~ 200 km 3) 1. 0 Ma Rocky Hill eruption from the Mangakino Volcanic Centre (MVC). Crystallisation histories determined through SIMS U-Pb dating of zircons reveal that the paired Kidnappers and Rocky Hill eruptions were products of a common magmatic system, which built over ~ 200 kyr, in the time break after the Ongatiti eruption. U-Pb age spectra from the Ongatiti show a protracted crystallisation history (over ~ 250 kyr), in which the majority of zircon crystallised ~ 100 kyr prior to eruption in a crystal mush. Zircons then ascended with melt during accumulation of the final erupted magma body in the shallow crust. Zircons remained stable in the melt dominant body but underwent little further crystallisation. Zircons from all three systems record common geochemical processes governed by the fractionating assemblage (predominantly plagioclase and amphibole). In particular, the MREE/HREE ratios and Sr concentrations of zircons from the Ongatiti record imply two contrasting source regions governed by different proportions of crystallising amphibole. The in-situ major and trace element chemistry of glass shards and crystals from the Kidnappers fall deposit reveal that magma within the Kidnappers was stored in three discrete bodies, which were systematically tapped {{during the early stages}} of eruption. Temperature and pressure (T-P) estimates from amphibole and Fe-Ti oxide equilibria from each magma type are similar and therefore the three magma bodies were adjacent, not vertically stacked, in the crust. Amphibole model T-P estimates range from 770 to 840 °C and 90 to 170 MPa corresponding to pre-eruptive storage depths of ~ 4. 0 - 6. 5 km. The systematic evacuation of the three independent magma bodies implies that there was tectonic triggering and linkage of eruptions. The termination of fall deposition and onset of the overlying ignimbrite emplacement marks the point of widespread caldera collapse and the catastrophic evacuation of a wider variety of melt during the Kidnappers eruption. Pumice compositions from the Kidnappers ignimbrite fall into three groups, two of which (KI- 1 and KI- 2) can be matched to bodies tapped during the fall phase of the eruption, {{with the addition of a}} further discrete batch of lower SiO 2 (KI- 3) magma. Core-rim textural and chemical variations in major crystal phases (plagioclase, amphibole and orthopyroxene) suggest each compositional group was sourced from a common mush but underwent a unique magmatic history during the development of melt-dominant bodies in the final stages prior to eruption. The field relationships and distinctive appearance of the Rocky Hill ignimbrite (~ 200 km 3 DRE) and the underlying Kidnappers ignimbrite suggests that the two deposits are from distinct eruption events. However, major and trace element chemistry of matrix glass, coupled with the <b>textural</b> and chemical <b>signatures</b> of crystals suggests the magma erupted during the Rocky Hill was generated from the same source or mush zone as the Kidnappers. The two largest melt-dominant bodies (KI- 1 and KI- 2) within the Kidnappers were renewed, underwent mixing and incorporation of marginal material to form two magma types (RH- 1 and RH- 2) in the time break prior to the Rocky Hill eruption. Fe-Mg interdiffusion timescales in orthopyroxenes from the Kidnappers and Rocky Hill deposits suggest the establishment of the final melt-dominant bodies, through extraction of melt and crystals from a common mush, occurred within 1000 years, and peaked within centuries of each eruption. In addition, one discrete batch of Kidnappers melt has evidence for interaction with a lesser evolved melt within 50 yrs prior to eruption. This rejuvenation event was not the eruption trigger but may have primed the magma for eruption. The difference in timescales from common zones from both the Kidnappers and Rocky Hill orthopyroxene, recording the same processes reveal the time break between the two eruptions was ~ 20 - 40 years. This work highlights the rapidity of rejuvenation and renewal of the melt-dominant bodies within the Kidnappers/Rocky Hill magmatic system. The textural and in-situ compositional signatures of crystals from the Ongatiti ignimbrite imply the final erupted magma body was assembled from a thermally and chemically zoned mush, which extended to the base of the quartzofeldspathic crust (~ 15 km). The mush was close to water saturation and was dominated by amphibole crystallisation. Melt and crystals (including the majority of zircons) were extracted from the mush and ascended to 4 - 6 km depths during the development of a crystal-rich (20 - 30 %), but melt-dominant body. Significant crystallisation of plagioclase (and lesser proportions of orthopyroxene and amphibole) occurred in an event involving the gradual heating and/or increase of water in the rhyolite, from a broadly andesitic underplated magma. Homogeneous crystal rim and matrix glass compositions imply the final erupted volume of magma was effectively mixed through convection. Eu/Eu* values of whole-rock and matrix glass suggest little crystal-melt separation occurred in the melt-dominant magma body prior to eruption. This work has implications for understanding the generation, storage and eruption of large-scale silicic magma systems. The Ongatiti ignimbrite does not represent either an erupted mush, or a stratified magma chamber, suggesting an alternative model for the development of eruptible magma within large-scale silicic systems. The Kidnappers/Rocky Hill sequence records a complex interplay of multiple melt-dominant bodies, which were established and renewed on rapid timescales. The rapid timescales for the development of melt-dominant bodies and the systematic tapping of magmas in the Kidnappers/Rocky Hill system imply that tectonics may have had a strong external control on the eruptions at Mangakino...|$|R
