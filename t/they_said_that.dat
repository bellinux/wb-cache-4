5|$|At 3:34p.m., after a {{sweep of}} Founders Library was {{conducted}} and officers determined that Neptune and DuSable were not shooting sites, they declared the area safe. Police officers established a reception area for law enforcement personnel at Wirtz Hall, and an investigative command center at Holmes Student Center. By 4:00p.m. CST, school officials announced {{that there was no}} further danger. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> counselors would be made available in all residence halls.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu writers {{appreciated}} {{the amount of}} freedom the player has. In their reviews of the PlayStation and the Game Boy Advance versions, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the gameplay still holds up. They found the demon fusion system to be excellent and fun, and {{did not think it}} felt outdated. Kurt Kalata and Cristopher J. Snelgrove of Hardcore Gaming 101 {{appreciated the}} game's lowered difficulty compared to that of the first Shin Megami Tensei.|$|E

When I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I was to take it to-morrow, they showed no concern whatever. I looked in their faces for traces of anxiety. There weren't any. <b>They</b> all <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it wouldn't hurt me, that it was nothing.|$|R

5|$|Some {{witnesses}} {{maintained that}} the killer's claim to be John A. Covington was telling. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> both Sharp and Beauchamp had been acquainted with John W. Covington, and that Beauchamp often mistakenly called him John A. Covington. Other witnesses told of threats they had heard Beauchamp make against Sharp.|$|E
5|$|Two of the judges, Justice Deane and Justice Gaudron, {{went further}} and {{suggested}} {{that the right to}} representation in some circumstances is founded in the Constitution. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Chapter Three of the Constitution, which represents the Judicature with the notion of separation of powers, and vests judicial power exclusively in the courts, requires that judicial process and fairness be observed.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his tenants, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.|$|E

5|$|Hines led sixty {{men from}} Toronto, Ontario, on August 25, 1864. They arrived during the Democratic Party National Convention held in Chicago that year. The Copperheads had told Hines {{to wait until}} that time, as <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> 50,000 Copperheads would {{be there for the}} event. However, encountering Copperhead {{hesitation}} to assist Hines and his force, and with Federal authorities apparently knowledgeable of the plot, Hines and his men were forced to flee Chicago on August 30, 1864. Many of the men thought Anderson may have been a double agent, forcing him to leave the group. A second attempt to free the Camp Douglas Confederate prisoners occurred during the United States Presidential Election of 1864, but that plan was also foiled.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Alston {{managed the}} St. Paul Saints, a Dodgers Class AAA affiliate, to an 86-68 win-loss record. The team {{finished}} in third place, 14 games behind an Indianapolis Indians team managed by Al López. That year, Alston managed Campanella again, where Campanella integrated the American Association. The media {{was critical of}} Alston for playing Campanella; <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the catcher was simply there to integrate the league. Campanella hit 13 home runs in 35 games and fans were dismayed when he was called up to the Dodgers. The 1949 Saints finished with a 93-60 record and four of its players collected more than 90 runs batted in (RBI). The team finished in first place, half a game in front of Indianapolis. During the baseball off-season, Alston worked as a teacher in Darrtown.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{government}} officials {{denied that the}} dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction {{as the source of}} the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the deaths could have been prevented. According to one account, two master planned communities were situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|On 23 November, it was {{announced}} that the families of each victim of the fire would receive 960,000 yuan in compensation for the ordeal. The compensation would include 650,000 yuan for every death and 310,000 yuan in financial assistance from the government and charities. Zhang Renliang, the top official of Jing'an District, said that Shanghai residents and foreign workers would be compensated equally. Survivors of the blaze would be fully compensated for the loss of possessions and property. Some who lost relatives in the disaster, however, were not satisfied with the announcement. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the compensation plan was not enough to pay for another apartment in the district, and that they would rather have a new apartment than the money.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Desha's personal items {{could easily have been}} planted where they were found. They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
5|$|The {{two players}} {{did not tell}} their {{teammates}} or management about the deal, feeling that their interactions with bookmakers would meet with disapproval. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they {{did not feel that}} their liaisons were harming their team's chances in any way. They remained silent even after they reported Pakistan captain Saleem Malik for attempting to bribe them during the team's subsequent tour of Pakistan. Australian coach Bob Simpson later said that he was unaware of these events, asserting that his anti-betting attitude would have deterred any players from discussing their involvement in such matters with him.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses near King at {{the moment}} of his death said that the shot came from another location. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> it came from behind thick {{shrubbery}} near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) that were left in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints also determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich {{was tried}} in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a {{trafficking}} offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges. During the lengthy trial the accused had no legal representation. Although he had applied to the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria for assistance, <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they would only help him if he pleaded guilty, an option which Dietrich {{did not want to}} take. He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance, but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge—regarding the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to that which was involved in the first three charges—he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court. Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, but that court refused to hear his appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Fischer and Cristina {{often did}} outdoor {{activities}} together, but Fischer's stepmother {{thought they were}} only friends. She said that she never saw them hold hands or behave {{in a way that}} suggested intimacy. According to his friends, Fischer went with Cristina to South Padre Island, Texas, during spring break and had sex with her in her parents' condominium. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he did not brag about it, and in fact seemed to regret his decision. Cristina denied this ever happened. Later that year they attended St. Joe's prom together. In June 1992, Fischer broke up with Cristina; he told one of his friends that their relationship was only physical, and he did not feel an emotional attachment to her. Fischer had given Cristina his ring while they were dating, and once they broke up he asked her to return it. Cristina refused.|$|E
5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, there would be the odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it {{would not be able to}} hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E
5|$|Gupte {{described}} his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight. Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable {{and that it}} provided him with a foil to express rage and anguish. He worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from European and Japanese cinema. Chandan Roy Sanyal {{described his}} character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti-Narcotics Bureau. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{to prepare for the}} roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script and understanding the characters, and discussing it with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid {{that he did not have}} much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.|$|E

50|$|On 14 March, {{security}} forces raided an apartment shared by four Western journalists and deported them. Reporters Without Borders condemned {{the action and}} noted that two other foreign journalists were also deported two days earlier.
