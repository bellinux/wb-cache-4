40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{study was}} carried out for the lowest-level elevation method to retrieve total (sea ice+snow) freeboard from Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) elevation measurements in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Varying the percentage (P) of elevations used to approximate the instantaneous sea-surface height can cause widespread changes of a few to > 10 cm in the <b>total</b> <b>freeboard</b> obtained. Other input parameters have a smaller influence on the overall mean <b>total</b> <b>freeboard</b> but can cause large regional differences. These results, together with published ICESat elevation precision and accuracy, suggest that three times the mean per gridcell single-laser-shot error budget {{can be used as}} an estimate for freeboard uncertainty. Theoretical relative ice thickness uncertainty ranges between 20 % and 80 % for typical freeboard and snow properties. Ice thickness is computed from <b>total</b> <b>freeboard</b> using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) snow depth data. Average ice thickness for the Weddell Sea is 1. 73 0. 38 m for ICESat measurements from 2004 to 2006, in agreement with previous work. The mean uncertainty is 0. 72 0. 09 m. Our comparison with data of an alternative approach, which assumes that sea-ice freeboard is zero and that <b>total</b> <b>freeboard</b> equals snow depth, reveals an average sea-ice thickness difference of 0. 77 m...|$|E
40|$|During {{the spring}} of 2009, the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) system on the IceBridge mission {{acquired}} cross-basin surveys of surface elevations of Arctic sea ice. In this paper, the <b>total</b> <b>freeboard</b> derived from four 2000 km transects are examined and compared with those from the 2009 ICESat campaign. <b>Total</b> <b>freeboard,</b> {{the sum of the}} snow and ice freeboards, is the elevation of the air-snow interface above the local sea surface. Prior to freeboard retrieval, signal dependent range biases are corrected. With data from a near co-incident outbound and return track on 21 April, we show that our estimates of the freeboard are repeatable to within 4 cm but dependent locally on the density and quality of sea surface references. Overall difference between the ATM and ICESat freeboards for the four transects is 0. 7 (8. 5) cm (quantity in bracket is standard deviation), with a correlation of 0. 78 between the data sets of one hundred seventy-eight 50 km averages. This establishes a level of confidence in the use of ATM freeboards to provide regional samplings that are consistent with ICESat. In early April, mean freeboards are 41 cm and 55 cm over first year and multiyear sea ice (MYI), respectively. Regionally, the lowest mean ice freeboard (28 cm) is seen on 5 April where the flight track sampled the large expanse of seasonal ice in the western Arctic. The highest mean freeboard (71 cm) is seen in the multiyear ice just west of Ellesmere Island from 21 April. The relatively large unmodeled variability of the residual sea surface resolved by ATM elevations is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Snow on Antarctic sea ice plays a {{key role}} for sea ice {{physical}} processes and complicates retrieval of sea ice thickness using altimetry. Current methods of snow depth retrieval are based on satellite microwave radiometry, which perform best for dry, homogeneous snow packs on level sea ice. We introduce an alternative approach based on in-situ measurements of total (sea ice plus snow) freeboard and snow depth, which we use to compute snow depth on sea ice from Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) <b>total</b> <b>freeboard</b> observations. We compare ICESat snow depth for early winter and spring of the years 2004 through 2006 with the Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer aboard EOS (AMSR-E) snow depth product. We find ICESat snow depths agree more closely with ship-based visual and air-borne snow radar observations than AMSR-E snow depths. We obtain average modal and mean ICESat snow depths, which exceed AMSR-E snow depths by 5 - 10 cm in winter and 10 - 15 cm in spring. We observe an increase in ICESat snow depth from winter to spring for most Antarctic regions in accordance with ground-based observations, in contrast to AMSR-E snow depths, which we find to stay constant or to decrease. We suggest satellite laser altimetry as an alternative method to derive snow depth on Antarctic sea ice, which is independent of snow physical properties...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{investigation}} {{to quantify the}} influence of the sub-ice platelet layer on satellite measurements of <b>total</b> <b>freeboard</b> and their conversion to thickness of Antarctic sea ice. The sub-ice platelet layer forms {{as a result of the}} seaward advection of supercooled ice shelf water from beneath ice shelves. This ice shelf water provides an oceanic heat sink promoting the formation of platelet crystals which accumulate at the sea ice–ocean interface. The build-up of this porous layer increases sea ice freeboard, and if not accounted for, leads to overestimates of sea ice thickness from surface elevation measurements. In order to quantify this buoyant effect, the solid fraction of the sub-ice platelet layer must be estimated. An extensive in situ data set measured in 2011 in McMurdo Sound in the southwestern Ross Sea is used to achieve this. We use drill-hole measurements and the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption to estimate a mean value for the solid fraction of this sub-ice platelet layer of 0. 16. This is highly dependent upon the uncertainty in sea ice density. We test this value with independent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) surface elevation data to estimate sea ice thickness. We find that sea ice thickness can be overestimated by up to 19 %, with a mean deviation of 12 % as a result of {{the influence of the}} sub-ice platelet layer. It is concluded that within 100 km of an ice shelf this influence might need to be considered when undertaking sea ice thickness investigations using remote sensing surface elevation measurements...|$|E
40|$|Accurate circum-Antarctic sea-ice {{thickness}} is urgently {{required to}} better understand the different sea-ice cover evolution in both polar regions. Satellite radar and laser altimetry are currently the most promising tools for sea-ice thickness retrieval. We present qualitative inter-comparisons of winter and spring circum-Antarctic sea-ice thickness computed with different approaches from Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimeter total (sea ice plus snow) freeboard estimates. We find that approach A, which assumes <b>total</b> <b>freeboard</b> equals snow depth, and approach B, which uses empirical linear relationships between freeboard and thickness, provide the lowest sea-ice thickness and the smallest winter-to-spring increase in seasonal average modal and mean sea-ice thickness: A: 0. 0 m and 0. 04 m, B: 0. 17 and 0. 16 m, respectively. Approach C uses contemporary snow depth from satellite microwave radiometry, and we derive comparably large sea-ice thickness. Here we observe an unrealistically large winter-to-spring increase in seasonal average modal and mean sea-ice thickness of 0. 68 m and 0. 65 m, respectively, which we attribute to biases in the snow depth. We present a conceptually new approach D. It assumes that the two-layer system (sea ice, snow) can be represented by one layer. This layer has a modified density, which takes into account the influence of the snow on sea-ice buoyancy. With approach D we obtain thickness values and a winter-to-spring increase in average modal and mean sea-ice thickness of 0. 17 m and 0. 23 m, respectively, which lay between those of approaches B and C. We discuss retrieval uncertainty, systematic uncertainty sources, and the impact of grid resolution. We find that sea-ice thickness obtained with approaches C and D agrees best with independent sea-ice thickness information—if we take into account the potential bias of in situ and ship-based observations...|$|E
40|$|The {{area of the}} Southern Ocean {{covered by}} sea ice is {{relatively}} well described by a longterm time series of satellite observations spanning over 35 years. Throughout the seasonal cycle, Antarctic sea-ice cover varies between approximately 3 x 10 ⁶ km² {{at the end of}} summer to approximately 20 x 10 ⁶ km² during winter. This has profound implications for ocean-atmosphere heat and momentum exchange and also for global oceanic circulation induced by sea-ice production and melt. However, the thickness distribution of Antarctic sea-ice is poorly described. Without detailed knowledge of the distribution of sea-ice thickness (and hence volume) it is difficult to assess the magnitude of its influence, and its feedback within the ocean-ice-atmosphere system. Current estimates of the sea-ice thickness distribution derived from satellite-based altimetry rely on empirical models describing the relationship between sea-ice topography, snow depth and sea-ice draft. The input to these empirical models include approximations for the density of snow, sea ice and seawater, and relationships between snow depth and the <b>total</b> <b>freeboard</b> (ice + snow) of sea ice derived from sparse in-situ observations. Further, observations from comparatively lower resolution satellite altimetry remain insensitive to small scale features that often characterise sea ice. This research estimates high-resolution sea-ice thickness from airborne nadir-looking photography and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), deployed over East Antarctic pack ice between 2007 and 2012. It presents a detailed analysis of empirical models for snow depth estimation derived from in-situ observations. For altimetry without coincident methods to remotely sense the snow/ice interface, using an empirical relationship between snow depth and measured elevation is the only available means to estimate snow depth. This represents a novel direct comparison between empirical snow depth models and in situ observations at scales of less than hundreds of metres. Examination of sources of uncertainty in altimetry observations follow, with the development of a method for deriving the uncertainty of each point position in a LiDAR swath. This allows the rigorous propagation of uncertainties from the airborne instruments through to snow depth and ice thickness estimates. A unique comparison of draft estimates from airborne LiDAR with sea-ice draft mapped by upward looking SONAR from an underwater robot forms a key component of this research. SONAR-based ice drafts are used to empirically derive parameters for the ice thickness model applied to airborne LiDAR observations. Using the same small patch of sea ice, relationships between surface and under-ice features are explored, providing a unique insight into how well ice drafts derived from surface topography characterise the under-ice environment. The empirically derived model parameters from this exercise are then applied to a larger-scale dataset, which is compared to near-coincident ship-based visual sea-ice observations (using the ASPeCt protocol). Using in situ and sonar observations collected by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to inform parameter choices for modelling sea ice thickness from LiDAR altimetry, a close match between sub-floe scale ice draft from AUV and LiDAR-derived estimates was obtained. The ice density parameter used in the model was artificially high, at 915. 6 kgm³ compared to observed values which ranged from 800 kg m³ to 870 kg m³ on SIPEX-II. The distribution of ice keels associated with surface ridges was broadly similar in both AUV observations and LiDAR-derived estimates, although keels modelled using surface topography are narrower and deeper than keels present in the AUV observations. Smallscale topography was also added at the ice-ocean interface for draft estimates from airborne LiDAR, reflecting the influence of snow dunes at the surface. Importantly, co registration of in situ, AUV and airborne observations shows clearly that in situ observations captured only the thinnest and least deformed region of the surveyed ice floe. At a broader scale, the knowledge gained from validating sea ice thickness estimates over a single floe was applied to a 120 km flight leg with a near-coincident ASPeCt ship-based ice thickness observations. The distribution of ice thickness estimates from airborne LiDAR exhibited a shallow peak in the 3 m to 4 m range, where ship-based observations were predominantly showing ice thicknesses between 1 m to 2 m. This pattern is also seen for the smaller floe-scale study, suggesting that in situ observations for regions of deformed ice off East Antarctica may only represent one tail of the sea-ice thickness distribution. The implications for the use of in situ observations in tuning algorithms for satellite-based estimates of sea-ice thickness are clear, suggesting a bias toward thin ice especially in regions of heavy deformation. This work advocates for the combination of multiple observation types and techniques given their ability to offer insight into biases that affect a particular method at a particular spatial scale. Technologies spanning in situ, airborne and satellite platforms have a strong and integrated future in sea-ice observation...|$|E
