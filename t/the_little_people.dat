This video series centered around two children named Timmy and Penny and their Baby Sister, their parents, and their dog Lucky. In 1991, <b>the</b> Original <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> figures were redesigned for children.

25|$|When he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups had {{a second}} vision {{involving}} <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People,</b> one that changed the fate of his entire tribe. Plenty Coups' family had moved to be with other bands of Crow lodging in the Beartooth Mountains. All the young men were challenged {{to go into the}} hills to seek visions, and Plenty Coups did so. Plenty Coups walked for two days (fasting as he went) and entered the Crazy Mountains, but had no vision. He returned a few days later with three friends, fasted, and took sweat-baths. He decided to cut off the tip of his left index finger as an offering to the spirits. That night, he dreamt of the chief of <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> again. The chief introduced Plenty Coups to a buffalo that turned into a man with buffalo-like features (the buffalo-man), who led him underground and down a tunnel or path toward the Pryor Mountains. For two days, he traveled underground among throngs of American bison. Finally, the buffalo-man showed Plenty Coups a vision of endless streams of bison coming out of {{a hole in the ground}} but disappearing. Then a second stream of bison—with different colors (even spots), tails, and sounds—came up out of the ground, and remained on the plains. Plenty Coups had a vision of himself as an old man lodged near the Medicine Rocks, and of a vast forest whose trees had been felled by a great wind. Only a chickadee remained. A voice told Plenty Coups that the day of the Plains Indian was ending, and that white men would swarm over the land like buffalo. But the chickadee remains, because it is a good listener, develops its mind, and survives by its wits.|$|E
25|$|A {{graduate}} of University College Dublin, Ó Dálaigh was a committed Fianna Fáil supporter {{who served on}} the party's National Executive in the 1930s, he became Ireland's youngest Attorney General in 1946 under Taoiseach Éamon de Valera, serving until 1948. Unsuccessful in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann elections in 1948 and 1951, he was re-appointed as Attorney General in 1951 and in 1953 he was appointed as the youngest member of the Supreme Court by his mentor, de Valera. Less than a decade later, he became Chief Justice, when selected by then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass. He was a keen actor in his early years and became a close friend of actor Cyril Cusack. It is commonly stated that Ó Dálaigh and Cusack picketed the Dublin launch of Disney's Darby O'Gill and <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People,</b> for what they felt was the film's stereotyping of Irish people. However, there is no contemporary reference of this ever occurring.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} been {{described}} by CBS News, Rotten Tomatoes, and ComingSoon.com as a science fiction cult classic. However film critic Mark Kermode reported that The Fifth Element {{was one of the most}} divisive films among his readers, regarded as both the best and the worst summer blockbuster of all time. Kermode recalled his own experience: [...] "I remember very clearly being in Cannes when [...] Fifth Element was first played, and it really divided the audience." [...] Stephen Cass of Discover ranked the film the third-best science fiction film on subscription service Hulu, writing, [...] "People seem to either like or loathe The Fifth Element ...Lavish visuals and entertaining performances from Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman make this movie worth watching." [...] In some circles the film has gained a [...] "so-bad-it's-good" [...] status; Meredith Woerner of io9 listed The Fifth Element as one of [...] "The 20 Best Worst Science Fiction Movies of All Time". In 2007 the Visual Effects Society placed The Fifth Element at No. 50, tied with Darby O'Gill and <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People,</b> on their list of the 50 most influential visual effects films of all time. In 2014, Time Out listed the film at No. 42 on their [...] "100 best sci-fi movies" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Ferman's son, Edward Ferman, was {{managing}} editor during Davidson's tenure as editor. [...] When Davidson left, Joseph Ferman {{took over the}} editorial chair, but in reality Edward Ferman was doing all the editorial work, and by the May 1965 issue was in full control of the magazine. [...] It remained eclectic through the 1960s and 1970s, publishing work by New Wave writers such as Thomas Disch and John Sladek, along with new US writers such as Samuel Delany and Roger Zelazny, hard science fiction stories by Gregory Benford and John Varley, fantasies by Sterling Lanier and Tom Reamy, and horror by Charles L. Grant and Stephen King. [...] The mid-1960s saw {{an increase in the}} diversity of stories appearing elsewhere in the field; magazines like New Worlds and Science Fantasy published material that previously could only have appeared in F. [...] Sf author Christopher Priest, writing in 1978, commented that many writers later considered part of the New Wave soon found [...] "a natural home for their work" [...] in F. [...] In Ashley's view {{the rest of the field}} was starting to catch up to Fs open-mindedness, but this did not lead to a drop in Fs quality; the end of the 1960s saw Ferman printing some old-fashioned material such as John Christopher's novel about miniaturization, <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People,</b> alongside much of Roger Zelazny's early output, and [...] "anarchic and often indefinable" [...] stories by R.A.

500|$|A {{published}} synopsis in The Nickelodeon {{reads as}} follows, [...] "The night before Christmas, Alice, {{a child of}} wealth, after going through the usual form of hanging up her stocking, is put to bed by her maid. Alice falls asleep and dreams. Enter Santa Claus and Gnomes who tell Alice to follow her and they will show her part of their Funnyland. Alice follows <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>people</b> under the special protection of a policeman two foot high. The little party are seen trotting through beautiful glens and dales until they reach Funnyland. Santa Claus tells {{her that if she}} is a good girl all the animals and toys here are hers; as Alice touches each one they come to life. The teddy bear steps out to dance with Alice. As Alice removes the cover from Doll's box the doll dances out, a little king gives a magical entertainment, a clown is very active and all the animals and dolls do some interesting act much to the surprise and delight of little Alice. At last, tired out, Alice falls asleep reclining upon the shoulders of Teddy bear. Then we see her again back in her own little bed. It is now Christmas morning. Her maid awakens and dresses her for the great event, takes her to the drawing room where she is welcomed by her parents to find that her dream has come true." [...] Originally the film was billed as being released for December 19, 1910 and then it was later claimed to be December 26, 1910. This release was attributed in an issue of The Nickelodeon. However, the film was not released on December 19 because an advertisement in Moving Picture World in January 1911 said that the release would be delayed for a [...] "few days". It is unknown, and unlikely, if the film actually was released because no other publications, ads or materials surrounding the Gnome Motion Picture Company followed.|$|E
500|$|A proclamation: In {{the markets}} {{of the city}} the profits from {{commerce}} are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>people</b> from the rural villages {{are not allowed to}} sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this [...] "the boxing of the community family." [...] They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two {{at the end of the}} year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "spirit dwarves") were also said {{to be able to}} confer blessings or spiritual insight (maxpe) to certain individuals. Generally speaking, the Crow would refuse to enter the Pryor Mountains due to their belief in <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People.</b> However, on occasion a lone Crow would travel to the Medicine Rocks and fast, where one of <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> might manifest as a lone animal to teach the seeker these insights. The Crow tell of two ways to pass through the mountains without being harmed by <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People,</b> however. Both involved offerings. According to their folklore, <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> had befriended a young Crow boy. The boy told the Crow that there was a pass through the mountains which the Crow could use, but they would need to shoot arrows ahead of them as they traveled as an offering to <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People.</b> This pass, now called Pryor Gap, was known to the Crow as [...] "Hits With The Arrows." [...] The Crow name for Pryor Creek was [...] "Arrow Creek," [...] and the Pryor Mountains were known to them as the Baahpuuo or [...] "Arrowhead Mountains." [...] However, other kinds of offerings, such as beads, cloth, or tobacco, could also be left in order to win safe passage through the mountains.|$|E
2500|$|As of {{the late}} 20th century, some Crow {{remained}} convinced that <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> exist. [...] Members of the Crow Nation passing through Pryor Gap sometimes still leave offerings for <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People.</b> Members of the modern Crow Nation say they have even encountered them while hunting in the Pryor Mountains. Others, taking a wrong road or footpath, say they have seen them blocking the road, and Little People are claimed to have even healed some sick people. Several white {{people in the area}} also claim to have seen <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People,</b> including a local bar owner, ranch hands, and hunters.|$|E
2500|$|Crow {{folklore}} {{says the}} [...] "Little People" [...] {{live in the}} Pryor Mountains, a small mountain range in Carbon County, Montana and Bighorn County, Montana. Petroglyphs on rocks in the mountains, the Crow said, were made by these demon-like creatures. Because <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> live there, the mountains are sacred to the Crow. <b>The</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> {{are said to be}} no more than [...] (or knee) high. Crow folklore differs slightly from that of other tribes in describing <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> of the Pryor Mountains as having large, nearly round bellies; incredibly strong but short arms and legs; and little or no neck. In the story of [...] "Lost Boy" [...] (or [...] "Burnt Face"), the Crow told of a Little Person who killed a full-grown bull elk and carried it off just by tossing the elk's head over its shoulder. The Crow expression, [...] "strong as a dwarf," [...] references the incredible strength of these Little People. However, they are incredibly fierce warriors, feed primarily on meat, and have many sharp, canine-like teeth in their mouths. Nearby tribes told stories of <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> tearing the hearts out of their enemies' horses, stories which may have helped keep these tribes from making war on the Crow. Each year, the Crow made an offering to <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> at Medicine Rocks (also known as [...] "Castle Rocks"), where they believed some Little People lived. The Pryor Mountains Little People were also known for stealing children, food, medicine, and tobacco. The Crow also believed that <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> created stone arrowheads, for the Crow themselves only knew how to make bone arrowheads. Anyone who tried to play a trick on <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>People</b> would incur their wrath, which usually destroyed him and his entire family.|$|E
