Long build times have a severe impact on team morale, productivity, and project ROI. With the application of techniques described in this Long Build <b>Trouble</b> <b>Shooting</b> <b>Guide,</b> teams {{will be able to}} keep their builds from exceeding 10 minutes in length. By keeping builds short, teams will be able to minimize the cost of integration, thereby freeing them to focus on other critical project areas. ...|$|E

TSG is considered {{as a first step}} in developing an Expert Diagnostic System (EDS). The research is focused on the acquisition and refinement of actual knowledge from the manufacturing domain, and a Hierarchical Data Collection (HDC) system is introduced {{to solve the problem of}} bottleneck in developing EDS. An integrated circuit manufacturing environment is introduced, and issues relating to the collection and assessment of knowledge concerning the performance of the machine park are discussed. Raw data about equipment used in manufacturing environment is studied and results are discussed. A systematic classification of symptoms, failures, and repair activities is presented...|$|E

The theory behind PCR and cloning is stressed in this manual, because {{a clear understanding of}} the processes involved is essential for experimentation.

40|$|It {{should be}} {{possible}} to build expert systems which are capable of serving more than one purpose. Experts apply their knowledge in more than one way, for example they diagnose, they administer, they train, they schedule and they design using the expertise they have built up. Likewise it {{should be possible}} to build an expert system which can be used for more than a single task. The purpose of this study was to identify a problem domain where this could be done, pick an appropriate development methodology and build such an expert system. The system which was finally chosen as a candidate for development was the evaporator section of the chemical recovery process at Associated Pulp and Paper Mills pulp mill at Burnie. The system was initially built using knowledge about fault diagnosis but with the aim of using it as part of the operator training process. The third purpose was to optimise the maintenance cycle and hence reduce down times of all or part of the evaporator process by investigating key features at set intervals. Fast prototyping was used for the development of the system with knowledge being obtained via interview with multiple experts, operators' manuals, <b>trouble</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>guides</b> and evaporator log sheets. The system was developed on a cheap micro-computer based shell. It is operational and is currently being used as a fault diagnosis assistant and for training...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{were three}} {{purpose of this}} study;(1) {{exploring}} successful factors of <b>trouble</b> <b>shooting</b> diagnoses in single-chip microprocessor; (2) analyzing the thinking processes of sampling group possessing successful achievement;(3) designing the diagnoses processes of <b>trouble</b> <b>shooting</b> in single-chip microprocessor circuits. 16 students of Electrical Engineering were sampled to participate the experiments in three types of diagnoses processes of <b>trouble</b> <b>shooting</b> in single-chip microprocessor circuits. Recording their experimental procedures, thinking aloud procedure and using protocol analysis were three main research methods in this study. The conclusion after data analyzing was as following: The successful factors of the diagnoses processes of <b>trouble</b> <b>shooting</b> in single-chip microprocessor circuits consists of professional knowledge, comprehension for circuits, fully taking advantage of strategies, wisely making use of electric meters, judging defining qualities of components, and using sensory assessment. The procedures for diagnoses processes of <b>trouble</b> <b>shooting</b> in single-chip microprocessor circuits are judging symptoms of <b>trouble</b> <b>shooting,</b> searching of <b>trouble</b> <b>shooting</b> points in circuit, firmly determining <b>trouble</b> <b>shooting</b> points, executing repair activities, accomplishing repairing process.
