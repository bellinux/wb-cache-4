5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do {{with the idea of}} women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E

This {{panel will}} {{consider}} {{those of us}} on the borders of the field of printmaking as we bridge into other artistic disciplines…those of us who have a chosen printmaking to be the heart of our varied bodies of work. Self-defined printmakers/artists will discuss their artwork and research—both how it embraces printmaking and how it leaves it behind. What the F… does <b>this</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do with printmaking?! is something heard by many us as we navigate the path that our artistic concepts have laid for us. Today we will answer your question of What the F… does <b>this</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do with printmaking?! on our own terms...|$|R

This strategy {{is said to be}} feasible but less cost effective due to its incompleteness.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of Saddam Hussein's regime, a dark era is drawing to a close. And we welcome it... Together we must now build peace in Iraq and for France <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> mean the United Nations having a central role. Together we must build peace throughout the region and {{this can be done}} only through the determined search for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} N-terminus is {{revealed}} by using a deletion mutation of the N-terminal plug; the protein {{was still able to}} be inserted into the membrane, but acts as a non-selective pore for larger molecules, exhibited by increased permeability of the cell to maltotetraose, maltopentaose, ferrichrome, as well as several antibiotics including albomycin, vancomycin and bacitracin. However, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be treated with caution, as the conformation of the barrel may change {{in the absence of the}} N-terminal plug.|$|E

25|$|The AMA Foundation {{provides}} approximately $1,000,000 {{annually in}} tuition assistance to financially needy students. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{be seen on}} the background that in 2007, graduating medical students carried a mean debt load of $140,000 which rose to $220,000 after four years of negative amortization during residency medical student debt has increased by 7% each successive year. By the time debt is paid off, it is sometimes almost half a million dollars.|$|E
25|$|Even {{in modern}} Turkey, however, Ottoman Divan poetry {{is a highly}} {{specialist}} subject. Much of <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the fact}} that Divan poetry is written in Ottoman Turkish, which was written using a variant of the Arabic script and made extensive use of Arabic and Persian words, making the language vastly different from modern Turkish. In its own time, knowledge of this form of literary Turkish was largely limited to the educated classes.|$|E
25|$|Nominative–accusative {{alignment}} {{can also}} be distinguished through behavioral properties, {{in the way a}} nominative or accusative argument will behave when placed in particular syntactic constructions. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do with the impact of alignment on the level of the whole sentence rather than the individual word. Morphosyntactic alignment determines which arguments can be omitted in a coordinate structure during the process of conjunction reduction (deleting arguments from the ends of joined clauses). In nominative–accusative, only arguments S and A can be omitted and not argument O.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} this building, which {{lies on the}} {{southern}} slope of the seventh hill of Constantinople and overlooks the Sea of Marmara, is not certain. The tradition says that in year 325 Helena, the mother of Constantine I, coming back from Jerusalem with the True Cross and entering the City through the Port tou Psomatheou, left in this place some vases ("Gastria") containing aromatic herbs collected on Calvary. Then she founded there a nunnery. In reality, no monastery was established in Constantinople before {{the last quarter of}} the fourth century, so <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be considered only a legend.|$|E
25|$|The Transrapid is an {{electrically}} driven, clean, high-speed, high-capacity {{means of}} transport able to build up point-to-point passenger connections in geographically challenged surroundings. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be set {{in comparison with the}} impact on heritage and or landscape protection areas (compare Waldschlösschen Bridge). Any impact of emissions has {{to take into account the}} source of electrical energy. The reduced expense, noise and vibration of a people-only Transrapid system versus a cargo train track is not directly comparable. The reuse of existing tracks and the interfacing with existing networks is limited. The Transrapid indirectly competes for resources, space and tracks in urban and city surroundings with classical urban transport systems and high speed trains.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the order}} Diptera have a {{holometabolous}} lifecycle, meaning they go through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago, or adult. C. cadaverina typically has around 17 generations of offspring per year with 25 to 50 eggs per generation if the right conditions are present. Temperature can have an extreme impact on development. If the temperature gets above or below a certain temperature it can cause all development of the fly to stop. In general, the warmer it is, the faster the lifecycle will go; while if it is colder, the lifecycle may take longer than usual. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{be taken into account}} when estimating the postmortem interval.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} risk to {{participants}} in an fMRI study is claustrophobia {{and there are}} reported risks for pregnant women {{to go through the}} scanning process. Scanning sessions also subject participants to loud high-pitched noises from Lorentz forces induced in the gradient coils by the rapidly switching current in the powerful static field. The gradient switching can also induce currents in the body causing nerve tingling. Implanted medical devices such as pacemakers could malfunction because of these currents. The radio-frequency field of the excitation coil may heat up the body, and <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be monitored more carefully in those running a fever, the diabetic, and those with circulatory problems. Local burning from metal necklaces and other jewellery is also a risk.|$|E
25|$|Like Plato, Mazzoni {{was very}} {{concerned}} with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure and delight {{in the perception of}} the believable images.” Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.” In part, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do with the idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the history}} {{published}} by Omala Caldron on its website, the Daughters of Mokanna formed in 1919, in Rock Island, Illinois. This coincides with the secession of Amoo from Chicago and the founding of their own Supreme Caldron. They go one to describe how the ritual was decided upon and list the first four Daughters of Mokanna Caldrons – Amoo No. 1, Mohassan No. 2, Ankara, No. 3, and Zal No. 4. This would lead one to believe that Hapac was No. 5 as listed in the newspaper accounts. However, no account is given {{as to what happened}} to Koom Caldron No. 3, except that it shows up as participating in the Daughters of Mokanna national Convention in 1922. What remains unclear is when the Illinois group officially dropped the Witches and became Daughters; <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be somewhere between 1920 and 1922.|$|E

25|$|A study {{conducted}} in the Tocantis State, in northern Brazil, found that many families were cutting down forests {{in order to produce}} two conglomerates of oilseed plants, the J. curcas (JC group) and the R. communis (RC group). This region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity, and 80% Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity. During the study, the farmers that planted the JC group released over 2193 Mg CO2, while losing 53-105 Mg CO2 sequestration from deforestation; and the RC group farmers released 562 Mg CO2, while losing 48-90 Mg CO2 to be sequestered from forest depletion. The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide, but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves. In addition, the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation, as well as of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff, but also to the emission of nitrous oxide (NO2) as a fertilizer byproduct, which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO2).|$|E

500|$|School {{officials}} again {{asked students}} about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech, and this time Cole came forward. She stated {{that she had not}} done so before as she had not written the sign. Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again. Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, she indicated, was more fun than sitting in history class. The Toledo Blade investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what happened to it after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, [...] "I think <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be {{the most important thing that}} has ever happened around here." [...] Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler Flag, stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up. Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign.|$|E
