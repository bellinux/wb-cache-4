Secondly, we tested if <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> was a predictor of pain intensity. Thirty-six English-speaking adults with TMC arthrosis or de Quervain syndrome were randomized for a dexamethasone or a placebo injection. At time of the injection, patients completed a demographic data sheet and validated questionnaires assessing arm-specific disability, pain intensity, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and patient's health-related beliefs. At an average of 1. 4 [*]±[*] 0. 42 months (range, 0. 79 - 2. 5 months) after the injection, patients completed questionnaires regarding arm-specific disability, pain, and treatment satisfaction.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: A {{systematic}} review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). OBJECTIVE: To determine if injection therapy {{is more effective}} than placebo or other treatments for patients with subacute or chronic low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The effectiveness of injection therapy for low back pain is still debatable. Heterogeneity of target tissue, pharmacological agent, and dosage, generally found in RCTs, point to the need for clinically valid comparisons in a literature synthesis. METHODS: We updated the search of the earlier {{systematic review}} and searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases up to March 2007 for relevant trials reported in English, French, German, Dutch, and Nordic languages. We also screened references from trials identified. RCTs on the effects of injection therapy involving epidural, facet, or local sites for subacute or chronic low back pain were included. Studies that compared the effects of intradiscal injections, prolotherapy, or ozone therapy with other treatments were excluded unless injection therapy with another pharmaceutical agent (no placebo treatment) was part of one of the treatment arms. Studies about injections in sacroiliac joints and studies evaluating the effects of epidural steroids for radicular pain were also excluded. RESULTS: Eighteen trials (1179 participants) were included in this review. The injection sites varied from epidural sites and facet joints (i. e. intra-articular injections, peri-articular injections and nerve blocks) to local sites (i. e. tender-and trigger points). The drugs that were studied consisted of corticosteroids, local anesthetics, {{and a variety of other}} drugs. The methodologic quality of the trials was limited with 10 of 18 trials rated as having a high methodologic quality. Statistical pooling was not possible because of clinical heterogeneity in the trials. Overall, the results indicated that there is no strong evidence for or against the use of any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> therapy. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of injection therapy in subacute and chronic low-back pain. However, it cannot be ruled out that specific subgroups of patients may respond to a specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> therapy...|$|E
30|$|Tail vein {{injection}} (with {{or without}} an intravenous catheter) under short anesthesia {{is the most}} commonly used route for administering radiopharmaceuticals. The small caliber of the vein in rodents may, however, predispose to tracer extravasation into the interstitium. Other validated administration routes are available, including retro-orbital and intraperitoneal injection [5, 6]. The main limitation of the first technique relates to restrictions imposed by many animal care committees. The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> has several advantages. It is reproducible in longitudinal studies and can be performed on conscious animals, thereby reducing stress levels. However, a risk of failure remains (intra-digestive injection, [7, 8]), and it has not been validated in animals bearing intraperitoneal tumors in which peritoneal tracer absorption could be impaired. Moreover, even though delayed images (60  min) {{have been shown to be}} equivalent to intravenous injection [9 – 11], retro-orbital and intraperitoneal injections do not allow dynamic imaging [5].|$|E
40|$|International audienceLaser-wakefield {{acceleration}} {{constitutes a}} promising technology for future electron accelerators. A crucial step {{in such an}} accelerator is the injection of electrons into the wakefield, which will largely determine {{the properties of the}} extracted beam. We present here a new paradigm of colliding-pulse injection, which allows us to generate high-quality electron bunches having both a very low emittance (0. 17 [*][*]mm·mrad) and a low energy spread (2 %), while retaining a high charge (∼ 100 [*][*]pC) and a short duration (3 fs). In this paradigm, the pulse collision provokes a transient expansion of the accelerating bubble, which then leads to transverse electron injection. This mechanism contrasts with previously observed optical injection mechanisms, which were essentially longitudinal. We also specify the range of parameters in which this new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> occurs and show that it is within reach of existing high-intensity laser facilities...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} graph labellings {{has focused on}} finding classes of graphs which admit a {{particular}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> labelling. Here we consider variations of the well-known edge-magic and vertex-magic total labellings for which all graphs admit such a labelling. In particular, we consider two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> the vertices and edges of a graph with positive integers: (1) for every edge {{the sum of its}} label and those of its end-vertices is some magic constant (edge-magic); and (2) for every vertex the sum of its label and those of the edges incident to it is some magic constant (vertex-magic). Our aim is to minimise the maximum label or the magic constant associated with the injection. We present upper bounds on these parameters for complete graphs, forests and arbitrary graphs, which in a number of cases are within a constant factor of being optimal. Our results are based on greedy algorithms for computing an antimagic injection, which is then extended to a magic total <b>injection.</b> <b>Of</b> independent interest is our result that every forest has an edge-antimagic vertex labelling...|$|R
