2500|$|Nolan was {{becoming}} frustrated because {{he realized that}} something was wrong. Many of the buffalo hunters were getting impatient because they believed the Comanche raiders were in the sand hills. [...] They sent out a scout in that direction without the soldiers. Several other hunters called it quits. They {{were concerned about the}} [...] "droughty" [...] conditions and perceived <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> wrong. They pointed out to the soldiers that most of the bison and pronghorn had left the area. This was a sign of a serious drought and [...] "if the rest had good sense they wouldn't (go further) either." ...|$|E

The dissent concludes, [...] "The Court would have us believe that over 200 years ago, the Framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons.... I could not possibly conclude that the Framers made such a choice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bousman {{said they}} did not intend to have a twist ending, as {{distinctly}} as the previous films, [...] noting that [...] "I think most people will figure it out in the first 15 minutes of the film". Whannell added, [...] "What Darren and I struck for Saw III was to have an emotionally impactful ending. We wanted something that would almost make someone who was really invested in the story cry. We have Jigsaw, this character who's been so cold and clinical, he's been presented throughout the previous two films as someone who's very much in control. He's more like a reptile than a human being. In Saw III he becomes a human being. You see him crack. His veneer cracks and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> most important to us far and above any sort of gimmick or twist". Whannell also answered questions from previous films that were brought up by fans on the official Saw message board. As with the previous two films, the ending was only given to the actors who appeared in the final scene {{at the time it was}} filmed. At one point the script was stolen from Bousman's chair; however, it was returned before it was leaked online.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So I took an instant editorial decision <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
