30|$|Before porting can occur, {{a hidden}} module must be modularized {{to have at}} least two submodules: one “interior” and one “exterior.” The “exterior” parts of the ported module’s design must then {{translate}} information from the external system into data usable by the interior sections, and vice versa. The design rules of the surrounding system and of the ported module are both equally visible to these <b>translator</b> <b>modules.</b> As their name suggests, then, <b>translator</b> <b>modules</b> are a special type of hidden module, whose role is to convert one system’s information into a form usable in another system. Examples of <b>translator</b> <b>modules</b> include (1) compilers that translate high-level languages into machine instructions; (2) printer drivers that translate machine commands into printer commands; and (3) read-only-memory instruction sets that translate machine instructions into microcode.

The kernel knowledge representation form {{is a special}} predicate centered conceptual graph called ECG. The ECG provides a semantic-based, language independent description of the environment. The other base representation form {{is some kind of}} language. The sentences of the language should meet the corresponding grammatical rules. The pilot project demonstrates the functionality of a <b>translator</b> <b>module</b> using this transformation engine between the ECG graph and the Hungarian languag...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{negotiation}} {{systems have}} been implemented using agent architectures, where agents communicate exchanging negotiation primitives generated by each system, based on particular language definitions implicitly encoded, giving different syntax and semantics to their messages. In this paper we {{address the problem of}} communicating heterogeneous negotiation agents in a Web-based environment, considering differences in their message implementations. Our research is based {{in the development of a}} shared ontology for publishing definitions of negotiation primitives, and a <b>translator</b> <b>module,</b> which is executed only when a misunderstanding occurs. We implemented a service-oriented architecture for executing negotiations and conducted experiments incorporating heterogeneous agents. The results of the tests show that the proposed solution improves communication between negotiation agents...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the Universal Reconfigurable Translation Module, or URTM. The URTM {{was developed by}} Sigma Space Corporation for NASA in order to translate specific serial protocols, both logically and physically. At present, the prototype configuration has targeted MIL-STD- 1553 B (RT and BC), IEEE 1394 b (Firewire), and ECSS-E- 50 - 12 A (SpaceWire). The objectives of this program were to study the feasibility of a configurable URTM to translate serial link data as might {{be used in a}} space-flight mission and to design, develop, document, and deliver an engineering prototype model of the URTM with a path to spaceflight. By simply connecting two of the three Physical Interface Modules (PIM) on either end of the RPTM (Reconfigurable Protocol <b>Translator</b> <b>Module),</b> the URTM then self configures via a library of interface translation functions, thereby allowing the two data links to communicate seamlessly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We want {{to create}} a working tool for {{mathematics}} teachers and a corresponding learning tool for students, namely a graphical simulator of mathematical algorithms (GraSMa). To achieve it we try two different strategies. We started by annotate manually the original algorithm with inspector functions. Now we are testing a new approach that aims to automatically annotate the original code with inspector functions. To achieve this we are developing a language <b>translator</b> <b>module</b> that enables to comment automatically any code written in Octave language. The run of the annotated code gated by one of these two ways, records in a XML (eXtensible Markup Language) file everything that happened during the execution. Subsequently, the XML file is parsed by a Java application that graphically represents the mathematic objects and their behaviour during execution. The final application will be accessed on-line through a website (WebGraSMa) which is currently under development. In this paper we report and discuss about the procedures followed and present some intermediate results. ...|$|R

This service will allow deaf people to communicate properly with other people. The deaf person will make a video-calling using a 3 G mobile device and what the other person means using his voice, is recognized and translated to sign language by a voice platform {{in order to show}} on the 3 G device screen the animation by means of the sign language. Nowadays we are working in two modules which are necessary in this service such as a LVCSR (Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition) used to recognize what the other person means, and a text to sign language <b>translator</b> <b>module</b> used to show the deaf person who makes the video-calling the information appropriately. Both the recognition module and the text to sign language translator will be developed in Spanish language so the service will be proved with Spanish users...|$|R
40|$|We have in {{the past}} {{investigated}} the design and implementation of micronet-based architectures of the scalar[AR 94], superscalar[AM 99], VLIW[AS 97] and Multithreaded[AHKR 01] kind, which were all based on a RISC-like instruction set. In this paper, we present a preliminary design, based around a micronet core, of an asynchronous Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) architecture. A <b>TRANSLATOR</b> <b>module</b> converts the CISC instructions into ones which are native to the micronet datapath, called the milliops instructions. This translation can be accomplished either in hardware, as in Intel's x 86 architectures, or in software, in the style of Transmeta's Crusoe architecture. The design environment enables C programs targeted at the CISC architecture, to be executed on a RTL model of the micronet core, and its execution and power consumption can be visualised over space and time. This allows a systematic study of the effect of compiler and architectural optimisations of micronet-based CISC processors, on the performance of application benchmarks...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program defines an XML schema for specifying the interface to a generic FPGA {{from the perspective}} of software that will interact with the device. This XML interface description is then translated into header files for C, Verilog, and VHDL. User interface definition input is checked via both the provided XML schema and the <b>translator</b> <b>module</b> to ensure consistency and accuracy. Currently, programming used on both sides of an interface is inconsistent. This makes it hard to find and fix errors. By using a common schema, both sides are forced to use the same structure by using the same framework and toolset. This makes for easy identification of problems, which leads to the ability to formulate a solution. The toolset contains constants that allow a programmer to use each register, and to access each field in the register. Once programming is complete, the translator is run as part of the make process, which ensures that whenever an interface is changed, all of the code that uses the header files describing it is recompiled...|$|R

Besides, the partial self-inductance and mutual-inductance model of the parallel branches is set up. Finally, a high-precision partial stray inductance measurement method is proposed, and the accuracy of the partial stray inductance model for asymmetrical parallel branches is verified by experimental tests...|$|R

40|$|Resistive plate {{chambers}} (RPCs) {{are going}} to be used as the active detector element of the INO-ICAL experiment. We have developed a glass RPC (named AB 08) consisting of two parallel electrodes of glass plates separated by a distance of 2 mm through which a gas mixture of Freon, SF 6 and isobutene is flown. The detector is operated in avalanche mode at high voltage. The efficiency and time resolution of the RPC have been studied. The signal from the RPC is processed through NIM/CAMAC based INO-DAQ system. Monitoring of the RPC’s strip is required to record the noise and its health information. This noise may be due to radioactivity, the electrical noise, cosmic ray charged particles of multiple scattering and the dark current of the chamber.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the problem of {{constructing}} the interfaces needed to transfer data between different geographical information systems. Traditionally, data values were moved from one computer system to another using magnetic tapes and, more recently, using CD-ROM. Use of communication networks to move data sets from one computer system to another greatly widens the scope for data transfers. Examples of types of data transfer now possible are: the development of federated and distributed database management systems which allow data to be transferred among databases stored on different computer systems; the use of electronic mail servers for the distribution of data files; use of hand-held data collectors that can transfer field data through communication links; and applications which, though executing on separate computer systems, communicate with each other through a network. The diverse data representations defined for different geographical information systems cause difficulties when attempting to transfer geographical data. To better understand these representations, and thereby assist in the construction of interfaces, the representation of geographical data values is discussed using the concepts of: an abstraction, which is a collection of ideas about the data to be represented; a data model, which defines a notation for describing the types of data values, and operations for manipulating these values; and a schema, which is a definition of an abstraction using the notation and operations defined by a data model. The author's approach to interface construction is based on generating interfaces from formal transfer specifications. Any such specification defines: the various representations to which the data conforms before, during, and after the transfer; the transformations to modify the data values from one representation to another; and perhaps also transformations to move the values between different computer systems. An interface can be generated from such a transfer specification using the software tool a 2 b, which has been developed by the author as part of this project. An interface is defined as comprising some combination of four types of interface modules. Decoder modules transform data values from a text-file representation into a memory-resident representation, and encoder modules perform the reverse transformation. <b>Translator</b> <b>modules</b> modify the types of data values, and communication modules send and receive data values through a communications network. These modules are either generated directly by a 2 b, or from specifications generated by a 2 b and processed by other software tools such as bison, flex, and the software tools rosy and pepsy provided within the ISO Development Environment (ISODE) ...|$|R
