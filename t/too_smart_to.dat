5|$|The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to {{join their}} {{exhibition}} basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged {{by the fact that}} owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>to</b> speak with him, then he was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>to</b> play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.|$|E

[...] "Tom Hanks plays the title character, an amiable dunce who is far <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>to</b> embrace the lethal values of the 1960s.

She also knew Guy Burgess, who fled to Russia in 1951 when he and Maclean {{were about to be}} unmasked as traitors. A 2015 {{biography}} of Burgess, a homosexual, contained claims that, encouraged by his Soviet [...] "handlers", he had contemplated marriage to Clarissa. However, the latter, then aged 95, denied that they had been close. She described Burgess as [...] "courteous, amusing, nice and good company", but said that he had been [...] "standoffish" [...] towards her and did not wish any friendship to develop.|$|E

In a video commentary to the album, Knowles explained {{that in her}} mind , she would have never imagined losing as a possibility, {{and it was the}} best message for her. [...] "I feel like something about the aggression of 'Bow Down' and the attitude of 'Flawless'—the reality is, sometimes you lose. And you're never too good to lose, you're never too big to lose, you're never <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>to</b> lose, it happens. And it happens when it needs to happen. And you have to embrace those things", she added.|$|E
2500|$|BevMo! employs Wilfred Wong, {{an expert}} taster and wine {{competition}} judge, who assigns bottles a wine rating {{based on his}} own version of Robert M. Parker, Jr.'s 50–100-point system. Wong, a veteran industry analyst and wine writer who has written regular columns for Vineyard & Winery Management magazine and Beverage Industry News, tastes some 8,000 bottles a year for BevMo!, and may taste 40 wines a day. A San Francisco native and resident who grew up working in his family's upscale grocery store in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, Wong was hired to work for BevMo! in 1995, when they had six stores. He told a New York Times reporter in 2006 that it can be tricky working as a wine critic inside a large retail chain that sells wine—there can be conflicts between appropriate scoring for a wine and business plans for that wine. He reported that he has, upon occasion, been encouraged by company management to give a high score to a wine, especially one that did not receive a high rating from other reviewers, or one that was purchased by BevMo! at a good price. Wong said, [...] "we have fights all the time." [...] Wong made assurances that he does not treat a wine to a good score based on company founders' wishes. Executive VP David Richards agrees: [...] "If we were to impinge on Wilfred's credibility, it would be very bad for our brand." [...] Wong reports only to Richards, to keep him from being influenced by wine sellers or BevMo!'s own buyers. Richards said, [...] "we have to give him independence within the organization." [...] Alder Yarrow, publisher of the wine blog Vinography.com, said of Wong, [...] "he is not a shill... He knows what he is talking about when it comes to wine." [...] Professor Emeritus Robert Smiley, Director of Wine Studies, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Davis, said about Wong's ratings: [...] "I {{think this is a good}} innovation and he's helpful to the consumer. It brings more people to BevMo and it probably moves them up in price because typically, the higher-price wines get the better scores." [...] Smiley said that shoppers were <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>to</b> be fooled: [...] "If Wilfred and BevMo fix the ratings, people will catch on and go elsewhere." ...|$|E
5000|$|The show {{received}} a positive reception from most media publications. The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin raved that the telecast had [...] "less silliness and less small talk, with {{more emphasis on}} cleverly chosen film clips and the bona fide Hollywood magic being celebrated." [...] She also praised host Goldberg saying that she [...] "sustained a tone of levity, which became particularly important as the sweep by Schindler's List threatened to bring out great ponderousness in some quarters." [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazette television critic Robert Bianco commended Goldberg's performance writing that [...] "She never acted like she was <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> or <b>to</b> hip for the show she was hosting; she never smirked {{like there was a}} joke she alone was cool enough to get." [...] He also extolled producer Cates by commenting, [...] "In place of the extraneous jokes and terrible production numbers, he gave us a theme that worked and a generous selection of clips to back it up." [...] Anne Thompson of Entertainment Weekly lauded Goldberg by stating, [...] "Her elegant appearance (at least during the first half), her uncharacteristic restraint (she didn't cuss), and her ability to make it funny (despite the very somber speeches) made the ho-hum telecast worth watching." ...|$|R

Not {{that he thought that}} there could be any danger there; but you never can tell, and it is always the part of wisdom {{to be on the safe}} side. As he passed over the top of the tree, he looked down eagerly. Just imagine how he felt when instead of one, he saw two white things in the old nest--two white things that looked for all the world like eggs! The day before there had been but one; now there were two. That settled it in Blacky's mind; they were eggs! They couldn't be {{anything}} else.|$|R
5000|$|Influenced by Graham Greene and James Salter, Reuland’s hard-edged but elegant {{writing is}} known for its gritty realism and has drawn praise from Dennis Lehane, Alan Furst, and George Pelecanos. A {{reviewer}} for the Washington Post referred to Semiautomatic as “the best-written legal thriller I’ve ever read, hands down.” Marilyn Stasio of the New York Times called Reuland [...] "a daring writer. His cityscapes are ugly to the point of insult, his characters have no hearts, and his abrasive dialogue will rub you raw. Its an irritating voice for a new writer — <b>too</b> quick and <b>smart</b> <b>to</b> toy with civilizing subtleties — and I like it a lot." [...] Of Reulands second novel, [...] "Semiautomatic," [...] Kirkus, in a starred review wrote, [...] "Reuland is a real-life ADA, and if he prosecutes as effectively as he writes, Brooklyn is a lucky borough." ...|$|R

5000|$|Fat Cat (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a felonious, obese grey {{tabby cat}} {{and one of}} the Rescue Rangers' most {{frequent}} antagonists. Formerly owned by criminal Aldrin Klordane, Fat Cat became an independent agent and animal world crime boss after Klordane's incarceration. Inordinately proud of his appearance, he keeps his whiskers clean, wears a purple business suit, and has a taste for expensive things. Fat Cat is a ruthless criminal mastermind, and his plans, though sometimes bizarre, are nevertheless dangerous and sadistic. He hates dogs and several of his schemes have been attacks against them. The only thing he hates more than dogs are the Rescue Rangers, which he always tries to get rid of using an elaborate and slow methods, rather than killing them immediately. The complexity of his plans usually ends up being his downfall. He has a cousin who lives in Paris, France. Voice actor Jim Cummings described Fat Cat as a combination of Zero Mostel and Dom DeLuise. Fat Cat is usually accompanied by four henchmen. In spite of their combined stupidity, Fat Cat almost always sends them out to do his dirty work for him, as he is <b>too</b> <b>smart,</b> or lazy <b>to</b> get his paws dirty.|$|R

When Wilson tried to connect her with the stealing raid, and thought she might have been the old woman's confederate, if not the very thief disguised as an old woman, Tom seemed stuck, and also much interested, and said he would keep a sharp eye out for this person or persons, although he was afraid that she or they would be <b>too</b> <b>smart</b> <b>to</b> venture again into a town where everybody would now be on the watch for a good while to come.|$|E
