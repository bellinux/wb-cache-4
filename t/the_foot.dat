5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the sole of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> may be elicited during the physical examination. <b>The</b> <b>foot</b> may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the sole of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> before inserting {{at the base of}} the toes, and supports the arch of <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>feet</b> are pressed {{together}} to avoid loss of water pressure. <b>The</b> <b>feet</b> are naturally pointing downwards, giving downwards thrust, moving up <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> and pressing down the head.|$|R
40|$|The {{punching}} shear failure often governs {{the strength of}} the footing-to-column connection. The {{punching shear}} failure is an undesirable failure mode, since it results in a brittle failure of <b>the</b> <b>footing.</b> In this study, a new method to increase the strength and ductility of <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> was proposed by inserting the punching shear preventers (PSPs) into <b>the</b> <b>footing.</b> <b>The</b> validation and effectiveness of PSP were verified through a series of experimental studies. The nonlinear finite element analysis was then performed to demonstrate the failure mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> with PSPs in depth and to investigate the key parameters that affect the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> with PSPs. Finally, the design recommendations for <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> with PSPs were suggested...|$|R

5|$|The {{underside}} {{consists of}} a muscular foot, which has adapted to different purposes in different classes. <b>The</b> <b>foot</b> carries a pair of statocysts, which act as balance sensors. In gastropods, it secretes mucus as a lubricant to aid movement. In forms having only a top shell, such as limpets, <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> acts as a sucker attaching the animal to a hard surface, and the vertical muscles clamp the shell down over it; in other molluscs, the vertical muscles pull <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and other exposed soft parts into the shell. In bivalves, <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> is adapted for burrowing into the sediment; in cephalopods it is used for jet propulsion, and the tentacles and arms are derived from <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E

5|$|If the plantar fascia {{continues}} to be overused {{in the setting of}} plantar fasciitis, the plantar fascia can rupture.

2500|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> {{serve as}} a {{foundation}} {{for the rest of the}} body in this and other standing asanas, the position of <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> is of high importance. Minor alteration in the position of <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> affects posture throughout the body.|$|R
50|$|Changing {{the height}} of <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> changes {{how easy it is}} for the rower to reach forward and the amount of power they can comfortably apply. Lowering <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> allows a greater body angle at the catch, while raising <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> reduces <b>the</b> moment arm between the handle and the force at <b>the</b> <b>feet,</b> {{allowing}} greater force application for the same core/postural muscle strength.|$|R
50|$|A two-step {{consists}} of two steps in approximately the same direction onto <b>the</b> same <b>foot,</b> separated by a closing step with <b>the</b> other <b>foot.</b> For example, a right two-step forward is a forward step onto <b>the</b> right <b>foot,</b> a closing step with <b>the</b> left <b>foot,</b> and a forward step onto <b>the</b> right <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> closing step may be done directly beside <b>the</b> other <b>foot,</b> or obliquely beside, or even crossed, as long as <b>the</b> closing <b>foot</b> does not go past <b>the</b> other <b>foot.</b>|$|R

5|$|Lobatus gigas has {{an unusual}} means of locomotion, first {{described}} in 1922 by George Howard Parker (1864–1955). The animal first fixes the posterior end of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> by thrusting {{the point of}} the sickle-shaped operculum into the substrate, then it extends <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> in a forward direction, lifting and throwing the shell forward in a so-called leaping motion. This way of moving is considered to resemble that of pole vaulting, making L.gigas a good climber even of vertical concrete surfaces. This leaping locomotion may help prevent predators from following the snail's chemical traces, which would otherwise leave a continuous trail on the substrate.|$|E

40|$|Eccentric loading, {{in which}} {{vertical}} or inclined wall surrounds {{one or more}} sides of the soil mass beneath <b>the</b> <b>footing,</b> {{is one of the}} recognized bearing capacity improvement techniques. <b>The</b> <b>footing</b> when provided with footing projection on one side such that it {{is an integral part of}} <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> it is called angle shape footing. Construction of <b>footing</b> projection at <b>the</b> base of <b>the</b> <b>footing,</b> confining <b>the</b> underlying soil, generates a soil resistance on projection side that helps <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> to resist sliding. In such a <b>footing</b> <b>the</b> soil particles near <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> projection are prevented from moving laterally thus footing projection to tilt in direction opposite the one in which <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> has tendency to tilt thus tilt of <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> can be reduced to zero by providing a downward inclined footing projection of required depth toward the loading side. The idea of angle as well as suitable length of projection has been used here by giving <b>the</b> <b>footing</b> an angle shape of variable projection angle. Various load inclination angles, load eccentricities, various angles as well as lengths of footing projection were investigated. Load displacement values for all cases were compared, and favourable design conditions were suggested. Laboratory work and numerical analysis were performed to study the behaviour of eccentric loading subjected to eccentric inclined load...|$|R

The individual keeps <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> in <b>the</b> wide stance throughout the exercise and omits the intermediate step of moving <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> together between repetitions.|$|R

5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of <b>the</b> <b>foot,</b> going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel and bottom of <b>the</b> <b>foot.</b> The pain is usually most severe with the first steps {{of the day or}} following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{pinpoint}} stance, <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> start apart, {{but as the}} serve unfolds, <b>the</b> back <b>foot</b> slides or {{steps forward}} until it is adjacent to or slightly behind <b>the</b> front <b>foot.</b> As a result, <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> provide a very small base of support and balance may be a problem.|$|R
25|$|The {{footwork}} {{is a basic}} side-tap, side-tap. For example, <b>the</b> left <b>foot</b> {{moves to}} <b>the</b> left with a weight-shift to <b>the</b> left <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> right <b>foot</b> then 'taps' (touching the floor without weight-shift) next to <b>the</b> left <b>foot.</b> This {{is followed by the}} same movement to the other side: <b>the</b> right <b>foot</b> moves back to the right with a weigh-shift to <b>the</b> right <b>foot,</b> and <b>the</b> left <b>foot</b> comes back to tap beside the right.|$|R
