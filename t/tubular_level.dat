40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{has been}} {{proposed}} to modulate the renal response to protein as well as basal renal hemodynamics. We investigated whether NO and angiotensin II (AII) interact to control glomerular hemodynamics and absolute proximal tubular reabsorption (APR) during glycine infusion and in unstimulated conditions. In control rats, glycine increased single nephron GFR and plasma flow with no change in APR. The NO synthase blocker, NG-monomethyl L-arginine (LNMMA), abolished the vasodilatory response to glycine, possibly through activation of tubuloglomerular feedback due to a decrease in APR produced by LNMMA + glycine. Pretreatment with an AII receptor antagonist, DuP 753, normalized the response to glycine at both glomerular and <b>tubular</b> <b>levels.</b> In unstimulated conditions, LNMMA produced glomerular arteriolar vasoconstriction, decreased the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, and reduced single nephron GFR. These changes were associated with a striking decrease in APR. DuP 753 prevented both glomerular and tubular changes induced by LNMMA. In conclusion, NO represents a physiological antagonist of AII at both the glomerulus and tubule in both the basal state and during glycine infusion; and inhibition of NO apparently enhances or uncovers the inhibitory effect of AII on proximal reabsorption...|$|R

No significant changes were found. A direct, non-receptor-mediated action of ketanserin was then suspected, and the effects of two concentrations of ketanserin (5 x 10 (- 8) and 5 x 10 (- 7) M) were evaluated in erythrocytes from 12 normal volunteers. Both concentrations of ketanserin significantly decreased the activity of the Na/K pump and increased the activity of Na/Li countertransport.

No difference was found in renal dynamics between young (Y, 3 mo old) and old (O, 18 mo old) rats in normal conditions (CON) or after ATO treatment (12 mg/kg/d for 14 d). Twenty-four hours after clamping of both renal arteries, a more pronounced decrease in GFR was observed in O rats versus Y rats after a greater renal vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion of aging animals. Pretreatment with ATO mitigated renal vasoconstriction in O rats and restored GFR values to Y rats.

As a subset of cancer, hyponatremia is quite common in lung cancer patients, and it is often coupled with the diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. The presence of hyponatremia is consequential in that its presence adversely affects cancer patients’ prognosis and outcomes. Limited data suggest that correcting hyponatremia in lung cancer patients can increase response to anticancer treatment, may help reduce length of hospital stay and cost, and reduce morbidity and mortality. The type of treatment for hyponatremia depends on several factors; the key factors are the duration and severity of neurological symptoms of hyponatremia {{and the status of}} extracellular volume. When hyponatremia is caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, hypertonic saline is indicated for acute symptomatic cases, whereas fluid restriction is recommended in chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia. The latter allows a slower rate of correction, thus avoiding the dreaded complication of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Fluid restriction is, however, insufficient or impractical, and often the use of pharmacological therapy such as antidiuretic hormone receptor antagonists becomes necessary. Availability of these antagonists as an effective treatment in the management of hyponatremia has been a major breakthrough, and furthermore, its clinical or investigational use in cancer-related hyponatremia may offer a potential opportunity to gain further insights into the prognostic impact of hyponatremia correction on cancer patients’ outcomes.

This study addresses these issues directly at the <b>tubular</b> cell <b>level.</b> Potential alternative mechanisms for RCN have also been sought. MethodsIsolated mouse proximal tubule segments (PTS), or cultured proximal tubule (HK- 2) cells, were subjected to radiocontrast media (RCM) (Ioversol, Optiray 320) exposure, followed by assessments of cellular viability [% lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, tetrazolium dye (MTT), uptake] and lipid peroxidation. These experiments were conducted in the absence or presence {{of a variety of}} antioxidants [NAC, glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase, catalase] or pro-oxidant (GSH depletion, heme oxygenase inhibition) strategies. RCM effects on mitochondrial and plasma membrane integrity were also assessed. ResultsRCM exposure did not induce PTS lipid peroxidation. Neither antioxidant nor pro-oxidant interventions mitigated or exacerbated RCM-induced tubular cell injury, respectively. RCM impaired mitochondrial integrity, as assessed by ouabain-resistant ATP reductions, and by cytochrome c release (before cell death). RCM also induced plasma membrane damage, as indicated by loss of key resident proteins (NaK-ATPase, caveolin) and by increased susceptibility to phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) attack (increase of ≥ 2 times in free fatty acid and NaK-ATPase release). Hyperosmolality could not account for RCM's toxic effects. ConclusionRCM toxicity can be dissociated from tubular cell oxidant stress.

In animal models, experimental data demonstrate that intracerebroventricular injection of apelin into lactating rats inhibits the phasic electrical activity of arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons, reduces plasma AVP levels, and increases aqueous diuresis. In the kidney, apelin increases diuresis by increasing the renal microcirculation and by counteracting the antidiuretic effect of AVP at the <b>tubular</b> <b>level.</b> Moreover, after water deprivation or salt loading, in humans and in rodents, AVP and apelin are conversely regulated to facilitate systemic AVP release and to avoid additional water loss from the kidney.

Since the in vivo half-life of apelin is in the minute range, metabolically stable apelin analogs were developed.

The natriuretic hormones, such as the atrial natriuretic peptide,mediate some of their effects by affecting the renal dopaminergic system. Renal dopaminergic tonus can be modulated at different steps of dopamine metabolism (synthesis, uptake, release, catabolism, and receptor sensitization) which can be regulated by the atrial natriuretic peptide. At <b>tubular</b> <b>level,</b> dopamine and atrial natriuretic peptide act together in a concerted manner to promote sodium excretion, especially through the overinhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase activity. In this way, different pathological scenarios where renal sodium excretion is dysregulated, as in nephrotic syndrome or hypertension, are associated with impaired action of renal dopamine and/or atrial natriuretic peptide, or as a result of impaired interaction between these two natriuretic systems. The aim of this review is to update and comment on the most recent evidences demonstrating how the renal dopaminergic system interacts with atrial natriuretic peptide to control renal physiology and blood pressure through different regulatory pathways. 1...|$|E

Nephropathy following contrastmedia (CM) exposure {{is reduced by}} administration before, during, and after the contrast procedure of either isotonic sodium chloride solution (Saline) or isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution (IsoBicarb). The reasons for this reduction are not well established for either sodium salt; probable mechanisms are discussed in this paper. For Saline, the mechanism for the decrease in CIN is likely related primarily to the increased tubular flow rates produced by volume expansion and therefore a decreased concentration of the filtered CM during transit through the kidney tubules. Furthermore, increased tubular flow rates produce {{a slight increase in}} tubular pH resulting from a fixed acid excretion in an increased tubular volume. The mechanism for the decreased CIN associated with sodium bicarbonate includes the same mechanisms listed for Saline in addition to a renal pH effect. Increased filtered bicarbonate anion raises both tubular pH and <b>tubular</b> bicarbonate anion <b>levels</b> toward blood physiologic levels, thus providing increased buffer for reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed in the tubules as a result of exposure to CM in renal tubular fluid. 1...|$|R
40|$|Proximal <b>tubular</b> {{cholesterol}} <b>levels</b> rise within 18 {{hours of}} diverse forms of acute renal tubular injury (eg, myoglobinuria, ischemia/reperfusion, urinary tract obstruction). These increments serve {{to protect against}} further bouts of tubular attack (so-called “acquired cytoresistance”). Whether these cholesterol increments are merely transitory, or persist into the maintenance phase of acute renal failure (ARF), has not been previously defined. Furthermore, whether subacute/insidious tubular injury [eg, cyclosporine A (CSA), tacrolimus toxicity], nontubular injury (eg, acute glomerulonephritis), or physiological stress (eg, mild dehydration) impact renal cholesterol homeostasis have not been addressed. This study sought to resolve these issues. Male CD- 1 mice were subjected to glycerol-induced ARF. Renal cortical-free cholesterol (FC) and cholesterol ester (CE) levels were determined 3, 5, 7, or 14 days later, and the values contrasted to prevailing blood-urea nitrogen concentrations. The impact of 40 minutes of unilateral renal ischemia plus reflow (3 to 6 days) on mouse cortical FC/CE content was also assessed. Additionally, FC/CE levels were measured in rat renal cortex either 10 days after CSA or tacrolimus therapy, or 48 hours after induction of nephrotoxic serum nephritis. Finally, the impact of overnight dehydration on mouse renal cortical/medullary FC/CE profiles was determined. Compared to sham-treated animals, glycerol, CSA, tacrolimus, ischemia-reperfusion, and nephrotoxic serum each induced dramatic CE ± FC elevations, rising as much as 10 × control values. In the glycerol model, striking correlations (r ≤ 0. 99) between FC/CE and blood-urea nitrogen levels were observed. The FC/CE increases were specific to damaged kidney (glycerol did not raise hepatic FC/CE; unilateral renal ischemia did not alter contralateral renal FC/CE levels). Overnight dehydration raised renal CE levels, most notably in the medulla. Conclusions: FC/CE accumulation is {{a hallmark of the}} maintenance phase of ischemic and nephrotoxic ARF, and can reflect its severity. That cholesterol accumulation can result from glomerular injury and dehydration suggests that it is a generic renal stress response, with potential relevance extending beyond just the phenomenon of acquired cytoresistance...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) {{involves}} {{damage to}} tubular cells via excess {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) generation. Stem cell-based therapies have shown great promise in AKI treatment. In this study, we aimed to assess the protective effect and mechanism of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) -derived conditioned medium (CM) against cisplatin-induced AKI. Methods: In vitro, NRK- 52 E cells were incubated with cisplatin in {{the presence or absence}} of CM, followed by the assessment of cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. Then, ICG- 001 and IWR- 1 were used to inhibit the wnt/β-catenin pathway. Furthermore, intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels were evaluated using DCFH-DA and MitoSOX, respectively. In vivo, after cisplatin injection, rats were intravenously injected with CM or BMSCs. Sera and kidney tissues were collected on day 3 after cisplatin injection to evaluate changes in renal function and histology. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were employed to determine the expression of wnt/β-catenin pathway-related genes and proteins. Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate tubular β-catenin expression in kidney biopsy from AKI patients. Results: CM protected NRK- 52 E cells from cisplatin-induced injury by restoring the wnt 4 /β-catenin pathway. In response to ICG- 001 and IWR- 1, the protective effect of CM was attenuated, characterized by a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in cell apoptosis and intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels. Knockdown of β-catenin using siRNAs also suppressed the mitochondrial biogenesis regulators PGC- 1 α, TFAM and NRF- 1. In the rat model, CM significantly alleviated renal function and histology associated with tubular injury and upregulated wnt 4 and β-catenin. However, the renoprotective effect of CM was blocked by ICG- 001, characterized by exacerbated renal function, suppressed PGC- 1 α expression and increased mitochondrial ROS. Clinical data showed that the <b>tubular</b> β-catenin <b>level</b> was lower in AKI patients experiencing partial recovery than in patients experiencing complete recovery. Conclusion: The activation of the wnt/β-catenin pathway by CM protects against cisplatin-induced kidney injury, resulting in reduced apoptosis and intracellular ROS levels...|$|R
