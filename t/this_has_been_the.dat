5|$|The river has a {{long history}} of {{improvements}} to facilitate navigation from Bridgwater to Taunton, and has also been used to power mills along its length. These two objectives are often antagonistic, and <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case on the River Tone.|$|E
5|$|An {{emergency}} procedure enabling an Act {{to come into}} force {{at the same moment}} as the receipt of the equivalent of the royal assent, when it is being announced at an ordinary sitting of the Tynwald, subject to its being promulgated within 12 months, was introduced in 1916; since 1988, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> normal procedure, but an Act ceases to have effect unless promulgated within 18 months after the equivalent of the royal assent is announced in the Tynwald.|$|E

5|$|The {{health risks}} {{associated}} with nuclear materials have also featured prominently in Australian anti-nuclear campaigns. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case worldwide because of accidents like the Chernobyl disaster, but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as controversy over {{the health effects of}} nuclear testing in Australia and the South Pacific, and the emergence of prominent anti-nuclear campaigners Helen Caldicott and Tilman Ruff, who are medical practitioners.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate than {{it has in the}} past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case as early 1893. The upper reaches of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system.|$|E
5|$|The Dogon {{people are}} {{an ethnic group}} in Mali, West Africa, {{reported}} by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius that would normally be considered impossible {{without the use of}} telescopes. In 1938 Marcel Griaule produced his dissertation and received his doctorate degree from the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE) based on his research work with the Dogon. According to Griaule's books Conversations with Ogotemmêli 1965 and The Pale Fox 1972 they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers. They also refer to a third star accompanying Sirius A and B. Robert Temple's 1976 book The Sirius Mystery, credits them with knowledge of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of controversy and speculation.|$|E
50|$|Despite that <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> most massive raid, <b>the</b> damages <b>were</b> again quite limited: 21 {{people were}} killed and 35 wounded; 59 {{buildings}} were destroyed and 135 damaged.|$|R

50|$|Alterations to <b>the</b> school uniform <b>were</b> {{made and}} <b>the</b> girls started wearing scarlet ties. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> school's colour from the beginning. A red P.E shirt was worn until a recent uniform update.|$|R
5|$|This {{was not the}} end of the controversy. A letter {{campaign}} led to {{the name}} of the park being changed to Whirls End State Forest Park in 1936; opponents of the new name launched another letter-writing campaign to revert the name to Worlds End State Forest Park. This matter was brought before the State Geographic Board, which supervised the official naming of places. The board ruled that the name be changed once again to Worlds End State Forest Park in 1943. The word Forest was dropped on November 11, 1954, when the park was officially named Worlds End State Park by the Pennsylvania Geographic Board. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> official name ever since, but the names Whirls End and Whirls Glen are still used, and are synonymous with Worlds End.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> only {{hijacking}} for Aeroméxico.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{a general}} pelagic {{organism}} decline (POD) was described, and <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> source of much concern within the scientific, managerial, and political communities.|$|E
2500|$|<b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> first rate {{war on the}} Columbia in many years. [...] It {{began when}} Iralda, {{operated}} by Lawrence H. Holman (1885-1941), cut its rates to $1 each way from Portland to Astoria.|$|R
50|$|For {{most of the}} history, Vietnamese kings {{sometimes}} {{recognized the}} Chinese Emperor as their feudal lord, while ruling independently in their own land. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case throughout {{the reign of the}} Later Lê dynasty.|$|R
25|$|The {{bridge and}} {{causeway}} <b>was</b> part of <b>the</b> King's highway between Derby and Coventry. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> main route {{between the two}} cities since before the Norman Conquest, and there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a river crossing on the site.|$|R
25|$|More than a {{third of}} nurses in {{training}} fail to complete the training course, and <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case for more than a century.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, the {{consumption}} of dog meat is taboo in Europe. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case for many centuries, although exceptions have occurred in times of scarcity such as sieges or famines.|$|E
25|$|The Research Complex {{hosts the}} Piedmont Wetlands Research Project, {{a golf course}} (open to faculty, {{students}} and alumni), and a world-class disc golf course. (<b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> site of the United States Disc Golf Championship since its opening in 1999).|$|E
50|$|Cranmere Pool {{was once}} a {{permanent}} pool of water, but William Crossing, writing early in the 20th century, stated that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{over a hundred years}} since <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case. The only time there is standing water today is after heavy rainfall.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{upper deck}} <b>was</b> divided into a smoking room, staterooms, and a cabin for ladies and another cabin for gentlemen. [...] <b>The</b> upper deck <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{extended}} over <b>the</b> wheel, {{to prevent it}} from splashing water onto the cabin deck. [...] <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> idea of Mr. Biles.|$|R

25|$|The DARPA Grand Challenge and DARPA Urban Challenge have {{encouraged}} development of even more autonomous capabilities for ground vehicles, while <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> demonstrated goal for aerial robots since 1990 {{as part of}} the AUVSI International Aerial Robotics Competition.|$|E
25|$|One of the latest, {{and quite}} controversial, {{hypotheses}} of long term flooding is the Black Sea deluge hypothesis, which argues for a catastrophic deluge about 5600BC from the Mediterranean Sea into the Black Sea. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of considerable discussion.|$|E
25|$|Lehman {{supported}} Ostrom and Wellnhofer's {{conclusion that}} there was only one valid species of Triceratops. He divided the Ceratopsidae into two subfamilies originally named by Lambe, the Centrosaurinae and the Chasmosaurinae. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> accepted classification scheme for ceratopsids ever since.|$|E
50|$|By 2009, <b>the</b> {{monument}} <b>was</b> in need {{of repair}} and maintenance. Previously, <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> responsibility of the Green Areas Trust, but this body was now defunct, and so <b>the</b> monument <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> maintained for a decade, and required attention including testing for structural integrity, cleaning, and refacing of the pedestal.|$|R
25|$|Lucy Duff-Gordon's {{connection}} to her design empire began to disintegrate following a restructuring of Lucile, Ltd in 1918–19. An acrimonious battle {{emerged in the}} press, culminating in her public acknowledgement that many Lucile dresses were not designed by her. Lucy Duff-Gordon's autobiography acknowledges that <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case since at least 1911.|$|R
50|$|A {{collection}} {{comparable to}} the Institute's treasures could not be assembled today, since Middle Eastern governments no longer allow foreign archeologists to take home half of what they find. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> typical arrangement in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when most of <b>the</b> holdings <b>were</b> excavated, until <b>the</b> 1930s, when new antiquities laws were instituted.|$|R
25|$|A cline {{of genes}} with highest {{frequencies}} in the Middle East, spreading to lowest levels northwest. Cavalli-Sforza originally described this as faithfully reflecting {{the spread of}} agriculture in Neolithic times. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> general tendency in interpretation of all genes with this pattern.|$|E
25|$|The IRA {{has also}} {{received}} weapons and logistical support from Irish Americans in the United States. Apart from the Libyan aid, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> {{main source of}} overseas IRA support. American support has been weakened by the War against Terrorism, and {{the fallout from the}} events of 11 September 2001.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{for freedom of}} religion in accordance with established customs, and the government generally respects this right in practice. However, there were some restrictions. It is an offence to proselyte other religions. The federal Constitution declares that Islam is the official religion {{of the country and}} <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> basis of some rules in the country.|$|E
50|$|However, in 1812, Matthew Murray and John Blenkinsop had {{produced}} the first twin cylinder steam locomotive, Salamanca, for Middleton Colliery railway near Leeds, using a pinion engaging with teeth along the iron edge rails track (first rack railway). <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> first steam locomotive railway to work successfully, but <b>the</b> system <b>was</b> complex and expensive.|$|R
50|$|Annamese rulers {{recognised}} the Chinese emperor {{as their}} feudal lord while ruling independently {{in their own}} land. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case throughout {{the reign of the}} Later Lê dynasty. This changed, however, when the brothers of Tây Sơn, leading a national uprising, defeated the feuding Trịnh and Nguyễn lords and overthrew the last Lê ruler, Lê Chiêu Thống.|$|R
50|$|After Boston's {{city hall}} left, <b>the</b> whole {{building}} <b>was</b> rented out for commercial use. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case once before, {{in the interim}} between the State House period and the City Hall period. Occupants included tailors, clothing merchants, insurance agents, railroad line offices, and more. As many as fifty businesses used the building at once.|$|R
