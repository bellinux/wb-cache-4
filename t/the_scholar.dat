5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>scholar</b> István Boná, Thurisind's rise {{to power}} is a typical example of the {{conflicts}} among the leading families for the kingship that plagued Gepidia in the 6th century and {{made it difficult to}} maintain the succession within the king's family. To contain these obstacles Thurisind made Turismod, his oldest son, commander of the Gepid forces in Sirmium, an important position that made Turismod the king's heir apparent (in early Germanic custom the eldest son was not necessarily the first in line of succession). After Turismod died, his younger brother Cunimund became commander in Sirmium and thus heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|As {{bishop and}} archbishop, Oswald was a {{supporter}} {{and one of}} the leading promoters (together with Æthelwold) of Dunstan's reforms of the church, including monastic reforms.

Oswald also switched the cathedral chapter of Worcester from secular clergy to monks. While archbishop, he brought <b>the</b> <b>scholar</b> Abbo of Fleury to teach, and he spent two years in England, mostly at Ramsey. Oswald died in 992, while washing the feet of the poor. A hagiographical life was written shortly after his death, and he was quickly hailed as a saint.|$|E

5|$|High (early) dating hypothesis: Giovanni Pettinato {{supports}} {{an early}} dating for Ebla {{that would put}} the destruction at around 2500 BC. Pettinato, while preferring the date of 2500 BC, later accepted the event could have happened in 2400 BC. <b>The</b> <b>scholar</b> suggests the city was destroyed in 2400 BC by a Mesopotamian such as Eannatum of Lagash—who boasted of taking tribute from Mari—or Lugalzagesi of Umma, {{who claimed to have}} reached the Mediterranean.|$|E

Goldstucker tested the boundaries of Dubček’s devotion to {{freedom of the press}} when he appeared on a television interview as the new head of the union. On 4 February, in front of the entire nation, he openly criticized Novotny, exposing all of Novotny’s previously unreported policies and explaining how they were preventing progress in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the Qedarites {{ceased to exist}} as a {{separately}} defined confederation or people. Allies with the Nabataeans, {{it is likely that}} they were absorbed into the Nabataean state around the 2nd century CE. In Islam, Isma'il is considered to be the ancestral forefather of the Arab people, and in traditional Islamic historiography, Muslim historians have assigned great importance in their accounts to his first two sons (Nebaioth and Qedar), with the genealogy of Muhammad, the Messenger of God in Islam, alternately assigned to one or the other son, depending on <b>the</b> <b>scholar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|These {{writings}} {{belong to}} {{a special kind of}} Rabbinical literature - so-called [...] "objections" [...] raised by <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> of Provence against attempts by <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> from [...] "Eretz Islam" [...] to force the adoption of their halakhot and commentaries. From this point of view, Zerachiah stands together with Abraham ben David [...] of Posquieres, known because of his objections to Maimonides, though even between them there was sufficient difference of opinion. Zerachiah, in many cases, prefers the variants of commentaries supplemented by Rashi, and, to a great extent, he relies upon the methods of <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> of France in commentaries on Gemara. From this point of view, the works of Zerachiah reflect a mingling of the school of halakha and the drasha of <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> of Spain and France not uncommon in Provence.|$|R
50|$|For a year, Rabbi Yakov Beirav {{discussed}} {{the issues of}} re-establishment institution of semicha with <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> of Safed. After much discussion <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> at Safed {{came to the conclusion}} that Maimonides' view was correct, and that there was a pressing need to re-establish the Sanhedrin. In 1538 twenty-five Rabbis met in an assembly at Safed and ordained Rabbi Yakov Beirav, giving him the right to ordain others who would then form a Sanhedrin. After sending a delegation to Jerusalem, Rabbi Yakov Beirav expounded on Shabbat before all <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> of Safed <b>the</b> halachic basis of the re-establishment of semicha and its implications, with an intent to dispel any remaining doubts. On hearing of this event, approximately two hundred <b>scholars,</b> most of <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> in Land of Israel, also expressed their consent. To obtain the good-will of <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> of Jerusalem, Rabbi Yakov Beirav sent Rabbi Shlomo Chazan to inform them of the reinstitution of semicha and to obtain their approval. He extended semicha to the chief Rabbi at Jerusalem, Levi ben Yakov ibn Chaviv, (Ralbach).|$|R
50|$|The Ralbach however {{rejected}} the semicha. He considered it {{an insult to}} his dignity and to the dignity of Jerusalem that so important a change should be effected without consultation of <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> of Jerusalem. Rabbi Moshe deCastro of Jerusalem also expressed doubts over the applicability of semicha. Because of this opposition some of <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> of Safed also began to entertain doubts. Rabbi Yakov Beirav again assembled <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> of Safed, and reviewed the halachic basis for re-establishment of semicha. Rabbi Yosef Karo and others sent a treatise Maaseh Beis Din to <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> of Jerusalem explaining the basis for semicha and protesting their opposition to its re-establishment. In the course of time, the Ralbach put his objections to Rabbi Yakov Beirav's semicha in writing, involving additional <b>scholars</b> in <b>the</b> dispute. In response Rabbi Yakov Beirav composed and distributed Iggeret Hasemicha to settle any halachic doubts. The dispute lasted for a year. In general <b>the</b> <b>scholars</b> outside of Land of Israel did not get involved {{at this stage in}} the dispute, {{with the exception of the}} Radbaz.|$|R
5|$|Much of Wodehouse's use of slang terms {{reflects}} {{the influence of}} his time at school in Dulwich, and partly reflects Edwardian slang. As a young man he enjoyed the literary works of Arthur Conan Doyle and Jerome K. Jerome, and the operatic works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Wodehouse quotes from and alludes to numerous poets throughout his work. <b>The</b> <b>scholar</b> Clarke Olney lists those quoted, including Milton, Byron, Longfellow, Coleridge, Swinburne, Tennyson, Wordsworth and Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} serious post-war studies of Meyerbeer and grand opera was Crosten's 1948 book Grand Opera: An Art and a Business which laid out the themes and {{standards}} for much subsequent research. A major contribution to revival of interest in Meyerbeer {{was the work of}} <b>the</b> <b>scholar</b> Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer's complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert Letellier has translated the diaries and undertaken a wide range of Meyerbeer studies. Not least, the establishment of a 'Meyerbeer Fan Club' in America has stimulated interest.|$|E
5|$|Ryholt's {{hypothesis}} regarding Sheshi {{comes with}} his dating {{the start of}} the 14th Dynasty around 1805 BC, over 90 years earlier than accepted by most Egyptologists. They propose instead that the 14th Dynasty emerged during the two decades of Merneferre Ay's reign, which is dated to between 1700 BC and 1660 BC, depending on <b>the</b> <b>scholar.</b> Ay is the last 13th Dynasty pharaoh to be attested in Lower Egypt, and most scholars therefore contend that he abandoned Itjtawy, the capital of Egypt since the reign of Amenemhat I (c. 1980 BC), in favor of Thebes as he lost control of the Delta region to the 14th Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Baekje {{in the form}} of {{classical}} Chinese books likely written on paper and {{in the form of}} manuscript rolls (kansubon).
