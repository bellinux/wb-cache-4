Employers' Expectations for Head of <b>Technical</b> <b>Services</b> Positions in Academic Libraries. Library Collections, Acquisitions and <b>Technical</b> <b>Services,</b> 33 (2009)) <b>Technical</b> <b>services</b> in libraries have been defined as "library operations concerned with the acquisition, organization (bibliographic control), physical processing, and maintenance of library collections, {{as opposed to the}} delivery of public services. " (Reitz, 2009) In the past 10 years or so, <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> experienced tremendous changes due to advances in technology, scholarly communication, research, information retrieval and higher education. Have the employers' expectations for head of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> positions changed in the past 10 years or so? This study uses job ads for head of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> positions in academic libraries to answer the following research questions. Considered together and separately, the research questions (RQ) attempt to compare employers' expectations for head of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> positions in academic libraries from 1996 - 1998 to those in 2006 - 2008 to track changes. RQ 1 : Have the position titles for head of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> positions in academic libraries changed from 1996 to 2008 ? RQ 2 : Have the areas of responsibilities of head of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> positions in academic libraries changed from 1996 to 2008 ? RQ 3 : Have the employers' required/preferred requirements for head of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> positions in academic libraries changed from 1996 to 2008 ? This study uses the content analysis model (Hall-Ellis 2006) [...] a coding scheme that includes an appropriate code for each data element along with detailed instructions.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} factors that {{influence}} perceived and expected daily task competencies for <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrators; that is, the competencies <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrators claim to possess (perceived) and those they believe they ought to possess (expected) in the areas of acquisitions, cataloging, and serials. For the purposes of this paper, a <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrator is one who oversees, at a minimum, the acquisitions, cataloging, and serials units in her library. The author surveyed 116 <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> administrators via e-mail in Fall 2003, receiving a response rate of fifty-four percent and an acceptable use rate of fifty-three percent. The survey was designed to correlate perceived and expected competencies with (1) an incumbent’s professional background; (2) tenure in current position at present institution; and (3) size of <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> unit as measured in full-time equivalents (FTE). The study concludes that incumbent tenure and size of the <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> unit affect both perceived and expected competencies, with the latter having a greater effect. Professional background affects competency possession, but has only a marginal effect on competency expectation. The findings reveal that administrators with ten or more years in their current positions, who have non-cataloging backgrounds, and who have at least ten FTE in their <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> units are least likely to know the daily procedures of their <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> units. Administrators with ten or more years in their current positions, who have cataloging backgrounds, and who have at least ten FTE in their <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> units are least likely to feel they ought to know the daily procedures of their <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> departments.

The poster {{reports on the}} research findings about the roles of paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries in the previous five years. Due to factors including technological advances, budget cuts, reorganizations, downsizing, outsourcing, expanded roles of professionals {{and changes in the}} information world, the workload among professionals and paraprofessionals has been redistributed in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries. Today, paraprofessionals manage major functional areas in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> and dominate the <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> work force. The roles of paraprofessionals have expanded to include duties that used to be considered the sole responsibilities of professionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services.</b> In 2011, the author conducted a survey to understand more about the roles of paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries in the previous five years. The survey was designed to answer the following research questions: 1. 	In the previous five years, what educational degrees and high-level skills are required for the positions of professionals and paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries according to their official job descriptions? What are the similarities and differences? 2. 	In the previous five years, what complex duties are regularly assigned (i. e., officially part of the job description) to professionals and paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries, either full or part time? What are the similarities and differences? 3. 	In the previous five years, have the roles of paraprofessionals in <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> in academic libraries been expanded, grown smaller, or remained the same in complex duties? 4.
