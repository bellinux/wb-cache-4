40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of bi-metal lining pipes {{is more and}} more extensive because of low cost and resistance to corrosion. The inner diameter of bi-metal lining pipe decreases 1 mm∼ 8 mm as compared to carbon steel pipe. It's necessary to reevaluate the <b>transporting</b> <b>capacity</b> and friction loss of bi-metal pipes. The flow frictional characteristics and <b>transporting</b> <b>capacity</b> of bi-metal lining pipe whose outer diameter ranged from φ 114 mm to φ 324 mm were studied. Studies showed that the inner surface roughness affected <b>transporting</b> <b>capacity</b> much more than the flow cross section in condition of the same pipe size. Wall thickness of lining pipe had little effects on the <b>transporting</b> <b>capacity</b> when it was less than 4 mm. The friction of bi-metal lining pipe was less than carbon steel pipe. Therefore, the <b>transporting</b> <b>capacity</b> of bi-metal lining pipe was higher than carbon steel pipe by 23 %- 46 % in condition of the same pipe size and pressure drop, and the transporting distance was much farther. Research results in the paper provide reliable guidance for designing bi-metal lining gas pipelines...|$|R

40|$|The {{changes in}} the {{parameters}} of the <b>transporting</b> <b>capacity</b> of albumin, in some biochemical plasma parameters, and in the impact of low-energy laser irradiation on the studied parameters were examined in patients with severe mechanical injury in the early posttraumatic period. Thirty patients aged 17 to 70 years who had a health status of 78 to 98 scores by the APACHE-III scale were examined. The results indicated that as a consequence of prior hypoxia of mixed genesis and subsequent reperfusion and later on due to the development of endogenous intoxication, there were {{changes in the}} <b>transporting</b> <b>capacity</b> of albumin and in the de Ritis coefficient, a reduction in cholesterol concentrations, and increases in the levels of triglycerides and in the activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Early quantum hemotherapy as a part of complex treatment makes it possible to prevent the progressive deterioration of the <b>transporting</b> <b>capacity</b> of plasma albumin, the critical reduction in the effective concentration of albumin, contributes to a more rapid recovery of the lowered levels of cholesterol and to a further increase in the activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, which is indicative of the recovered biosynthetic activity of the liver and its enhanced detoxifying activity...|$|R

30|$|Form {{factor is}} a {{dimensionless}} {{ratio of the}} area (A) of a drainage basin to the square of its maximum length (Lb) (Horton 1932). Basin shape may be indexed by simple dimensionless ratios of the basic measurements area, perimeter and length (Singh 1998). Form factor is an indicator for flood formation and move, degree of erosion and <b>transport</b> <b>capacities</b> of sediment load in a watershed. The Ff of CW is 0.13 and that of 9 sub-watersheds (Table  3) varies from 0.17 to 0.24. The value of Ff varies from 0 (highly elongated shape) to unity i.e.; 1 (perfect circular shape). Main watershed and sub-watersheds shows a lower value of Ff which implies more elongated basin with flatter peak of low flow for longer duration, lower erosion and sediment <b>transport</b> <b>capacities</b> and favors a diminution of floods because streams flow into the main stream at greater time intervals and space which leads to ground water percolation.|$|R

25|$|Together, the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) act as {{a carbon}} sink, {{absorbing}} atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it in solution. If the SAMW temperature increases {{as a result of}} climate change, the SAMW will have less capacity to store dissolved carbon dioxide. Research using a computerized climate system model suggests that if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were to increase to 860 ppm by the year 2100 (roughly double today's concentration), the SAMW will decrease in density and salinity. The resulting reductions in the subduction and <b>transport</b> <b>capacity</b> of SAMW and AAIW water masses could potentially decrease the absorption and storage of CO2 in the Southern Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{contributes}} {{greatly to}} soil erosion and sediment deposition through intensive management or inefficient land cover. It {{is estimated that}} agricultural land degradation is leading to an irreversible decline in fertility on about 6 million ha of fertile land each year. The accumulation of sediments (i.e. sedimentation) in runoff water affects water quality in various ways. Sedimentation can decrease the <b>transport</b> <b>capacity</b> of ditches, streams, rivers, and navigation channels. It can also {{limit the amount of}} light penetrating the water, which affects aquatic biota. The resulting turbidity from sedimentation can interfere with feeding habits of fishes, affecting population dynamics. Sedimentation also affects the transport and accumulation of pollutants, including phosphorus and various pesticides.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{began its}} own air bridge in April 1961, {{as well as}} {{photographic}} reconnaissance efforts. RLAF <b>transport</b> <b>capacity</b> was augmented to 13 C-47s, and {{were used for the}} RLAF's first significant airlift when they carried three battalions of Royal Lao troops to Sam Neua. The U. S. also supplied ten more AT-6s for ground attack missions to the RLAF via the medium of the Thai air force. During a four plane sortie by AT-6s flown from Luang Prabang's airfield during April 1961, Lieutenant Khampanh of the RLAF downed a Soviet Ilyushin Il-4 of its air bridge fleet, using unguided missiles to do so. This was the RLAF's sole air-to-air victory. However, shortcomings of the aging AT-6s were becoming apparent to the U. S. and T-28s being retired by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force were earmarked for the RLAF, but not delivered because of the truce.|$|E

There is an aspiration for half-hourly services, however due to the large sections of single-track and the congested main line from Temple Meads, such frequency is not currently feasible. However, it is expected that with the four-tracking of Filton Bank, including the Severn Beach line between Temple Meads and Narroways Hill Junction, that there will be sufficient capacity to allow half-hourly services. The Invitation to Tender for the new Greater Western franchise asks bidders to include costs for two trains per hour each direction on the Severn Beach line, one between Severn Beach and , the other between Severn Beach and , both calling at all stations. These services are to run from December 2017, operating 18 hours a day Monday-Saturday and 9 hours a day on Sundays.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{were exposed}} to the first large scale {{airborne}} attack in history. During the invasion of the Netherlands, the Germans threw into battle almost their entire Luftlandekorps, an airborne assault army corps that consisted of one parachute division and one division of airlanding troops plus the necessary <b>transport</b> <b>capacity.</b> The existence of this formation had been carefully kept secret until then. Two simultaneous airborne operations were launched. German paratroopers landed at three airfields near The Hague, hoping to seize the Dutch government. From one of these airfields, they were driven out after the first wave of reinforcements, brought in by Ju-52s, was annihilated by anti-aircraft fire and fierce resistance by some remaining Dutch defenders. As a result, numerous crashed and burning aircraft blocked the runway, preventing further reinforcements from landing. This {{was one of the few}} occasions where an airfield captured by paratroops has been recaptured. The other two airfields were recaptured as well. Simultaneously, the Germans dropped small packets of paratroopers to seize the crucial bridges that led directly across the Netherlands and into the heart of the country. They opened the way for the 9th Panzer Division. Within a day, the Dutch position became hopeless. Nevertheless, Dutch forces inflicted high losses on German transportation aircraft. Moreover, 1200 German elite troops from the Luftlandekorps taken prisoner around The Hague, were shipped to England just before the capitulation of the Dutch armed forces.|$|E
