2500|$|On {{the final}} day of the inquest held at the coroner’s court, Dacre and other Mail {{executives}} had lunch with Sir Paul Condon, then Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, [...] "who very eloquently <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> as guilty as sin". Four of the five suspects had never provided any alibi for their whereabouts on the night of Stephen Lawrence's murder and they invoked the privilege against self incrimination to avoid giving evidence and exposing themselves to cross examination. The police believed that the alibi of the fifth suspect was unconvincing. The newspaper on 14 February 1997, under its headline asserted: [...] "The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us". No claim was issued and the newspaper received significant acclaim and opprobrium as a result. Two of the men featured on the Mail front page were convicted of Stephen Lawrence's murder in January 2012. Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian wrote of the development: [...] "He made an unlikely anti-racist campaigner, but there were few voices more critical in the demand for justice for Stephen Lawrence than Paul Dacre and the Daily Mail.|$|E

2500|$|Love {{remembers that}} Capitol's working {{title for the}} album was Our Freaky Friends, and that the label planned the cover shoot at the zoo, with the animals {{representing}} the group's [...] "freaky friends". In May, the San Diego Union reported that the group [...] "came down from Hollywood to take a cover picture for their forthcoming album Our Freaky Friends.... Zoo officials were not keen about having their beloved beasts connected with {{the title of the}} album, but gave in when the Beach Boys explained that animals are an 'in' thing with teenagers. And that the Beach Boys were rushing to beat the rock and roll group called The Animals." [...] Asher remembered: [...] " [...] had some proofs of the pictures they'd done at the zoo, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> thinking of calling the album Pet Sounds. I thought it was a goofy name for an album – I thought it trivialized what we had accomplished." [...] Until arriving to the photo shoot, Jardine thought that [...] "pet" [...] referred to slang for making out ("petting"). Jardine also expressed disappointment with the chosen cover, believing it was [...] "crazy" [...] to go to the zoo, that [...] "the art department screwed up pretty badly on that one... wanted a more sensitive and enlightening cover." [...] Author Peter Doggett writes that the design was at odds with the increasingly sophisticated cover portraits used on releases by artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan over 1965–67. He highlights it as [...] "a warning of what could happen when music and image parted company: songs of high romanticism, an album cover of stark banality." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the casting}} team had {{successfully}} cast the actors who were playing Sam's brothers, {{they already knew}} what facial attributes they needed for Sam to create a similar family resemblance. Producer Corinne Hollingworth has commented, [...] "we'd decided on Steve [...] and Ross [...] and we knew the sort of round, open face we needed. We saw Danniella (Westbrook) first and liked her, then saw some others, but came back to her." [...] The actress, {{a graduate of the}} Sylvia Young Theatre School, had already appeared in the soap aged 11, as an extra who rollerskated across the soap's fictional setting of Albert Square in front of the characters Den and Angie Watts. At the time, Westbrook's local paper ran a story on her with the punchline, [...] "who knows, one day she might be the show's star". Eighty girls auditioned for the part of Sam, but these eighty were eventually whittled down to four. On her final casting callback, Westbrook bumped into actors Michelle Gayle and Sid Owen, who were already on the EastEnders cast as Hattie Tavernier and Ricky Butcher respectively. Westbrook already knew Gayle, whose character was to be Sam's screen best friend, and she introduced her to Owen, whose character was scripted to be Sam's boyfriend. According to Westbrook, she liked Owen right from the start and was amused by his response of [...] "You're a bit of alright. You can be Sam!". On Westbrook's last audition, she and the other hopefuls were forced to stand for a lengthy period in front of a panel of the show's producers, directors and writers while they continuously compared images of the auditionees to images of Kemp and McFadden, looking for a resemblance. Westbrook was given the part. She has commented, [...] "they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> looking for someone bright and bubbly, who could be the sister of Phil and Grant, and my round face fitted." [...] In the character's first scene, Sam walked past Ricky Butcher and gave him a [...] "flirty backward glance", causing him to walk into a lamp-post. Westbrook was initially given a three-month contract with the soap, but halfway through her contract the producers extended it as they felt [...] "the character of Sam had gelled well with the others and they wanted to include her in more storylines".|$|E
