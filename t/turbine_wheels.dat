2500|$|RB26DETT N1 is an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} standard RB26DETT engine. It was developed by Nissan Kohki's REINIK division for NISMO and N1 race cars. The standard RB26DETT, although known for its durability, proved to require too much maintenance for Group N (N1 class) racing conditions. REINIK started with a strengthened RB26DETT block. The N1 block is identified by its 24U number stamped on the block (05U standard blocks). The cylinder walls are thicker and water cooling channels are enhanced to increase flow. It also received an upgraded oil pump and water pump, to improve the cooling and lubrication for race conditions. The pistons have [...] top rings and were balanced before assembly but otherwise very close to standard. The connecting rods are also similar to standard but made from slightly stronger material and balanced. Standard crankshaft is balanced to a higher level. Higher flow exhaust manifolds and turbochargers were added for increased torque and slightly higher top-end power. <b>Turbine</b> <b>wheels</b> on the N1 turbochargers are also made from steel for durability, rather than the lighter but weaker ceramic found on the standard turbine.|$|E

50|$|The biggest {{difference}} between the turbochargers used in the N1 engine, and the standard RB26DETT engine, is that the <b>turbine</b> <b>wheels</b> in the turbocharger are made from steel, rather than the ceramic used for the standard RB26DETT turbochargers. The ceramic <b>turbine</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are found to be}} very unreliable when used at high rotational speeds inducing higher centrifugal forces (such as when the turbochargers are used at a higher boost pressure than stock).

As the LOX entered the outlet volute, velocity was converted to pressure and the LOX was discharged into the outlet duct at high pressure.|$|R

40|$|The {{designers}} of the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) {{are investigating the}} potential of nuclear powered-electric propulsion technology to provide deep space propulsion. In one design scenario a closed-Brayton-cycle power converter is used to convert thermal energy from a nuclear reactor to electrical power for the spacecraft utilizing an inert gas as the working fluid to run a turboalternator as described in L. S. Mason, "A Power Conversion for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter," Journal of Propulsion and Power, vol. 20, no. 5, pp. 902 - 910. A key component in the turboalternator is the radial flow <b>turbine</b> <b>wheel</b> which may be fabricated from a cast superalloy. This <b>turbine</b> <b>wheel</b> is envisioned to run continuously {{over the life of}} the mission, which is anticipated to be about ten years. This scenario places unusual material requirements on the <b>turbine</b> <b>wheel.</b> Unlike the case of terrestrial turbine engines, fatigue, associated with start-up and shut-down of the engine, foreign-object damage, and corrosion issues are insignificant and thus creep issues become dominate. The purpose of this paper is to present estimates for creep growth of a prototypical JIMO <b>turbine</b> <b>wheel</b> over a ten year life. Since an actual design and bill of materials does not exist, the results presented in this paper are based on preliminary concepts which are likely to evolve over time. For this reason, as well as computational efficiency, a simplified 2 -D, in lieu of a 3 -D, viscoelastic, finite element model of a prototypical <b>turbine</b> <b>wheel</b> will be utilized employing material properties for the cast superalloy MAR-M 247. The creep data employed in this analysis are based on preliminary data being generated at NASA Glenn Research Center...|$|R
50|$|The XJ49 {{design was}} truly a break from {{conventional}} design practices of the time. Most turbojet engines then used one centrifugal compressor, one <b>turbine</b> <b>wheel</b> and multiple combustion chambers that resembled long cylinders arranged in a conical pattern. The XJ49 design had a two-stage compressor made up of an axial-flow supersonic compressor at the engine intake, driven by the second power <b>turbine</b> <b>wheel,</b> followed by a spirally-shaped mixed flow compressor, driven by the first <b>turbine</b> <b>wheel,</b> giving an over-all compression ratio of 6:1. Power from the annular combustion chamber exhaust drives the complex two-stage turbine. The discharge flow from the first turbine stage drives an independent second-stage turbine. The blades of the last stage of the second turbine are extended beyond the engine core to form a supersonic fan that provides air flow around the engine core for additional thrust and further combustion. Supplementary burning (reheat or afterburning) between the two turbines and in the tailpipe {{can also be used}} for additional thrust.|$|R
