The new Supra would continue to move upscale and become a showcase for Toyota technology. Originally meant {{to be released in}} 1985, production delays caused the model to actually be introduced mid year. The all new Supra was powered by a 3.0-liter DOHC inline six-cylinder engine rated at 200bhp. Notable features included an electronically controlled independent suspension (called the Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension – TEMS), and some came with a removable Sport-Roof panel (<b>Targa</b> top).|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1930, Nuvolari {{decided to}} stop racing {{motorcycles}} and concentrate fully on cars for 1931. Regulations for the season required Grand Prix races {{to be at least}} 10hours long. For the Italian Grand Prix, Nuvolari was to share an Alfa Romeo with Baconin Borzacchini. The car started from ninth place on the grid, and when it retired with mechanical problems after 33 laps Nuvolari teamed up with Giuseppe Campari. The pair took the race win, although Nuvolari could not receive the championship points. Apart from the Belgian Grand Prix, where he came second, the only other European Championship race was the French Grand Prix, where he finished 11th. The same year, he won both the <b>Targa</b> Florio and the Coppa Ciano.|$|E
