25|$|Unger's work {{in office}} {{was an attempt}} to enact his program. Seeing the future in small {{enterprises}} and advocating a rotating capital fund that would function like a government run venture capital fund, he pushed for a rapid expansion of credit to smaller producers and a decentralized network of technical support centers that would help broaden the middle class from below. He further called for political solutions that would broaden access to production forces such as information technology, and for states to focus on equipping and monitoring civil society rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> social services.|$|E
25|$|When Vincent was {{not quite}} one year old his father, Toaly, decided to move the family, his wife, and seven {{children}} to New York {{in search of a}} better life. After settling in the Bronx in 1909, they remained trapped in poverty. Five of Vincent’s six siblings died before he was twelve. His mother died of tuberculosis in 1916, worn out after years of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> for her children. Vincent’s father Toaly had simply run off years before and was never heard from again. After his mother’s death, Vincent's surviving sister tried to raise him in a cold-water flat when Vincent was eleven.|$|E
25|$|After fatally {{shooting}} Bernall, Harris {{turned toward}} the next table, where Bree Pasquale sat next to the table rather than under it. Harris asked Pasquale {{if she wanted to}} die, and she responded with a plea for her life. Witnesses later reported that Harris seemed disoriented—possibly from the heavily bleeding wound to his nose. As Harris taunted Pasquale, Klebold noted Ireland <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> aid to Hall, who had suffered a wound to his knee. As Ireland tried to help Hall, his head rose above the table; Klebold shot him a second time, hitting him twice in the head and once in the foot. Ireland was knocked unconscious, but survived.|$|E

I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube {{had been in his}} pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{wanted the}} musical to appear like a [...] "corny and low-rent production". [...] The ensemble includes 10 actors from ages eight to twelve. [...] Though professionals, the child actors perform with a [...] "realistic lack of polish", {{as they are}} playing non-professional children of Scientologists, performing in a holiday pageant. The chorus portrays Thetans, and the reactive and analytical portions of the mind are depicted by two children who share a conjoined right brain costume. [...] During the Xenu story, the narrator is outfitted in a cardboard robot suit, and the actor portraying Xenu wears a [...] "tacky headdress". [...] Staging, costumes and set design are all made {{to appear to be}} the [...] "earnest work of schoolteachers and supportive parents <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a colorful and cheery atmosphere on a small budget." [...] The stage design includes a [...] "colorful, crayon-colored backdrop of space age-like, semi-circular set pieces." [...] Costumes include white robes, rainbow-striped socks and tinsel halos. [...] Props used to denote locations include [...] "a waving cardboard palm frond for Hawaii, a street sign and cell phones for New York." [...] The musical ends with a tableau vivant, where the audience sees the cast standing {{at the back of the}} theater holding candles and singing cheerfully as a door closes and they are blocked from view.|$|E
500|$|Similar to New Super Mario Bros., {{the game}} was {{developed}} with the intention to invoke nostalgic feelings in players with its art style and sound, while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> them with new gameplay experiences. Retro {{tried to make the}} game [...] "accessible to all players", but with a [...] "kind of difficulty that made players want to try it again". The game employs fully polygonal 3D graphics with levels containing three times the amount of textures and polygons that Retro's [...] offered in a single room. Though Miyamoto initially opposed the idea, simultaneous two-player gameplay was eventually implemented, contrary to the tag-team system of the original series. Tanabe said a partial inspiration for the feature was to make Returns [...] "stand out" [...] compared to the New Play Control! re-release of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. Over the course of six months, two-thirds of the game's tools and engine had to be rewritten by the programmers, the animation and collision systems being subject to the most changes, and while experiments were conducted with underwater levels, they were ultimately omitted as they felt too slow and unfitting to the overall gameplay. Two levels in the game, [...] "Tidal Terror" [...] and [...] "Mangoruby Run", proved to be the most difficult levels to design and program, each requiring several months of development time. In Returns, Retro tried to use the same camera engine used for the Morph Ball in Metroid Prime, but found it unable to handle the quick and complex movements of the characters, particularly after the implementation of two-player gameplay.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, IGN interviewed Namco {{producer}} Shinji Noguchi about the game's development. [...] Noguchi shared that, although the game was an entirely new property, its development leveraged Monolith Soft's previous experience developing role-playing games, including series such as Xenosaga. When asked why the game was being developed for the GameCube, Noguchi explained that the goal was to satisfy existing fans of the genre yearning for such games on the system, {{while at the same time}} <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> an intuitive experience for those new to role-playing titles.|$|E
2500|$|Fertility {{was found}} to be a {{significant}} factor in a man’s perception of his masculinity, driving many to keep the treatment a secret. In cases where the men did share that he and his partner were undergoing IVF, they reported to have been teased, mainly by other men, although some viewed this as an affirmation of support and friendship. For others, this led to feeling socially isolated. [...] In comparison with women, men showed less deterioration in mental health in the years following a failed treatment. However many men did feel guilt, disappointment and inadequacy, stating that they were simply <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> an ‘emotional rock’ for their partners.|$|E

2500|$|Public {{as well as}} {{political}} impatience with the war began to emerge in the spring of 1966. At the time, when Johnson's approval ratings were reaching new lows of 41 percent, Sen. Richard Russell, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, reflected the national mood in June 1966, when he declared it was time to [...] "get it over or get out". Johnson responded by saying to the press, [...] "we are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost." [...] In response to the intensified criticism of the war effort, Johnson employed the suspicion of communist subversion in the country, and press relations became strained. Johnson's primary war policy opponent in Congress included among others the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, James William Fulbright. The persistent Johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum, oil and lubrication facilities in North Vietnam in hopes of accelerating victory. Humphrey, Rusk and McNamara all agreed; the bombing began the end of June. In July polling results indicated that Americans favored the bombing campaign by a 5 to 1 margin; however, in August a Defense Department study indicated that the bombing campaign had little impact on North Vietnam.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, Retro saw the {{departure}} of three key developers, designer Mark Pacini, art director Todd Keller, and principal technology engineer Jack Mathews, {{who went on to}} form their own company, Armature Studio. Around the same time, Shigeru Miyamoto asked fellow producer Kensuke Tanabe to recommend a studio that could develop a new Donkey Kong game, and Tanabe recommended Retro. Kelbaugh had worked on the Donkey Kong Country series during his years at Nintendo of America, and had interest in continuing with the franchise. Retro accepted the task, and thus started development of Donkey Kong Country Returns. Similar to New Super Mario Bros., the game was developed with the intention to invoke nostalgic feelings in the player with its art style and sound, while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> them with new gameplay experiences. Returns employs fully polygonal 3D graphics with three times the amount of textures and polygons that Corruption offered, and over the course of six months, two thirds of the game's tools and engine had to be rewritten by the programmers. Development accelerated at the outset of 2010, and the project was just [...] "beginning to cohere as a game" [...] around the time of E3, when it was officially announced to the press. Although the game was set for release in autumn that year, the team still had 70 levels to create or refine. After the development of Returns was completed, two more key departures happened at Retro, with senior designers Kynan Pearson and Mike Wikan moving on to 343 Industries and id Software, respectively.|$|E
