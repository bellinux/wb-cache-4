2500|$|Thiamine {{in foods}} can be {{degraded}} {{in a variety}} of ways. Sulfites, which are added to foods usually as a preservative, will attack thiamine at the methylene bridge in the structure, cleaving the pyrimidine ring from the thiazole ring. [...] The rate of this reaction is increased under acidic conditions. Thiamine is degraded by <b>thermolabile</b> thiaminases (present in raw fish and shellfish). Some thiaminases are produced by bacteria. Bacterial thiaminases are cell surface enzymes that must dissociate from the membrane before being activated; the dissociation can occur in ruminants under acidotic conditions. Rumen bacteria also reduce sulfate to sulfite, therefore high dietary intakes of sulfate can have thiamine-antagonistic activities.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two common}} {{variants}} of MTHFR deficiency. In the more significant of the two, {{the individual is}} homologous for the 677T polymorphism.

50|$|In a {{study that}} was {{published}} in 1998, Hoshino et al. prepared a TRP with a maltose ligand, evaluated it with concanavalin A (Con A), and attempted to separate and purify α-glucosidase, a <b>thermolabile</b> compound. Since {{the goal is to}} selectively isolate a <b>thermolabile</b> enzyme, a TRP with a small LCST value is desired. To fit this condition, the selected TRP was poly(N-acryloylpiperidine)-cysteamine (pAP), which has an LCST of 4 °C. The terminally bound maltose moiety maintains affinity for both analytes, thus the modified TRP, pAPM, met critical conditions of external temperature requirements and affinity for both target analytes. The solubility properties changed from 4 °C (soluble) to 8 °C (insoluble). Several reagents were tested for the recovery of Con A by desorption which had higher binding affinities to Con A than maltose. These reagents were α-D-glucopyranoside, D-mannose, methyl α-D-mannopyranoside, and glucose. α-D-mannopyranoside was the most effective for desorbing Con A from pAPM at virtually 100% after 1 hour. As a control, pAPM was used to bind Con A from a crude extract, which found the pickup of several impurities but still managed to recover 80% of Con A. This exemplifies the need for selective moieties, maltose not residing among them. Finally, the application of pAPM was tested by attempting to separate α-glucosidase from yeast extract under low temperature conditions. In conclusion, the pAPM was found to recover 68% of α-glucosidase activity tested against, maltose being the selected desorption reagent.|$|E

50|$|Modern methods use {{supercritical}} fluids in the micronization process. These methods use supercritical fluids {{to induce}} {{a state of}} supersaturation, which leads to precipitation of individual particles. The most widely applied techniques of this category include the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions), the SAS method (Supercritical Anti-Solvent) and the PGSS method (Particles from Gas Saturated Solutions). These modern techniques allow for greater tuneability of the process. Parameters like relative pressure and temperature, solute concentration, and antisolvent to solvent ratio are varied to adjust the output to the producer's needs. The supercritical fluid methods result in finer control over particle diameters, distribution of particle size and consistency of morphology. Because of the relatively low pressure involved, many supercritical fluid methods can incorporate <b>thermolabile</b> materials.

In studies of human recombinant MTHFR, the protein encoded by 1305C cannot be distinguished from 1305A in terms of activity, thermolability, FAD release, or the protective effect of 5-methyl-THF. The C mutation does not appear to affect the MTHFR protein. It does not result in <b>thermolabile</b> MTHFR and does not appear to affect homocysteine levels. It does, however, affect the conversion of MTHF to BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin), an important cofactor in the production of neurotransmitters, and the synthesis of nitric oxide ...|$|E
5000|$|Initial {{application}} of the FLP-FRT recombinase did not work in mammals. The FLP protein was <b>thermolabile</b> (denatured at elevated temperatures) and therefore was not useful in the mammalian model due to elevated body temperatures of these model systems. However, due to patents and restrictions {{on the use of}} Cre-Lox recombination, great interest was taken to produce a more thermostable FLP-FRT cassette. Some of the first results were produced by Buchholz et al. (1997) by utilizing cycling mutagenesis in Escherichia coli [...] In their research, the authors transfected E. coli cells with two plasmids: one coding for randomly mutated FLP proteins downstream of an arabinose promoter and another containing a lacZ gene promoter within a FRT cassette. The E. coli were grown on arabinose plates at 37 °C and 40 °C, and if recombination occurred, the lacZ expression would be attenuated, and the colonies would appear white. White colonies were selected from each generation and grown on a new arabinose plates at same previous temperatures for eight generations. After recombination was confirmed by western-blotting and the mutated FLP genes were sequenced, this eighth generation FLP protein (FLPe) was transfected into mammalian cell culture, and recombination in mammalian cells was confirmed. This variant of FLP only has 4 amino acid substitutions: P2S, L33S, Y108N, and S294P.|$|E

40|$|Severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) {{deficiency}} {{with less}} than 2 % of normal enzyme activity is characterized by neurological abnormalities, atherosclerotic changes, and thromboembolism. We have discovered a "new" variant of MTHFR deficiency which {{is characterized by the}} absence of neurological abnormalities, an enzyme activity of about 50 % of the normal value, and distinctive thermolability under specific conditions of heat inactivation. In this study, lymphocyte MTHFR specific activities in the <b>thermolabile</b> variant and control groups were 5. 58 +/- 0. 91 and 10. 33 +/- 2. 89 nmol formaldehyde formed/mg protein/h, respectively. The difference was significant (P less than. 01). However, there was overlap among the individual values from the two groups. On the other hand, residual MTHFR activity after heat inactivation was 11. 2 +/- 1. 43 % in the <b>thermolabile</b> variant and 36. 3 +/- 5. 18 % in the controls. There was no overlap. Enzyme studies in 10 subjects with <b>thermolabile</b> MTHFR and their family members support the hypothesis that <b>thermolabile</b> MTHFR is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. To elucidate the association of <b>thermolabile</b> MTHFR with the development of coronary artery disease, we determined the thermostability of lymphocyte MTHFR in 212 patients with proven coronary artery disease and in 202 controls without clinical evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease. <b>Thermolabile</b> MTHFR was found in 36 (17. 0 %) cardiac patients and 10 (5. 0 %) controls. The difference in incidence between the two groups was statistically significant (P less than. 01). The average age at onset of clinical coronary artery disease in 36 patients with <b>thermolabile</b> MTHFR was 57. 3 +/- 7. 6 years (35 - 72 years). The mean total plasma homocysteine concentration in patients with <b>thermolabile</b> MTHFR was 13. 19 +/- 5. 32 nmol/ml and was significantly different from the normal mean of 8. 50 +/- 2. 80 nmol/ml (P less than. 05). There was no association between <b>thermolabile</b> MTHFR and other major risk factors. We conclude that <b>thermolabile</b> MTHFR is a variant(s) of MTHFR deficiency which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.

40|$|Influenza-associated {{encephalopathy}} (IAE) is {{a potentially}} fatal neurological complication of influenza infection {{usually in the}} presence of high and persistent fever. <b>Thermolabile</b> carnitine palmitoyltransferase II enzyme (CPT-II) predisposes IAE, so far only described in Japanese. As the genetic origins of Japanese and Chinese are alike, similar genetic risk factors in CPT-II are expected. We report the first two unrelated Chinese patients of <b>thermolabile</b> CPT-II variants that underlain the persistent high fever-triggered viral infection-associated encephalopathy, multi-organ failure and death. Elevated (C 16 : 0 +C 18 : 1) /C 2 acylcarnitines ratio and the CPT 2 susceptibility variant allele p. Phe 352 Cys; p. Val 368 Ile were detected. The asymptomatic family members of one patient also had abnormal long-chain acylcarnitines. In our experience of biochemical genetics, the elevated (C 16 : 0 C 18 : 1) /C 2 acylcarnitines ratio is unusual and specific for <b>thermolabile</b> CPT-II variants. Allele frequency of p. Phe 352 Cys; p. Val 368 Ile among Hong Kong Chinese was 0. 104, similar to Japanese data, and p. Phe 352 Cys has not been reported in Caucasians. This may explain the Asian-specific phenomenon of <b>thermolabile</b> CPT-II-associated IAE. We successfully demonstrated the <b>thermolabile</b> CPT-II variants in patients with viral infection-associated encephalopathy in another Asian population outside Japanese. The condition is likely under-recognized. With our first cases, it is envisaged that more cases will be diagnosed in subsequent years. The exact pathogenic mechanism of how other factors interplay with <b>thermolabile</b> CPT-II variants and high fever leading to IAE, is yet to be elucidated. Fasting and decreased intake during illness may aggravate the disease. Further studies including high risk and neonatal screening are warranted to investigate its expressivity, penetrance and temperature-dependent behaviors in <b>thermolabile</b> CPT-II carriers.

40|$|The work {{recorded}} above {{has served}} to corroborate {{the observations of}} other writers, notably of Noguchi, that in many human sera, if not in all, there develop, on standing, anticomplementary bodies which are delicately <b>thermolabile,</b> being inactivated by heating to 56 ° C. for fifteen to twenty minutes. It has appeared that these bodies may occasionally be present in sera which, after heating, may develop the thermostable anticomplementary body referred to by other authors. It has become evident also that the speed of development of the <b>thermolabile</b> anticomplementary body in different sera is subject to much variation. The <b>thermolabile</b> body appears as the complement disappears. The question arises whether the <b>thermolabile</b> anticomplementary body may not be originally present in the serum, temporarily masked by the native complement. This would seem improbable {{from the fact that}} titration has shown that 0. 1 and 0. 2 cubic centimeter of the inhibiting serum will often inhibit as much as 0. 6 cubic centimeter of fresh guinea-pig complement, a quantity superior to the amount of complement present originally in the antihemolytic serum. It seems, therefore, that the anticomplementary body must actually be formed in the serum during the period of preservation. The <b>thermolabile</b> antihemolytic body studied by us is like the thermostabile body investigated by Noguchi, in that it inhibits alien as well as homologous complement; it is unlike the thermostabile body, however, in that it cannot be absorbed from serum by digestion with red cells, nor does it render the treated cells more resistant to hemolysis. The <b>thermolabile</b> body may be removed from inhibiting sera by precipitating the globulins. A solution of the glotmiins then manifests a <b>thermolabile</b> anticomplementary action. No relationship between a clinical condition and the appearance of these bodies in the sera, has been found.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were; 1) to design and develop a laboratory scale microwave vacuum dehydration testing rig for drying of <b>thermolabile</b> materials; 2) to study the drying mechanism of <b>thermolabile</b> material; 3) to determine the kinetics of microwave energy transfer in a vacuum testing rig. A laboratory-scale microwave vacuum dehydration system was successfully developed for dehydration of <b>thermolabile</b> materials. Microwave is recognized as a fast heating process characterised by volumetric heating. Contrary to conventional dehydration method which heats {{from the surface of}} material, microwave heats material from inside out. Incorporation of vacuum enhances the microwave dehydration process by allowing water to vaporize at lower temperature. Thus, dehydration of <b>thermolabile</b> materials can be achieved at low temperature and shorter time thereby preventing degradation of nutritional values and texture. Behaviours of <b>thermolabile</b> materials such as jackfruit, guava and papaya in microwave vacuum dehydration were studied. Operating parameters such as microwave power and vacuum pressure were found to influence the dehydration process. Increment of microwave power resulted in higher drying rates but increased risks of charring. However, the charring could be reduced with combination of microwave power. Products dried by combination of microwave power has lesser shrinkage and softer texture due to porous (puffing) structure induced by vacuum condition. It also possessed better reconstitution ability. In addition, papaya dried using microwave vacuum was found to have high enzyme activity retained...|$|E
