25|$|For {{capacitors}} with a {{rated voltage}} of ≤ 315 volts the surge voltage is 1.15 times <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage,</b> and for capacitors with a rated voltage exceeding 315 volts the surge voltage is 1.10 times <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{surge voltage}} is {{standardized}} in IEC/EN 60384-1. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with a rated voltage {{of up to}} 315V, the surge voltage is 1.15 times <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage,</b> and for capacitors with a rated voltage exceeding 315V, the surge voltage is 1.10 times <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors are {{low voltage}} components. Safe {{operation}} {{requires that the}} voltage remain within specified limits. <b>The</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> UR is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously and remain within the specified temperature range. Capacitors should never be subjected to voltages continuously in excess of <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Film {{capacitors}} are not polarized and {{are suitable}} for handling an alternating <b>voltage.</b> Because <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> AC <b>voltage</b> is specified as an RMS value, the nominal AC voltage must be smaller than <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> DC <b>voltage.</b> Typical figures for DC voltages and nominally related AC voltages are given in the table below: ...|$|R

40|$|Polynomial load model {{practical}} application has some specificity. Per unit static load model dependence on node <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> value is demonstrated in this paper. <b>The</b> assigned <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> values of load nodes with polynomial characteristics {{are to be}} invariant to avoid calculation complementary error appearance. If <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> correction is necessary condition, for example to obtain calculation convergence, the active and reactive power drawn under <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> and polynomial coefficients must be corrected too. Correcting calculation expressions are presented in the paper...|$|R
25|$|Higher pulse rise {{times are}} {{permitted}} for pulse voltage lower than <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because the {{thickness}} of the effective dielectric is proportional to the forming voltage, the dielectric thickness can be tailored to <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of the capacitor. For example, for low voltage types a 10V electrolytic capacitor has a dielectric thickness of only about 0.014µm, a 100V electrolytic capacitor of only about 0.14µm. Thus, the dielectric strength also influences the size of the capacitor. However, due to standardized safety margins the actual forming voltage of electrolytic capacitors is higher than <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of the component.|$|E
25|$|Operating supercapacitors below <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> {{improves}} the long-time {{behavior of the}} electrical parameters. Capacitance values and internal resistance during cycling are more stable and lifetime and charge/discharge cycles may be extended.|$|E

5000|$|As stated above, {{there are}} {{two degrees of freedom}} within the per unit system that allow the {{engineer}} to specify any per unit system. The degrees of freedom are the choice of the base voltage (V) and the base power (S). By convention, a single base power (S) is chosen for both sides of the transformer and its value is equal to <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> power of <b>the</b> transformer. By convention, there are actually two different base voltages that are chosen, V and V which are equal to <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltages</b> for either side of the transformer. By choosing the base quantities in this manner, the transformer can be effectively removed from the circuit as described above. For example: ...|$|R
25|$|For {{tantalum}} {{electrolytic capacitors}} the surge {{voltage can be}} 1.3 times <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage,</b> rounded off to the nearest volt. The surge voltage applied to tantalum capacitors may influence the capacitor's failure rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{thickness}} of the spacer depends on <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of the electrolytic capacitor. It is up to 100V between 30 and 75µm. For higher voltages, several layers of paper (duplex paper) are used to increase the breakdown strength.|$|E

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolytes normally can be charged up to <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> without any current limitation.

25|$|The {{surge voltage}} {{indicates}} the maximum peak voltage value {{that may be}} applied to electrolytic capacitors during their application for {{a limited number of}} cycles.

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are relatively insensitive to high and short-term transient voltages {{higher than the}} surge voltage, if the frequency and the energy content of the transients is low.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> {{includes}} a safety margin against the electrolyte's {{breakdown voltage at}} which the electrolyte decomposes. The breakdown voltage decomposes the separating solvent molecules in the Helmholtz double-layer, f. e. water splits into hydrogen and oxide.

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolytes normally can be charged up to <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> without any current surge, peak or pulse limitation.
