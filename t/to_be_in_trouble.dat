One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Lucas di Grassi {{challenged}} Jarno Trulli for the lead, but Trulli closed the racing line into turn one. As Trulli lost the rear end of the car going into turn three, di Grassi took the lead. The other Audi Sport Abt of Daniel Abt was less fortunate, being sent into a spin at the same corner, dropping {{to the back of the}} field. Nelson Piquet, Jr. immediately made up for ground lost in qualifying, gaining three positions during the first lap, running in tenth place. At turn six on the following lap, he went past Stéphane Sarrazin (Venturi) for ninth. While di Grassi built an early lead, several manoeuvres were made behind him, with Nicolas Prost (e.dams-Renault) losing two positions to Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Dragon Racing) and Vitantonio Liuzzi (Trulli GP), dropping back to seventh. Pole sitter Jarno Trulli looked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with his car and lost positions continuously, running in thirteenth after lap twelve. Third placed Nick Heidfeld was also unable to hold onto his podium position, being overtaken by d'Ambrosio on lap thirteen.|$|E

Also, a number of major manufacturers had joined Formula One since 2000 - there were now 8 manufacturers participating in some form in Formula One. Toyota, Ford/Jaguar and Renault had joined as full works teams, and Mercedes, Honda, BMW and Cosworth were all supplying engines to specific teams.|$|E

When stumps was called at the end of the second day North Otago was in a strong position, being 138-3 with a lead of 186. the inning was completed just after lunch on the third day and North Otago had 262 on the board to set Manawatu 311 of 58 overs for an outright victory. Darren Broom scored the second century of the game, combining with Drew for an 83 run partnership for the 4th wicket. For Manawatu J Cunningham took the a five wicket bag, finishing with 5-99 of his 33 overs. Manawatu started aggressively in their innings looking to put North Otago under pressure, however with wickets constantly falling and good partnerships failing to materialize they fell short by 159 runs to retain the Hawke Cup. Once again David Sewell picked up three wickets finishing with 3-31 of 8 overs while captain Chirs Smith took 3-23 including the final wicket. North Otago victors in its fourth Hawke Cup Challenge and for the first time in the 99-year history of the cup, holders of the Hawke Cup.|$|E
