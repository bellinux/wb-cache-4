5|$|Fifty years later, the Protestants of London Missionary Society came to New Caledonia, {{which was}} {{followed}} by entry of the French Catholics to the island, in 1843. <b>This</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> conflict between the two religious factions and eventually the French Catholics' control of the islands prevailed. The island nation was thereafter annexed by France, in 1853.|$|E

5|$|Mining and {{metallurgy}} developed further {{during the}} 16th century, and technical progress {{took place in}} various commercial applications. Great quantities of exported agricultural and forest products floated down the rivers to be transported through ports and land routes. <b>This</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> positive trade balance for Poland throughout the 16th century. Imports from the West included industrial products, luxury products and fabrics.|$|E

5|$|Political and {{financial}} problems led to very low {{oil prices and}} oversupply, causing most metals to drop in price. The economies of China, India and other emerging countries slowed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014 alone, 23,722,890 motor vehicles were produced in China, excluding motorbikes. <b>This</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rhodium price of 740.00 US-$ per Troy ounce (31.1 grams) in late November 2015.|$|E

5|$|After ReaLemon {{met with}} success in European markets, Borden {{introduced}} {{it into the}} United Kingdom in 1975, as a 250 ml bottle of lemon juice. By 1980, ReaLemon comprised around 25% of the U.K. lemon juice market. In response to this competition, Reckitt & Coleman, the producers of Jif lemon juice began producing Jif in 150 ml- and 250 ml-sized bottles. Borden then began making plans to market ReaLemon in a lemon-shaped package that was similar to Jif's packaging. <b>This</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lawsuit initiated by Reckitt & Coleman against Borden, alleging that ReaLemon copied Jif's packaging to mislead consumers by confusing their product with Jif.|$|E

50|$|PFK {{deficiency}} {{is believed}} to be the result of <b>a</b> nonsense mutation <b>in</b> the gene that encodes for PFKM. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unstable, truncated protein that lacks normal function. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> near complete loss of PFKM activity in the skeletal muscle. Dogs with the mutation display 10-20% of normal PFK activity in their erythrocytes, due to a higher proportion of PFKM in those cells.|$|R

5|$|Columbia Records {{executive}} Tommy Mottola {{had approached}} Anthony {{to sign a}} contract with the company to record an album in English during the peak period of Latin artists crossing over the Anglophone market. Nonetheless, his contract with RMM denied Anthony the right to perform in Spanish for Colombia Records. <b>This</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lawsuit against Mercado because Anthony did not want to work under him anymore. As part of the settlement, RMM Records retained the rights to his earlier albums and to release a greatest hits collection from them while Anthony no longer had any obligations to RMM.|$|E
5|$|During World War II civil {{aerodromes}} {{were taken}} over for military use, existing military airfields were expanded, and new ones were built. <b>This</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> significant inventory of facilities becoming available after the war. Pre-war civil aerodromes, for example Sywell, {{were returned to}} civilian use. Surplus military airfields were closed, and in some cases, for example Beccles, subsequently re-opened as civil aerodromes. The Ministry of Civil Aviation was created to regulate all civil aviation in the UK, and this task remained the responsibility of government departments until {{the establishment of the}} independent CAA in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Following the Richmond Depot, other depots {{started up}} {{throughout}} the South to supply their respective regional forces. Major depots were in Columbus, Athens and Atlanta, Georgia for the Army of Tennessee and Houston, Texas and Shreveport, Louisiana for the Trans-Mississippi forces. The {{use of the}} depot system meant that army-wide uniformity was impossible, as different depots had unique uniforms (Columbus Depot Jackets for instance, had breast pockets, whilst Richmond Depot Jackets did not). <b>This</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> varied set of uniforms worn by different Confederate units.|$|E
5|$|Frank Brittan sold Linwood House to Hiorns in 1889, who {{commissioned}} architect John Whitelaw {{to design}} an extension. <b>This</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> drawing room, a billiard {{room and a}} study {{to be added to}} the house. In 1898, Hiorns leased Linwood House to Sir John Denniston for five years. Hiorns had retired from business and spent some of his time in Sydney. Denniston, the oldest son of Thomas Denniston and married to the daughter of John Bathgate, was a judge at the Supreme Court in Christchurch.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the premium}} tax credits are {{mandatory}} spending, meaning all those eligible under the ACA receive them without Congressional appropriation.

5|$|In 1911, it was {{revealed}} that in 1910–11 Curie had conducted an affair of about a year's duration with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre's—a married man who was estranged from his wife. <b>This</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker. When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.|$|E
