5|$|Gods {{were linked}} with {{specific}} {{regions of the}} universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with {{other parts of the}} universe were said to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E
5|$|The constellation's {{brightest}} member, Alpha Pavonis, is {{also known}} as Peacock and appears as a 1.91-magnitude blue-white star, but is actually a spectroscopic binary. Delta Pavonis is a nearby Sun-like star some 19.9 light-years distant. Six of the star systems in Pavo have been found to host planets, including HD 181433 with a super-earth, and HD 172555 with evidence of a major interplanetary collision in the past few thousand years. The constellation contains NGC 6752, the third-brightest globular cluster in <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> spiral galaxy NGC 6744, which closely resembles the Milky Way but is twice as large. Pavo displays an annual meteor shower known as the Delta Pavonids, whose radiant is near the star δ Pav.|$|E
5|$|The mode {{begins as}} Mario and Kirby {{face each other}} on a stadium located in the Smash Bros. world. In this world, when a fighter is defeated, they turn into a trophy form, which can be revived by {{touching}} the base. Suddenly, smoke pours from <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Battleship Halberd flies over. It releases a stream of black purple-clouded bugs called Shadow Bugs that form the soldiers of the Subspace Army. The Ancient Minister, a cloak-clad, mysterious hovering General of the Subspace Army, arrives with his Army and detonates a Subspace Bomb, {{which can only be}} detonated by the sacrifice of two R.O.B.s, and which transports the stadium into Subspace, an alternate dimension where the Subspace Army resides. The Ancient Minister's advance prompts the heroes to progressively team up and attempt to repel the enemy, while villains harvest the power of the allied characters by using dark cannons to convert them into trophies, and using shadow bugs on some of them to fight the protagonists during their adventure.|$|E

5|$|In {{the time}} after myth, most gods {{were said to}} be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world. Temples were their main means of contact with humanity. Each day, it was believed, the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples, their homes in the human world. There they {{inhabited}} the cult images, the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals. This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> earth. As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities, the god in a city's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region. Deities' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over. Many gods had more than one cult center, and their local ties changed over time. They could establish themselves in new cities, or their range of influence could contract. Therefore, a given deity's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin. The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity. When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC), they elevated Thebes' patron gods—first the war god Montu and then Amun—to national prominence.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{design was}} a highly symbolic variety of sacred architecture. It was a greatly elaborated variant {{on the design of}} an Egyptian house, reflecting its role as the god's home. Moreover, the temple represented a piece of the divine realm on earth. The elevated, enclosed sanctuary was equated with the sacred hill where the world was created in Egyptian myth and with the burial chamber of a tomb, where the god's ba, or spirit, came to inhabit its cult image just as a human ba came to inhabit its mummy. This crucial place, the Egyptians believed, had to be insulated from the impure outside world. Therefore, as one moved toward the sanctuary the amount of outside light decreased, and restrictions on who could enter increased. Yet the temple could also represent the world itself. The processional way could therefore stand for the path of the sun traveling across <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary for the Duat where it was believed to set and to be reborn at night. The space outside the building was thus equated with the waters of chaos that lay outside the world, while the temple represented the order of the cosmos and the place where that order was continually renewed.|$|E

25|$|Ukko's origins are {{probably}} in Baltic Perkons {{and the older}} Finnish sky god Ilmarinen. Also Thor is related to Perkons. While Ukko took Ilmarinen's position as the Sky God, Ilmarinen's destiny was {{to turn into a}} smith-hero, or the god of the rock. In the epic poetry of the Kalevala, Ilmarinen is credited with forging the stars on the dome of <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> magic mill of plenty, the Sampo.|$|E
25|$|It is more {{difficult}} to find the south celestial pole in the sky at this moment, as that area is a particularly bland portion of <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nominal south pole star is Sigma Octantis, which with magnitude 5.5 is barely {{visible to the naked eye}} even under ideal conditions.

25|$|The idea {{of using}} several {{exposures}} to adequately reproduce a too-extreme range of luminance was pioneered {{as early as the}} 1850s by Gustave Le Gray to render seascapes showing both <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sea. Such rendering was impossible at the time using standard methods, as the luminosity range was too extreme. Le Gray used one negative for the sky, and another one with a longer exposure for the sea, and combined the two into one picture in positive.|$|E

25|$|Jumala, {{a generic}} {{name for a}} major deity. Originally the name given by the Finns to the sky, the sky-god, and the supreme god.

The origin of the word is unknown – some {{possible}} explanations are derivation from Jomali, the supreme deity of the Permians and origination from the Estonian word jume.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{needed to}} break the shield around Cor Hydrae drains the energy that allows the five major islands to float in <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> islands fall toward the Earth below.

Martin Leitner, chief sales officer of Leitner, explained that the cable car system used in Hong Kong is much heavier and bigger than that used in Austria. He said the steel columns used to support the system have to be stronger, and thus more expensive.|$|E
