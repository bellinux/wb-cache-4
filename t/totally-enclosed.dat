50|$|Another {{negative}} {{aspect is}} that these motors may only be used where mostly-clean air is present at all times. Due to the dramatically increased risk of overheating, <b>totally-enclosed</b> fan cooled universal motors would be impractical, though some have been made. Such a motor would need a large fan to circulate enough air, decreasing efficiency since the motor must use more energy to cool itself. The impracticality comes from the resulting size, weight, and thermal management issues which open motors have none of.|$|E
