Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that {{hold them in}} place and maintain an air gap between them.

5|$|GTAW {{can be used}} {{on nearly}} all {{weldable}} metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material <b>thicknesses</b> than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.|$|E
5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the weld electrode metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the weld electrode metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given weld electrode diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of <b>thicknesses</b> above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|E

Methods: Twenty-one eyes (21 patients) in patients with resolved, non-complicated BRAO and a normal control of 10 eyes (10 volunteers) were used in this study. The average macular <b>thickness,</b> foveal <b>thickness</b> and ONL <b>thickness</b> at central fovea were measured in both the patients and the control group using spectral domain OCT. The <b>thickness</b> between the patient group and the control group were compared and correlation between the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and each <b>thickness</b> was determined. Results: The average age of the patients was 52 ± 5. 8 years. The average macular <b>thickness,</b> foveal <b>thickness</b> and ONL <b>thickness</b> at the central fovea of the patients were significantly (p < 0. 001, p = 0. 023, p = 0. 021, respectively) thinner than that of the control group. Both the foveal <b>thickness</b> (rs = 0. 56, p = 0. 008) and ONL <b>thickness</b> (rs = 0. 86, p < 0. 001) were significantly correlated with BCVA.

5|$|Examination of the Deinonychus egg's {{microstructure}} {{confirms that}} {{it belonged to}} a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with ornithischian and sauropod eggs. Compared to other maniraptoran theropods, the egg of Deinonychus is more {{similar to those of}} oviraptorids than to those of troodontids, despite studies that show the latter are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus. While the egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7cm (2.7in) based on the width of the pelvic canal through which the egg had to have passed. This size is similar to the 7.2cm diameter of the largest Citipati (an oviraptorid) eggs; Citipati and Deinonychus also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the <b>thicknesses</b> of Citipati and Deinonychus eggshells are almost identical, and since shell thickness correlates with egg volume, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were about the same size.|$|E

We hypothesized that CLSM can differentiate superficial-partial vs. deep-partial <b>thickness</b> burns on a histomorphological level. METHODS: Thirty-eight burn wounds in 14 patients were clinically divided in three groups from superficial (group 1), superficial-partial (group 2) to deep-partial (group 3) <b>thickness</b> burns. CLSM was {{performed with the}} Vivascope 1500 (Lucid Inc., Rochester, NY, USA) 24 h after burn. The following parameters were assessed: cell size of the granular-layer, <b>thickness</b> of the basal-layer, minimal <b>thickness</b> of the epidermis and number of perfused dermal papillae. RESULTS: Superficial burns resulted in a significant increase of the cell size of the granular-layer and a higher increase of the minimal <b>thickness</b> of the epidermis as in superficial-partial <b>thickness</b> burns.
