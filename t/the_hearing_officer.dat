Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of <b>the</b> <b>Hearing</b> <b>Officer,</b> and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E

2500|$|A {{doctor was}} {{allegedly}} subject to multiple hearings {{for the same}} charges, and his rights to an expedited hearing were allegedly denied while a suspension was in place. On May 15, 2001, the California Medical Association filed an amicus curiae brief to emphasize legal protections meant to prevent physicians being arbitrarily excluded from access to healthcare facilities based on mechanisms such as summary suspension without a speedy hearing. [...] This case was decided on April 18, 2005. [...] The court ruled that <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> in the case could indeed terminate the physician's peer review hearing based on grounds that the physician refused to cooperate on procedural and other matters necessary for the good conduct of the proceedings. [...] Thus, the physician lost his membership and privileges at the hospital. Ironically, the same physician was brought into a peer review hearing at another facility a short time later. [...] <b>The</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> in that case also terminated the proceedings, this time due to the physician's failure to turn over certain evidence {{for use in the}} hearing. [...] The physician challenged the termination through the court system arguing, contrary to the Tenet appellate court ruling, that California's peer review statutes never intended <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> in peer review hearings to have such powers of termination. [...] The California Supreme Court reviewed the case and agreed in April 2009. [...] The High Court ruled, among other things, that peer review hearing officers must defer the question of termination to the panel of physicians who sit in judgment of each peer review hearing.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1995, the United States Senate {{asked the}} U.S. Court of Federal Claims to {{determine}} if the United States owed Inslaw compensation for the government's use of Promis. On July 31, 1997, Judge Christine Miller, <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> for the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that all of the versions of Promis were in the public domain and that the government had therefore always been free to do whatever it wished with Promis. The following year, the appellate authority, a three-judge Review Panel of the same court, upheld Miller's ruling; it also determined that Inslaw had never granted the government a license to [...] "modify Promis to create derivative software" [...] although Inslaw was automatically vested with the exclusive copyright rights to Promis. The Review Panel then held that the United States would be liable to Inslaw for copyright infringement damages if the government had created any unauthorized derivatives from Promis, but noted that Inslaw [...] "had failed to prove in court that the government had done so;" [...] moreover, the Board held that the issue of [...] "derivative works" [...] was [...] "of no consequence." [...] Inslaw challenged this interpretation but the Review Panel refused Inslaw's request to reopen discovery. In August 1998, Chief Judge Lorin Smith of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims sent an Advisory Report to the Senate, [...] noting that the court had not found that the United States owes Inslaw compensation for the government's use of Promis, and enclosing the decision of <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> and the decision of the Review Panel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{seminal case}} in Social Security law is Richardson v. Perales, a Supreme Court {{decision}} from 1971.

These should be accepted, even if cross-examination is not available. [...] The claimant {{has the right to}} subpoena the treating physician. [...] In cases of conflicting medical evidence, it is not unconstitutional for <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> to obtain independent medical advice to help resolve the physical questions involved.

He became the commanding officer when American Sailor was commissioned on 22 July 1941 and sailed her to the Maritime Service Training Station at Port Hueneme, California where he also assumed command of the school in February 1942. Richmond was promoted to commander on 17 July 1942 while stationed at Port Hueneme. With the termination of Coast Guard control of Maritime Service ships on 1 September 1942, he received orders to report aboard the Haida once again as the commanding officer where he was responsible for convoy escort duty for ships taking troops and cargo to Alaska. In February 1943 he was directed to report to the Merchant Marine Inspection Office in New York where his duties included those of examining officer and hearing officer. Richmond was promoted to captain 1 June 1943 and in July {{was transferred}} to London, England. He was the Senior Coast Guard Officer in charge of the Merchant Marine Hearing Unit where he was responsible for administering and enforcing laws relating to the functions of Coast Guard vessels and personnel.

On July 28, the Parole board notified Carlos Alberto that they would postpone their decision for at least 90 days, pending resolution of the charges. Two days later, <b>the</b> prison disciplinary <b>hearing</b> <b>officer</b> held hearings on the weapons charges. Alberto's defense consisted not merely of his statement denying possession. The tenth cellmate appeared as a witness, admitting that the knives were his, and his alone, and that Carlos Alberto and none of the other cellmates knew he had hidden the knives in the light fixture.

40|$|Objectives. Financial penalties, or sanctions, are a core {{mechanism}} for enforcing the work {{requirements of the}} Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and helping clients achieve self-sufficiency. This study’s objective is to examine whether sanctions are being administered consistent with policy goals of encouraging work. Methods. This study uses administrative fair hearing decisions, which {{are the product of}} an adversarial-style procedure triggered when a client appeals an adverse decision by the agency, including work sanctions. Qualitative content analysis is used to analyze the decisions. Results. The study found that despite organizational reforms, local offices had created the welfare-to-work version of an eligibility-compliance culture, where sanctions were based primarily on attendance records and became a paper-processing function. Transactions between clients and workers were often routinized and mechanical, resulting in improper and arbitrary sanctions that were reversed by <b>the</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>officers</b> nearly 50 percent of the time. Conclusion. This study underscores the importance of scrutinizing and correcting agency errors that may undercut clients’ engagement in work activities...|$|R

This research has provided this important information to educators and can help school districts to make decisions based upon factors that are considered to be important to success in a hearing.

2500|$|The NFLPA {{released}} a statement calling the suspensions unjustified, claiming that Goodell had not furnished them with any evidence supporting the sanctions.

It also contended that since the alleged conduct took place before the most recent CBA was signed in August, Goodell should have deferred to NFL special master Stephen Burbank in ruling on the players' actions. Goodell issued the suspensions as part of his power to sanction any [...] "conduct detrimental to the integrity and public confidence in the NFL," [...] a violation of Article 46 of the CBA.
