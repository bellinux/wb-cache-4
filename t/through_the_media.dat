5|$|After {{graduating from}} Queen's in 1928, Wilfrid Eggleston began {{writing for the}} locally printed Lethbridge Herald. He wrote under Canadian Senator William Ashbury Buchanan, whom had {{acquired}} ownership of the newspaper in 1905. Eggleston held Buchanan and his politics in high regard during his short stay at the publication. After just one year writing in Lethbridge, he became Ottawa correspondent for the Toronto Star in 1929, and witnessed significant political events in this position, including {{the passing of the}} Statute of Westminster in 1931 and the British Empire Economic Conference of 1932. He also began writing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> agency Reuters in the late 1920s by means of a syndicated weekly newspaper column, with a selection of his political pieces featuring in Time Magazine and a plethora of other noted publications. By the time Eggleston had resigned from the Toronto Star in 1936, he had risen to become the newspaper's parliamentary correspondent; he'd finished reporting through Reuters within the same year.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine if and to what extent the {{personnel}} at the local school perceive offensive treatment <b>through</b> <b>the</b> social <b>media</b> among <b>the</b> students and what the personnel thinks about the responsibility of the school to prevent this type of abuse. Offensive treatment <b>through</b> <b>the</b> social <b>media</b> has become a common occurrence among youth and affects health in both psychological and physical ways. As offensive treatment <b>through</b> <b>the</b> social <b>media</b> often takes place outside of school in the students spare time the responsibility of their health is unclear. But since it affects their school results the school has a responsibility to act, which is confirmed by legislation. However, the legislation does not mention offensive treatment <b>through</b> <b>the</b> social <b>media</b> and <b>the</b> school has no distinct guidelines to prevent this form of offensive treatment. Therefore many schools use prevention programs designed for traditional bullying and it is based on local conditions in each school. This leads to differences among how school handle offensive treatment <b>through</b> <b>the</b> social <b>media.</b> It is therefore interesting to investigate how the school personnel perceive offensive treatment <b>through</b> <b>the</b> social <b>media</b> as it affects their work against it. This study is based on the results from qualitative semi – structured interviews with school- and leisure personnel from three different secondary schools. The results show that there is a significant difference between how the school personnel understand the occurrence of offensive treatment <b>through</b> <b>the</b> social <b>media</b> among <b>the</b> students in the different schools and how the school personnel handle it. The measures that are updated and implemented in these schools are dependent on the prevailing climate at each school, which affects the understanding of the problem and its existence...|$|R

5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
