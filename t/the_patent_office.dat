5|$|Much of {{his work}} at <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> <b>office</b> related to {{questions}} about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions {{about the nature of}} light and the fundamental connection between space and time.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently {{recognised}} as {{the design}} {{from which all}} later locomotives are derived, Rocket eventually came to be {{considered one of the}} most important symbols of the Industrial Revolution. It was returned to Robert Stephenson and Company in 1851 with the intention of displaying it at The Great Exhibition, but this did not take place. It was loaned to <b>the</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Office</b> for display in 1862. Moved to the Science Collection of the South Kensington Museum in 1876 (renamed the Science Museum in 1885), it has remained there ever since other than a brief display at the National Railway Museum.|$|E
5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called {{stainless}} steel, {{now known as}} martensitic stainless steel. <b>The</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Office</b> rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the stainless steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E

25|$|Some of Thornton's {{reputation}} as an inventor is due to abuse of his position in <b>the</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Office.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{abolition}} of the board in 1802, President Jefferson appointed Thornton the first Superintendent of <b>the</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Office.</b> When Washington was burned by the British in 1814, Thornton convinced them not to burn <b>the</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Office</b> because of its importance to mankind. He held the position from June 1, 1802 until his death in 1828 in Washington, DC. During his tenure, he introduced innovations including the patent reissue practice, which survives to this day.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} story, Gray's caveat {{was taken to the}} US Patent Office a few hours before Bell's application. Gray's caveat was taken to <b>the</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Office</b> in the morning of February 14, 1876, shortly after <b>the</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Office</b> opened and {{remained}} {{near the bottom of the}} in-basket until that afternoon. Bell's application was filed shortly before noon on February 14 by Bell's lawyer who requested that the filing fee be entered immediately onto the cash receipts blotter and Bell's application was taken to the Examiner immediately. Late in the afternoon, Gray's caveat was entered on the cash blotter and was not taken to the Examiner until the following day. The fact that Bell's filing fee was recorded earlier than Gray's led to the myth that Bell had arrived at <b>the</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Office</b> earlier. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not know this happened until later. Gray later abandoned his caveat and did not contest Bell's priority. That opened the door to Bell being granted US patent 174465 for the telephone on March 7, 1876.|$|E

25|$|As a {{consequence}} of winning the Capitol competition, Thornton was frequently asked to give ideas for public and residential buildings in the Federal City.

25|$|Newman {{argued that}} he had been mistreated by <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> <b>office,</b> and tried to have his motor legalized {{directly}} by the US Congress.
