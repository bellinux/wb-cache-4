40|$|Balance-of-powers {{arguments}} are ubiquitous in judicial opinions and academic articles that address separation-of-powers disputes over the president 2 ̆ 7 s removal authority, power to disregard statutes, authority to conduct foreign wars, and much else. However, <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> has never received a satisfactory theoretical treatment. This Essay examines possible theories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> and rejects them all as unworkable and normatively questionable. Judges and scholars should abandon the balance-of-powers metaphor and instead address directly whether bureaucratic innovation {{is likely to}} improve policy outcomes...|$|R

5|$|Historian Michael Crawford {{attributes}} {{the disappearance of}} much of Tiberius Gracchus' support to the reduced level of citizen participation due to dispersal far from Rome, and sees his tribunate as marking {{a step in the}} Hellenization of Roman aristocracy.

5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence.

5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city.

With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration.

Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E

5|$|In 1709, George {{resigned}} as field marshal, never {{to go on}} active service again. In 1710, he was granted the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Empire, an office formerly held by the Elector Palatine—the absence of the Elector of Bavaria allowed a reshuffling of offices. The death of the Emperor in 1711 threatened to destroy <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in the opposite direction, so the war ended in 1713 with the ratification of the Treaty of Utrecht. Philip was allowed to succeed to the Spanish throne but {{was removed from the}} French line of succession, and the Elector of Bavaria was restored.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this success, joined {{by the forces of}} John Doukas, John Palaiologos marched south into Thessaly, seizing and fortifying its fortresses, until he reached the town of Neopatras, where he made his camp for a time. He then continued on into Boeotia, the territory of the Duchy of Athens, where he took and plundered Levadeia and Thebes. At this point, however, John Doukas defected back to his father, upsetting <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and John himself was soon after recalled to Lampsacus. Thus, his conquest of Greece remained incomplete and was soon reversed by the recovery of Epirus' fortunes.|$|E
5|$|Neighboring {{states were}} alarmed by this {{upsetting}} of <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> especially the Hungarian nobility in Transylvania, who rose against Michael in rebellion. With {{the help of}} Basta, they defeated Michael at the Battle of Mirăslău, forcing the prince to leave Transylvania together with his remaining loyal troops. A Polish army led by Jan Zamoyski drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and defeated Michael at Năieni, Ceptura, and Bucov (Battle of the Teleajăn River). The Polish army also entered eastern Wallachia and established Simion Movilă as ruler. Forces loyal to Michael remained only in Oltenia.|$|E
40|$|Using {{longitudinal}} data on private consumption from South Korea, {{this article examines}} <b>the</b> marital <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> between spouses in a dynamic setting by allowing for unobserved heterogeneity at the household level and spouses’ time-constant unobserved bargaining power.

Relative spousal earnings may be a good proxy for <b>the</b> long-term <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> to an extent that cross-sectional variation in relative earnings across households reflects the pattern of spousal matching.

As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842.|$|E
