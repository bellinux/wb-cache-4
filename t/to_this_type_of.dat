5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> feeding.|$|E

5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> damage.|$|E

25|$|A 'flow failure' may {{initiate}} if {{the strength}} of the soil is reduced below the stresses required to maintain equilibrium of a slope or footing of a building for instance. This can occur due to monotonic loading or cyclic loading, and can be sudden and catastrophic. A historical example is the Aberfan disaster.

Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail; the central and northern {{parts of the state}} are most vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> storm.

25|$|Attempted {{reform of}} labor {{relations}} in the mid-1970s also included severe restrictions on rights to discharge workers once they passed a brief trial period of employment. A review process set up to examine disputes was implemented {{in a way that}} made discharges practically impossible. Businesspeople circumvented the restrictions to some degree by hiring workers on a temporary basis up to the point at which they would have to be kept and then letting them go before the restrictions applied. Businesspeople remained unremittingly hostile <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> regulation, primarily on the grounds that it took away their main means of exercising discipline over their workers. This form of regulation was also eliminated shortly after Velasco lost power.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate in}} Southeast Asia is mainly tropical–hot and humid {{all year round}} with {{plentiful}} rainfall. Northern Vietnam and the Myanmar Himalayas are the only regions in Southeast Asia that feature a subtropical climate, which has a cold winter with snow. The majority of Southeast Asia has a wet and dry season caused by seasonal shift in winds or monsoon. The tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season. The rain forest is the second largest on earth (with the Amazon being the largest). An exception <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern region, where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape. Other parts fall out of this climate because they are desert like.|$|E
