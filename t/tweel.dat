5000|$|The <b>Tweel</b> (a {{portmanteau}} of {{tire and}} wheel) is an airless tire design concept {{developed by the}} French tire company Michelin. Its significant advantage over pneumatic tires is that the <b>Tweel</b> does not use a bladder full of compressed air, and therefore it cannot burst, leak pressure, or become flat. Instead, the <b>Tweel</b> assembly's inner hub connects to flexible polyurethane spokes which are used to support an outer rim and these engineered compliant components assume the shock-absorbing role provided by the compressed air in a traditional tire.|$|E

The Thoth first visited the planet Earth when mankind was in the Stone Age. They were looked up to as gods by the Ancient Egyptians, to whom they gave the gift of writing.|$|R

5000|$|Potential {{benefits}} of the <b>Tweel</b> include not only the obvious safety and convenience of never having flat tires, but also, in automotive applications, the <b>Tweel</b> airless tire {{has the potential to}} be able to brake better - a significant performance compromise that is inherent to pneumatic tires. Unlike a pneumatic tire, a <b>Tweel</b> can be designed to have high lateral stiffness while simultaneously having low vertical stiffness. This can be achieved because, in the design elements of a <b>Tweel,</b> the vertical and lateral stiffness are not inseparably linked and can thus be optimized independently. Because there is no air bladder under the tread, tread patterns can, if desired, even incorporate water evacuation through holes in the design thus eliminating or significantly reducing hydroplaning. Michelin expects the tread to last two to three times as long as a conventional tire. [...] Because the tread rubber around the outer circumference is replaceable when worn (as opposed to disposing of a whole worn tire), the potential environmental impact of a <b>Tweel</b> airless tire can be less than that of a conventional pneumatic tire.|$|E
