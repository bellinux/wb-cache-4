In consideration of the network scalability and energy efficiency for <b>target</b> <b>tracking</b> in large-scale WSNs, it has been employed as an effective solution by organizing the WSNs into clusters. However, <b>tracking</b> a moving <b>target</b> in cluster-based WSNs suffers a boundary problem when the target moves across or along the boundaries of clusters, as the static cluster membership prevents sensors in different clusters from sharing information. In this paper, we propose a novel mobility management protocol, called hybrid cluster-based <b>target</b> <b>tracking</b> (HCTT), which integrates on-demand dynamic clustering into a cluster-based WSN for <b>target</b> <b>tracking.</b> By constructing on-demand dynamic clusters at boundary regions, nodes from different static clusters that detect the target can temporarily share information, and the tracking task can be handed over smoothly from one static cluster to another.
