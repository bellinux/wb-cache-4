5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E

5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their bottom surfaces. The <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the <b>two</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} HA RP. Ranchi during 2004 - 05 to study the amount of intra-plant variation in different fruit quality parameters as influenced by sample size and method of sampling in litchi cv. Shahi.

TSS, total sugar and tit ratable acidity. Significant differences among the treatments were observed in the values of average fruit weight and ti/ratable acidity. An in-general higher value of intra-plant coefficient of variation in fruit quality was observed in case of simple sampling (T,-T/ than that in case of composite sampling (T,-T,/ Composite sample consisting <b>of</b> three <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 10 fruits each (T 1,) exhibited the minimum values of intra-plant coefficient of variation (O/o) in case of fruit weight, TSS and total sugar content which was at par with that in case o/T 7 T, and Tlf Keeping in view the ease in fruit sample collection and volume of work for quality analysis. composite sampling consisting <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 10 fruits each (T.) can be considered effective/or minimizing the error due to intra-plant variation in fruit quality of litchi.
