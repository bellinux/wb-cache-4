5|$|The <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> song, it's such {{a passionate}} song. I had {{to present it}} in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E
500|$|Universal Music Group took extreme {{measures}} {{to prevent the}} album from leaking, offering pre-release listening sessions for critics instead of sending out review copies. However, Universal Music Australia's online music store, getmusic.com.au, accidentally released the album for digital sale on 18February 2009, almost {{two weeks before the}} scheduled release date. The complete album appeared on the website for a short time before it was removed, and the accidental sale led to the album's being leaked and shared across the Internet. U2 reacted to the leak with some positivity. The Edge stated, [...] "The one good <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> is a lot of our fans have already given us their thumbs up. Even though it was fans getting it for free." ...|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{has spoken}} about his {{political}} views on several occasions, most notably {{when he visited}} Tony Blair at No. 10 Downing Street in 1997. In an interview in 1997 {{when he was asked}} about why he visited Blair he replied, [...] "I've taken a lot of flack for going to No. 10 Downing Street but the <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> is, I never considered myself a rebel anyway. I wasn't going there representing the 'Indie community'. I wasn't representing anyone. I was going there for me. You have to understand that from when I went to school and from when I was born all we ever knew was conservative, Tory, right-wing government. What people don't mention is, they say 'He went to meet Tony Blair.' No. I went to meet the Labour prime minister. Our parents always drummed into us that the Labour Party was for the people and the Tory Party was not. I went to meet the Labour prime minister." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2015, Smith {{was cast}} in the [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] of Masters for the second season, having previously worked with Butters and Fazekas on their television series Resurrection. Though the executive producers never thought {{that they would be}} able to get Smith for the series, they developed and wrote Masters with the actor in mind. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The nice <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> is we could go both ways on it. Maybe we never see him again or maybe we see him again and by the way he's full of Zero Matter now. The last thing you saw was Whitney Zero Mattering him and then getting interrupted. But it's still in him. Either way, we wanted to keep our options open." ...|$|E
500|$|Comedian Ed Byrne {{performed}} a skit {{in which he}} jokingly attacked the song for its lack of ironies: [...] "The only ironic <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> song is it's called 'Ironic' and it's written {{by a woman who}} doesn't know what irony is. That's quite ironic." [...] Also, satirists Berger and Wyse parodied the song in one segment of their cartoon strip The Pitchers. In that episode, a superhero named [...] "Irony Man" [...] compared his superpowers to lyrics from Morissette's song, causing his cohorts to rename him [...] "The Man from Alanis". In December 2009, the comedy website CollegeHumor released a spoof video of the song called [...] "Actually Ironic", featuring actress Sarah Natochenny, in which Patrick Cassels amended the lyrics in a form that would be appropriately ironic. The CollegeHumor spoof was replicated in July 2013 by sisters Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz, from New York City, who published their version on YouTube. The sisters sing the line [...] "We fixed it for you, Alanis. You're welcome." [...] throughout their [...] "It's Finally Ironic" [...] video. In his 2014 song [...] "Word Crimes", [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic references Morissette's lyrics by singing [...] "Irony is not coincidence", and the music video for the song shows a fire truck burning (depicted as [...] "Irony") compared with rain during a wedding (which is described as [...] "Weather"). Morissette herself poked fun at her grammar mistakes during a 2013 performance of [...] "Semicolon" [...] with The Lonely Island on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In it, Morissette cut off their song to explain that their use of hashtag rap to demonstrate the function of a semicolon is incorrect, to which they respond that her critiquing their grammar is [...] "ironic".|$|E

The remixed/remastered sound was received more positively. [...] Warrel Dane admitted that [...] "The remix of the albumobviously sounds better. But to me, that's the really odd <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> album. I find it really strange that the production on that album got reviewed {{more than the}} songs did." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Amos {{formed a}} musical group called Y Kant Tori Read, named for her {{difficulty}} sight reading. In addition to Amos, {{the group was}} composed of Steve Caton (who would later play guitars on all of her albums until 1999), drummer Matt Sorum, bass player Brad Cobb and, for a short time, keyboardist Jim Tauber. The band went through several iterations of songwriting and recording; Amos has said interference from record executives caused the band to lose its musical edge and direction during this time. Finally, in July 1988, the band's self-titled debut album, Y Kant Tori Read, was released. Although its producer, Joe Chiccarelli, stated that Amos was {{very happy with the}} album at the time, Amos has since criticized it, once remarking: [...] "The only good <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> album is my ankle high boots." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{official}} cover (standard version) {{was revealed}} on February 29, 2012. The cover art {{was shot in}} January {{of the same year}} by Steven Gomillion and Dennis Leupold of the photography team, Gomillion and Leupold. On the album cover, a light shines down on Brown, who poses against a blue backdrop, dressed in a blue [...] "sleek, slim-fitting suit with a skinny tie and thick black framed glasses", while the word [...] "Fortune" [...] appears behind him in different languages. Brown and his art director Courtney Walter {{came up with the idea}} of using hieroglyphics for the album's title. In an interview by telephone with Erik Parker of CBS Local, Gomillion said Brown [...] "knew before the last album came out what this one would look like. He thinks so far ahead". Regarding the use of the color blue, Gomillion said [...] "The funny <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> blue is it basically just happened. It matched the suit and it gives a kind of futuristic vibe. You'll see blue throughout the [...] packaging". Sarah Brotherton of MTV News wrote that the cover shows [...] "a more mature, sleek side" [...] to Brown. Becky Bain of Idolator noted that Brown [...] "seems to have finally dropped his beloved graffiti imagery and is going for a futuristic vibe". A reviewer for Rap-Up described it as a [...] "slick cover". Alex Loinaz of E! Online compared Brown's look to that of actors Keanu Reeves in The Matrix films, and Colin Firth in A Single Man (2009).|$|E
