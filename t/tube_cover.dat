2500|$|While the {{official}} government commission blamed the explosion on a faulty weld {{in the practice}} torpedo, Vice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev cited inadequate training, poor maintenance, and incomplete inspections that caused the crew to mishandle the weapon. The internal tube door {{was designed to be}} three times as strong as the external torpedo door, so that any explosion inside the tube would be directed out into the sea. Salvage crews eventually found the internal <b>tube</b> <b>cover</b> embedded in a bulkhead [...] from the tube. This led investigators to conclude that it was likely that the internal door was not fully closed when the explosion occurred.|$|E

5000|$|The AK-107, AK-108, and AK-109 {{represent}} {{a significant change}} to the Kalashnikov operating system originally designed in the late 1940s. This system uses a recoil-reducing countermass mechanism with two operating rods that move in opposite directions, thereby providing [...] "balance". One operating rod, the upper, has a gas piston facing forward while the lower also has a gas piston. The gas tube at the forward end of the handguard is double-ended to accommodate the two rods. The enlarged gas <b>tube</b> <b>cover</b> of the upper handguard guides both rods in their travel.|$|E
50|$|While the {{official}} government commission blamed the explosion on a faulty weld {{in the practice}} torpedo, Vice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev cited inadequate training, poor maintenance, and incomplete inspections that caused the crew to mishandle the weapon. The internal tube door {{was designed to be}} three times as strong as the external torpedo door, so that any explosion inside the tube would be directed out into the sea. Salvage crews eventually found the internal <b>tube</b> <b>cover</b> embedded in a bulkhead 12 m from the tube. This led investigators to conclude that it was likely that the internal door was not fully closed when the explosion occurred.|$|E
50|$|Remove before {{flight is}} a safety warning often seen on {{removable}} {{aircraft and spacecraft}} components, typically {{in the form of}} a red ribbon, to indicate that a device, such as a protective cover or a pin to prevent the movement of mechanical parts, is only used when the aircraft is on the ground (parked or taxiing). On small general aviation aircraft, this may include a pitot <b>tube</b> <b>cover</b> or a control lock. In some cases, non-removal of a labelled part has caused airplane crashes, like that of Aeroperú Flight 603. The warning appears in English only. Similar ribbons labelled pull to arm or similar are found on missiles and other weapon systems that are not mounted on aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Often the {{pressure}} vessel is built {{from one or}} more used plastic soft drink bottles, but polycarbonate fluorescent <b>tube</b> <b>covers,</b> plastic pipes, and other light-weight pressure-resistant cylindrical vessels have also been used.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Astragalus gombo. They {{live in a}} silken <b>tube,</b> <b>covered</b> with sand. This tube {{runs from}} the ground up to the lowest leaves. Here, the feeding causes fleck mines. The larvae are greenish-white with a brown head.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Plantago alpina. Full-grown larvae reach {{a length}} of 12-13 mm. They are black brown {{slightly}} tinged with greenish. They overwinter in a silken <b>tube</b> <b>covered</b> with leaf litter. Pupation takes place in June {{on the ground in}} a loose cocoon.|$|R
5000|$|The RPK-74M (Modefitsyrovannyj [...] "Improved") is {{an updated}} {{variant of the}} RPK-74 was {{developed}} during mid-seventies. In line with the AK-74M assault rifle variant the RPK-74M lower handguard, gas <b>tube</b> <b>cover,</b> pistol grip, and new synthetic stock are made from a black, glass-filled polyamide. The stock is shaped like the RPK-74 fixed stock, but also side-folds like the RPKS-74. Each AK-74M is fitted with a side-rail bracket for mounting optics. Updated magazines were produced by Molot with horizontal ribs going {{up the sides of}} the magazines. An export variant chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO was also introduced, designated as the RPK-201. Also for export is the RPKM (A.K.A. RPK-203) chambered in 7.62×39mm; it uses the same polymer furniture as the RPK-74M variant.|$|E
5000|$|The AKS-74U {{also has}} a {{different}} sighting system with a U-shaped flip sight instead of the standard sliding notch tangent rear sight. This rear sight has two settings: [...] "П" [...] corresponding to a 350 m [...] "point-blank range" [...] battle zero setting and [...] "4-5" [...] (used for firing at distances between 400 - 500 m). The rear sight is housed in a semi-shrouded protective enclosure that is riveted to the receiver's spring-loaded top cover. This top cover hinges from the barrel trunnion, pivoting forward when opened, which also works to unlock the gas <b>tube</b> <b>cover.</b> Both the gas tube and handguard are also of a new type and are shorter than the analogous parts in the AKS-74.For the AKS-74s combined with the 7N6 or 7N10 service cartridges the 350 m battle zero setting limits the apparent [...] "bullet rise" [...] within approximately -5 to +42 cm relative {{to the line of}} sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier.|$|E
40|$|Mortars {{are used}} as one method for {{ejecting}} parachutes into the airstream to decelerate spacecraft and aircraft pilot escape modules and to effect spin recovery of the aircraft. An approach to design of mortars in the class that can accommodate parachutes in the 20 - to 55 -foot-diameter size is presented. Parachute deployment considerations are discussed. Comments are made {{on the design of}} a power unit, mortar <b>tube,</b> <b>cover,</b> and sabot. Propellant selection and breech characteristics and size are discussed. A method of estimating hardware weights and reaction load is presented. In addition, some aspects of erodible orifices are given as well as comments concerning ambient effects on performance. This paper collates data and experience from design and flight qualification of four mortar systems, and provides pertinent estimations that should be of interest on programs considering parachute deployment...|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a conventional single seat ultralight {{based on the}} wings taken from the Easy Riser hang glider. The fuselage and tail were of original design. The airframe structure was of aluminum <b>tube,</b> <b>covered</b> with aircraft fabric. The landing gear was of a fixed tricycle configuration.|$|R
50|$|The willow flute {{is a type}} of {{overtone}} flute. It {{is played}} by varying the force of the air blown into the mouthpiece, {{with the end of the}} <b>tube</b> being <b>covered</b> by the finger or left open. The tones produced are based on the harmonic series. Playing the instrument with the end of the <b>tube</b> <b>covered</b> produces one fundamental and its overtones, playing it with the end of the tube left open produces another fundamental and series of overtones. Willow flutes cannot be tuned to an equal tempered scale.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} had an oval cross-section and {{was made}} of welded steel <b>tubes,</b> <b>covered</b> with fabric. The double wings provided very high lift, even at low speeds. Both wings had the same span and an 8° sweep. Construction consisted of a double pine wing spar structure, with lime tree ribs, and fabric covering. There were ailerons in both {{the upper and lower}} wings. The tail had a conventional design, with the horizontal stabilizers mounted on the fuselage upper edge. The rudder was placed behind the elevators. Both the rudder and the elevators were of steel <b>tube</b> <b>covered</b> in fabric, and had a bigger surface than the first version to correct balance problems. The steel tube undercarriage was attached to the fuselage in a [...] "V" [...] shape and used high-pressure rubber suspension.|$|R
5000|$|Bücker Flugzeugbaus first {{production}} type, the Bü 131A was {{the last}} biplane built in Germany. [...] It had two open cockpits in tandem and fixed landing gear. [...] The fuselage was steel <b>tube,</b> <b>covered</b> in fabric and metal, [...] the wings wood and fabric. [...] It first flew on the [...] Hirth HM60R.|$|R
50|$|The 128 linear position-sensitive 3He gas {{detector}} <b>tubes</b> <b>cover</b> the full opening height of 300 mm behind the collimators. They determine {{the position of}} the neutron event by charge division over the resistive anode towards each end of the detector. Overall and local count rates lie in the several 10000 Hz range.|$|R
50|$|Calcinea {{in which}} the cormus is formed by anastomosed <b>tubes</b> <b>covered</b> by a thin {{membranous}} layer, at least in young specimens. Cormus is massive/globular {{with or without a}} stalk. The skeleton contains regular (equiangular and equiradiant) triactines and tetractines, but parasagittal triactines may be present. Triactines are the most numerous spicules. Aquiferous system asconoid.|$|R
50|$|The {{submarine}} {{was missing}} its external torpedo <b>tube</b> <b>covers.</b> They used one original, that was stored somewhere else and the drawings (obtained from England), to construct 3 replicas. Most {{of the external}} paint was also removed, for minor derusting {{and the removal of}} some small dents. It was anticipated that the total restoration, would cost over 360000 Euros.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} aluminium <b>tube,</b> <b>covered</b> with Dacron. Its 38 ft span wing is braced by twin [...] "V" [...] struts and jury struts. The cruciform tail is strut-braced. The controls consist of a side stick and rudder pedals. The landing gear is a monowheel gear, mounted directly behind the pilot. A ballistic parachute was factory-optional equipment.|$|R
25|$|The typical {{style for}} ceramic {{capacitors}} beneath the disc (at that time called condensers) in radio applications {{at the time}} after the War from the 1950s through the 1970s was a ceramic <b>tube</b> <b>covered</b> with tin or silver on both the inside and outside surface. It included relatively long terminals forming, together with resistors and other components, a tangle of open circuit wiring.|$|R
50|$|The {{wing of the}} XB-8 and XO-27 {{was built}} entirely from wood, {{although}} the fuselage was constructed of steel <b>tubes</b> <b>covered</b> with fabric {{with the exception of}} the nose which had a corrugated metal. They featured the first retractable landing gear ever fitted to an Army Air Corps bomber or observation craft. The undercarriage retracted electrically. Crew was three in tandem position.|$|R

50|$|The F.II {{had other}} {{characteristic}} early-Fokker design features: a wing constructed of wood, fully skinned in plywood, with ailerons extending beyond the wingtips {{and a deep}} sided square section fuselage of welded steel <b>tube</b> <b>covered</b> in fabric which provided enough directional stability that no vertical fin was fitted. The F.II had a fixed undercarriage, the main units of which were joined by a cross-axle.|$|R
50|$|The Sh 14 {{engine was}} a tried-and-true design that only {{required}} servicing every 400 hours, {{as opposed to}} the nearly 27 litre displacement, nine-cylinder BMW/Bramo Fafnir 750 hp radial engine powering the larger Focke Achgelis Fa 223 helicopter, whose outdated design required maintenance every 25 hours. The Fl 282's fuselage was constructed from steel <b>tube</b> <b>covered</b> with doped fabric, and it was fitted with a fixed undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|Initially planned {{as a civil}} airliner, it {{was soon}} {{converted}} to the bomber/transport role. The aircraft was a typical 1920's design. It had three engines, one in the nose and one under each wing, high wings and a fixed undercarriage. The fuselage, of quadrangular cross-section, was made of steel <b>tubes</b> <b>covered</b> with fabric, as were the wings and tail. The floor was made of wood.|$|R
50|$|Fuselage:The pod-like forward {{fuselage}} was of elliptical section which rapidly {{reduced to a}} tail boom aft of the wings. The structure of the {{forward fuselage}} was of steel <b>tube</b> <b>covered</b> with Elektron, (a Magnesium alloy), and the tail boom was built up from Duralumin sheet also covered with Elektron. Both wings and tail boom were attached to the centre-section by easily removed pins to allow for de-rigging the glider.|$|R
