All of the videos are first person with no dialogue. The film references other films, including Peeping Tom, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, , Kill the Scream Queen, and The Crucifier.|$|E

They watch the process; even though the boys pass out momentarily, Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed.|$|E

They were in no mood for the formalities of polite Society. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elsewhere, and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there quick.

5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
25|$|Patrick Olivelle {{suggests}} that the Hindu ashrama system of life, created probably around the 4th-century BCE, {{was an attempt to}} institutionalize renunciation within the Brahmanical social structure. This system gave complete freedom to adults to choose what they want to do, whether <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> householders or sannyasins (ascetics), the monastic tradition was a voluntary institution. This voluntary principle, states Olivelle, was the same principle found in Buddhist and Jain monastic orders at that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} {{level in the}} Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is variable. They are capable of being athletic, but usually that activity is in bursts; they are active for {{short periods of time}} followed by napping. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with their owners and to participate; their {{activity level}} most often matches the activity level of the family. As a working dog, they like having a job to do and enjoy participating in hiking, carting, obedience trials, herding, weight pulling and backpacking with their owners.|$|E

25|$|Another way males get to {{mate with}} several females is {{through the use of}} leks. Leks are places where many fish come together, and the males display to each another. Based on these displays, each female then selects the male <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their mate. For example, among the cichlid Cyrtocara eucinostomus in Lake Malawi, up to 50,000 large and {{colourful}} males display together on a lek four kilometres long. The females, which are mouth brooders, choose which male they want to fertilize their eggs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{priests in}} some parishes (six out of 80) bless {{permanent}} faithful relationships. Permission is {{granted by the}} bishop only when a priest requests it, and a parish has decided by majority vote, that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a place of blessing. Ingham says of the practice: I insist only that those {{on all sides of}} the issue respect one another and that everyone should maintain the order of the church. Our goal in the Anglican Church in the Greater Vancouver area is to be a church that accommodates differences.|$|E
25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

25|$|Producers {{organize}} and strive for Fair Trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or simply because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid {{more for their}} labor efforts and products. Farmers {{are more likely to}} identify with organic farming than Fair Trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods. Fair Trade farmers {{are also more likely to}} attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.|$|E

I don't have the talent to adopt a different persona. It's intimate, not flirtatious".

Many commentators have alluded to Lawson's attractiveness, and she was once named as one of the world's most beautiful women. She has been referred to as [...] "stunningly beautiful, warm, honest, likeable and amazingly normal", as well as being described as having [...] "flawless skin, perfect white teeth, a voluptuous body, ample height and lots of lush, brown hair". Nigella Lawson has been voted, Sexiest Celebrity Chef. [...] The media have also noted Lawson's ability to engage with both male and female viewers; The Guardian wrote, [...] "Men love her because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with her. Women love her because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> her". [...] The chef Gary Rhodes said that viewers were attracted to her smile rather than her cooking. Despite often being labelled as a domestic goddess, she insists that she exhibits very few of the qualities associated with the title.|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato and Tim James, {{who also}} {{produced}} the track. According to Cyrus, the track's moral is to free yourself from any biding or hindrance, in particular application to women. Cyrus said the song's message applies to different situations. Personally to her, [...] "it is {{about being a}} cage and people looking at you." [...] As for others, she believed it could describe high school, {{in a situation where}} [...] "someone feeling they have to be one way to be with a clique and <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> who they are.

The majority of reviewers thought the protagonist was referring to a [...] "controlling boyfriend". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times sided with the boyfriend, and believed the song's protagonist was [...] "bullying some poor boy for the sin of wanting to know what she talks about with her friends."
