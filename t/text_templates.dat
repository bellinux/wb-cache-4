Presenta-tion trees have intermediate nodes labeled as “contrast ” and “compare, ” and such types of nodes are associated with ap-propriate speech <b>text</b> <b>templates</b> with gesture specifications. Traversing the presentation tree then yields speech texts for explaining the table, and the resultant texts animate the agent.

In previous studies, the primary method for obtaining data stored in a database is to extract drug information from package inserts by employing pattern matching or more sophisticated methods such as text mining. However, {{it is difficult to}} obtain a complete database because there is no strict rule concerning expressions used to describe drug information in package inserts. The authors&# 39; strategy was to first build a database and then automatically generate package inserts by embedding data in the database using templates. To create this database, the support of pharmaceutical companies to input accurate data is required. It is expected that this system will work, because these companies can earn merit for newly developed drugs to decrease the effort to create package inserts from scratch. This study designed the table schemata for the database and <b>text</b> <b>templates</b> to generate the package inserts. To handle the variety of drug-specific information in the package inserts, this information in drug composition descriptions was replaced with labels and the replacement descriptions utilizing cluster analysis were analyzed. To improve the method by which frequently repeated ingredient information and/or supplementary information are stored, the method was modified by introducing repeat tags in the templates to indicate repetition and improving the insertion of data into the database. The validity of this method was confirmed by inputting the drug information described in existing package inserts and checking that the method could regenerate the descriptions in the original package insert. In future research, the table schemata and <b>text</b> <b>templates</b> will be extended to regenerate other information in the package inserts.

40|$|Abstract. Software architects {{consider}} capturing {{and sharing}} architectural decision knowledge increasingly important; many tacit dependencies exist in this knowledge. Architectural decision modeling makes these dependencies explicit {{and serves as}} a foundation for decision knowledge management tools. In practice, however, <b>text</b> <b>templates</b> and informal rich pictures rather than models are used to capture the decision knowledge; a formal definition of model entities and their relations is missing in {{the current state of the}} art. In this paper, we propose such a formal definition of architectural decision models as directed acyclic graphs with several types of nodes and edges. In our models, architectural decision topic groups, issues, alternatives, and outcomes form trees of nodes connected by edges expressing containment and refinement, decomposition, and triggers dependencies, as well as logical relations such as (in) compatibility of alternatives. The formalization can be used to verify integrity constraints and to organize the decision making process; decision types and dependency patterns can be identified. A reusable architectural decision model supporting service-oriented architecture design serves as our example. We present tool support and give a quantitative evaluation...|$|E
