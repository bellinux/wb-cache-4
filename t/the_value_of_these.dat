5|$|The renewed {{blockade}} of Île de France was lifted in December 1795, and Elphinstone deployed {{most of his}} forces in the continued {{blockade of}} Colombo. In February a small squadron under Captain Alan Gardner attacked city and secured the total surrender of the remaining Batavian garrison on the island. In March word arrived at Madras of the Batavian attempt to recapture the Cape Colony and Elphinstone returned westwards with Monarch, followed by Stately, Echo and Rattlesnake. In the east, Rainier's force had some success, seizing the considerable clove stores at Amboyna on 16 February 1796 and the nutmeg and mace supplies of Banda Neira on 8 March. <b>The</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> captures was significant: the captains involved each received £15,000. However, these successes were offset by the complicated political position Rainier discovered in the Dutch East Indies; he spent {{the entirety of the}} remainder of the year diffusing or defeating a series of uprisings by local rajahs and did not return to India until February 1797.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} a new method {{to deal with the}} Iris data {{classification}} prob-lem based on the distribution of training instances. First, we find two useful attributes of the Iris data from the training instances that are more suitable to deal with the classification problem. It means that <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two useful attributes of the three species (i. e., Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica) has less overlapping. Then, we calculate <b>the</b> average attribute <b>values</b> and <b>the</b> standard deviations <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two useful attributes. We also calculate the overlap-ping areas formed by <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two useful attributes between species of the training in-stances, <b>the</b> average attribute <b>values,</b> and <b>the</b> standard deviations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two useful attributes of each species. Then, we calculate the difference between <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two useful attributes of a testing instance to be classified and <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two useful attributes of each species of the training instances. We choose the species that has the smallest difference between <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two useful attributes of the testing instance and <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two useful attributes of each species of the training instances as the classification result of the testing instance.

5|$|Spices {{were among}} the most luxurious {{products}} available in the Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. <b>The</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities; turmeric provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb. Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones. Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger.|$|E

25|$|The coinage {{system that}} existed in Egypt until the time of Diocletian's {{monetary}} reform was a closed system based upon the heavily debased tetradrachm. Although <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> tetradrachmas can be reckoned as being equivalent in value to the denarius, their precious metal content was always much lower. Clearly, not all coins that circulated contained precious metals, as <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> coins was too great to be convenient for everyday purchases. A dichotomy existed between the coins with an intrinsic value and those with only a token value. This {{is reflected in the}} infrequent and inadequate production of bronze coinage during the Republic, where from the time of Sulla till the time of Augustus no bronze coins were minted at all; even during the periods when bronze coins were produced, their workmanship was sometimes very crude and of low quality.|$|E

He also had the lands of the bailiary of Kyle Stewart. <b>The</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> lands largely lay in their near exemption from taxation. In about 1720 the lands passed to the Wallaces of Carnell, at Fiveways near Kilmarnock.

25|$|The {{foundation}} of state's school system—the first state-funded {{system in the}} nation—also began to be laid during Hendricks's administration. During his tenure as governor each township was granted land on which a public school could be established. <b>The</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> improvements totaled over $1.25 million, making it the highest dollar item on the budget to that date. Construction of the State Seminary, later to become Indiana University, also began during his term. Hendricks also contributed personally to Hanover College. As the state's finances would not allow the large-scale improvements Hendricks envisioned, he focused efforts on creating critical routes and approved legislation that required state residents to spend allotted amounts of time helping to build the state roads. Existing roads and rivers were improved by clearing obstacles.|$|E
25|$|Most {{countries}} are experiencing {{significant increases in}} wealth and standard of living. However, there are unfortunate exceptions to this rule. Noticeably some of the former Soviet Union countries has experienced major disruption of industry in {{the transition to a}} market economy. Many African nations have recently experienced reduced GNPs due to wars and the AIDS epidemic, including Angola, Congo, Sierra Leone and others. Arab oil producers rely very heavily on oil exports to support their GDPs so any reduction in oil's market price can lead to rapid decreases in GNP. Countries which rely on only a few exports for much of their income are very vulnerable to changes in the market value of those commodities and are often derogatively called banana republics. Many developing countries do rely on exports of a few primary goods for a large amount of their income (coffee and timber for example), and this can create havoc when <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> commodities drops, leaving these countries with no way to pay off their debts.|$|E

Many of his colleagues and students expressed disappointment with the recordings and felt they did not truly represent Busoni's pianism. Egon Petri was horrified by the piano roll recordings when they first appeared on vinyl and said that they were a travesty of Busoni's playing. Similarly, Petri's student Gunnar Johansen who had heard Busoni play on several occasions, remarked, [...] "Of Busoni's piano rolls and recordings, only Feux follets (no. 5 of Liszt's [...] Transcendental Études) is really something unique. The rest is curiously unconvincing. The recordings, especially of Chopin, are a plain misalliance".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Johor's economy {{began to}} diversify from gambier and pepper {{plantations}} to other agricultural crops.

Coffee and tapioca was quickly abandoned in the 1890s when <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> crops experienced a drop, while rubber was introduced and quickly established a strong foothold in Johor, as the world demand for rubber increased greatly around 1910. Prices for gambier plunged between 1905 and 1906, and many Kangchu abandoned gambier in favour of rubber. Further {{decline in the number of}} gambier and pepper plantations was fuelled by the colonial government's suppression of traditional farming methods employed by the Kangchu for planting gambier and pepper; these method led to soil exhaustion and a depletion of forests which was used as firewood in small factories. A few years before the Kangchu system was abolished, exports for both gambier and pepper plunged by a further 60% between 1912 and 1917.|$|E
