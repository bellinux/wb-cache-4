5|$|In October 2013, in {{a conference}} to promote the 25th season of the show, {{producer}} Al Jean revealed that a major character would die in this episode. The character would have appeared more than twice in the show, and be voiced by an Emmy Award-winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character. Later that month, {{following the death of}} Marcia Wallace, it was confirmed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be her character, Edna Krabappel. Voice actor Hank Azaria, whose roles include Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Moe Szyslak, stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be one of his characters. It was shown at the 2014 Comic-Con <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be Homer, although there is a scene that features Lisa worrying about Homer's health as he struggles with a CPAP mask.|$|E

5|$|Amid {{the general}} {{euphoria}} in Poland – {{the acquisition of}} Teschen was a very popular development – no one {{paid attention to the}} bitter comment of the Czechoslovak general who handed the region over to the incoming Poles.

5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that {{the statute of limitations}} would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, {{proposals}} {{were made to}} re-open the line to Tryvandshøiden Station, so that the Tryvann Ski Resort would be more accessible to Oslo residents.

5|$|In August 2015, {{the series}} was reinvented as Most Wanted and {{received}} a pilot order from ABC. The cast was filled out in early 2016, and production was completed by late March.

In May 2016, ABC announced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> pick up the pilot to series, and would look to develop other series with Marvel instead.|$|E

5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|Other {{advantages}} of using an electric fire engine were <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> produce loud noises, smoke, dust, cinders and ashes, as steam fire engines did. Also, {{the cost of}} an electric fire engine would be about one-third that of a steam boiler fire engine. A typical electric fire engine weighed sixty percent less than a steam boiler of the same capacity.|$|E
5|$|Peyton Manning and Leaf {{were widely}} {{considered}} {{the two best}} players available in the 1998 draft, and scouts and analysts debated who should be selected first.

Most observers, however, believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> greatly matter whether Manning or Leaf was drafted first because either would greatly benefit his team.|$|E

5|$|Rakeysh Mehra took {{seven years}} to {{research}} and develop the story, including three to write the script. While some raised doubts about his morale following the failure of his last film, Aks, at the box office, he retorted by saying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> affect him at all.

5|$|Some {{major changes}} were {{introduced}} in a third watercolour painting (№ 238) which he made during the autumn of 1913. This version was given the text En drömsyn.

5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have to be painted {{to protect it from}} the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
