50|$|An {{electronic}} {{motion detector}} contains an optical, microwave, or acoustic sensor, {{and in many}} cases a transmitter for illumination. However, a passive sensor senses a signature only from the moving object via emission or reflection, i.e., it can be emitted by the object, or by some ambient emitter such as the sun or a radio station of sufficient strength. Changes in the optical, microwave, or acoustic field in the device's proximity are interpreted by the electronics based on one of the <b>technologies</b> <b>listed</b> below. Most low-cost motion detectors can detect up to distances of at least 15 ft. Specialized systems cost more, but have much longer ranges. Tomographic motion detection systems can cover much larger areas because the radio waves are at frequencies which penetrate most walls and obstructions, and are detected in multiple locations, not only at the location of the transmitter.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} water on the quality of dried {{products}} is reviewed in light of recent applications of novel characterization methods (nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy) in quantifying the state and mobility of water in dried products. The mechanical configuration and ability of a number of hybrid drying technologies that use novel heating sources (microwave, infrared, radiofrequency) and/or sub-atmospheric pressure in producing better-quality products are reviewed in considerable detail. The drying kinetics models, especially those related to the quality loss, are also reviewed. It appears that more and more drying research is now focused on the development of novel hybrid technologies to produce better-quality products and for energy savings. The novel characterization <b>technologies</b> <b>listed</b> above are capable of quantifying the dynamic mobility and state of water in dried food products; this information can be used to design more efficient drying processes...|$|E
30|$|In this section, we {{describe}} the proprietary MAC sub-layer protocol developed {{on top of the}} SimpliciTI compliant PHY layer radio stack[15]. This is based on the low-power CC 430 microcontroller system on chip (SoC) with integrated RF transceiver operating at 868 MHz and low-power MSP 430 controller[16]. The SimpliciTI system is here adopted for the intrusion detection experimental study as its wireless modules use a very basic core API compared to the other <b>technologies</b> <b>listed</b> in the previous section and thus allow for a more flexible network design. The proposed MAC sub-layer has a smaller code size (8 to 16 kB), and it allows to efficiently manage the different traffic patterns generated by the intrusion detection system, jointly exploiting both synchronized and nonsynchronized access schemes. The use of the ISM band 868 -MHz radio technology provides an improved robustness, compared to 2.4 -GHz transceivers, against severe propagation conditions that are typical of indoor environments. This conclusion is confirmed by the experimental analysis illustrated in the next section.|$|E
