5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Magnificent</b> Mile, {{sometimes}} referred to as The Mag Mile, is an upscale section of Chicago's Michigan Avenue, running from the Chicago River to Oak Street in the Near North Side.

5|$|Citizen Kane was {{the only}} film made under Welles's {{original}} contract with RKO Pictures, which gave him complete creative control. Welles's new business manager and attorney permitted the contract to lapse. In July 1941, Welles reluctantly signed a new and less favorable deal with RKO under which he produced and directed <b>The</b> <b>Magnificent</b> Ambersons (1942), produced Journey into Fear (1943), and began It's All True, a film he agreed to do without payment. In the new contract Welles was {{an employee of the}} studio and lost the right to final cut, which later allowed RKO to modify and re-cut <b>The</b> <b>Magnificent</b> Ambersons over his objections. In June 1942 Schaefer resigned the presidency of RKO Pictures and Welles's contract was terminated by his successor.|$|E

5|$|In 1800, Hansen {{was also}} charged with {{rebuilding}} Christiansborg Palace which had burnt down in 1794. Unfortunately, it burnt down {{once again in}} 1884. All that remains is <b>the</b> <b>magnificent</b> chapel which, with its Ionic columns, conveys a sense of antiquity.|$|E
5|$|It {{once was}} an {{important}} religious center, used exclusively by the prominent families of New Spain.

5|$|The {{two films}} most {{commonly}} compared to Greed are Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Welles' <b>The</b> <b>Magnificent</b> Ambersons. Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being {{lost in the}} desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. <b>The</b> <b>Magnificent</b> Ambersons and Greed both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. Ambersons was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that Greed influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and Bill Forsyth followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to {{the intentions of the}} original novels. The 1994 Jonathan Lynn film Greedy pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague.|$|E

An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus, though {{it was unclear whether}} it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.|$|E
