2500|$|In March 2012, Dell reassigned Snowden to Hawaii as lead {{technologist}} for the NSA's information-sharing office. At {{the time}} of his departure from the U.S. in May 2013, he had been employed for 15 months inside the NSA's Hawaii regional operations center, which focuses on the electronic monitoring of China and North Korea, the last three of which were with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. While intelligence officials have described his position there as a system administrator, Snowden has said he was an infrastructure analyst, which meant that his job was to look for new ways to break into Internet and <b>telephone</b> <b>traffic</b> around the world. On March 15, 2013—three days after what he later called his [...] "breaking point" [...] of [...] "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress"—Snowden quit his job at Dell. Although he has stated that his career high annual salary was $200,000, Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at Booz Allen, where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the NSA's worldwide surveillance activity. According to a Reuters story by Mark Hosenball, while in Hawaii, Snowden may have misled 20–25 co-workers into giving him their logins and passwords under false pretenses. NBC News subsequently reported that the NSA sent a memo to Congress suggesting that Snowden had tricked a fellow employee into sharing his personal public key infrastructure certificate to gain greater access to the NSA's computer system. This report was disputed, with Snowden himself saying in January 2014, [...] "With all due respect to Mark Hosenball, the Reuters report that put this out there was simply wrong. I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers." [...] Booz Allen terminated Snowden's employment on June 10, 2013, one month after he had left the country.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the user network on the <b>telephone</b> network <b>traffic</b> is studied in this paper. Unlike {{classical}} traffic analysis, where users {{are assumed to be}} connected uniformly, our proposed method employs a scale-free network to model the behavior of telephone users. Each user has a fixed set of acquaintances with whom the user may communicate, and the number of acquaintances follows a power-law distribution. We show that compared to conventional analysis based upon a fully connected user network, the network traffic is significantly different when the user network assumes a scale-free property. Specifically, network blocking (call failure) is generally more severe {{in the case of a}} scale-free user network. It is also shown that the carried traffic is practically limited by the scale-free property of the user network, rather than by the network capacity.

Each of these applications has different critical parameters. For today's portable electronics, power conservation and battery life are of primary concern.
