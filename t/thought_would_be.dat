5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them to believe the enemy was breaking. Another four or five days, they <b>thought,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sure to break them.|$|E
5|$|While F-105s did score 27 air-to-air victories, {{the overall}} {{exchange}} ratio was near parity. On January 2, 1967, the Americans sprang a surprise on the MiGs when they launched Operation Bolo. F-4 Phantoms, {{using the same}} radio call signs, direction of approach, altitude, and speed as a typical flight of bomb-laden F-105s, lured a group of MiG-21s toward what the MiG pilots <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> easy prey. The result was seven MiG-21s shot down within 12 minutes for no U.S. losses.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Hollywood {{characters}} Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto {{were popular}} in the Indies, as were imported detective films in general; however, no films in that genre had yet been produced domestically. This led Jo to make a detective film which he <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> successful with ethnic Chinese audiences. For this, he approached L.V. Wijnhamer, Jr., an Indo man who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work; Wijnhamer, better known as Pah Wongso, helped educate abandoned children, ran an employment office, and raised funds for Red Cross aid in war-torn China. Wijnhamer accepted the role.|$|E

5|$|Taylor rebounded in {{the early}} stages of what many <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> his final season in 1992. Through close to nine games Taylor was on pace for 10 sacks and the Giants were 5–4. However, a {{ruptured}} Achilles tendon suffered in a game on November 8, 1992 against Green Bay sidelined him for the final seven games, during which the team went 1–6. Before the injury Taylor had missed only four games due to injury in his 12-year career. Throughout the 1992 season, and the ensuing offseason, Taylor was noncommittal about his future, alternately saying he might retire, then later hinting he wanted a longer-term contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{backward}} {{condition of}} shipyards in the seceding states convinced Mallory {{that he would}} have to look abroad to obtain the vessels that he <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to challenge the U.S. Navy. He selected two men as his primary representatives: James D. Bulloch and Lieutenant James H. North of the Confederate States Navy. North was a disappointment, but Bulloch proved to be one of the most effective agents for the Confederacy in Europe. He sought diligently and discreetly in England to acquire ships for the purposes of his government while working within or around the framework of the neutrality laws of the host nation.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but had gone in a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap enough for an arcade game would not be powerful enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that they had not solved that problem yet.|$|E

5|$|That {{game was}} Computer Space, {{developed}} by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They {{had found the}} Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they <b>thought</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100. By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed {{for a short time}} in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy. Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation. Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!. Galaxy Games prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of business plan.|$|E

Hawaii statehood was expected to result in the addition of two pro-civil-rights senators from a state {{which would be the}} first to have majority non-white population. This would endanger the Southern minority segregationist Democrat Senate by providing two more pro-civil rights votes to invoke cloture and halt a Senate filibuster.|$|E
