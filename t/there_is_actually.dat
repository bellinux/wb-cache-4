5|$|Such a {{depiction}} {{is common}} in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions {{with members of the}} same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named Labrosaurus ferox is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|To {{support their}} {{categorization}} of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others, many critics {{refer to a}} set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode. The question of what constitutes the set of noir's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy. For instance, critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion, but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings (e.g., Stranger on the Third Floor, The Big Sleep, Dark Passage, and The Dark Corner), while the tone of many other noir denouements is ambivalent. Some critics perceive classic noir's hallmark as a distinctive visual style. Others, observing that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> considerable stylistic variety among noirs, instead emphasize plot and character type. Still others focus on mood and attitude. No survey of classic noir's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo-noir; once again, there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period.|$|E

25|$|The {{seemingly}} rational decisions {{during the}} game are in fact clearly irrational once one realizes that they {{are nothing more than}} a greedy algorithm, which is of course not guaranteed to give a globally optimal solution.

25|$|Alternatively, higher {{volumetric}} {{energy density}} liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used. However, liquid hydrogen is cryogenic and boils at 20.268K (–252.882°C or –423.188°F). Cryogenic storage cuts weight but requires large liquification energies. The liquefaction process, involving pressurizing and cooling steps, is energy intensive. The liquefied hydrogen has lower energy density by volume than gasoline by approximately {{a factor of}} four, because of the low density of liquid hydrogen — <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams). Liquid hydrogen storage tanks must also be well insulated to minimize boil off. Ice may form around the tank and help corrode it further if the liquid hydrogen tank insulation fails.|$|E
25|$|Carioca — Not a dialect, but sociolects of the fluminense variant {{spoken in}} an area roughly {{corresponding}} to Greater Rio de Janeiro. It appeared after locals {{came in contact with}} the Portuguese aristocracy amidst the Portuguese royal family fled in the early 19th century. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a continuum between Vernacular countryside accents and the carioca sociolect, and the educated speech (in Portuguese norma culta, which most closely resembles other Brazilian Portuguese standards but with marked recent Portuguese influences, the nearest ones among the country's dialects along florianopolitano), so that not all people native to the state of Rio de Janeiro speak the said sociolect, but most carioca speakers will use the standard variant not influenced by it that is rather uniform around Brazil depending on context (emphasis or formality, for example).|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} or slush hydrogen may be used, {{as in the}} Space Shuttle. However {{liquid hydrogen}} requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (−252.882°C or −423.188°F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature). The tanks must also be well insulated to prevent boil off but adding insulation increases cost. Liquid hydrogen has less energy density by volume than hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline by approximately a factor of four. This highlights the density problem for pure hydrogen: <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> about 64% more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams hydrogen) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams hydrogen). The carbon in the gasoline also contributes to the energy of combustion.|$|E

25|$|Empiricism {{has stood}} in {{contrast}} to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation. Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation {{is made in the}} light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it. Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method. Popper further claimed that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error. It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.|$|E
25|$|Jayfeather {{receives}} a prophecy informing him that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a fourth {{cat in the}} prophecy. Jayfeather believes it may be Mothwing, medicine cat of RiverClan, divisions in StarClan and the medicine cats, due to the accusation that Jayfeather murdered Flametail in Night Whispers, {{makes it difficult to}} speak to Mothwing. Jayfeather is granted safe passage, however, and Mothwing shows him a reed that has been smoldering for days, even after heavy rainfall. Jayfeather takes this as an omen to find the spirit of Flametail, although the divisions in StarClan make it difficult. When he finds Flametail, he convinces Flametail to reveal the truth: that he had drowned and was not killed by Jayfeather. This revelation resolves the divisions among the medicine cats, who then unite StarClan in preparation for the final battle with the Dark Forest. Former ThunderClan leader Bluestar tells Jayfeather that the fourth cat is Firestar. The final battle between the Clans and the Dark Forest then begins, with both StarClan and Dark Forest cats taking on corporeal forms. The battle ends when Firestar kills Tigerstar's spirit, but he dies immediately afterward and loses his last life.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Jason Head re-evaluated the phylogenetic {{position}} of Eolambia based on specimens stored at the OMNH. He recognized Kirkland's identification of supposed lambeosaurine distinguishing traits in Eolambia as either erroneous or dubious. As demonstrated by Head, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a foramen on the premaxilla; the premaxilla only borders the nostril {{on the bottom}} edge; there are two finger-like processes {{at the front of}} the maxilla in addition to the shelf; high neural spines of the caudal vertebrae also occur in the non-lambeosaurines Ouranosaurus and Bactrosaurus; and the expansion of the tip of the ischium also occurs in Camptosaurus, Iguanodon, Ouranosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, indicating that the expansion is plesiomorphic for iguanodonts and was secondarily lost in hadrosaurines. While M.L. Casanovas and colleagues in 1999 characterized lambeosaurines as having a [...] "expanded foot" [...] at the tip of the ischium, as opposed to a [...] "club-like" [...] condition, Head argued that Corythosaurus and Lambeosaurus have ischial tips no more an expanded than those of Mantellisaurus or Ouranosaurus.|$|E

500|$|Let Me In was {{not well}} {{received}} by all critics. Some disputed Reeves' claims {{that he was not}} remaking the film but re-adapting the book, criticizing it for being too similar to the Swedish film. Josh Tyler wrote [...] "The movie he’s made is absolutely a direct remake of the 2008 film, the two are so similar that it’s almost impossible to differentiate between them." [...] In a similar vein, Jamie S. Rich noted that while there was plenty of content in the original novel that the Swedish film omitted, [...] "Reeves hasn't really ferreted out anything new; on the contrary, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> less plot in Let Me In than in the Alfredson version." [...] Beth Accomando wrote, [...] "How Reeves can take the credit 'written and directed by Matt Reeves' seems almost laughable when you note how similar the script and the direction are to the original." [...] In comparing the two films, she opined that the remake [...] "makes obvious all that the original film made subtle and does so with less complexity." [...] Mark Kermode called it [...] "the most utterly redundant remake of the year".|$|E
500|$|An early {{draft of}} the script {{attributed}} to Jones and Phillips is markedly different from the finished film. The early script has Jareth enter Sarah's house {{in the guise of}} Robin Zakar, the author of a play she is due to perform in. Sarah does not wish for her brother to be taken away by the goblins, and Jareth snatches him away against her will. Jareth is overtly villainous in this {{draft of the}} script, and during his final confrontation with Sarah he tells her he would [...] "much rather have a Queen" [...] than [...] "a little goblin prince." [...] The early script ends with Sarah kicking Jareth in disgust, her blows causing him to transform into a powerless, sniveling goblin. In the extensive junkyard scene, Jareth operates the Junk Lady as a puppet, whereas in the film she is autonomous. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a pub or bar in the Labyrinth where the Man with Hat and Hoggle gather, and the river Lethe in Greek myth is mentioned. As well, the ballroom scene features extensive dialogue between Jareth and Sarah, whereas in the film there is none (although there is in the novelization by A. C. H. Smith), and the goings-on with the dancers in the ballroom are more overtly sexualized.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian writer Alexis Petridis was {{confident}} that [...] "there's clearly an interesting pop star" [...] emerging from Diamandis, but suggested that her creativity was restricted by the heavy integration of alter egos and an implied determination for commercial success, which he commented failed to reflect Diamandis' inventiveness. Simon Price from The Independent accepted that the record was [...] "too professional to be truly terrible", although noted that Diamandis' revamped public image as a [...] "British Katy Perry" [...] lacked ingenuity. NME columnist Priya Elan summarised the album as an [...] "expensive-sounding failure" [...] that suffered from its lack of decisiveness. Writing for Pitchfork, Laura Snapes questioned the decision of creating the [...] "Electra Heart" [...] character for the record, and suggested that it was unnecessary. She elaborated that [...] "duller and more unbearable" [...] tracks were unavoidable, and expressed particular disappointment because she thought that Electra Heart could have become [...] "one of the year's most acclaimed pop albums." [...] Representing The Observer, Kitty Empire assumed that Diamandis' collaborations with Dr. Luke and Greg Kurstin were evidence of [...] "a big label push". She compared the disc to the works of Perry and Britney Spears, although felt that Lana Del Rey was more successful in embodying the themes of [...] "love, identity, femininity and America" [...] than Diamandis' generic production values allowed. Emily Mackay from The Quietus criticised the songs' titles for being lacklustre, which she sarcastically stated caused listeners [...] "physical pain", and was disappointed that the character [...] "Electra Heart" [...] was a scapegoat for expressing [...] "all the worst parts of Marina Diamandis that she didn't want to become." [...] The harshest review came from Clash magazine, with George Boorman writing, [...] "'Electra heart' is an ingloriously languid statement of Marina's demise, the final stamp of disapproval on her flailing excuse of a musical career. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a song called 'Bubblegum Bitch' on this album.
