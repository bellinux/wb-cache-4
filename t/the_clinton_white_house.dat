In the 1998 campaign Miller accused Moran of flip-flopping in {{his support of}} President Bill Clinton, after Moran, {{who had been a}} vocal supporter of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> voted in favor of opening an impeachment inquiry following the Monica Lewinsky scandal.|$|E
5|$|In November 1997, Robin Raphel was {{appointed}} as United States Ambassador to Tunisia. Tunisia {{was a frequent}} partner for Mediterranean military exercises with U.S. naval squadrons and marine battalions, allowing more exercises in its waters {{than any other country}} in North Africa. When Raphel was ambassador, Stuart Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economics, Business and Agriculture, proposed a new initiative to liberalize trade further with Tunisia. The Eizenstat Initiative, as it came to be known informally, implemented lower tariffs on industrial and manufacturing sector goods to enable Tunisia to become a supplier for goods throughout Arab and African states. President Zine El Abidine visited <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W. Bush over concerns about Pakistan's burgeoning nuclear program under the Pressler Amendment banned all military ties, supply of military hardware and jet fighters, and cut off political relations with Islamabad. Bhutto sought rapprochement with <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> and Raphel became a key player in orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E

Hart both embraced and moved away from aspects of his past affiliation with McGovern, while Clinton, and the Democratic Leadership Council movement {{of which he was}} a part, explicitly rejected McGovern's ideology.

500|$|In his own estimation, the Arizona {{senator is}} {{straightforward}} and direct, but impatient. Other traits include {{a penchant for}} lucky charms, a fondness for hiking, {{and a sense of}} humor that has sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers: [...] "Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly?– Because Janet Reno is her father." [...] McCain subsequently apologized profusely, and <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> accepted his apology. McCain has not shied away from addressing his shortcomings, and apologizing for them. He is known for sometimes being prickly and hot-tempered with Senate colleagues, but his relations with his own Senate staff have been more cordial, and have inspired loyalty towards him. [...] He formed a strong bond with two senators, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham, over hawkish foreign policy and overseas travel, and they became dubbed the [...] "Three Amigos".|$|E
500|$|On August 13, 2000, Gore {{announced}} that he had selected Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman became [...] "the first person of the Jewish faith to run for the nation's second-highest office." [...] Many pundits saw Gore's choice of Lieberman as further distancing him from the scandals of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> Gore's daughter, Karenna, together with her father's former Harvard roommate Tommy Lee Jones, officially nominated Gore as the Democratic presidential candidate during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. Gore accepted his party's nomination and spoke about the major themes of his campaign, stating in particular his plan to extend Medicare to pay for prescription drugs and to work for a sensible universal health-care system. Soon after the convention, Gore hit the campaign trail with running mate Joe Lieberman. Gore and Bush were deadlocked in the polls. They participated in three televised debates. While both sides claimed victory after each, Gore was critiqued as either too stiff, too reticent, or too aggressive in contrast to Bush.|$|E

5000|$|Trailer parks, {{especially}} in American culture, are stereotypically viewed as lower income housing {{the occupants of}} which live at or below the poverty line, have low social status and lead a desultory and deleterious lifestyle. Despite the advances in trailer home technology, the trailer park image survives, as evoked by a statement from Presidential adviser James Carville who, {{in the course of}} one of <b>the</b> Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> political scandals, suggested [...] "Drag $100 bills through trailer parks, there's no telling what you'll find," [...] in reference to Paula Jones.

2500|$|Sessions {{also served}} as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee during the {{nomination}} process for Elena Kagan, President Obama's nominee to succeed retired Justice John Paul Stevens.

Sessions pointed out that Kagan [...] "has a very thin record legally, never tried a case, never argued before a jury, only had her first appearance in the appellate courts a year ago".|$|E

2500|$|William Gould's term as NLRB chair {{ended on}} August 27, 1998. Two days later, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> asked Truesdale {{to return to}} the NLRB as chair. [...] "I was very {{conflicted}} about it," [...] Truesdale later said. [...] "But I worked for the NLRB for almost 50 years. How can you say no?" [...] The administration's rationale for picking Truesdale was his acceptability to employers, conservative groups, and Republicans in Congress as well as a desire to avoid the contentious relationship Gould had with these groups during his tenure as chair. Administration officials also hoped Truesdale would smooth relationships among NLRB members themselves, who often had an unhappy relationship with Gould.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, Hugh Rodham and {{his brother}} Tony ignited a small {{controversy}} {{when they tried to}} solicit corporate donations for Clinton's inaugural parties; they dropped the effort after a public outcry.Once <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> entered <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> Rodham became a sometime golfing buddy of the President and he and Maria often joined family get-togethers at Camp David.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{press office}} issued a {{response}} to McCaughey's [...] "No Exit" [...] article by arguing that it contained [...] "numerous factual inaccuracies and misleading statements." [...] McCaughey responded that her claims came [...] "straight from {{the text of the}} bill." [...] Supporters of the Clinton plan questioned McCaughey's claims, including her statements that [...] "the law will prevent you from going outside the system to buy basic health coverage you think is better" [...] and that [...] "doctor can be paid only by the plan, not by you" [...] by pointing to the text of the legislation such as Section 1003: [...] "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting...

2500|$|The First Lady's role in {{the secret}} {{proceedings}} of the Health Care Task Force also sparked litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Some constitutional experts argued to the court that such a legal theory was not supported by the text, the history, or the structure of the Constitution. Ultimately, Hillary Clinton won the litigation in June 1993, when the D.C. Circuit ruled narrowly that the First Lady could be deemed a government official (and not a mere private citizen) for the purpose of not having to comply with the procedural requirements of FACA.|$|E

5000|$|As {{chair of}} the Veterans Affairs {{subcommittee}} on Oversight and Investigations, Everett garnered national attention {{in the fall of}} 1997 for revealing that former Ambassador M.

But the Republicans reacted to <b>White</b> <b>House</b> anger by digging into Mr. Lawrences background. In early December, a House panel headed by Representative Terry Everett of Alabama discovered that there was no record that Mr. Lawrence was aboard the ship Horace Bushnell, as he and the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> had claimed. That discovery revived Republican accusations that perhaps the Administration had granted a favor to a wealthy donor after all. But for once a politician warned against instant judgment.

50|$|In April 2016 that 2016 U.S. {{president}}ial candidate, {{and wife}} {{of former president}} Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton's old car was being offered for sale.

The car was moved to the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> in Washington, DC in 1993 when Bill <b>Clinton</b> became <b>the</b> President of the United States, but was then sold for $2,000 in the year 2000, directly before <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> left <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> when George W.

Lawn first attempted to sell the car in 2011 on eBay, though the car never sold on the site, so Mike Lawn is offering the car for sale once again at the appraised value of approximately $8,000 USD. The value of the car is not based on the previous history of the car, but its condition and mileage (the car is in good condition other than some paint peeling and a small tear in the passenger's velour seat that are expected for the age of the car).
