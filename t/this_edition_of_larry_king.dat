40|$|The topic <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> Moving Soldiers (MS) is body {{composition}} measurement in military personnel. The text {{is based on}} the theory chapter in my masterwork at the Norwegian School of Sport Science (Holtberget, 2010). The topic of the master degree was validation of instruments measuring {{body composition}}, and the subjects were military personnel. The text presented in <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> MS has gone through a minor revision from the original masterwork text, and something has been added. I hope <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> MS will give the reader an overview in what body composition is, and the different methods of measuring it. I also hope that <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> MS can be used as an encyclopedia to those who in the future wishes to study and measure body composition in military personnel...|$|R
