5|$|Oliver Cromwell {{moved to}} the street in 1647, taking up {{residence}} in Wallingford House. Two years later, Charles I was carried through Whitehall on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> trial at Westminster Hall. Whitehall itself was a wide street and had sufficient space for a scaffold to be erected for the King's execution at Banqueting House. He made a brief speech there before being beheaded. Cromwell died at the Palace of Whitehall in 1658.|$|E
5|$|British and Soviet ballistic-missile {{submarines}} are mysteriously disappearing. James Bond—MI6 agent 007—is {{summoned to}} investigate. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> briefing, Bond escapes an ambush by Soviet agents in Austria, killing their leader during a downhill ski chase. The {{plans for a}} highly advanced submarine tracking system are being offered in Egypt. There, he encounters Major Anya Amasova—KGB agent Triple X—his rival to recover the microfilm plans. They travel across Egypt together, encountering Jaws – a tall assassin with razor sharp steel teeth – along the way. Bond and Amasova reluctantly join forces after a truce is agreed by their respective British and Soviet superiors. They identify {{the person responsible for}} the thefts as the shipping tycoon and scientist Karl Stromberg.|$|E

5|$|Following his death, Sabbagh and Zahir's sons Abbas and Salih {{were arrested}} by Hasan Pasha's men. The Sublime Porte also seized {{property}} belonging to Zahir, his sons and Sabbagh, which valued at 41,500,000 piasters. They were imprisoned in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital {{along with their}} physician, who {{was known to be}} talented in his profession. The physician was summoned by the sultan to treat his wife's ailment, which he did successfully, earning him his freedom from incarceration and a medal of honor from the sultan. The physician used his influence with the authorities to have Zahir's children and grandchildren released and returned to their hometowns. Sabbagh was executed by Hasan Pasha. Al-Dinkizli was rewarded with the governorship of Gaza, but died on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> new headquarters, likely having been poisoned by Hasan.|$|E
5|$|Pattle {{had flown}} several patrols {{that morning and}} was {{suffering}} from a high temperature and fever. He had downed a Ju 88 and two Bf 109s on a morning interception to interdict German air operations. One of his victims, a Bf 109 from III./JG 77 crash-landed at Larissa. His success took Pattle's total from 47 to 49. At 17:00 in the afternoon, another raid approached. He was seen, just before an air raid alarm, in the mess, lying on a couch, shivering under the blankets. He was detailed to take a patrol over the lines but during the mission briefing, around 100 German bombers with fighter escort attacked the capital, seeking to attack Allied shipping in the harbour. He ran for the door towards a Hurricane. His adjutant, George Rumsey, tried to stop him, but Pattle was determined to fly. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> fighter, he narrowly avoided being killed in a strafing attack by a low-flying Bf 110. He took to the skies minutes later. Pattle climbed to gain altitude and headed for Piraeus Harbour at 20,000 feet.|$|E

25|$|On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{classification}} of Riemannian holonomy groups, Berger developed two criteria {{that must be}} satisfied by the Lie algebra of the holonomy group of a torsion-free affine connection which is not locally symmetric: one of them, known as Berger's first criterion, {{is a consequence of}} the Ambrose–Singer theorem, that the curvature generates the holonomy algebra; the other, known as Berger's second criterion, comes from the requirement that the connection should not be locally symmetric. Berger presented a list of groups acting irreducibly and satisfying these two criteria; this can be interpreted as a list of possibilities for irreducible affine holonomies.|$|E
25|$|On 7 December 2010, Pathan's power hitting sealed {{a memorable}} 5-wicket win for India. Pathan clobbered the New Zealand attack with his {{aggressive}} innings, smashing an unbeaten 123 from 96 balls and shared an unbroken 133-run partnership with Saurabh Tiwary to guide India {{to a huge}} target of 316 with seven balls to spare and give the hosts a 4–0 lead in the series. He was named man of the match for this effort. The all-rounder clubbed seven fours and seven sixes on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> maiden one-day century to help the hosts overhaul New Zealand's challenging 315–7 with seven balls to spare at the M.

25|$|Eventually Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep {{the mouse}} reach the world's end, where Aslan {{appears as a}} lamb before {{transforming}} into a lion (a scene that refers to John 21:12, where Jesus appears after his resurrection and makes a breakfast of fish for his disciples). He shows Reepicheep <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> country and helps the children return home. He tells Edmund and Lucy that, like Peter and Susan, they have become too old to return to Narnia, and that they must instead come to know him in their world—a relatively direct reference to the Christian theme of the series. He does not say whether Eustace will return to Narnia.|$|E

25|$|After lunch, {{the pair}} {{continued}} to score quickly for another hour, and extended their partnership to 177 before Flintoff was lbw to Tait for 102, his first Test century against Australia. The loss of Flintoff did not deter the English, as Jones continued to hit {{runs through the}} off side on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> highest score against the Australians, making 85 before he was caught and bowled by Kasprowicz. The next two wickets fell quickly, but a stubborn last-wicket partnership of 23 between Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones – including an incident where the ball hit the stumps but the bails failed to fall off – saw England to 477 all out at tea.|$|E
25|$|The Cougars {{traveled}} to Cincinnati for a Tuesday night game versus Xavier of the Big East with both teams on unbeaten streaks– four {{games for the}} Musketeers and five for the Cougars. SIUE got on the board in the 14th minute; Kendall-Moullin headed McHugh's corner away from the Xavier keeper, and Gutierrez tipped it into the net for his first score of the season. The defenses then took control, as the Musketeers turned away the Cougars' relentless attack, and the SIUE defense only allowed 4 shots-on-goal for Dal Santo to save on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> fifth shutout of the year. The Cougar unbeaten streak is at six, with only four MVC games remaining on the schedule.|$|E

At {{the time of the}} conquest Quemuenchatocha was the zaque and he ordered his men to not submit to the European invaders or show them <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> bohío. He sent messengers to the Spanish conquistadors with valuable peace offers. While this was happening, Quemuenchatocha had hidden his treasures from the Spanish. Hunza was located in a valley not as green as the Bogotá savanna. The advantage of the Spanish weaponry {{and the use of the}} horses quickly beat the Muisca warriors.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1861, Sheridan was ordered to travel to Jefferson Barracks, near St. Louis, Missouri, for {{assignment}} to the 13th U.S. Infantry. He departed from his command of Fort Yamhill, Oregon, by way of San Francisco, across the Isthmus of Panama, and through New York City to home in Somerset for a brief leave. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> new post, he made a courtesy call to Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck in St. Louis, who commandeered his services to audit the financial records of his immediate predecessor, Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont, whose administration of the Department of the Missouri was tainted by charges of wasteful expenditures and fraud that left the status of $12 million in debt. Sheridan sorted out the mess, impressing Halleck in the process. Much to Sheridan's dismay, Halleck's vision for Sheridan consisted of a continuing role as a staff officer. Nevertheless, Sheridan performed the task assigned to him and entrenched himself as an excellent staff officer in Halleck's view.|$|E
25|$|In 1929 Alfredo Binda won {{a record}} eight {{consecutive}} stages on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> third consecutive, and fourth career, Giro d'Italia victory. This Giro began in Rome, {{which was the}} second time that the Giro had not started in Milan in the history of its running. When Binda came to the finish in Milan, he was booed by some of the spectators. The next year, Binda was paid 22,500 lire— {{the same amount of money}} the winner of the Giro would get— not to participate in the Giro. Binda's absence left the field open for everyone else. The eventual winner, Luigi Marchisio, gained the lead after winning the third stage of the race. Marchisio held a slim fifty-two second lead for the last six stages of the race to the finish in Milan. Marchisio became the youngest rider to win the Giro at 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days; his record stood for ten years before being broken by Fausto Coppi.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} play of the second half, Steelers {{defensive}} tackle Casey Hampton forced a fumble from George that Aaron Smith recovered for Pittsburgh on the Titans 31-yard line. On the next play, the team took a 20-14 lead with a 31-yard touchdown run by Amos Zereoué. But Tennessee stormed right back, going into a no-huddle offense and scoring twice in a span of five minutes. First, they responded by driving 70 yards in eight plays, including a 39-yard reception by tight end Frank Wycheck, and scored on McNair's 7-yard touchdown toss to Wycheck that retook the lead. The Steelers had to punt on their next drive, and Derrick Mason returned the ball nine yards to the Titans 42-yard line. McNair then completed two passes to Mason for 24 total yards and one to Wycheck for 21 on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Erron Kinney, giving Tennessee a 28-20 lead with 2:53 {{left in the third}} quarter.|$|E
