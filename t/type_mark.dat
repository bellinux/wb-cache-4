50|$|Because it fired {{a bigger}} {{cartridge}} than the <b>Type</b> 99 <b>Mark</b> 1, the <b>Type</b> 99 <b>Mark</b> 2 {{had a higher}} muzzle velocity but a lower rate of fire, and was heavier. In {{the first years of}} the war the IJN preferred the <b>Type</b> 99 <b>Mark</b> 1, and it did not operationally use the <b>Type</b> 99 <b>Mark</b> 2 until 1942. Towards the end of the war it developed a preference for installing the <b>Type</b> 99 <b>Mark</b> 2, presumably to counter the improving performance and ruggedness of US combat aircraft. The Type 99 cannon suffered from relatively low muzzle velocity and rate of fire compared to other 20mm cannons but the trade off was an extremely light cannon that did not hinder flight performance of the IJN's fighter aircraft. The close economic and political ties between the IJN and Dai Nihon Heiki KK ensured that the latter had little competition.|$|R

40|$|Static {{checking}} {{of process}} types ensures that each object accepts all messages received from concurrent clients, although {{the set of}} acceptable messages can depend on the object's state. However, conventional approaches of using dynamic type information (e. g., checked type casts) are not applicable in the current process type model, and the typing of self-references is too restrictive. In this paper a refinement of the model is proposed. It solves these problems {{so that it is}} easy to handle, for example, heterogeneous collections. 1 Introduction The process type model was proposed as a statically checkable type model for concurrent and distributed systems based on active objects [Pun 96,Pun 97]. A process type specifies not only a set of acceptable messages, but also constraints on the sequence of these messages. Type safety can be checked statically by ensuring that each object reference is associated with an appropriate <b>type</b> <b>mark</b> which specifies all message sequences accepted by th [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{scaffolds}} {{control the}} intensity and duration of signaling and dictate the specificity of signaling through MAP kinase pathways. KSR 1 is a molecular scaffold of the Raf/MEK/ERK MAP kinase cascade that regulates {{the intensity and}} duration of ERK activation. Relative to wild-type mice, ksr 1 -/- mice are modestly glucose intolerant, but show a normal response to exogenous insulin. However, ksr 1 -/- mice also demonstrate a three-fold increase in serum insulin levels {{in response to a}} glucose challenge, suggesting a role for KSR 1 in insulin secretion. The kinase MARK 2 is closely related to C-TAK 1, a known regulator of KSR 1. Mice lacking MARK 2 have an increased rate of glucose disposal in response to exogenous insulin, increased glucose tolerance, and are resistant to diet-induced obesity. mark 2 -/- ksr 1 -/- (DKO) mice were compared to wild <b>type,</b> <b>mark</b> 2 -/-, and ksr 1 -/- mice for their ability to regulate glucose homeostasis. Here we show that disruption of KSR 1 in mark 2 -/- mice reverses the increased sensitivity to exogenous insulin resulting from MARK 2 deletion. DKO mice respond to exogenous insulin similarly to wild type and ksr 1 -/- mice. These data suggest a model whereby MARK 2 negatively regulates insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissue through inhibition of KSR 1. Consistent with this model, we found that MARK 2 binds and phosphorylates KSR 1 on Ser 392. Phosphorylation of Ser 392 is a critical regulator of KSR 1 stability, subcellular location, and ERK activation. These data reveal an unexpected role for the molecular scaffold KSR 1 in insulin-regulated glucose metabolism...|$|E
