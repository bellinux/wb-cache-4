60|$|September 10th.--I {{went into}} town again yesterday, {{by way of}} the Porta San Frediano, and {{observed}} that this gate (like the other gates of Florence, as far as I have observed) is a tall, square structure of stone or brick, or both, rising high above the adjacent wall, and having a range of open loggie in the upper story. The arch externally is about half the height of the structure. Inside, towards the town, it rises nearly to the roof. On each side of the arch <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>room</b> for offices, apartments, storehouses, or whatever else. On the outside of the gate, along the base, are those iron rings and sockets for torches, which are said to be the distinguishing symbol of illustrious houses. As contrasted with the vista of the narrow, swarming street through the arch from without, the view from the inside might be presented with a glimpse of the free blue sky.|$|E
60|$|The gross {{statistical}} {{result from}} the schoolboys is as follows: --Total returns, 337: viz. Winchester 135, Princeton 34, Charterhouse 168; the number of these that contained well-defined Number-Forms are 5, 1, and 12 respectively, or total 18--that is, one in twenty. It may justly {{be said that the}} masters should not be counted, because it was owing to the accident of their seeing the Number-Forms themselves that they became interested in the inquiry; if this objection be allowed, the proportion would become 16 in 337, or one in twenty-one. Again, some boys who had no visualising faculty at all could make no sense out of the questions, and wholly refrained from answering; this would again diminish the proportion. The shyness in some would help in a statistical return to neutralise the tendency to exaggeration in others, but I do not think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>room</b> for correction on either head. Neither do I think it requisite to make much allowance for inaccurate answers, as the tone of the replies is simple and straightforward. Those from Princeton, where the students are older and had been specially warned, are remarkable for indications of self-restraint. The result of personal inquiries among adults, quite independent of and prior to these, gave me the proportion of 1 in 30 as a provisional result for adults. This is as well confirmed by the present returns of 1 in 21 among boys and youths as I could have expected.|$|E

6000|$|He {{felt about}} France what Pericles felt of Athens--unique value in her, nothing else mattering; but {{his theory of}} {{politics}} was Bismarck's. He had one illusion--France; and one disillusion--mankind, including Frenchmen, and his colleagues not least. His principles for the peace can be expressed simply. In the first place, he was a foremost believer {{in the view of}} German psychology that the German understands and can understand nothing but intimidation, that he is without generosity or remorse in negotiation, that there is no advantage be will not take of you, and no extent to which he will not demean himself for profit, that he is without honor, pride, or mercy. Therefore you must never negotiate with a German or conciliate him; you must dictate to him. On no other terms will he respect you, or will you prevent him from cheating you. But it is doubtful how far he thought these characteristics peculiar to Germany, or whether his candid view of some other nations was fundamentally different. His philosophy had, therefore, no place for [...] "sentimentality" [...] in international relations. Nations are real things, of whom you love one and feel for the rest indifference--or hatred. The glory of the nation you love is a desirable end,--but generally to be obtained at your neighbor's expense. The politics of power are inevitable, and there is nothing very new to learn about this war or the end it was fought for; England had destroyed, as in each preceding century, a trade rival; a mighty chapter had been closed in the secular struggle between the glories of Germany and of France. Prudence required some measure of lip service to the [...] "ideals" [...] of foolish Americans and hypocritical Englishmen; but it would be stupid to believe that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>room</b> in the world, as it really is, for such affairs as the League of Nations, or any sense in the principle of self-determination except as an ingenious formula for rearranging {{the balance of power in}} one's own interests.|$|E

50|$|L-DOPA, a {{precursor}} of dopamine that crosses the blood-brain barrier, {{is used in}} the treatment of Parkinson's disease. For depressed patients where low activity of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine is implicated, there is only little evidence for benefit of neurotransmitter precursor administration. L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine are both precursors for dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These conversions require vitamin B6, vitamin C, and S-adenosylmethionine.

5000|$|Traditionally, as {{explained}} in a journal article discussing user modeling and user-adapted interaction, computer use was modeled as a human-computer dyad {{in which the two}} were connected by a narrow explicit communication channel, such as text-based terminals.

However, as stated in the introduction, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>room</b> for mishaps and failure.

5000|$|Legalizing Prostitution {{examines}} a {{wide variety}} of regulations that differ from nation to nation. One of Weitzer's objectives is to assess which kinds of regulations are (1) most sensible, (2) most likely to win public support, (3) best suited to reducing risks and harms, and (4) most likely to preserve public order. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>room</b> for debate here, and each nation that has legalized prostitution has had to grapple with these difficult questions. Weitzer's book advocates about 30 “best practices” that he thinks should be taken into account by any nation considering legalization. The first step, he writes, is that [...] "consensual adult prostitution be officially recognized as work and that participants be accorded the rights and protections available to those involved in other occupations".|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of pan {{processing}} of ores, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> tremendous losses in precious metals and quicksilver (mercury). Almost every millman was experimenting with some secret process for the amalgamation of ore.

60|$|And now Miles Milton {{began to}} find out, {{as well as}} to fix, in some degree, his natural character.

50|$|The Labouchère System is a {{progression}} betting strategy like the martingale {{but does not}} require the gambler to risk his stake as quickly with dramatic double-ups. The Labouchere System involves using a series of numbers in a line to determine the bet amount, following a win or a loss. Typically, the player adds the numbers at the front and end of the line to determine the size of the next bet. When he wins, he crosses out numbers and continues working on the smaller line. If he loses, then he adds his previous bet {{to the end of the}} line and continues to work on the longer line. This is a much more flexible progression betting system and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>room</b> for the player to design his initial line to his own playing preference.|$|E
