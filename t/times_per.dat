40|$|AbstractA “rooted” plane {{triangulation}} is a plane triangulation {{with one}} designated vertex {{on the outer}} face. A simple algorithm to generate all triconnected rooted plane triangulations with at most n vertices is presented. The algorithm uses O(n) space and generates such triangulations in O(1) <b>time</b> <b>per</b> triangulation without duplications. The algorithm does not output entire triangulations but the difference from the previous triangulation. By modifying the algorithm all triconnected rooted plane triangulations having exactly n vertices including exactly r vertices on the outer face in O(r) <b>time</b> <b>per</b> triangulation can be generated without duplicates, while the previous best algorithm generates such triangulations in O(n 2) <b>time</b> <b>per</b> triangulation. All triconnected (non-rooted) plane triangulations having exactly n vertices including exactly r vertices on the outer face can also be generated without duplicates in O(r 2 n) <b>time</b> <b>per</b> triangulation, and all maximal planar graphs can be generated in O(n 3) <b>time</b> <b>per</b> graph...|$|R
