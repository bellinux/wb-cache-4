In addition, the Soyuz rocket—which {{has been the}} Russian's space launch workhorse for some 40 years—is proven technology with a very good safety record. Russia benefits in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> access to the Kourou launch site. Due to its proximity to the equator, launching from Kourou rather than Baikonur nearly doubles Soyuz's payload to GTO (3.0 tonnes vs. 1.7 tonnes).|$|E

It may be that when told to go to a certain X-Y-Z position <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> only to within 1mm of that position. This would be its accuracy which may be improved by calibration. But if that position is taught into controller memory and each time it is sent there it returns to within 0.1mm of the taught position then the repeatability will be within 0.1mm.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011 several lesbian UK musicians got {{together}} {{to record the}} song 'It Does Get Better' {{under the banner of}} The L Project, an anti-LGBT-bullying fundraising initiative led by Georgey Payne (of lesbian band Greymatter) and Sofia Antonia Milone (of Geekgirl). The song's aim, with accompanying video, is to raise funds for charities Stonewall and Diversity Role Models for their work addressing the issue of LGBT bullying in schools, and also to help spread the message <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> better. The song reached number 11 in the Official UK independent singles chart in February 2012, the week it was released, and spent several days {{at the top of the}} UK iTunes and Amazon rock and folk/rock charts.|$|E

25|$|Before {{a diving}} {{operation}} {{it is usually}} necessary {{to set up the}} surface supply equipment. There are a number of components which must be connected in the correct order, with checks at various stages to ensure that there are no leaks and everything functions correctly. Most diving contractors will have comprehensive checklists that are used to ensure that the equipment is connected in the appropriate sequence and all checks are done. Some checks are critical to the safety of the diver. The compressor must be set up so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> uncontaminated air to the intake. Filters should be checked in case they need to be changed. Air supply hoses will be connected to the air panel and checked for leaks, umbilicals connected to the panels and helmets, and the communications equipment connected and tested. Before the umbilical is connected to the helmet or full face mask, the umbilical should be blown through to ensure there is no dirt inside, and the non return valve on the bailout block must be given a function test. This is important, as it is there to prevent backflow of air up the umbilical if the line is cut, and if it fails the diver may suffer a helmet squeeze, or a neck dam flood.|$|E

In the video, Songz sees several women along the beach, and plays volleyball with them, walks along the coastline, relaxes on a parked motorcycle, and other things, however in each instance they disappear and {{turn out to be}} illusions. In a review AOL Boombox recommended the video as one to watch, commenting, [...] "The crooner admits <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> 'lonely in this business,' which is why he needs a companion aka a 'homey' and he won't rest 'til he finds the one for him." ...|$|E

500|$|Baldur's Gate IIs {{gameplay}} {{was called}} [...] "addicting" [...] by GamePro. RPGamer {{said that while}} the game was generally the same as the original Baldur's Gate, the combat was much improved, with less frustration and more strategic options. Computer Gaming World agreed, saying players would put more consideration into designing and implementing combat plans. Eurogamer noted that the interface was [...] "incredibly easy to use." [...] Some reviewers, however, felt the non-player characters in the game were not as powerful as player-made characters. GameSpy said the game is much more difficult than Baldur's Gate and requires more strategy and planning than the original does. GameSpot felt the opening level of the game [...] "falls flat," [...] but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> much better once the player reaches Athkatla. IGN also noted that the introductory section of the game, while good, was nowhere near as fun as the adventures in Athkatla.|$|E
500|$|Dumped was {{met with}} a mixed {{reaction}} from critics. James Walton, of The Telegraph, was critical of the programme and its purpose; on Darren's departure, he said: [...] "According to the narrator, this proved that Darren “didn’t understand” the experiment. Another interpretation, of course, would be that he did." [...] The Times criticised the programme for setting the programme in an artificial rubbish dump for health and safety reasons, comparing it to various fakery scandals {{that had taken place}} in the programme Blue Peter in the past year. However, Nigel Kendall of the same newspaper called the programme [...] "entertaining" [...] and its contestants [...] "likeable", while Paul Hoggart said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> its point across. Website TV Scoop said that the programme was [...] "a great experiment", but did not approve of the inclusion of [...] "fame hungry" [...] participants and compared the programme to the most recent series of Big Brother. The website Hecklerspray gave the programme a negative review, calling the participants [...] "absolute fucking morons", and Orange gave the programme 3 out of 5 stars. Channel 4 controller Julian Bellamy commented on the programme's failure during Edinburgh Television Festival 2008, saying that it [...] "didn't have the human narrative you need" [...] and that it was [...] "a little bit too like other reality shows".|$|E
500|$|Another {{reviewer}} {{who liked}} the graphics was Dawn Jepsen of Computer Gaming World, who also praised the humour, especially the [...] "wackiness" [...] of the illnesses, {{and described the}} game as [...] "delightful and absorbing". The humour was also approved by a reviewer of Jeuxvideo.com, who, like other reviewers, lauded the graphics, by describing them as colourful. Next Generation reviewer echoed others' views about the humour, describing it as something {{they had come to}} except from Bullfrog, but criticised the lack of multiplayer support. The humour was again praised by a reviewer of PC Power, who said that the ailments enabled Bullfrog to have [...] "hilarious" [...] cures. The [...] "thoroughly engrossing" [...] gameplay, and the graphics were also complimented: it was stated that the bright colours gave hospitals a [...] "cheerful look". Theme Hospital was described as a [...] "fantastic title". Other comments from critics included Edge reviewer's compliments of the balance of patients and illnesses against the player's resources, and his belief that the game is a refinement of its genre, and PC Zone reviewers commendation of the detail: it was remarked <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> players [...] "helplessly immersed", and the game was awarded the PC Zone Classic accolade.

500|$|Philadelphia Inquirer {{television}} critic Jonathan Storm strongly {{criticized the}} show, {{calling it a}} flat, [...] "miscast mess" [...] with serious structural problems. Storm also said the Leslie character lacked energy and Poehler was playing the part against her comedic strengths. Tom Shales of The Washington Post said, [...] "Poehler's show unfortunately isn't worthy of her. It's dry and hesitant when one longs {{for it to be}} raucous and madcap." [...] David Hinckley of New York Daily News said the show was not funny enough to deserve Poehler's comedic talents, and compared the dialogue to a Saturday Night Live sketch that he said could not sustain a whole sitcom. New York Post television critic Linda Stasi said the pilot lacked laughs and was so similar to The Office that [...] "it's starting to look like a one-trick pony outfit that's gonna keep dressing that horse up in new saddles, hoping that no one will guess it's been around the track so many times, it's worn a ditch in the dirt." [...] The pilot episode premiered in Australia on Channel Seven on December 1, 2009, when episodes from the critically acclaimed second season were already playing in the United States. Sacha Moritorisz of The Sydney Morning Herald said of the episode, [...] "To be frank, tonight's premiere is weak.

2500|$|Some {{medications}} {{are also}} given by IV [...] "push" [...] or bolus. A syringe containing the medication {{is connected to}} an access port in the primary tubing and the medication is administered through the port. The syringe plunger is pressed slowly, if it might irritate the vein or cause a too-rapid effect. Certain medications, such as potassium, are never to be administered by IV push because the spike in medication in the blood from the IV push could be fatal. Once a medicine has been injected into the fluid stream of the IV tubing {{there must be some}} means of ensuring <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> from the tubing to the patient. [...] Usually this is accomplished by allowing the fluid stream to flow normally and thereby carry the medicine into the bloodstream; however, a second fluid injection is sometimes used, a [...] "flush", following the injection to push the medicine into the bloodstream more quickly.|$|E

[...] A woman states to Cross of her experiences with autism: [...] "I cry, I scream, I wish to God I wasn't different and I didn't have to struggle with everything...", and a boy tells him of the negative aspects of the condition: [...] "The bad thing about autism is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> hard to understand other people and to understand what people say and what--what other people try to tell me to do and how to explain me better." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to writing and speaking messages from God, Israelite or Jewish nevi'im ("spokespersons", [...] "prophets") often acted out prophetic parables in their life. For example, {{in order to}} contrast the people’s disobedience with the obedience of the Rechabites, God has Jeremiah invite the Rechabites to drink wine, in disobedience to their ancestor’s command. The Rechabites refuse, wherefore God commends them. Other prophetic parables acted out by Jeremiah include burying a linen belt so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> ruined to illustrate how God intends to ruin Judah's pride. Likewise, Jeremiah buys a clay jar and smashes it in the Valley of Ben Hinnom in front of elders and priests to illustrate that God will smash the nation of Judah {{and the city of}} Judah beyond repair. God instructs Jeremiah to make a yoke from wood and leather straps and to put it on his own neck to demonstrate how God will put the nation under the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. In a similar way, the prophet Isaiah had to walk stripped and barefoot for three years to illustrate the coming captivity, and the prophet Ezekiel had to lie on his side for 390 days and eat measured food to illustrate the coming siege.|$|E
