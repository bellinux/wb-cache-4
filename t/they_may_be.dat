5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea.

Their origins are unknown, but <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> gravitationally captured into current orbit or <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet.
