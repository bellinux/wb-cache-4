In the interior of the house, the forms of the rooms were simple but combined to make a more complex structure like Breuer and Gropius advocated. The house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} commenced {{around the}} courtyard with the East Wing (The King's Library) in 1823–1828, {{followed by the}} North Wing in 1833–1838, which originally housed among other galleries a reading room, now the Wellcome Gallery. Work was also progressing on the northern half of the West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826–1831, with Montagu House demolished in 1842 {{to make room for}} the final part of the West Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade, initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> <b>Hall</b> and Great Staircase were opened to the public. The Museum is faced with Portland stone, but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building were built using Haytor granite from Dartmoor in South Devon, transported via the unique Haytor Granite Tramway.|$|E
25|$|The old City Hall {{was built}} in 1906–1907 after the {{construction}} plans of Komor Marcell and Jakab Dezső. The entrance area, including the corridor and the staircase leading {{to the first floor}}, is the most representative in this regard. The ribbed stellar vaults that cover this area were inspired by Gothic architecture. The vaults are supported by columns with composite caps, and the keystone is a large floral shape which includes the lighting appliance. The vaults are painted with spiraling vegetal motifs. Elements of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>hall</b> include the stone bench with its legs shaped as those of an animal and with wing-shaped handles. Its shell-shaped, golden back has a shield flanked by two volutes on its upper side. Features of the monumental staircase leading to the first floor include the upper side of the banister resembling a slithering animal or a wave. The exterior decoration is simpler and is based on Hungarian-Székely folk motives made of polychromatic ceramics. The ground floor is marked by a solid, embossed pedestal. Windows with large openings tend to be predominant in the façade. The three semicircular windows in the middle area of the façade are those of the honor hall that has a double elevation with respect to the other rooms. The glass paintings which illustrated Gábor Bethlen, Francis II Rákóczi, Lajos Kossuth, Ferenc Deák and Franz Joseph I of Austria are missing from the halls.|$|E

Large crowds mobbed Heston, {{where he was}} met by the Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of Clarendon, who gave him a letter from King George VI assuring him of the Empire's lasting gratitude and urging him to come straight to Buckingham Palace to report. The streets were so packed with cheering people that it took Chamberlain {{an hour and a}} half to journey the nine miles (14km) from Heston to the Palace. After reporting to the King, Chamberlain and his wife appeared on the Palace balcony with the King and Queen. He then went to Downing Street; both the street and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>hall</b> of Number 10 were packed. As he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first-floor window, someone called to him, [...] "Neville, go up to the window and say 'peace for our time'." [...] Chamberlain turned around and responded, [...] "No, I don't do that sort of thing." [...] Nevertheless, Chamberlain recalled the words of his predecessor, Benjamin Disraeli and his return from the Congress of Berlin in his statement to the crowd: ...|$|E

500|$|Finds {{especially}} in Pompeii show the so-called Roman goddess Venus wearing a bikini. A {{statue of the}} so-called Venus in a bikini {{was found in a}} cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere, others were found in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>hall.</b> A statue of the so-called Venus was recovered from the tablinum of the house of Julia Felix, and another from an atrium in the garden at Via Dell'Abbondanza. Naples National Archaeological Museum, which opened its limited viewing gallery of more explicit exhibits in 2000, also exhibits a [...] "Venus in Bikini". However, the Naples National Archaeological Museum is keen to stress that this statue actually depicts her Greek counterpart Aphrodite as she is about to untie her sandal, a common theme among other works depicting Aphrodite. The museum's exhibits include female statues wearing see-through gold lamé brassiere, basque and knickers. The Kings of Naples discovered these Pompeii artifacts, including the one meter tall, almost unclothed statue of Venus painted in gold leaf with something like a modern bikini. They found them so shocking that for long periods the secret chamber was opened only to [...] "mature persons of secure morals". Even after the doors were opened, only 20 visitors were to be admitted at a time, and children under 12 were not allowed into the new part of the museum without their parents' or a teacher's permission.|$|E

2500|$|Endless Palace (未央宮; Wèiyāng Gōng) Also {{known as}} the West Palace. [...] The {{official}} center of government from Emperor Huidi onwards. [...] The palace was a walled rectangle 2250×2150m enclosing a 5km2 building complex of 40 halls. [...] There were four gates in the wall facing a cardinal direction. [...] The east gate was used only by nobility and the north one only by commoners. [...] The palace was sited along the highest portion of the ridgeline on which Changan was built. [...] In, fact <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> <b>Hall</b> {{at the center of}} the palace was built atop the exact highest point of the ridge. [...] The foundation terrace of this massive building is 350×200×15m. [...] Other important halls are: Xuanshi Hall, Wenshi Hall, Qingliang Hall, Qilin Hall, Jinhua Hall, and Chengming Hall. [...] Used by seven dynasties this palace has become the most famous in Chinese history.|$|E
2500|$|Prominent {{original}} exterior {{features include}} carved limestone detail, numerous false chimneys, steeply pitched slate roofs, and a seven-story clock tower. While {{it is not}} known for certain that Columbia High School was inspired by any earlier structures, there is a strong resemblance to Laynon Hall at Queen's University of Belfast. At {{the very top of the}} clock tower is a copper pyramidal structure. The entire pyramid structure rotates, and one side opens, serving as an observatory. The observatory is equipped with a large refracting telescope made by John Brashear. [...] That telescope is no longer functional, but there is a more modern Celestron C11 reflecting telescope that is used by students. Two levels below are the E. Howard & Co. Style #3 clock works. Alongside the clock is an enormous bronze bell by the Meneely Bell Foundry. Inside the school can be found rooms with fireplaces, hallways with beautiful faience wall tiles by John Scott Award recipient Herman Carl Mueller of Trenton, and mosaic inlaid terrazzo floors in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>hall.</b> The front foyer was recently renovated, removing non-period lighting and mid-century acoustic tile. The restoration included doors that more closely replicated the 1926 originals, a new terrazzo floor, and dramatic lighting of the zodiac-inspired plaster ceiling. Recently, dubious student art dating from as far back as the 1970s was painted over, among other improvements. The auditorium includes a three-manual Ernest M. Skinner Organ. Although it is little used and not completely functional, the organ is one of the few unmodified Skinners in existence and has received an Organ Historical Society citation. Regrettably, on either side of the stage the large plaster grills that hide the organ pipes were water damaged. The original auditorium chandeliers have also been removed. A similar story exists with regard to the swimming pool; while the original vaulted Catalan Guastavino tile ceiling remains, the chandeliers are gone, and a giant arched window is blocked by a later addition.|$|E

It is surmounted by a pair of toads carved by Shi Li, one holding a chrysanthemum in its teeth symbolizing long life and the other holding a camellia symbolizing a long and prosperous spring.
