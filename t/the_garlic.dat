25|$|<b>The</b> <b>garlic</b> plant's bulb is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used part of the plant. With the exception of the single clove types, garlic bulbs are normally divided into numerous fleshy sections called cloves. Garlic cloves are used for consumption (raw or cooked) or for medicinal purposes. They have a characteristic pungent, spicy flavor that mellows and sweetens considerably with cooking.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} varieties or subspecies of garlic, most notably hardneck garlic and softneck garlic. The latitude where <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> is grown affects {{the choice of}} type, as garlic can be day-length sensitive. Hardneck garlic is generally grown in cooler climates and produces relatively large cloves, whereas softneck garlic is generally grown closer to the equator and produces small, tightly-packed cloves.|$|E

25|$|Garlic {{is often}} kept in oil to produce flavored oil; however, the {{practice}} requires measures {{to be taken}} to prevent <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> from spoiling which may include rancidity and growth of Clostridium botulinum. Acidification with a mild solution of vinegar minimizes bacterial growth. Refrigeration does not assure the safety of garlic kept in oil, requiring use within one month to avoid bacterial spoilage.|$|E

25|$|Garlic {{is easy to}} {{grow and}} can be grown year-round in mild climates. While sexual {{propagation}} of garlic is possible, nearly all of <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> in cultivation is propagated asexually, by planting individual cloves in the ground. In colder climates, cloves are planted in the autumn, about six weeks before the soil freezes, and harvested in late spring or early summer. The cloves must be planted deep enough to prevent freeze/thaw, which causes mold or white rot.|$|E

25|$|The {{flagship}} red {{variety of}} Tabasco pepper sauce measures 2,500–5,000SHU on the Scoville scale. The habanero sauce is considerably hotter, rating above 7,000 Scoville units. The chipotle sauce adds chipotle pepper {{to the original}} sauce, measuring 1,500–2,500. <b>The</b> <b>garlic</b> variety, which blends milder peppers in with the tabasco peppers, rates 1,200–1,400 Scovilles, and the green pepper (jalapeño) sauce is even milder at 600–1,200 Scovilles.

500|$|The onion (Allium cepa L., from Latin cepa [...] "onion"), {{also known}} as the bulb onion or common onion, is a {{vegetable}} and is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. Its close relatives include <b>the</b> <b>garlic,</b> shallot, leek, chive, and Chinese onion.|$|E

2500|$|The {{well-known}} {{phenomenon of}} [...] "garlic breath" [...] is allegedly alleviated by eating fresh parsley. The herb is, therefore, included in many garlic recipes, such as pistou, persillade, and <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> butter spread used in garlic bread.|$|E
2500|$|The green, dry [...] "folds" [...] in {{the center}} of <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> clove are {{especially}} pungent. The sulfur compound allicin, produced by crushing or chewing fresh garlic, produces other sulfur compounds: ajoene, allyl polysulfides, and vinyldithiins. Aged garlic lacks allicin, but may have some activity due to the presence of S-allylcysteine.|$|E

He obtains books and other research materials from a library, and through painstaking research discovers the root of the disease in a strain of bacteria capable of infecting both deceased and living hosts. He also discovers that the vampires are affected by <b>the</b> <b>garlic,</b> mirrors, and crosses because of [...] "hysterical blindness", the result of previous psychological conditioning of the infected. Driven insane by the disease, the infected now react as they believe they should when confronted with these items. Even then, their reaction is constrained to the beliefs of the particular person; for example, a Christian vampire would fear the cross, but a Jewish vampire would not.|$|E

2500|$|St. Bernard Church, {{founded in}} 1785, {{was the first}} parish church {{established}} south of New Orleans after the American Revolutionary War, while the first permanent church in Saint Bernard was built in 1787 in Bayou Terre-aux-Boeufs. The Isleño cemetery began the same year; at first the dead were buried in the churchyard, but then the burial grounds were moved to a site facing the church. [...] By 1790 sugarcane had replaced indigo as the most profitable crop in Louisiana. Wealthy planters purchased the Isleños' land, {{many of whom were}} left with little choice but to work on the plantations consolidated from their small farms. In addition, Saint Bernard supplied the market in New Orleans with much of <b>the</b> <b>garlic,</b> onions, beans, potatoes and poultry that the city consumed between the late 18th and early 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Neither critics nor {{the public}} responded enthusiastically, {{although}} Robert Osborne {{has stated that}} the film was a success when he hosted a telecast of it on Turner Classic Movies. Graham Greene wrote that he was [...] "less than ever convinced {{that there is an}} aesthetic justification for filming Shakespeare at all... the effect of even the best scenes is to distract." [...] Cinemagoers considered the film too [...] "arty", staying away as they had from Warner's A Midsummer Night Dream a year before: leading to Hollywood abandoning the Bard for over a decade. The film nevertheless received four Oscar nominations. Subsequent film versions would make use of less experienced, but more photogenic, actors in the central roles. Cukor, interviewed in 1970, said of his film: [...] "It's one picture that if I had to do over again, I'd know how. I'd get <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> and the Mediterranean into it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> plant are also edible. The leaves and flowers (bulbils) {{on the head}} (spathe) are {{sometimes}} eaten. They are milder in flavor than the bulbs, and are most often consumed while immature and still tender. Immature garlic is sometimes pulled, rather like a scallion, and sold as [...] "green garlic". When green garlic is allowed to grow past the [...] "scallion" [...] stage, but not permitted to fully mature, it may produce a garlic [...] "round", a bulb like a boiling onion, but not separated into cloves like a mature bulb. It imparts a garlic flavor and aroma in food, minus the spiciness. Green garlic is often chopped and stir-fried or cooked in soup or hotpot in Southeast Asian (i.e. Vietnamese, Thai, Lao, Cambodian, Singaporean) and Chinese cookery, and is very abundant and low-priced. Additionally, the immature flower stalks (scapes) of the hardneck and elephant types are sometimes marketed for uses similar to asparagus in stir-fries.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{perceived}} <b>garlic</b> taste upon skin {{contact with}} DMSO {{may be due}} to nonolfactory activation of TRPA1 receptors in trigeminal ganglia.

2500|$|Inedible or rarely eaten {{parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> plant include the [...] "skin" [...] {{covering}} each clove and root cluster. The papery, protective layers of [...] "skin" [...] over {{various parts of}} the plant are generally discarded during preparation for most culinary uses, though in Korea immature whole heads are sometimes prepared with the tender skins intact. The root cluster attached to the basal plate of the bulb is the only part not typically considered palatable in any form. An alternative is to cut the top off the bulb, coat the cloves by dribbling olive oil (or other oil-based seasoning) over them, and roast them in an oven. Garlic softens and can be extracted from the cloves by squeezing the (root) end of the bulb, or individually by squeezing one end of the clove. In Korea, heads of garlic are heated {{over the course of several}} weeks; the resulting product, called black garlic, is sweet and syrupy, and is now being sold in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia.|$|E
