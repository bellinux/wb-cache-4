40|$|The project aims {{to improve}} {{positive}} <b>torque</b> <b>transient</b> response through more advanced wastegate controllers than what are used today. All controllers are developed for a standard General Motors turbocharged engine. In many turbocharged SI engines, a wastegate {{is used for}} preventing the turbine to overrun and to decrease the pumping loss. Today, the wastegate is controlled by a PI controller, which tries to fulfill a compromise between fuel consumption and torque response by regulating the wastegate position. A nonlinear Mean Value Engine Model (MVEM) of this engine, with 13 states and linearized in 45 different working points, is used. The original model, implemented in Matlab/Simulink, has been enriched with new features, like lambda and spark advance efficiencies and the related exhaust temperature correction. The project aims to do a theoretical analysis to find the optimal control of wastegate position, investigating also spark retard and fuel enrichment during a positive <b>torque</b> <b>transient.</b> First a solution for achieving optimal wastegate control is designed, based on Linear Quadratic (LQ) approach. Since the optimal control strategy is expected to vary quite much for different working points, a gain scheduling architecture has been investigated. An independent lambda controller has been developed, {{in order to maximize}} the lambda efficiency and quicken the <b>torque</b> response during <b>transient.</b> Since the system operates near a constraint boundary, another solution based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) of the wastegate has been investigated. The MPC design has been extended also to a MIMO formulation, adding the throttle and the air to fuel ratio as control inputs, and the trade off between fast torque response and fuel economy is analyzed. A complete realtime MPC implementation, with the capability for automatic code generation in the dSpace microAutobox environment, requires the model, now with 13 states, to be reduced to a minimum state space order. The extent of model reduction that is required and the possible performance deterioration have been investigated...|$|R

The experimental setup of the <b>transient</b> <b>torque</b> method {{is similar to that}} of the oscillation cup method. The melt sample is sealed inside a fused silica ampoule, and the ampoule is suspended by a long quartz fiber to form a torsional oscillation system. A rotating magnetic field is used to induce a rotating flow in the conductive melt, which causes the ampoule to rotate around its vertical axis. A sensitive angular detector is used to measure the deflection angle of the ampoule.

40|$|Abstract—Voltage sags are voltage {{reduction}} events, followed by {{restoration of the}} normal supply conditions after a short duration. Induction Motors (IMs) constitute {{a large portion of}} the loads in industrial power systems. The loss of their service in a continuous process plant (like a refinery) may result in a costly shutdown. The basic observed effects of voltage sags on induction motors are speed loss and current and <b>torque</b> <b>transients</b> associated with both {{voltage reduction}} and recovery. This paper will focus on the response of the IMs to various parameters of voltage sags; including magnitude, duration, effect of pre-sag voltage, loading percentage, point on the wave of sag occurrence, source harmonics, and three-phase unbalance. Other objectives of this study are to investigate the motors ride through capability during different types of voltage sags, and to establish guidelines for adjusting the protection relays of the IMs. The industrial electrical distribution system of Alexandria National Refining and Petrochemicals Co.

The concept was modelled around an existing baseline high-speed direct-injection diesel engine model featuring a variable-geometry turbocharger.

Attributes {{of particular importance}} to the application of brushless motors in the automotive sector, are considered e. g. implementation cost, accuracy of predictions during load transients, the impact of motor saliency and algorithm complexity. Emphasis is given to techniques based on model linearisation during each sampling period (EKF); feedback-linearisation followed by Luenberger observer design based on the resulting �linear� motor characteristics; and direct design of non-linear observers. Although the benefits of sensorless commutation of PMSMs have been well expounded in the literature, an integrated approach to their design for application to salient machines subject to load <b>torque</b> <b>transients</b> remains outstanding. Furthermore, this paper shows that the inherent characteristics of some non-linear observer structures are particularly attractive since they provide a phase-locked-loop (PLL) -type of configuration that can encourage stable rotor position estimation, thereby enhancing the overall sensorless scheme.

40|$|Randomly {{occurring}} <b>torque</b> <b>transients</b> {{have been}} detected in the reaction wheels of several spacecraft. The causes of the transients are presumably cage instabilities and oil jogs occurring in the ball bearings of the wheels. Within high precision pointing missions these disturbances significantly impair pointing-stability performance. Hence, {{the goal of this}} thesis is to investigate how the impact of wheels’ disturbance transients on the pointing performance parameters can be minimized through the implementation of dedicated control strategies. Eventually, the capabilities of the Precision Pointing Control Design tool developed by Airbus Defence and Space can be further extended and improved with respect to friction torque instabilities. The torque profiles generated by friction instabilities have been characterized by the means of a pseudo-power spectral density formalism allowing to analytically perform accurate pointing error analysis and evaluations, following the ECSS standard. Moreover, two different solutions have been investigated and implemented on a reference case study mission. While the first one consists in the optimization of the controller’s integral bandwidth with respect to the disturbance transients, the second solution considers the design of a wheel speed control loop. The implementation of an inner control loop nested in the global attitude control loop {{turns out to be the}} most promising strategy for handling disturbance transients. However, the research shows that angular rate sensors are a crucial element for the pointing performance and stability of the whole control loop. Therefore, at the end of the thesis, guidelines to further optimize the in-house control design tool and to characterize the pointing error sources analytically are presented. Additionally, in order to pave the way for a practical implementation of the wheel speed loop strategy, the specific requirements regarding the rate sensor that should be provided to the wheels’ manufacturer are discussed.

Cassini is a three-axis stabilized spacecraft. It uses reaction wheels to achieve high level of spacecraft pointing stability that is needed during imaging operations of several science instruments. The Cassini flight software makes in-flight estimates of reaction wheel bearing drag torque and made them available to the mission operations team. These telemetry data are being trended {{for the purpose of}} monitoring the long-term health of the reaction wheel bearings. Anomalous drag torque signatures observed over the past 15 years are described in this paper. One of these anomalous drag conditions is bearing cage instability that appeared (and disappeared) spontaneously and unpredictably. Cage instability is an uncontrolled vibratory motion of the bearing cage that can produce high-impact forces internal to the bearing that will cause intermittent and erratic <b>torque</b> <b>transients.</b> Characteristics of the observed cage instabilities and other drag torque "spikes" are described in this paper. In day-to-day operations, the reaction wheels' rates must be neither too high nor too low. To protect against operating the wheels in any undesirable conditions (such as prolonged low spin rate operations), a ground software tool named Reaction Wheel Bias Optimization Tool (RBOT) was developed for the management of the wheels.

40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} lower carbon dioxide {{emissions}} and fuel consumption drive technological developments for car manufacturers. One trend that has shown success for reducing fuel consumption in spark ignited engines is downsizing, where the engine size is reduced to save fuel and a turbocharger is added to maintain the power output. A drawback of this concept is the slower torque response of a turbocharged engine. Recent hardware improvements have facilitated the use of variable geometry turbochargers (VGT) for spark ignited engines, which can improve the transient torque response. This thesis addresses the transient torque response through three papers. Paper 1 presents the optimal control of the valve timing and VGT for a fast torque response. Optimal open-loop control signals are found by maximizing the torque integral for a 1 -d simulation model. From the optimization {{it is found that}} keeping the ratio between exhaust and intake pressure at a constant level gives a fast torque response. This can be achieved by feedback control using vgt actuation. The optimal valve timing differs very little from a fuel consumption optimal control that uses large overlap. Evaluation on an engine test bench shows improved torque response over the whole low engine speed range. In Paper 2, model based, nonlinear feedback controllers for the exhaust pressure are presented. First, the dynamic relation between requested VGT position and exhaust pressure is modeled. This model contains an estimation of the on-engine turbine flow map. Using this model, a controller based on inverting the input-output relation is designed. Simulations and measurements on the engine show that the controller handles the strong nonlinear characteristic of the system, maintaining both stability and performance over the engine’s operating range. Paper 3 considers the dependence of the valve timing for the cylinder gas exchange process and presents a torque model. A data-based modeling approach is used to find regressors, based on valve timing and pressures, that can describe the volumetric efficiency for several engine speeds. Utilizing both 1 -d simulations and measurements, a model describing scavenging is found. These two models combine to give an accurate estimation of the in-cylinder lambda, which is shown to improve the torque estimation. The models are validated on <b>torque</b> <b>transients,</b> showing good agreement with the measurements. QC 20120928 </p...|$|E

40|$|This work {{proposes to}} match the engine {{characteristics}} {{to the requirements of}} the Continuously Variable Transmission [CVT] powertrain. The normal process is to pair the transmission to the engine and modify its calibration without considering the full potential to modify the engine. On the one hand continuously variable transmissions offer the possibility to operate the engine closer to its best efficiency. They benefit from the high versatility of the effective speed ratio between the wheel and the engine to match a driver requested power. On the other hand, this concept demands slightly different qualities from the gasoline or diesel engine. For instance, a torque margin is necessary in most cases to allow for engine speed controllability and transients often involve speed and torque together. The necessity for an appropriate engine matching approach to the CVT powertrain is justified in this thesis and supported by a survey of the current engineering trends with particular emphasis on CVT prospects. The trends towards a more integrated powertrain control system are highlighted, as well as the requirements on the engine behaviour itself. Two separate research axes are taken to investigate low Brake Specific Fuel Consumption [BSFC] in the low speed region and <b>torque</b> <b>transient</b> respectively for a large V 8 gasoline engine and a turbocharged diesel V 6 engine. This work is based on suitable simulation environments established for both engines in the powertrain. The modelling exercises are aimed at supplying appropriate models that can be validated against experimental data. The simulation platforms developed then allow the investigation of CVT powertrain biased engine characteristics. The V 8 engine model in particular benefited from engine and vehicle dynamometer data to validate the model behaviour and the accuracy of the prediction. It benefited from the parallel work conducted on the Electrically Assisted Infinitely Variable Transmission [EASIVT] project in Cranfield University. The EASIVT vehicle is a parallel mild hybrid aimed at demonstrating the combined fuel economy benefits of a CVT technology and hybridisation. From the CVT powertrain requirements for fuel economy, BSFC operation can be further promoted in the low speed region if Noise Vibration and Harshness [NVH] counter-measures are developed. A study of the combustion torque oscillations at the crankshaft led to the elaboration of an Active Vibration Control [AVC] strategy for the hybrid Integrated Motor Generator [IMG]. Successful implementation of the strategy in both simulation and in-vehicle helped quantify the benefits and short comings of engine operation for best fuel economy. The development in parallel of the hybrid control functions for torque assist and regenerative braking made it possible to implement the low speed AVC in the vehicle without a driveability penalty. The V 6 TDI model yielded a realistic and representative simulation for the <b>transient</b> <b>torque</b> response improvement research to be undertaken. For that purpose, the model was tuned against full-load data and the air path control sub-systems were designed and calibrated similarly to a real application. The model was able to highlight the turbocharger lag issue associated with a large combined speed and <b>torque</b> <b>transient</b> inevitable in the fuel economy biased CVT powertrain. This study proposes a Manifold Air Injection [MAI] system in the intake of the engine to help breathing when the VGT operating conditions cannot be shifted rapidly enough for a manoeuvre. The system design constraints were analysed and a suitable strategy was elaborated and calibrated. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to demonstrate the influence of the MAI design and control variables on the engine performance in the CVT powertrain In conclusion, the benefits of the engine characteristic matching were highlighted in both cases. A review of the work achieved is available in the last chapter, including prospects for further improvements and investigations. The ideal engine characteristics for gasoline and diesel engine technologies integrated in a CVT powertrain are derived from the experience gathered in the research and the results obtained from the tests in low speed operation and <b>transient</b> <b>torque</b> control respectively for the gasoline and the diesel engines. The engine characteristics can be altered toward a better match with a CVT by the use of specific hardware and control strategy. This work recommends that a direct injected, variable valve actuated gasoline engine provides the ideal starting point for low fuel consumption powertrain. When integrated within a mild hybrid CVT powertrain, the full benefits are obtained with the use of low speed operation and AVC. If no electrical machine is available to torque assist the engine, then existing supercharging concepts for a downsized engine can be applied. Diesel engines can also be downsized because of their high torque density. Increased turbocharging boost levels allow steady state torque levels to be maintained in the downsizing process. The CVT powertrain can optimise the fuel consumption and emission levels by appropriate selection of the engine steady state operating points. The torque response lag then becomes critical for the CVT to control the engine speed. This can be improved by the use of Manifold air Injection to assist the turbocharger.

40|$|Among many {{technical}} innovations {{and improvements}} in power train technologies, engine downsizing (reduction in displacement volume and/or the number of cylinders) {{is one of the}} most effective methods to reduce fuel consumption. Engine downsizing is achieved by running with high levels of pressure boosting at full load using a supercharger or turbocharger. In order to downsize Diesel engines that are typically turbocharged, it is necessary to raise the boost level well above the capability of the single-stage boosting system. However, when the displacement of the engine is reduced substantially, its dependence on boosting system increases and it needs high boost pressure to produce enough torque for acceleration. Although very effective, some characteristics of the turbocharged engines remain unsatisfactory and matching a turbocharger to an engine to achieve efficient turbocharger operation over a wide range of engine speed is a difficult and often compromising process. This study presents a simulation-based methodology for dual-stage turbocharger matching, through an iterative procedure predicting optimal configurations of compressors and turbines for given operating conditions. Different types of boost control schemes for the dual-stage turbocharging system are evaluated for performance and fuel economy benefits. In order to further enhance the low end <b>torque</b> and <b>transient</b> characteristics of the downsized engine, hybrid dual-stage boosting systems are also investigated. The hybrid dual-stage boosting systems incorporate different types of boosting devices, such as a mechanically driven supercharger, an electrically driven supercharger, and a variable geometry turbine, into a dual-stage system with only turbochargers on both stages. The simulation results suggest that the hybridization of the boosting system results in fewer compromises in the boosting system matching resulting in substantial reduction in fuel consumption without too much compromise in performance. In addition, the assessment of the different types of dual-stage boosting systems presented in the study and the methodology used in the process provide valuable means to evaluate and develop a new boosting system that requires excellent low end <b>torque</b> and <b>transient</b> boosting characteristics as well as the fuel economy benefit from the downsized engine...|$|R

40|$|Viscosity of {{semiconductor}} and metallic melts {{is usually}} measured by oscillating cup method. This method utilizes the melts contained in vacuum sealed silica ampoules, thus the {{problems related to}} volatility, contamination, and high temperature and pressure can be alleviated. In a typical design, the time required for a single measurement is {{of the order of}} one hour. In order to reduce this time to a minute range, a high resolution (0. 05 arc. sec) angular detection system is implemented in our design of the viscometer. Furthermore, an electromagnet generating a rotational magnetic field (RMF) is incorporated into the apparatus. This magnetic field can be used to remotely and non intrusively measure the electrical conductivity of the melt. It {{can also be used to}} induce a well controlled rotational flow in the system. The transient behavior of this flow can potentially yield the viscosity of the fluid. Based on RMF implementation, two novel viscometry methods are proposed in this work: a) the <b>transient</b> <b>torque</b> method, b) the resonance method. A unified theoretical approach to the three methods (oscillating cup, <b>transient</b> <b>torque,</b> and resonance) is presented along with the initial test results of the constructed apparatus. Advantages of each of the method are discussed...|$|R
