Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E

25|$|In the {{language}} of tensor algebra, a particular tensor {{is associated with a}} particular shape with many lines projecting upwards and downwards, corresponding to abstract upper and lower indices of tensors respectively. Connecting lines between two shapes corresponds to contraction of indices. One advantage of this notation is <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not have to invent new letters for new indices. This notation is also explicitly basis-independent.|$|E
25|$|It {{also means}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> {{not need a}} {{sampling}} frame listing all elements in the target population. Instead, clusters can be chosen from a cluster-level frame, with an element-level frame created only for the selected clusters. In the example above, the sample only requires a block-level city map for initial selections, and then a household-level map of the 100 selected blocks, rather than a household-level map of the whole city.|$|E
25|$|Speech {{is planned}} in advance: speech errors like {{substitution}} and exchanges show <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not plan his/her entire sentence before s/he speaks. Rather, their language faculty is constantly tapped during the speech production process. This is {{accounted for by}} the limitation of the working memory. In particular, errors involving exchanges imply that one plans ahead in their sentence but only about significant ideas (e.g. the words that constitute the core meaning) and only to a certain extent of the sentence.|$|E

25|$|Chazal have {{in certain}} {{instances}} permitted intentional extra-vaginal ejaculation {{in tandem with}} one's wife. Tosefot cites the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak (Isaac ben Samuel) who permits an occasional complete extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife on condition <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not accustom himself to always doing so (Tosfoth, Yebamoth 34b, Tosfoth Sanhedrin 58b)). The Bayit Chadash (Yoel Sirkis) commentary to the Rabbeinu Asher (ibid.) explicitly permits this foreign ejaculation with Rabbeinu Asher siding with the tosafist opinion. This opinion is likewise quoted in Tur Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer ch. 25.|$|E
25|$|I owe {{a lot to}} R. B. Woodward. He {{showed me}} that one could attack {{difficult}} problems without {{a clear idea of}} their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E
25|$|However, all {{of these}} beliefs seem to still be viewed under very {{specific}} sets of morals and ethics. Such as <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not take themselves away, or deny the true past of hip hop (doing such would result in ignorance {{of the history of}} hip hop, and a completely disconnected community of fans who become uncertain as to what truly should be considered hip hop). Hip hop is also known to be the music of the oppressed (African Americans, Puerto Ricans and women) and activist based. Fans of more progressed Hip Hop have received both acclaim due to innovation and futuristic views, as well as strong criticism due to lack of proper education and what is felt as a completely changed form of values, rather than evolved.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they inquired along seven lines before they {{determined}} that a genital discharge rendered a man unclean. A discharge caused by one of these reasons did not render the man impure or subject him to bringing an offering. They asked: (1) about his food, (2) about his drink, (3) what he had carried, (4) whether he had jumped, (5) whether he had been ill, (6) what he had seen, and (7) whether he had obscene thoughts. It did not matter whether he had had thoughts before or after seeing a woman. Rabbi Judah taught that the discharge would not render him unclean if he had watched animals having intercourse or even if he merely saw a woman's dyed garments. Rabbi Akiva taught that the discharge would not render him unclean {{even if he had}} eaten any kind of food, good or bad, or had drunk any kind of liquid. The Sages exclaimed to Rabbi Akiva that according to his view, no more men would ever be rendered unclean by genital discharge. Rabbi Akiva replied <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not have an obligation to ensure that there exist men unclean because of a genital discharges.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{prayer is}} {{considered}} acceptable, but prayer with a quorum of ten adults—a minyan—is {{the most highly}} recommended form of prayer and is required for some prayers. An adult in this context means {{over the age of}} 12 or 13 (bat or bar mitzvah). Judaism had originally counted only men in the minyan for formal prayer, on the basis <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not count someone who is not obligated to participate. The rabbis had exempted women from almost all time-specific positive mitzvot (commandments), including those parts of the prayer that cannot be recited without a quorum, due to women in the past being bound up in an endless cycle of pregnancy, birthing and nursing from a very early age. Orthodox Judaism still follows this reasoning and excludes women from the minyan. Since 1973, Conservative congregations have overwhelmingly become egalitarian and count women in the minyan. A very small number of congregations that identify themselves as Conservative have resisted these changes and continue to exclude women from the minyan. Those Reform and Reconstructionist congregations that consider a minyan mandatory for communal prayer, count both men and women for a minyan. All denominations of Judaism except for Orthodox Judaism ordain female rabbis and cantors. In Orthodox Judaism, according to some authorities, women can count in the minyan for certain specific prayers, such as the Birchot HaGomel blessing, which both men and women are obligated to say publicly.|$|E
500|$|The same {{paper had}} {{received}} Keable's second novel, 1922's The Mother of All Living, favourably; reviewer Louise Maundell Fields called it [...] "Not only...better from an artistic {{point of view}} ... its general outlook is both steadier and more mature. [...] the book has in {{it so much that}} is well done and worth while <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not feel inclined to carp at its comparatively few weaknesses." [...] On the whole, other reviews were less favourable. The characters in both Peradventure and Recompense were criticised for lacking depth: reviewers said they served only as vehicles for conveying different theoretical points of view. A later book, 1927's Ann Decides, was dismissed succinctly by the Chicago Daily Tribune as [...] "tosh".|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the {{legitimate}} government had relocated to Iași, in besieged Moldavia. Late in 1916, it court-martialled Filitti in absentia, and {{sentenced him to}} death for the crime of high treason. By January 1918, the collapse of Russian forces on the Eastern Front led the Iași administration into negotiating a separate peace with the Central Powers. Germanophile Alexandru Marghiloman took over as Premier, in what seemed to spell a moral victory for the pro-German camp. However, Filitti was drawing closer to the more disgruntled Germanophiles, led by P. P. Carp, who wanted to sign peace on their own terms: [...] "I ask Carp, should he leave to negotiate for Romania, to take me with him. He says that he'll take along his son. I note <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not exclude the other. He agrees" [...] (January 12, 1918). Filitti was also upset that Marghiloman himself had not yet offered him a high diplomatic post during negotiations over the Buftea-Bucharest Peace Treaty, and noted that the Ententist King, Ferdinand I, [...] "made it hard" [...] {{for him to be}} accepted back into the diplomatic corps. As noted by Georgeta Filitti, Ferdinand vetoed successive proposals to rehire him as public servant.|$|E
