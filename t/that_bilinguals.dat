5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E
25|$|Language-nonselective {{access is}} the {{automatic}} co-activation {{of information in}} both linguistic systems. It implies that when a bilingual encounters a spoken or written word, the activation happens in both contextually appropriate and inappropriate linguistic subsystems. Also, there is evidence <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> take longer than monolinguals to detect non-words while in both bilingual and monolingual modes, providing evidence <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> do not fully inactivate their other language while in a monolingual mode.|$|E
25|$|Studies in {{this area}} {{generally}} compare the behaviour or brain activity in normally hearing monolingual speakers of an oral language, genetically deaf, native signers, and normally hearing bimodal bilinguals. With the use of functional Near-Infrared Imaging (fNIR), Kovelman (2009) compared the performance and brain activity of these three groups in picture-naming tasks. These researchers found that, although performance in all groups was similar, neuroimaging revealed <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> showed greater signal intensity within the posterior temporal regions (Wernicke's area) while using both languages in rapid alternation than when they were only using one language.|$|E

40|$|It {{is claimed}} <b>that</b> <b>bilingual</b> {{children}} have two separate linguistic systems from early ages. Over the past decades, linguists {{carried out a}} number of studies to test the validity of the claim. They explored bilingual children’s code-mixing in correlation with a variety of linguistic elements, such as lexicon, syntax, phonology in different contexts, concluding <b>that</b> <b>bilingual</b> children had separate linguistic system for each language. Although there were certain limitations in these studies, most of their results supported the statement...|$|R
25|$|As to {{structural}} plasticity {{induced by}} bilingualism, it {{has recently been}} shown <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals,</b> as compared to monolinguals, have increased grey matter density in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC is a brain structure that helps subjects to monitor their actions and {{it is part of}} the attentional and executive control system. Bilinguals have increased grey matter in this brain area because they continuously monitor their languages in order to avoid unwanted language interferences from the language not in use. The continuous use of the ACC in turn induces plastic neural effects. This may be the same reason why bilinguals are faster than monolinguals on many attentional control tasks.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the Dual Language System Hypothesis states <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> have a {{separate}} system for the L1 and L2 which they learn right from the start, so both languages can be acquired simultaneously. Research on vocabulary development have generally provided strong support for this theory. Monolingual children in early language development learn one term for each concept, so does a bilingual child, just that the bilingual child does so for both L1 and L2, and hence they know two language terms of the same concept that has similar meaning, which {{is also known as}} translational equivalents. The awareness of synonyms do not appear till a much later age. For example, they know that both 'two' in English and 'dos' in Spanish refer to the numerical number '2'.|$|E
25|$|The IC {{model is}} {{developed}} at large extent compatible with and complementary to the BIA model. This inhibitory control model {{focuses on the}} importance of task demands and regulation happened during language processing by modifying the levels of activation of items in language network. In this model, a key concept is the language task schema, which specifies the mental processing steps <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> take to perform a particular language task. The language task schema regulates the output from the word identification system by altering the activation levels of representations within that system and by inhibiting outputs from the system. For example, when a bilingual switches from one language to another in translation, a change in the language schema corresponding to much take place.|$|E

25|$|Spreading activation, {{a process}} where similar {{concepts}} are activated when their neighbors are activated, {{is a widely}} accepted model of lexical access. It {{has been shown in}} both bilingual and monolingual individuals, with bilinguals showing activation in both languages during language research tasks. Multiple studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> recognize cognate words more quickly than non-cognate words, especially identical cognates, which produce the strongest effect. These effects occurred even when the participants knew ahead of time what language the target words would be in. Despite the specific language contexts, both languages are activated, showing that lexical access is not language-specific and that top-down processing is important in lexical access. Findings suggest that the amount of activation that occurred cross-linguistically was related to the similarity between the translation equivalents of the languages.|$|E
2500|$|Many have {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> have weaker connections in their lexical representations than monolinguals (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, & Yang, 2010; Ameel, Malt, Storms, & Van Assche, 2009). [...] It {{is believed that}} this is because bilinguals get less practice with each language because they use each less often than a monolingual person uses their language, giving them half of the opportunity [...] "to receive feedback in each language" [...] and deepen their [...] "mappings between words and objects in each language" [...] (p.272).|$|E
2500|$|One {{possibility}} is <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> initially {{make a decision}} about the language of the word and then activate the appropriate language-selected lexicon. In this mechanism, an executive system directs the language switch for the input word. In earlier studies, researchers found <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> can comprehend passages composed of words entirely from only one language more quickly than passages composed of words from both languages. They explain this result as an involuntary switch that happens when bilinguals comprehend passages with two languages. When comprehension procedures in one language fail due to the language contextually changing, then the switch mechanism will automatically direct input to another language system. Therefore, bilinguals are slower at reading mixed language passages than at single language passages because they must spend time on switching languages. However, those studies failed to consider that the two languages might be activated simultaneously and there might be a later lexical competition in choosing which language information to use. The later lexical completion {{can also be used to}} explain why bilinguals spend more time understanding passages in mixed languages. [...] However, other studies have found that there is no significant cost incurred by inter-sentential language switching and mixing. showed that there was no cost to switching between languages when bilinguals read sentences for comprehension. Additionally, Guzzardo Tamargo, R.E. found that when making metalinguistic judgments and performing non-comprehension based tasks, switch costs were evident but there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that there is a cost at the switch site when bilinguals read a mixed sentence. This indicates that under normal circumstances and given sufficient linguistic context, language switching does not incur a cost.|$|E

40|$|Although Bilingual First Language Acquisition {{research}} has increased considerably {{over the past}} few decades, there is still much controversy regarding the rate of development, i. e. the question whether bilinguals lag behind their monolingual peers in various aspects of language. Some studies have found similar rates of development, whereas others have found <b>that</b> <b>bilingual</b> children lag behind their monolingual peers. The current study contributes to this discussion of (dis) similar rates of development by investigating bilingual children’s acquisition of German complex sentence constructions involving adverbial clauses (ACs). Our findings are consistent with usage-based approaches to language acquisition, which predict <b>that</b> <b>bilingual</b> acquisition should proceed slower due to learners having less exposure, on average, to each language...|$|R
2500|$|People {{were once}} {{concerned}} that {{being exposed to}} more than one language would be confusing and cause bilinguals to lag behind their monolingual peers in language development, but multiple researchers have refuted this claim. Bilinguals appear to acquire the same milestones—including when they say their first word, when they say their first telegraphic phrase, and when they obtain a vocabulary of fifty words—within the [...] "normal range of variation" [...] of monolingual development in each language. This is an analysis of overall vocabulary in bilinguals, as this is the more accurate and appropriate measure of language development in bilinguals. Analyzing only one of a bilingual individual's languages would seriously underestimate their true vocabulary knowledge. Note that any vocabulary deficits in one language are likely filled by knowledge in the other language, suggesting a likelihood <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> know more vocabulary words than monolinguals in general. To this effect, researchers emphasize the importance of assessing overall vocabulary in bilinguals because assessing only one is an underestimation of their true knowledge, and when assessed in overall vocabulary bilingual children were no different from monolingual children in terms of language development.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} whether the presentation of words in a sentence context restricts lexical access to words of the target language only are most studied in bilinguals' second language (L2) processing. This sentence context effect might be an efficient strategy to speed up lexical search, because it reduces the number of lexical candidates. For example, Elston-Guttler et al. showed that cross-lingual activation is very sensitive {{to the influence of}} a sentence context and previous activation state of the two languages in a semantic priming study. In their study, German-English bilinguals were presented with relatively low-constraint sentences in which a homograph (e.g., The woman gave her friend a pretty GIFT; gift means poison in German) or a control word was presented at the end (e.g., The woman gave her friend a pretty SHELL). [...] "Constraint" [...] means {{the degree to which the}} sentence frame preceding the target word biased that word. The sentence was then replaced by a target word (poison) for lexical decision task. They found that only for participants who saw a German film prior to experiment and only in the first block of the experiment, participants could recognize the target faster after primed with the related homograph sentence than primed with the controlled sentence. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> can quickly [...] "zoom into" [...] the L2 processing situation even the L1 activation was boosted.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the history}} of {{research}} into the cognitive advantages of bilingualism, views have shifted from a subtractive to an additive perspective; that is from believing <b>that</b> being <b>bilingual</b> detracts from one's abilities, to believing <b>that</b> being <b>bilingual</b> adds to an individual's abilities.|$|R

50|$|Some {{take issue}} with methodology. Virginia Valian asserts that the {{correlations}} between bilingualism and executive function are inconsistent, {{largely due to the}} fact that executive function is not uniformly defined and that different tasks contribute to executive function. Because some of these tasks are available to monolinguals and bilinguals may similarly participate in these tasks to varying degrees, she argues <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> cannot be assumed superior to monolinguals in executive function. She also notes <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> are not consistently better at all executive function tasks.|$|E
5000|$|Before the 1960s, {{research}} on bilingual individuals was varied. There was a specific pattern of conclusions, namely that being bilingual was detrimental to a child's linguistic and cognitive development, {{and that it}} put the individual at a disadvantage compared to monolingual peers. The general opinion was <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> would have smaller vocabularies, stunted cognitive abilities and that children learning two languages from a young age would be spending too much of their energy differentiating and building the two languages to become competent in either one. Studies referred to the topic as the [...] "problem of bilingualism" [...] or the [...] "handicapping influence of bilingualism" [...] and reported <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> performed worse in IQ tests and suffered in most aspects of language development.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Paap and Greenberg assert <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> are not {{necessarily}} superior at executive processing. They assess their sample as similar in confounding variables and found {{that not only was}} there not evidence supporting an advantage for bilinguals, but that, if anything, the evidence would argue against this.|$|E
50|$|Supporters {{argue that}} the {{bilingualism}} resulting from early acquisition of another language is of general intellectual benefit and helps children to learn still other languages.

50|$|Ellen Bialystok {{has done}} {{extensive}} {{research into the}} cognitive advantages of bilingualism. In several studies, she has shown <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> outperformed their peers in tasks measuring executive function, suggesting that being bilingual gives the individual an advantage of better control of attention and therefore facilitates processing and functioning in several cognitive tasks.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} found <b>that</b> <b>Bilinguals</b> are more {{susceptible}} to the tip of the tongue, in cases where the phonology of a word is different in both languages. For example, when recalling a word such as [...] "hair" [...] in English, there is more interference from the French word [...] "cheveux", because they sound and are spelled differently. However, when a word is phonologically similar in both languages, bilinguals produce less errors than individuals who are monolingual. For example, the word [...] "chocolate" [...] is similar to the translated word in French, which is [...] "chocolat". Overall, bilinguals experience the tip of the tongue phenomenon more than individuals who are monolingual. This is confirmed by the evidence <b>that</b> <b>bilinguals</b> are less able to recall words, or initiate representations of words that are different in each language.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond {{this general}} {{advantage}} to cognitive development seen in bilinguals, there is remarkable evidence for an advantage regarding executive control {{in particular -}} specifically in cases where multiple components of this executive control is required for perform a task.
