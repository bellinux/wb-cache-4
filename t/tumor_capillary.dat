40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} effects of hydroxy {{safflower}} yellow A (HSYA) on <b>tumor</b> <b>capillary</b> angiogenesis in transplanted human gastric adenocarcinoma BGC- 823 tumors in nude mice. MethodsBGC- 823 cells were injected subcutaneously into the right anterior armpit of nude mice to establish an animal model of transplanted tumors. After 24 h, 18 nude mice injected with tumor cells were randomized into model, control, and HSYA 0. 028 g/L groups, with six mice in each group. Transplanted tumors were excised on day 20. Tumor inhibition ratios were calculated for the transplanted tumors. Pathological changes and capillary angiogenesis in the tumors were observed by light microscopy. ResultsTumors in the model group grew more quickly than those in the control and HSYA groups, with inhibition ratios of 48 % and 30 %, respectively. The microvessel count in the HSYA group was lower than in the model group (P< 0. 01), and microvessel density was also lower in the HSYA group (P< 0. 05). Pathological changes were more obvious in tumors in the model group compared to the HSYA group. ConclusionHSYA inhibits the growth of transplanted BGC- 823 tumors, and its effects on <b>tumor</b> <b>capillary</b> angiogenesis may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for this antineoplastic effect...|$|E

PN's feature a unique design where a single PEG polymer surrounds a short fluorochrome and radiometal bearing peptide, and endows the resulting nanoprobe with pharmacokinetic control (based on molecular weight of the PEG selected) and optical tunability (based on the fluorochrome selected), while the chelate provides a radiolabeling option. PN's were used to image brain capillary angiography (intravital 2 -photon microscopy), <b>tumor</b> <b>capillary</b> permeability (intravital fluorescent microscopy), and the tumor enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (111 In-PN and SPECT).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{photodynamic}} therapy on the tumor microvas-culature {{in the first}} few hours after treatment was studied, at the light and electron microscopy levels. BALB/c mice with EMT- 6 tumor received ip injections of hematoporphyrin derivative, chlorin, or phthalocyanine, and 24 hours later, the tumors were treated with light at 100 J/cm 2 at the ap-propriate therapeutic wavelength for each photosensltizer. Animals were killed and their tumors removed at time 0, 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours after treatment The results indicate that for all three sensitizers the effects of photodynamic therapy leading to rapid necro-sis of tumor tissue are not the result of direct tumor cell kill but are secondary to destruction of the tumor microvas-culature.

40|$|The angiogenic {{phenotype}} {{is associated}} with increased tumor neovascularization and a state of vascular hyperpermeability to macromolecules.

The current investigation evaluated a potential drug interaction between the angiogenesis inhibitor O-(N-chloroacetyl-carbamoyl) -fumagillol (TNP- 470) and the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), in xenograft models that differentially expressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a driving force for angiogenesis.

40|$|Targeting tumors with antibody-based {{therapeutics}} is {{a complex}} task presenting multiple kinetic barriers. Antibody internalization and clearance inhibit uptake both in solid tumors, limited by tu-mor vascular permeability, and in micrometastases, limited by diffusion. Methods: A modeling exercise is used to introduce 2 simple criteria that must be less than unity for saturation of both tumors and micrometastases. The clearance modulus and the Thiele modulus are ratios of the plasma clearance rate and antibody catabolism, respectively, to the tumor tissue pene-tration rate. Results: Even low rates of antigen internalization from constitutive membrane turnover can significantly retard an-tibody penetration. Rapid clearance of single-chain variable frag-ments also hinders uptake, often more than counterbalancing their more rapid extravasation and diffusion.

40|$|Every {{year in the}} US, 20, 000 new {{primary and}} nearly 200, 000 metastatic brain tumor cases are reported. The {{cerebral}} microvessels/ capillaries that form the blood–brain barrier (BBB) not only protect the brain from toxic agents in the blood but also pose a significant hindrance to the delivery of small and large therapeutic molecules. Different strategies have been employed to circumvent the physiological barrier posed by blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB). Studies in our laboratory have identified {{significant differences in the}} expression levels of certain genes and proteins between normal and brain <b>tumor</b> <b>capillary</b> endothelial cells.

We also showed that DCE-MRI metric of tissue vessel perfusion-permeability is sensitive to changes in blood vessel permeability following administration of calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channel activator NS- 1619. Our results show that human gliomas and brain tumor endothelial cells that overexpress BKCa channels can be targeted for increased BTB permeability for MRI enhancing agents to brain tumors.

Furthermore, we examined ZR 75 - 1 tumors by functional CT-scanning (fCT) to determine changes in parameters related to <b>tumor</b> <b>capillary</b> transfer constants and vascular volume fraction in response to antiestrogenic manipulations. The vascular resistance decreased significantly from 42. 7 to 20. 8 mmHg × min × g × ml‡ 1 (P<. 03) on day 9 after estrogen withdrawal, but not after 9 days of tamoxifen treatment. The estrogendepleted tumors were significantly smaller than controls on day 9. There {{was no difference in}} nutrient consumption or vascular density in any of the experimental groups compared to controls. fCT showed an increase (P <. 03) in vascular volume fraction during tumor growth, this parameter was significantly lower after estrogen withdrawal when compared to controls (P <. 05). Vascular resistance correlated with tumor size (R = 0. 7, P <. 0001), indicating that vascular resistance increases during tumor growth. The changes in vascular parameters after estrogen withdrawal indicate a vascular remodeling effect. This inhibition of vascular development by hormone deprivation may have important implications for future planning of multimodal treatment regimens...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Metastatic {{melanoma}} lesions experienced marked regression after systemic targeted alpha {{therapy in}} a phase 1 clinical trial. This unexpected response was ascribed to tumor antivascular alpha therapy (TAVAT), in which effective tumor regression {{is achieved by}} killing endothelial cells (ECs) in <b>tumor</b> <b>capillaries</b> and, thus, depriving cancer cells of nutrition and oxygen. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to quantitatively analyze the therapeutic efficacy and safety of TAVAT by building up the testing Monte Carlo microdosimetric models. Methods: Geant 4 was adapted to simulate the spatial nonuniform distribution of the alpha emitter 213 Bi. The intraluminal model was designed to simulate the background dose to normal tissue capillary ECs from the nontargeted activity in the blood. The perivascular model calculates the EC dose from the activity bound to the perivascular cancer cells. The key parameters are the probability of an alpha particle traversing an EC nucleus, the energy deposition, the lineal energy transfer, and the specific energy. These results were then applied to interpret the clinical trial. Cell survival rate and therapeutic gain were determined. Results: The specific energy for an alpha particle hitting an EC nucleus in the intraluminal and perivascular models is 0. 35 and 0. 37 Gy, respectively. As the average probability of traversal in these models is 2. 7 % and 1. 1 %, the mean specific energy per decay drops to 1. 0 cGy and 0. 4 cGy, which demonstrates that the source distribution has a significant impact on the dose. Using the melanoma clinical trial activity of 25 mCi, the dose to tumor EC nucleus is found to be 3. 2 Gy and to a normal capillary EC nucleus to be 1. 8 cGy. These data give a maximum therapeutic gain of about 180 and validate the TAVAT concept. Conclusions: TAVAT can deliver a cytotoxic dose to <b>tumor</b> <b>capillaries</b> without being toxic to normal tissue capillaries...|$|R

40|$|Growth of tumors and {{metastasis}} are processes {{known to}} require neovascularization. To ascertain {{the participation of}} the endogenous angiogenic inhibitor thrombospondin- 1 (TSP 1) in tumor progression, we generated mammary tumor-prone mice that either lack, or specifically overexpress, TSP 1 in the mammary gland. Tumor burden and vasculature were significantly increased in TSP 1 -deficient animals, and <b>capillaries</b> within the <b>tumor</b> appeared distended and sinusoidal. In contrast, TSP 1 overexpressors showed delayed tumor growth or lacked frank tumor development (20 % of animals); <b>tumor</b> <b>capillaries</b> showed reduced diameter and were less frequent. Interestingly, absence of TSP 1 resulted in increased association of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with its receptor VEGFR 2 and higher levels of active matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP 9), a molecule previously shown to facilitate both angiogenesis and tumor invasion. In vitro, enzymatic activation of proMMP 9 was suppressed by TSP 1. Together these results argue for a protective role of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis in tumor growth and implicate TSP 1 in the in vivo regulation of metalloproteinase- 9 activation and VEGF signaling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB) impedes the {{delivery}} of therapeutic agents to brain tumors. While adequate delivery of drugs occurs in systemic tumors, the BTB limits delivery of anti-tumor agents into brain metastases. Results In this study, we examined the function and regulation of calcium-activated potassium (K Ca) channels in a rat metastatic brain tumor model. We showed that intravenous infusion of NS 1619, a K Ca channel agonist, and bradykinin selectively enhanced BTB permeability in brain tumors, but not in normal brain. Iberiotoxin, a K Ca channel antagonist, significantly attenuated NS 1619 -induced BTB permeability increase. We found K Ca channels and bradykinin type 2 receptors (B 2 R) expressed in cultured human metastatic brain tumor cells (CRL- 5904, non-small cell lung cancer, metastasized to brain), human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human lung cancer brain metastasis tissues. Potentiometric assays demonstrated the activity of K Ca channels in metastatic brain tumor cells and HBMEC. Furthermore, we detected higher expression of K Ca channels in the metastatic brain tumor tissue and <b>tumor</b> <b>capillary</b> endothelia as compared to normal brain tissue. Co-culture of metastatic brain tumor cells and brain microvessel endothelial cells showed an upregulation of K Ca channels, which {{may contribute to the}} overexpression of K Ca channels in tumor microvessels and selectivity of BTB opening. Conclusion These findings suggest that K Ca channels in metastatic brain tumors may serve as an effective target for biochemical modulation of BTB permeability to enhance selective delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to metastatic brain tumors. </p...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that hypoxic tumor cells are {{resistant}} to radiation and that increasing tumor oxygen levels via laser-mediated hyperthermia treatment increases tumor cell radiosensitivity. Hence, studies of the effects of laser irradiation on tumor oxygen levels are of great interest, as they allow for the optimization of hyperthermia treatment. Accordingly, the main purpose of this experiment was to develop a finite element model to simulate the heat transfer due to laser irradiation of tumor tissue, the blood flow through a <b>tumor</b> <b>capillary,</b> and the effect of changing temperature on blood flow rates and oxygen delivery to tumor tissue. This was achieved by using finite element models in COMSOL Multiphysics. We employed two geometries based on those used in a simliar study by He et al. [1]: a tumor-containing breast model to simulate laser heating of the tissue and a capillary and tumor tissue model to simulate the effect of heating on blood flow and tissue oxygen concentration. By plotting partial pressure of oxygen as a function of radius at three different points in the tissue, we observed that the oxygen concentration was greatest near the inlet and lowest near the outlet (as expected), and that at all points in the tissue, heating increased the tissue oxygen partial pressure to about the same extent (0. 75 – 1 mm Hg). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses suggested ambient air cooling at the breast surface to be ideal and a laser intensity of 18000 W/m 2 to be optimal for hyperthermia treatment. The model we developed was validated by comparison to a similar model and has potential for use in future studies on optimization of hyperthermia treatment. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of human MDR 1 P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in the capillary endothelial {{cells of the}} central nervous system has been demonstrated. The brain capillary endothelial cells maintain the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier. Recently, the human MDR 1 Pgp (and its mouse homologue MDR 1 a Pgp) has been shown to function as an important part of this barrier, pumping out xenobiotics from endothelial cells into the lumen of capillaries resulting in the protection of the brain parenchyma. To examine whether the endothelial cells of the newly formed capillaries during neoangiogenesis within malignant human brain tumors express MDR 1 Pgp, 35 adult surgical brain tumor specimens (29 gliomas and 6 tumors metastatic to the brain) were obtained from previously untreated patients and studied by a new immunohistochemical sandwich method developed in our laboratory using the JSB- 1 monoclonal antibody. JSB- 1 is specific for the Pgp product of the human MDR 1 (and not MDR 3) gene. This sensitive method allows the detection of Pgp in capillary endothelial cells of normal brain in conventional paraffin sections after formalin fixation. The endothelial cells of the newly formed capillaries in 25 of 29 gliomas (86 %) and 3 of 6 metastatic tumors, immunostained positive for MDR 1 Pgp. The tumor cells in 7 of 35 cases were also positive for Pgp. In the 35 brain tumor cases investigated, the endothelial cells were Pgp positive in the tumor-brain border and in the brain further from the <b>tumor.</b> <b>Capillary</b> endothelial cells of neovasculature in 137 malignant tumors (non-brain) obtained from previously untreated patients showed no MDR 1 Pgp expression. These results demonstrated that MDR 1 Pgp is expressed not only in the capillaries of normal brain but also in the majority of the newly formed capillaries of brain tumors. Multidrug resistance of brain tumors may result not only from the {{expression of}} resistance markers in neoplastic cells but also from the MDR 1 Pgp expression in endothelial cells of tumor capillaries.

Under certain culture conditions, however, alpha-sm actin expression has also been described in EC. In order to further investigate to what extent pericytes/VSMC participate in MVP in GBM, we performed an immunohistochemical study at both the light and electron microscopic levels with anti-alpha-sm actin, with an antibody against EC (EN- 4) and with an antibody recently described to react with "activated" pericytes in conditions with neovascularization (anti-high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen).

40|$|Background: MRI-guided {{transcutaneous}} biopsy {{is recommended}} for histologic confirmation in cases where MR-mammography detects a suspicious breast lesion that cannot be detected by any other imaging modality. In these cases imaging-histologic correlation is necessary to ensure lesion sampling. In all patients with discordant imaging findings and histology, repeat percutaneous biopsy should be contemplated. To minimize the rate of repeated biopsies, it is desirable to have a verifiable method for reliable correlation of imaging findings and histopathologic parameters. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the capillary density of breast lesions using the markers D 2 - 40, CD 31, and CD 34 and to correlate <b>tumor</b> <b>capillary</b> density with enhancement on magnetic resonance mammography. Material and Methods: 41 malignant and 25 benign breast lesions were included. MR-mammographies were performed on a 1. 5 -Tesla MR-imager. The time course of MR signal intensities was determined. Enhancement one minute after contrast medium administration was determined in the tumor (T 1 /T 0 ratio) and surrounding tissue (T 1 /T 1 -fat ratio). Capillary density was determined using immunohistologic staining with D 2 - 40, CD 31, and CD 34. Mean vessels numbers were calculated. Mean capillary densities were correlated with contrast enhancement in the tumor and surrounding breast tissue using two-tailed Spearman’s rho. Results: The number of vessels identified by staining with D 2 - 40 and CD 31 did not correlate with tumor enhancement (D 2 - 40 : r=- 0. 188, p= 0. 130; CD 31 : r= 0. 095, p= 0. 448). For vessels stained with CD 34, there was a significant correlation between capillary density and tumor enhancement (CD 34 : r= 0. 259, p= 0. 035). In the surrounding tissue of breast lesions no significant correlation between capillary density and contrast enhancement was found for any of the investigated immunohistochemical stains (D 2 - 40 : r=- 0. 233, p= 0. 149; CD 31 : r= 0. 102, p= 0. 533; CD 34 : r= 0. 266, p= 0. 097).

Materials and methods: The growth-inhibitory effect of AE was investigated in four different cell types: CaSki (HPV- 16 positive), HeLa (HPV- 18 positive), hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG 2), and human dermal fibroblast cells (HDFs). The cell viabilities and IC 50 values of AE were determined in cells incubated with AE for different lengths of time. To conduct studies in vivo, female BALB/c nude mice (aged 6 &ndash; 7 weeks, weighing 20 &ndash; 25 g) were used. A cervical cancer-derived cell line (CaSki) with integrated HPV- 16 DNA was injected subcutaneously (1 &times; 107 cells/ 200 &micro;L) in the middle dorsum of each animal (HPV group). One week after injection, mice were fed orally with AE crude extract at either 300 or 3000 mg/kg body weight/day for 14 or 28 days (HPV-AE groups). Tumor microvasculature and capillary vascularity were determined using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Tumor tissue was collected from each mouse to evaluate tumor histology and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) immunostaining. Results: The time-response curves of AE and the dose-dependent effect of AE on growth inhibition were determined. After a 48 -hour incubation period, the IC 50 of AE in CaSki was discovered to be significantly different from that of HDFs (P &lt; 0. 05). A microvascular network was observed around the tumor area in the HPV group on days 21 and 35. <b>Tumor</b> <b>capillary</b> vascularity in the HPV group was significantly increased compared with the control group (P &lt; 0. 001).

40|$|Chemotherapy {{effectiveness}} {{not only}} depends on drug penetration extent in target tissues or tumor cells, but {{also depends on}} drug suppression extent by the normal tissues and cells. Ultrasound acts as {{an important role to}} meet this requirement in drug delivery of chemotherapy in recent years. The popular methods are micro bubbles and HIFU (high intensity focused ultrasound). In this thesis, we developed a method using ultrasound radiation force to ?push? the drug penetrate into tumor cells. The capillaries' walls in tumor are different from normal capillaries' ones. The space between cells of <b>tumor</b> <b>capillary</b> wall is quite big due to the aggressive growing. So drug can easily leak to interstitium and reach the pressure low difference besides capillaries wall. Which implicates that drug cannot travel too far from the blood vessel, only few tumor cells close to the blood vessels are exposed to the drug. Our study is addressing this issue. In our experiment, the tumor is placed at the focus of transducer and the radiation force in focus will build the bigger difference pressure besides capillaries walls and ?push? the drug from capillaries into tumor cells. But the radiation force must be controlled not too high to burn out the tumor. So in order to produce suitable radiation force or intensity in focus to improve drug transport, transducer simulation and design is the first important. In this thesis, many parameters of transducer such as center frequency, aperture size, beamwidth, depth of focus and so on are simulated. Transducer efficiency, thermal effect were measured. In the experiment, their combinational effect was applied. Ultrasonix 4 DL 14 - 5 / 38 probe, Sonix MDP scanner, software Forwardsim[1], hydrophone, thermal meter were used in this project. Center frequency, aperture size, beamwidth, depth of focus and ultrasound field are simulated by Forwardsim[1]. This software is quite powerful and developed mainly by Johannes Kvam and can simulate transducer ultrasound field in many aspects. Transducer efficiency was measured by hydrophone. Heating effect was measured with thermal meter and thermal camera. A final experiment conditions are decided based on the simulation and measurement results: 8 MHz center frequency, 14. 4 mm* 5 mm aperture size, 10 cycles pulse length, 18 V input power, 10 KHz PRF (pulse repeat frequency), 10 minutes therapy time and so on(see table 4. 3). The experiment was carried on 7 mice being anesthetized and injected with drug or nanoparticles. Plastic glove filled with water was used as propagation medium.

40|$|Brain tumor-associated {{cerebral}} edema arises because <b>tumor</b> <b>capillaries</b> lack normal {{blood-brain barrier}} function; vascular permeability factor (VPF, {{also known as}} vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF) is a likely mediator of this phenomenon. Clinically, dexamethasone reduces brain tumor-associated vascular permeability through poorly understood mechanisms. Our goals were to determine if suppression of permeability by dexamethasone might involve inhibition of VPF action or expression, and if dexamethasone effects in this setting are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In two rat models of permeability (peripheral vascular permeability induced by intradermal injection of 9 L glioma cell-conditioned medium or purified VPF, and intracerebral vascular permeability induced by implanted 9 L glioma), dexamethasone suppressed permeability in a dose-dependent manner. Since 80 % of the permeability-inducing activity in 9 L-conditioned medium was removed by anti-VPF antibodies, we examined dexamethasone effects of VPF expression in 9 L cells. Dexamethasone inhibited FCS- and PDGF-dependent induction of VPF expression. At all levels (intradermal, intracranial, and cell culture), dexamethasone effects were reversed by the GR antagonist mifepristone (RU 486).

The reprogrammed phenotype was accompanied by enhanced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. The pro-angiogenesis factor VEGF was down-regulated and in vivo the number of CD 31 -positive <b>tumor</b> <b>capillaries</b> was also reduced.

40|$|The high {{incidence}} of prostate cancer, combined with downstaging at diagnosis and the slow natural progression of the disease, has made its management a complex and controversial issue. Endorectal MRI is emerging as the most accurate imaging modality for the local anatomic assessment of prostate cancer. This dissertation assesses the value of current State-of-the-Art endorectal MRI in clinical practice and discusses {{the promise of the}} modality for improving prostate cancer management. MR images allow noninvasive assessment of the local extent of prostate cancer (including organ-confinement, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node metastasis) and can provide an indication of tumor aggressiveness based on signal intensity; thus MRI can assist in local staging and assessment of recurrence-free probabilities while providing surgeons with a visual road-map for optimal treatment planning. MRSI of the prostate depicts the altered metabolism associated with prostate cancer. The addition of 1 H MRSI to MRI has further improved the accuracy of MR imaging in prostate cancer staging. It may become possible to use MRI/ 1 H MRSI to achieve more precise stratification of patients in clinical trials, to monitor the progress of patients who select watchful waiting or minimally aggressive cancer therapies, and to guide and assess emerging local prostate cancer therapies. The second part of this dissertation illustrates the potential clinical applicat! ion of color-coded parameter imaging derived from postprocessing of dynamic multiphasic gadolinium-enhanced MRI (DMGE-MRI) of abdominal tumors. With more refined techniques, such as high-field imaging, and with more experienced readers and more uniform image interpretation, the MR imagingâ€“MR spectroscopy approach will have a tremendous capacity to improve patient care. Chapter 2 shows that MR findings (from endorectal MRI or combined endorectal MRI/MRSI) contribute significant incremental value to clinical staging nomograms in the prediction of organ-confined prostate cancer (OCPC) in all risk groups (low, intermediate, and high). The incorporation of endorectal MR imaging into future staging nomograms for the prediction of OCPC may therefore be warranted, particularly since clinical staging in the current staging nomograms is based only on digital rectal examination. Moreover, unlike MRI, the staging nomograms cannot assist in the localization of ECE, which is critical for optimal treatment planning. It is worth noting that in the study, the accuracy of radiologists' predictions of OCPC was higher in the combined MR group (MRI+MRSI) than in the endorectal MR imaging. Chapter 3 indicates that endorectal MR imaging findings are significant presurgical predictors of extracapsular extension (ECE) in patients with prostate cancer and add incremental value to clinical variables. At univariate analysis, all variables were associated with ECE. At ROC univariate analysis, endorectal MR imaging findings had the largest area under the ROC curve. At multivariate analysis, serum PSA level, greatest percentage of cancer in all core biopsy specimens, and endorectal MR imaging findings were predictors of ECE. A model containing endorectal MR imaging findings had a significantly larger area under the ROC curve than a model containing only clinical variables. In addition, endorectal MR imaging findings are spatially localized, and therefore, unlike clinical variables, they have the potential to allow tailored treatment modifications. Chapter 4 demonstrates that endorectal MR imaging findings can be significant predictors for ECE in patients with prostate cancer, after controlling for PSA level, Gleason score, greatest percentage of cancer in all core biopsy specimens, percentage of cancer-positive core specimens in all core biopsy specimens, PNI, and clinical stage of tumor. A comparison of the ROC curves drawn from the results of readings performed by genitourinary MR imaging radiologists and general body MR imaging radiologists showed that endorectal MR imaging findings added value to all other predictor variables only when MR images were interpreted by genitourinary MR imaging radiologists. In the genitourinary radiologist group endorectal MR imaging findings displayed a combination of sensitivity and specificity that was superior to that of all other predictors tested. In the general body radiologist group, however, the combination of sensitivity and specificity of endorectal MR imaging findings was! {{similar to that of the}} clinical predictors. Advances in technology and in the expertise of radiologists dedicated to the genitourinary field suggest that endorectal MR imaging could play an increasingly useful role in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. Chapter 5 shows that endorectal MRI findings can contribute significant incremental value to the Kattan nomogram for predicting SVI. On both univariate and multivariate analysis, endorectal MRI findings were a significant presurgical predictor of seminal vesicle invasion. Chapter 6 shows that a PACS cross-referencing tool allows radiologists to more accurately interpret prostate MR imaging, improving prostate cancer tumor staging by MRI. In the detection of ECE and SVI, radiologists performed substantially better when using MRI with PACS cross-referencing rather than MRI alone. PACS cross- referencing is particularly helpful in displaying the junction of the seminal vesicles and the central zone of the prostate. Chapter 7 describes a study showing that incorporation of the Partin nomogram results with MRI findings regarding both extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion improves the MR prediction of LNM in patients with prostate cancer. The study confirmed that MRI has a high negative predictive value and an exceptionally high specificity in the prediction of LNM compared with clinical and histological variables. As MRI also provides anatomical information that is useful in treatment planning, it could potentially be used along with the Partin nomogram to determine whether additional imaging with lymphotropic superparamagnetic nanoparticles is indicated. Chapter 8 shows that review of preoperative MRI findings significantly improves the surgeon's decision to preserve or resect the NVB(s) during radical prostatectomy. Preoperative MRI improved surgical planning in high-risk patients and provided appropriate reassurance for preserving the NVB(s) in other patients. The strength of MRI for low-risk and intermediate-risk patients lies in a high negative predictive value (i. e., demonstration of the absence of tumor in the region of interest). Chapter 9 shows that the addition of MRI findings significantly improves the accuracy of the Kattan pre- operative nomogram in predicting postoperatively determined recurrence-free probabilities in the total study cohort and in a subset of patients (PSAÂ³ 10, Gleason score Â³ 7 on biopsy or clinical stage T 2) at high risk for biochemical recurrence. Chapter 10 discusses a study demonstrating that MRI has potential in the noninvasive assessment of prostate cancer biological aggressiveness. First, there is a significant correlation between prostate cancer Gleason grade and tumor-to-muscle signal intensity ratio on T 2 -weighted MR images; a higher Gleason grade is associated with a lower tumor-to-muscle signal intensity ratio. Second, on T 2 - weighted MR images, Gleason grade 3 cancer in the transition zone has a significantly lower tumor-to-muscle signal intensity ratio than Gleason grade 3 cancer in the peripheral zone of the prostate. Chapter 11 is restricted to current reviews of major topics in radiology and brief case reports on postprocessing of dynamic multiphasic gadolinium-enhanced MRI (DMGE-MRI) of the abdominal tumors. Post-processing of dynamic multiphasic gadolinium-enhanced MRI (DMGE-MRI) of the abdomen allows the generation of color-coded parameter images and time-intensity curves that provide new opportunities for research and for improving the detection, staging and therapeutic monitoring of disease and the development of anti- tumor drugs. First, on the basis of pharmacokinetic modeling, the color-coded parameter images and time-intensity curves contribute to a better understanding of tumor enhancement patterns and angiogenesis, and hence may result in improved quantitative characterization of tumors. Second, the mechanisms behind the differential signal enhancement of dynamic multiphasic gadolinium- enhanced MRI (DMGE-MRI) are thought to include differences in tumor perfusion and the level! s of <b>tumor</b> <b>capillary</b> wall permeability and hydrostatic pressure. Third, the time-intensity curves and only a small number of parameters need to be displayed as color-coded parameter images on a workstation. These robust parameters include: 1) relative enhancement; 2) wash-in rate; 3) wash-out rate; 4) brevity of enhancement. In Chapter 12, the results of all the studies mentioned above are discussed in relation to one another and to the current literature. Recommendations for clinical practice are made. CONCLUSIONS The following overall conclusions can be made: 1. In patients with prostate cancer, endorectal MR imaging non- invasively improves pretreatment staging and treatment planning and the evaluation of recurrence-free probabilities; it can also provide an indication of cancer aggressiveness. 2. The incorporation of endorectal MR findings into future nomograms for the prediction of prostate cancer stage and freedom from biochemical recurrence is warranted. 3. Advances in technology, such as a PACS cross-referencing tool, and in the expertise of radiologists dedicated to the genitourinary field suggest that endorectal MR imaging can play an increasingly useful role in prostate cancer management. 4. Information from preoperative MR imaging allows the surgeon to significantly refine the surgical plan, maximizing the preservation of periprostatic tissues (important for recovery of urinary and sexual function) 5.

To achieve lesion-specific visualization of tumors by MRI, we investigated {{the availability of a}} novel polymer-based tracer. Although the 13 C nucleus is a candidate for a detection nucleus because of its low background signal in the body, the low magnetic resonance sensitivity of the nucleus needs to be resolved before developing a 13 C-based tracer. In order to overcome this problem, we enriched polyethylene glycol (PEG), a biocompatible polymer, with 13 C atoms. 13 C-PEG 40, 000 (13 C-PEG with an average molecular weight of 40 kDa) emitted a single 13 C signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio due to its ability to maintain signal sharpness, as was confirmed by in vivo investigation, and displayed a chemical shift sufficiently distinct from that of endogenous fat. 13 C-PEG 40, 000 intravenously injected into mice showed long retention in circulation, leading to its effective accumulation in tumors reflecting the well-known phenomenon that macromolecules accumulate in tumors because of leaky <b>tumor</b> <b>capillaries.</b> These properties of 13 C-PEG 40, 000 allowed visualization of tumors in mice by 13 C spectroscopic imaging.

Complementary RNA probes coding for the pro-alpha 1 (IV) chain of human type IV collagen and the B 1 chain of human laminin were used to detect the respective mRNAs. The results were correlated with the immunohistochemical reactivity of tumor cells to specific antibodies against the P 1 fragment of laminin and the 7 S domain of type IV collagen. Signals {{for the presence of}} laminin mRNA in atypical neoplastic tumor cells could be detected in 11 MFHs. None of the tumors could be shown to contain signals for type IV collagen mRNA in their cells, although such signals were detected in the endothelial cells of <b>tumor</b> <b>capillaries.</b> In the corresponding immunohistochemical stainings, nine MFHs showed intracytoplasmic staining of tumor cells for laminin and one tumor showed weak staining for type IV collagen in the neoplastic cells. The results show that the laminin immunoreactivity found in MFHs is due to synthesis in the tumor cells and not to endogenous uptake of this protein. Synthesis of laminin in the majority of MFHs is in accordance with the notion that these tumors originate from primitive mesenchymal cells in soft tissues...|$|R

Lewis lung cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into mice, which were then exposed to sidestream smoke (SHS) or clean room air and administered vehicle, cerivastatin, or mecamylamine. SHS significantly increased <b>tumor</b> size, weight, <b>capillary</b> density, VEGF and MCP- 1 levels, and circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). Cerivastatin (an inhibitor of HMG-coA reductase) or mecamylamine (an inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) suppressed the effect of SHS to increase <b>tumor</b> size and <b>capillary</b> density. Cerivastatin reduced MCP- 1 levels, whereas mecamylamine reduced VEGF levels and EPC. These studies reveal that SHS promotes tumor angiogenesis and growth.

40|$|Aquaporin- 1 (AQP 1) is {{the main}} water channel {{responsible}} for water transport through many epithelia and endothelia. The latest evidence pointed toward an important role of this protein also in gas permeation, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and migration. In the present work we studied the expression of AQP 1 by immunohistochemical staining of 92 lung biopsies from patients diagnosed with a pleuropulmonary tumor (71 lung and 21 pleural neoplasms). AQP 1 expression was analyzed comparing the results among the different histological patterns and against 9 control cases (5 parenchyma and 4 healthy pleura). Clear staining of AQP 1 was detected in 39 of the 92 tumors analyzed. In parenchyma, AQP 1 was more frequently detected in primary lung denocarcinomas (55 %,P< 0. 001); in contrast, small cell carcinomas were the least AQP 1 expressive tumors studied (93 % of negative staining, P< 0. 05). Carcinomas analyzed in pleura (mesotheliomas and metastatic adenocarcinomas) also revealed strong xpression of AQP 1. High expression of this protein was detected in small capillaries in areas near or surrounding the tumor, and novel intense AQP 1 immunostaining was detected over thicker alveolar walls in alveoli inside or next to the tumoral tissue regardless of the tumor type. An important role of AQP 1 in tumor angiogenesis is sustained by the abundant expression of this protein in the endothelia of <b>tumor</b> <b>capillaries.</b> Further studies are necessary to elucidate the potential pathophysiological role of this protein in pleuropulmonary neoplasms...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Macrophage {{migration}} inhibitory factor (MIF) {{has been}} shown to counterregulate glucocorticoid action and to play an essential role in the activation of macrophages and T cells in vivo. MIF also may function as an autocrine growth factor in certain cell systems. We have explored the role of MIF in the growth of the 38 C 13 B cell lymphoma in C 3 H/HeN mice, a well-characterized syngeneic model for the study of solid tumor biology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor-bearing mice were treated with a neutralizing anti-MIF monoclonal antibody and the tumor response assessed grossly and histologically. <b>Tumor</b> <b>capillaries</b> were enumerated by immunohistochemistry and analyzed for MIF expression. The effect of MIF on endothelial cell proliferation was studied in vitro, utilizing both specific antibody and antisense oligonucleotide constructs. The role of MIF in angiogenesis also was examined in a standard Matrigel model of new blood vessel formation in vivo. RESULTS: The administration of anti-MIF monoclonal antibodies to mice was found to reduce significantly the growth and the vascularization of the 38 C 13 B cell lymphoma. By immunohistochemistry, MIF was expressed predominantly within the tumor-associated neovasculature. Cultured microvascular endothelial cells, but not 38 C 13 B cells, produced MIF protein and required its activity for proliferation in vitro. Anti-MIF monoclonal antibody also was found to markedly inhibit the neovascularization response elicited by Matrigel implantation. CONCLUSION: These data significantly expand the role of MIF in host responses, and suggest a new target for the development of anti-neoplastic agents that inhibit tumor neovascularization...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of intraperitoneal chemotherapy for ovarian cancers {{is limited by}} poor penetration of drug into peritoneal tumors. Based on pharmacokinetic theory that suggests that penetration depth is primarily determined by the rate of drug removal via <b>tumor</b> <b>capillaries,</b> we have hypothesized that co-administration of antiangiogenic therapy will allow for decreased drug removal, increased drug concentrations in tumor, and increased {{efficacy of}} intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetic modeling was conducted to simulate the effect of tumor blood flow on tumor concentrations of topotecan. Simulations predicted that tumor blood flow reductions, as potentially achieved by antiangiogenic therapy, would lead to substantial increases in tumor concentrations after intraperitoneal chemotherapy but {{would lead to a}} slight decrease after systemic chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetic studies performed using the A 2780 xenograft tumor model showed that animals receiving combined intraperitoneal topotecan and an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody had ∼ 6. 5 -fold higher (p = 0. 0015) tumor topotecan concentrations compared with animals receiving intraperitoneal topotecan alone, whereas there was no significant (p = 0. 16) difference for systemic topotecan. Therapeutic studies conducted with two different drugs, topotecan and cisplatin, showed that animals receiving combined intraperitoneal chemotherapy and anti-VEGF therapy displayed superior survival relative to animals treated with chemotherapy alone (i. e., cisplatin or topotecan), anti-VEGF alone, or intravenous chemotherapy with concomitant anti-VEGF therapy. Combined intraperitoneal topotecan and anti-VEGF resulted in the complete cure of four of 11 mice. The proposed combination of antiangiogenic therapy and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, which was predicted to be beneficial by pharmacokinetic simulations, may provide substantial benefit to patients with peritoneal malignancies...|$|R
