40|$|A {{time domain}} {{equalizer}} (TEQ) is a finite impulse response filter that shortens the channel impulse response (CIR) to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI). Melsa, Younce, and Rohrs minimized ISI {{in the time}} domain by maximizing the shortening signal-tonoise ratio (SSNR) of the energy in a <b>target</b> <b>window</b> to the energy outside the <b>target</b> <b>window</b> in the shortened CIR. Infinite SSNR means zero ISI. Melsa, Younce, and Rohrs also developed a joint channel shortening method to design a single TEQ to shorten a channel and a near-end echo impulse response. In this paper, we extend the joint SSNR method to design a single TEQ to shorten multiple channels by maximizing the composite SSNR. The composite SSNR is a weighted sum of normalized channel SSNRs. The normalized SSNR is {{the ratio of the}} energy in the <b>target</b> <b>window</b> samples to the energy of all samples in the shortened CIR and has a range of [0, 1] so that it is better suited for numerical stability and fixed-point implementation. Our proposed method outperforms the joint channel shortening method. because it achieves higher weighted sum of SSNRs of the used channels...|$|E
40|$|LTR-containing retrotransposons reverse {{transcribe}} their RNA genomes, and {{the resulting}} cDNAs are integrated into the genome by the element-encoded integrase protein. The yeast LTR retrotransposon Ty 1 preferentially integrates into a <b>target</b> <b>window</b> upstream of tDNAs (tRNA genes) in the yeast genome. We investigated {{the nature of these}} insertions and the <b>target</b> <b>window</b> on a genomic scale by analyzing several hundred de novo insertions upstream of tDNAs in two different multicopy gene families. The pattern of insertion upstream of tDNAs was nonrandom and periodic, with peaks separated by ∼ 80 bp. Insertions were not distributed equally throughout the genome, as certain tDNAs within a given family received higher frequencies of upstream Ty 1 insertions than others. We showed that the presence and relative position of additional tDNAs and LTRs surrounding the target tDNA dramatically influenced the frequency of insertion events upstream of that target...|$|E
40|$|Blind Review) An {{increasing}} number of users are adopting large, multimonitor displays. The resulting setups cover such a broad viewing angle that users can no longer simultaneously perceive {{all parts of the}} screen. Changes outside the user’s visual field often go unnoticed. As a result, users often have trouble locating the active window, especially after switching focus using a keyboard. This paper surveys graphical cues designed to direct visual attention and adapts them to window switching. Visual cues include five types of frames and mask around the <b>target</b> <b>window</b> and four trails leading to the <b>target</b> <b>window.</b> We report the results of two user studies. The first evaluates each cue in isolation. The second study evaluates hybrid techniques created by combining the most successful candidates from the first study.

40|$|The {{residual}} gas composition in the time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometer vacuum {{system has been}} measured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. All {{residual gas}}es except hydrogen and helium are condensed and freezed on {{the windows of the}} liquid hydrogen target. As a result it increases the background during the reaction between the cooler synchrotron (COSY) beam and the target. These condensates have to be cleaned from the <b>target</b> <b>windows</b> by fast heating the target cell from 16 K up to room temperature. The partial pressure spectrums of the condensed gases on the liquid hydrogen target are also measured. The residual gas analysis shows {{that the majority of the}} condensates on the <b>target</b> <b>windows</b> are nitrogen, oxygen and water vapor. The target area has to be in a high vacuum < 1 x 10 (- 6) mbar in order to minimize the condensate. The <b>target</b> <b>windows</b> have to be cleaned with the fast heating cycle every 48 h.

DesignA double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial. Materials & methodsA total of 260 vascular surgery patients will be randomised to esmolol or placebo as an add-on to standard medical care, including chronic low-dose beta-blockers. Esmolol is titrated to maintain a heart rate within a <b>target</b> <b>window</b> of 60 – 80  beats per minute for 24  h from the induction of anaesthesia. Heart rate and ischaemia are assessed by continuous 12 -lead electrocardiographic monitoring for 72  h, starting 1 day prior to surgery. The primary outcome measure is duration of heart rate outside the <b>target</b> <b>window</b> during infusion of the study drug. Secondary outcome measures will be the efficacy parameters of occurrence of cardiac ischaemia, troponin T release, myocardial infarction and cardiac death within 30 days after surgery and safety parameters such as the occurrence of stroke and hypotension. ConclusionsThis study will provide data on the efficacy of esmolol titration in chronic beta-blocker users for tight heart-rate control and reduction of ischaemia in patients undergoing vascular surgery as well as data on safety parameters...|$|E

In this method a searching window will slide over the whole frame and in each step, similarity function will calculate then y which has a most similarity function will choose as a center of <b>target</b> <b>window.</b> Because each pixel in the window {{does not have an}} equal importance, therefor in calculation of histogram, weighted histogram will be used [34].|$|E

DMT simulates a video recorder/player system and provides recording, winding (forward/backward) and replaying functions. During recording, DMT records the target tool window image changes and the interactions between the target tool and the controlling mouse. By deleting and inserting visual-image scripts and by adding textual comments to explain the visual-image changes, a user can obtain editing of what has been recorded.

40|$|A {{lead-bismuth}} eutectic (LBE) target design {{concept has}} been developed to drive the subcritical multiplier (SCM) of the accelerator-driven test facility (ADTF). This report gives the target design description, {{the results from the}} parametric studies, and the design analyses including physics, heat-transfer, hydraulics, structural, radiological, and safety analyses. The design is based on a coaxial geometrical configuration to minimize the target footprint and to maximize the utilization of the spallation neutrons. The target is installed vertically along the SCM axis. LBE is the target material and the target coolant. Ferritic steel (HT- 9 alloy) is the selected structural material based on the current database and the design analyses. Austenitic steel (Type 316 stainless steel) is the backup choice. A uniform proton beam is employed to perform the spallation process. The proton beam has 8. 33 -mA current and 8. 14 -cm radius resulting in a current density of 40 {micro}A/cm{sup 2 }. The beam power is 5 MW and the proton energy is 600 MeV. The beam tube has 10 -cm radius to accommodate the halo current. A hemi-spherical geometry is used for the <b>target</b> <b>window,</b> which is connected to the beam tube. A conical <b>target</b> <b>window</b> with a rounded tip is also considered since it has a lower average temperature relative to the spherical geometry. The beam tube is enclosed inside two coaxial tubes to provide inlet and outlet manifolds for the LBE coolant. The inlet and the outlet coolant manifolds and the proton beam are entered from the top above the SCM. Several design constraints are developed and utilized for the target design process to satisfy different engineering requirements and to minimize the design development time and cost...|$|E

We describe the design and evaluation of a new window switcher called SCOTZ (for Spatially Consistent Thumbnail Zones). SCOTZ is a window switching interface which shows all windows grouped by application and allocates more space to the most frequently revisited applications. The two key design principles of SCOTZ are (1) predictability of window locations, and (2) improved accessibility of recently and frequently used windows. We describe the design and features of SCOTZ, and present the findings from qualitative and empirical studies which demonstrate that SCOTZ yields performance and preference benefits over existing window switching tools...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: One of {{the most}} popular areas of video {{processing}} is object tracking. The main purpose of object tracking is to estimate the position of the object in images in a continuous manner and reliably against dynamic scenes. This can be beneficially achieved by using the mean shift object tracking algorithm. In this approach, a rectangular <b>target</b> <b>window</b> is defined in an initial frame for a moving target in a video, and after that, the tracked object is separated from the back ground by processing the data within that window. It is considered as a new approach toward target localization and representation in visual tracking of objects. By using an isotropic kernel, target representations which are based on feature histogram are regularized with the help of spatial masking...|$|E
