5|$|As {{a natural}} force, {{the wind was}} often personified as one or more wind gods or as an {{expression}} of the supernatural in many cultures. Vayu is the Hindu God of Wind. The Greek wind gods include Boreas, Notus, Eurus, and Zephyrus. Aeolus, in varying interpretations the ruler or keeper of the four winds, has also been described as Astraeus, the god of dusk who fathered the four winds with Eos, goddess of dawn. The Ancient Greeks also observed the seasonal change of <b>the</b> <b>winds,</b> as evidenced by the Tower of <b>the</b> <b>Winds</b> in Athens. Venti are the Roman gods of <b>the</b> <b>winds.</b> Fūjin is the Japanese wind god {{and is one of the}} eldest Shinto gods. According to legend, he was present at the creation of the world and first let <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> out of his bag to clear the world of mist. In Norse mythology, Njörðr is the god of the wind. There are also four dvärgar (Norse dwarves), named Norðri, Suðri, Austri and Vestri, and probably the four stags of Yggdrasil, personify the four winds, and parallel the four Greek wind gods. Stribog is the name of the Slavic god of winds, sky and air. He is said to be the ancestor (grandfather) of <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> of the eight directions.|$|E
5|$|Communications on {{the island}} failed due to the winds; the entire island was left without power and phone service. <b>The</b> <b>winds</b> greatly damaged 715power poles and 513transformers, leaving about $52million in {{electrical}} damage reported (2002USD, $ USD). The local weather office's communication link was cut off after flooding damaged a telecommunication facility, causing the National Weather Service in Honolulu, Hawaii, to provide backup support by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories. Many anemometers near the northern coastline failed from <b>the</b> <b>winds.</b> <b>The</b> <b>winds</b> collapsed several walls at the Guam Memorial Hospital, resulting in major damage throughout the northern two-thirds of the facility and several units being shut down. Several hotels, churches, and schools received moderate damage, and the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport received damage to navigation equipment. Typhoon Pongsona also left 65% of the island's water wells inoperable, with most of Guam left without water service following the storm. Officials estimate the typhoon destroyed 1,300homes, severely damaged 1,825, and lightly damaged 4,800.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> power {{prediction}} error probability distribution is very complex {{due to the}} nonlinear relationship between <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed and <b>wind</b> power: when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is less than <b>the</b> cut-in <b>wind,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power is 0; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is between <b>the</b> cut-in <b>wind</b> speed and <b>the</b> rated <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will be the smooth output; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is between <b>the</b> rated <b>wind</b> speed and <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will maintain its maximum power; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed is greater than <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will be 0. Therefore, based on the nonlinear relationship between wind speed and <b>wind</b> power, <b>the</b> prediction distribution of wind power is complex.|$|R

5|$|Onshore, winds reached 52mph (84km/h) in Norfolk, Virginia, with an {{unofficial}} report of 57mph (92km/h) near Virginia Beach. Similar observations occurred along the Outer Banks, with <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> knocking some tree limbs onto power lines; some isolated power outages were reported. Wind damage included some roofs losing shingles from <b>the</b> <b>winds.</b> In Elizabeth City, North Carolina, an outer rainband dropped 0.5inches (10mm) of precipitation in about twohours {{as well as}} several lightning strikes; one bolt of lightning injured two firefighters. <b>The</b> <b>winds</b> covered portions of North Carolina Highway 12 with sand, and for a day the route was closed after waves from the storm washed out about 200feet (60m) of roadway. In some locations, the waves eroded up to 20feet (6m) of beach, leaving 70homes in imminent danger. On St. Simons Island in Georgia, the storm produced a storm tide of 8.09feet (2.43m). Trace amounts of rainfall occurred in the southeastern portion of the state.|$|E

30|$|There {{are three}} typical cases: ① When <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed {{is less than}} <b>the</b> cut-in <b>wind</b> speed or greater than <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> turbine does not produce <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power.

5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> at the surface and <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E

In the interior the predominant wind direction is more varied with northern winds being the most frequent in January – March and in October.|$|E
