5|$|Fire Emblem: <b>The</b> <b>Blazing</b> Blade {{was first}} {{announced}} in early 2003. It {{was the second}} title in the Fire Emblem series to {{have been developed for}} the Game Boy Advance (GBA). The game was released on April 25, 2003. It was also compatible with the newly released Game Boy Advance SP, an upgraded version of the GBA. Prior to 2017, the game's Japanese subtitle was translated as The Sword of Flame. In 2017, the subtitle was officially translated by Nintendo as <b>The</b> <b>Blazing</b> Blade. The game was later released on the Virtual Console for Wii U on May 14, 2014.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three drifting fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Océan ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the drifting Tonnerre and Patriote loomed out of the darkness. Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into the starboard side of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Océans crew then held <b>the</b> <b>blazing</b> ship alongside long enough that the drifters could escape before releasing the fireship to drift on shore. During this effort at least 50 men tumbled to their deaths in the fiery chasm between the ships {{as they tried to}} prevent the fire spreading on board.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Kennedy drummed for <b>The</b> <b>Blazing</b> Salads with Brian Cadd, Glenn Shorrock, Rex Goh, and Kirk Lorange. Hamish Stuart played drums on Chris Abrahams and Melanie Oxley's 1998 album, Jerusalem Bay. Doyle died on 5 May 2006, and on 28 May the Jim Doyle Tribute Concert {{was played}} at the Basement in Sydney. Musicians {{included}} Renée Geyer, Billy Field, bandmate Loughnan, and Barry Leef, with proceeds benefiting Doyle's family. Dunlop died on 16 May 2009; he had collapsed after drumming at his son's wedding in Sydney. As of 2015, Loughnan is a lecturer in jazz saxophone at the University of Sydney's Conservatorium of Music {{and has been a}} member of its Jazz Faculty since 1978. In 2007 he released a solo album, Ellen St.|$|E

5|$|In {{the seas}} off Lissa, British prize crews were making strenuous {{efforts to protect}} their captures; Corona was heavily on fire in {{consequence}} of her engagement with Active and the British prize crew fought the blaze alongside their Italian prisoners. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when <b>the</b> <b>blazing</b> mainmast collapsed. Problems were also experienced aboard Bellona, where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command to light the fuse. The officer promised to do so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British prize crew when they arrived. Duodo died still believing that the fuse had been lit.|$|E
5|$|No {{games in}} the series were {{released}} outside of Japan until two characters, Marth and Roy, were included as playable characters in the 2001 fighting game Super Smash Bros. Melee. Their popularity eventually convinced Nintendo to release the next game, <b>The</b> <b>Blazing</b> Blade, in Western regions under the title Fire Emblem in 2003. Many {{games in the}} series have sold well, despite a decline during the 2000s {{which resulted in the}} series' near-cancellation. Individual entries have generally been praised, and the series as a whole has been lauded for its gameplay, and it is cited as a seminal series in the tactical role-playing genre. Characters from multiple games have also been included in crossovers with other franchises.|$|E
5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite <b>the</b> <b>blazing</b> speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched {{for weeks at a}} time.|$|E
50|$|The rest of <b>the</b> <b>Blaze's</b> {{first year}} {{included}} some very questionable moves. On June 14, <b>the</b> <b>Blaze</b> traded their top draft pick, Myles Jones, to the Bayhawks after Jones had only played two games for <b>the</b> <b>Blaze.</b> On July 21, the team released Hall of Fame head coach John Tucker and replaced him with David Huntley after a 3-7 start. <b>The</b> <b>Blaze</b> finished their inaugural season in eighth place at 4-10, ahead {{of only the}} Florida Launch. Former Atlanta Hawks and Thrashers executive Jim Pfeifer was named the team's new president on December 29.|$|R
50|$|Ragsdale {{played for}} <b>the</b> Bismarck <b>Blaze</b> of <b>the</b> Indoor Football League in 2000, helping <b>the</b> <b>Blaze</b> earn a playoff berth. He {{finished}} with six wins and one loss as <b>the</b> <b>Blaze's</b> starter. He completed 89 of 157 passes for 1,056 yards in nine games with <b>the</b> <b>Blaze.</b> He threw for 21 touchdowns with just six interceptions and finished {{fourth in the}} league with a passer rating of 94.9. Ragsdale also ran 25 times for 87 yards and eight touchdowns.|$|R
5000|$|On September 9, 2008 {{the station}} changed to active rock and became <b>The</b> <b>Blaze,</b> with <b>the</b> call letters {{becoming}} KZZQ. <b>The</b> <b>Blaze</b> {{had previously been}} located on 94.9 with the call sign KHTB, which subsequently became the call sign for a new active rock station called 94.9 Z-Rock. Reportedly, <b>The</b> <b>Blaze</b> had almost been shut down, but was able to continue using <b>the</b> <b>Blaze</b> moniker because Citadel failed to acquire the naming rights. However, on this date, due to poor ratings (possibly {{as a result of}} competition against Z-Rock), <b>The</b> <b>Blaze</b> changed to what they called a [...] "Rockin' Hits" [...] format. However, this new format was met with even poorer ratings and extremely negative response from the station's longtime listeners. However, on December 1, 2010, <b>The</b> <b>Blaze's</b> morning host, Roger [...] "Big Rog" [...] Orton, spent his shift protesting the station's new mainstream rock format by playing active rock songs. This protest was met with overwhelmingly positive response from listeners, and the station received thousands of supportive phone calls, song requests, e-mails, and Facebook messages. Several Facebook fan pages showing support for <b>The</b> <b>Blaze</b> also appeared and hundreds of listeners signed the radio station's van, which was spray-painted white to act as a petition for the station to return to the active rock format. <b>The</b> <b>Blaze</b> returned to playing active rock shortly afterwards.|$|R
5|$|Fire Emblem: <b>The</b> <b>Blazing</b> Blade is a {{tactical}} role-playing game where players take {{the role of}} story protagonists Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector as they navigate story-driven missions across the fictional continent of Elibe. The player takes {{the role of an}} unseen tactician directing the player army. The single-player campaign is divided into chapters which generally begin with story elements presented through the use of scenes animated with still images of the main characters, then followed by a battle with an enemy; after each battle, the player is given the opportunity to save their progress. In-game currency is gained either through battles in the game's Link Arena or through other means, rather than from defeating units. Currency can be used to buy new items and weapons at merchants in between battles and at specific locations within maps. Items can also be exchanged between units during battles.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the crumbling social system outside their walls, the prison film portrayed a universe where the state was all powerful and orderly. Sparked by the Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930 in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions in prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconion system in <b>the</b> <b>blazing</b> outdoors where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's The Big House. 1932's I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is considered the seminal film of the chain gang genre. Although the chain gang film Hell's Highway had beaten Fugitive to the screen two months earlier, it exerted nowhere the influence.|$|E
5|$|Prison {{films of}} the pre-Code era often {{involved}} {{men and women who}} were unjustly incarcerated, and films set in prisons of the north tended to portray them as a bastion of solidarity against the crumbling social system of the Great Depression. Sparked by the real-life Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930, in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells, causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions inside prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconian system of discipline in <b>the</b> <b>blazing</b> outdoor heat, where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors.|$|E

5|$|During the First World War {{hundreds}} of Somerset soldiers were killed, and war memorials were {{put up in}} most of the towns and villages; only a few villages escaped casualties. There were also casualties– though much fewer– during the Second World War, who were added to the memorials. The county was a base for troops preparing for the 1944 D-Day landings, and some Somerset hospitals still date partly from that time. The Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater was constructed early in World War II for the Ministry of Supply. It was designed as an Explosive ROF, to produce RDX, which was then a new experimental high-explosive. It obtained water supplies from two sources via the Somerset Levels: the artificial Huntspill River which was dug during the construction of the factory and also from the King's Sedgemoor Drain, which was widened at the same time. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to resist a potential German invasion, and the remains of its pill boxes can still be seen, as well as others along the coast. A decoy town was constructed on Black Down, intended to represent <b>the</b> <b>blazing</b> lights of a town which had neglected to follow the black-out regulations. Sites in the county housed Prisoner of War camps including: Norton Fitzwarren, Barwick, Brockley, Goathurst and Wells. Various airfields were built or converted from civilian use including: RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II), RAF Weston-super-Mare, RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), Yeovil/Westland Airport, RAF Weston Zoyland, RAF Merryfield, RAF Culmhead and RAF Charmy Down.|$|E
