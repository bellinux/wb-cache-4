5|$|It is {{alarming}} {{and also}} nauseating <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now {{posing as a}} fakir of a type {{well known in the}} East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace....to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|A {{story is}} told of a cricketer who had {{regarded}} Fuller Pilch as the final word in batting, being taken in his old age <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Grace bat for the first time. He watched the great man {{for a quarter of}} an hour or so and then broke out into an expression of boundless delight. 'Why', he said, 'this man scores continuously from balls that old Fuller would have been thankful to stop'.|$|E

500|$|David Packard of DVD Verdict {{said that}} the live action scenes [...] "add to the silliness." [...] He also said [...] "It's a nice change of pace to see Plankton and Krabs as chums pre-Chum Bucket and finding out what led to their friendship's {{eventual}} demise. Viewers also get <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs introduced to 'the love of his life' as he develops the secret formula to the Krabby Patty that Bikini Bottom's residents know and love today." [...] On the DVD, Patrick Cossel of Blogcritics said [...] "Children and adults will laugh out loud at the crazy slapstick antics {{of the one who}} lives under the sea." [...] He added that [...] "This release is sure to be huge hit for SpongeBob fans everywhere." [...] Lesley Aeschliman of Yahoo! Voices was negative on the episode saying [...] "'Friend of Foe?' just felt like a regular episode that really had no reason to be hyped a special." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kinnear's {{performance}} {{has been widely}} praised. A. O. Scott writes, [...] "it’s nice <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Kinnear play an entirely sympathetic character for a change [...] his slyness and subtlety seem wasted in a project that {{has no interest in}} either." [...] Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune writes, [...] "Reliably honest and affecting, [...] fights off the waves of corn {{in much the same way}} that Tibetan monk defied the tsunami in 2012." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the West Essex Conservative Association, {{specially}} convened so that Churchill could explain his position, he said [...] "It is alarming and also nauseating <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace... to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor."

2500|$|Christopher R. Barron, {{co-founder of}} GOProud {{who would later}} not only endorse Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, but also launch LGBT for Trump, said he [...] "would love <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Trump run for president." [...] For the 2012 CPAC conference, the ACU board voted to not invite GOProud or the John Birch Society to the 2012 conference. The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is {{credited}} for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party. The 2015 CPAC featured Jamila Bey who became the first atheist activist to address CPAC's annual meeting. The 2016 CPAC featured co-sponsorship {{for the first time}} from the Log Cabin Republicans.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Kirk, the Conservative MP for Gravesend, criticised the TUCC's {{handling}} of the matter and tried {{to discuss it with}} Ernest Marples, the Minister of Transport. A Ministry of Transport memorandum of 14 April 1961 states that [...] "it would not be proper for the Minister <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Kirk at this stage [...] It may well be that Mr Kirk wished to put forward further representations at this late stage [...] Mr Kirk may, for example, wish to make some criticism {{of the way in which}} the proposals have been heard by the Consultative Committees." [...] Access to the Minister was therefore refused.|$|E
2500|$|His {{personal}} {{passion and}} extreme comfort around politicians gave him credibility that others ... would lack. Mr Valenti was a consummate salesman, who like all great salesmen ... worked himself up into believing {{the truth of}} his clients' message. Those privileged <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Valenti offstage – talking openly with his clients about what could or could not be achieved, and what artifice would or would not work – are aware that Mr Valenti's clients frequently disagreed with his advice and directed him to deliver a different message through a different artifice. [...] was a great actor working {{on the stage of}} Washington DC (and sometimes globally) on behalf of an industry that appreciated his craft, but that never let him forget that the message was theirs and not his.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Madam La Fleur," [...] {{interpolated}} Miss Panney, [...] "the celebrated {{chef who}} cooks for Dr. Tolbridge. She came, I think, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Drane." ...|$|R
60|$|Sophy smiled, she {{was much}} less {{impervious}} to cheerful auguries, and spoke with gladness of the pleasure it would give her friend Genevieve <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Kendal.|$|R
60|$|The {{kitchen door}} opened. Marilla looked up expecting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Lynde. Anne stood before her, tall and starry-eyed, {{with her hands}} full of Mayflowers and violets.|$|R
2500|$|Churchill {{denounced the}} Round Table Conference. He spoke at public {{meetings}} in Manchester and Liverpool in January and February 1931, respectively. At both he forecast widespread unemployment into the millions {{and other social}} and economic problems in the United Kingdom if India became self-governing. Though {{he would come to}} respect Mohandas Gandhi, especially after Gandhi [...] "stood up for the untouchables", {{at a meeting of the}} West Essex Conservative Association specially convened so Churchill could explain his position he said, [...] "It is alarming and also nauseating <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Gandhi, a seditious Middle-Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well-known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace... to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor."

2500|$|Still only twenty-one, Morphy was now quite famous. While in Paris, he {{was sitting}} in his hotel room one evening, chatting with his {{companion}} Frederick Edge, when they had an unexpected visitor. [...] "I am Prince Galitzine; I wish <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Morphy," [...] the visitor said, according to Edge. Morphy identified himself to the visitor. [...] "No, it is not possible!" [...] the prince exclaimed, [...] "You are too young!" [...] Prince Galitzine then explained {{that he was in the}} frontiers of Siberia when he had first heard of Morphy's [...] "wonderful deeds." [...] He explained, [...] "One of my suite had a copy of the chess paper published in Berlin, the Schachzeitung, and ever since that time I have been wanting to see you." [...] He then told Morphy that he must go to Saint Petersburg, Russia, because the chess club in the Imperial Palace would receive him with enthusiasm.|$|E
2500|$|Art Vandelay {{is first}} used in [...] "The Stake Out". George and Jerry invent {{an excuse to}} explain their {{presence}} in the lobby of an office building. They explain that they're meeting Art Vandelay, an importer-exporter who works in the building. In [...] "The Boyfriend", George tells the unemployment office he's close to getting a job at [...] "Vandelay Industries", a latex manufacturer. George later applies the name to a fictional problem boyfriend of Elaine, part of an elaborate cover story to hide from Susan that he's also dating Marisa Tomei ("The Cadillac"). George uses the name when asked which authors he reads during an interview with Elaine's publishing house in [...] "The Red Dot". In [...] "The Bizarro Jerry", George asks the receptionist at Brandt/Leland for a Mr. Art Vendelay, to which she replies, [...] "there's no Mr. Vandelay here". In [...] "The Serenity Now", George invents fake customers, one of whom is [...] "Mr. Vandelay", to hide his lack of sales success. In [...] "The Bizarro Jerry", George asks <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Vandelay as part of a ruse to approach an attractive secretary. In [...] "The Puerto Rican Day", George pretends to be Vandelay (Jerry pretends to be [...] "Kal Varnsen", and Kramer is [...] "H.E. Pennypacker") to take advantage of an open house to watch a Mets game on television. In [...] "The Finale", the name of the presiding judge is actually Arthur Vandelay, much to George's amazement. George says he thinks it's [...] "good luck" [...] that that is the judge's name, though this turns out to be false.|$|E

60|$|They parted {{without another}} word. <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Nadgett's bow when Montague and he next met, and <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Montague {{acknowledge}} it, anybody might have undertaken to swear {{that they had}} never spoken to each other confidentially in all their lives.|$|E
