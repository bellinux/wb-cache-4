5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
5|$|This amendment, {{as well as}} the Fourteenth, is {{undoubtedly}} self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances. By its own unaided force and effect, it abolished slavery and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected by it, and <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation may be primary and direct in its character, for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.|$|E
5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit {{a provision in the}} law which permitted doctors <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> contraceptives for the prevention of disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at the clinic, and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Background: Antidepressants {{are used}} {{frequently}} in non-fatal self-poisoning. There are national guidelines for prescribing antidepresants. There {{have been few}} investigations of how non-fatal self-poisoning with antidepressants varies in relation <b>to</b> <b>prescribing</b> and <b>to</b> patient characteristics. Methods: A comparative study {{of the use of}} specific antidepressants (amitriptyline and dosulepin (tricyclics), citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and venlafaxine (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) for non-fatal self-poisoning (episode-based), relative <b>to</b> <b>prescribing,</b> in three centres in England, 2004 to 2006. Results: There was marked variation between centres in the ratio of rates of self-poisoning <b>to</b> <b>prescribing</b> for specific antidepressants. Higher rates of self-poisoning relative <b>to</b> <b>prescribing</b> for all antidepressants combined, and for venlafaxine, were found in the centre with greater proportions of patients with a history of self-harm and/or previous psychiatric treatment. Within each centre, higher rates of self-poisoning relative <b>to</b> <b>prescribing</b> for either amitripyline or dosulepin were also similar to sertraline, which is of concern given the known toxicity of tricyclics. Limitations: An ecological study, where prescriptions were for all indications and not specifically for patients who self-poisoned. Conclusion: Marked differences found in ratios of self-poisoning with antidepressants <b>to</b> levels of <b>prescribing,</b> in three centres of England, are likely to reflect differences in both prescribing practices (despite clear national guidance) and patient characteristics. Risk of overdose and toxicity should be considered when local prescribing policy and clinical practice relating to antidepressant are under review.

5|$|Four {{years after}} the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for {{physicians}} <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses). This second clinic, the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923. To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women. The existence of the clinic was finally announced {{to the public in}} December 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years of struggle, birth control had finally become widely accepted in the United States. The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.|$|E
5|$|In his Essential Medical Treasures of the Golden Chamber (Jinkui yaolue), Zhang Zhongjing (c. 150– c. 219 CE) was {{the first}} to suggest a {{regulated}} diet rich in certain vitamins could prevent different types of disease, an idea which led Hu Sihui (fl. 1314–1330 CE) <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> a diet rich in Vitamin B1 as a treatment for beriberi. Zhang's major work was the Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Disorders (Shanghan zabing lun). His contemporary and alleged associate Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was a physician who had studied the Huangdi neijing and became knowledgeable in Chinese herbology. Hua Tuo used anesthesia on patients during surgery and created an ointment that was meant to fully heal surgery wounds within a month. In one diagnosis of an ill woman, he deciphered that she bore a dead fetus within her womb which he then removed, curing her of her ailments.|$|E
5|$|With many mining {{communities}} suffering {{high levels}} of unemployment following the General Strike, some Poor Law boards granted relief to unemployed workers by misusing provisions intended for exceptional circumstances. These boards used the provisions to give benefits to nearly all applicants. With the system thrown into crisis, Chamberlain sought legislation to permit the Minister of Health to dismiss recalcitrant boards, and later got Parliament to pass further legislation <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> criminal penalties to members of such boards. Though no board members were prosecuted, Chamberlain dismissed three boards, replacing their members with his own appointees. Finally, in 1929, Chamberlain brought in legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely, replacing them with bodies appointed by local authorities. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons {{for two and a}} half hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded, he was applauded by all parties. The Local Government Act 1929 passed by an ample majority, and the Morning Post commented that (despite Labour attacks), it had been found to be impossible to make it unpopular.|$|E

5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, <b>to</b> <b>prescribe</b> a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the terminations relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the terminations connected to each other via an ideal transformer perfectly matching them. Versions of this theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with network synthesis. Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually worked into a resistive load. Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with passive components. An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's dual-band filter where the input of two filters are connected in parallel and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required {{in the body of the}} filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E

40|$|Context: The use of {{complementary}} {{and alternative}} medicine (CAM) is common among {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) patients in Indonesia and may potentially affect adherence <b>to</b> <b>prescribed</b> diabetes medication, leading to uncontrolled blood sugar levels and complications. Aims: The objectives {{of this study were}} to analyze the association of CAM use with adherence <b>to</b> <b>prescribed</b> diabetes medication and to identify predictors of low adherence <b>to</b> <b>prescribed</b> diabetes medication. Settings and Design: A cross-sectional survey was done in a secondary health care facility in Bandung city, Indonesia. Data were collected between February and April 2014 from 114 respondents selected through consecutive sampling. Statistical Analysis Used: Chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: The result showed that 64. 9 % of the respondents used CAM with herbal products (54. 4 %), ceragem (16. 7 %), and massage (12. 3 %) as the most widely used types. CAM use was found to significantly decrease adherence <b>to</b> <b>prescribed</b> diabetes medication (P < 0. 05). The multivariate analysis suggested that the predictors of low adherence were CAM used [adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) 6. 16; 2. 44 - 15. 52], gender (ORadj 2. 57; 1. 05 - 6. 31), and age (ORadj 4. 25; 1. 53 - 11. 31). Conclusions: CAM use decreased adherence <b>to</b> <b>prescribed</b> medication in T 2 DM patients. Gender and age were also associated with adherence.
