The primary need is for safety measures <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> to prevent fuel escaping the tanks {{in which it is}} stored.

5|$|Despite the {{hotly contested}} status of O'Shaughnessy Dam in the {{environmental}} field, and occasional federal money set aside for studying alternatives to Hetch Hetchy – such as $7 million provided by President George W. Bush in 2007 in the National Park Service budget – local support for its removal is relatively low. In 2012, San Francisco voters struck down Proposition F, which would have ordered the city to study the removal of O'Shaughnessy Dam and draft a plan to replace Hetch Hetchy water, {{by a vote of}} 77 percent against. Proposition F would have allocated $8 million to create a feasibility study by 2016; new water delivery and filtration systems would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by 2025 and Hetch Hetchy Reservoir would have to be drained by 2035.|$|E
5|$|The affair came {{amid the}} larger dispute between Whitehall and Salisbury {{regarding}} the terms under which Rhodesia could be granted sovereign independence. Rhodesia's mostly white government insisted that statehood should {{come under the}} constitution introduced with Britain's approval in 1961, while Whitehall insisted that a set timetable for the introduction of black majority rule would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> before the country could be fully independent. The Rhodesian government's stance on this matter caused it to become isolated within the Commonwealth, which from 1964 excluded it from most of its internal bodies, while the Rhodesian military became unofficially embargoed by its established British and American suppliers.|$|E

25|$|In March 2008, the Golden Gate Bridge District board {{approved}} {{a resolution to}} start congestion pricing at the Golden Gate Bridge, charging higher tolls during the peak hours, but rising and falling depending on traffic levels.

25|$|As an {{intermediate}} solution a bus service was established from Oslo to Fornebu. The number of buses have increased dramatically as new work places have opened, {{although there is}} no spare capacity on the buses.

The lack of transit was also a hindrance for the construction of housing, as this required the transit system <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> As of 2012 only 300 residences had been built at Fornebu.|$|E

25|$|In mid-June 2011, {{preparations}} for the spinning of the main cable began by installing the temporary catwalks on the SAS span. Both western catwalks were installed and by mid-August, all four catwalks were installed in place and an approximation of the completed outline of the bridge could then be seen. All four catwalks, the traveler, its suspension cable and the drafting cables and the winches and specialized tracks at the deviation saddles had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> before strand dragging could begin.

25|$|General Scott {{had begun}} {{assembling}} men and supplies {{for a grand}} campaign against the Seminoles. Three columns, totaling 5,000 men, were to converge on the Cove of the Withlacoochee, trapping the Seminoles with a force large enough to defeat them. Scott would accompany one column, {{under the command of}} General Clinch, moving south from Fort Drane. A second column, under Brig. Gen. Abraham Eustis, would travel southwest from Volusia, a town on the St. Johns River. The third wing, under the command of Col. William Lindsay, would move north from Fort Brooke. The plan was for the three columns to arrive at the Cove simultaneously so as to prevent the Seminoles from escaping. Eustis and Lindsay were supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> on March 25, so that Clinch's column could drive the Seminoles into them.|$|E
25|$|The New Army Structure—the {{reorganization}} plan {{announced in}} late 1991 and scheduled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> sometime in 1995—replaces the previous two-corps structure {{with one of}} three corps. The new corps is headquartered at Baden, with responsibility for the two northeastern provinces of Lower Austria and Upper Austria. Army headquarters will be eliminated, as will the divisional structure for the three standing brigades. The three corps—in effect, regional commands—will be directly subordinate to the general troop inspector. The three mechanized brigades will be placed directly under the new Third Corps at Baden, although in the future one brigade may be assigned {{to each of the}} three corps. The mobile militia will be reduced from eight to six mechanized brigades. Each of the nine provincial commands will have at least one militia regiment of two to six battalions as well as local defence companies.|$|E
25|$|The College Football Playoff {{replaced}} the BCS {{as the system}} {{used to determine the}} FBS college football champion beginning in the 2014 season. The four-team playoffs consist of two semifinal games, with the winners advancing to the College Football Championship Game. The game is hosted by a different city each year, with locations selected by bids, akin to the Super Bowl or the Final Four. Cowboys Stadium hosted the first title game in 2015. The system is contracted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> through at least the 2025–2026 season per a contract with ESPN, which owns the rights to broadcast all games. Unlike the BCS, the system does not use polls or computer rankings to select participants. A 13-member committee chooses and seeds the teams for the two playoff games and four other top-tier bowl games, using a balloting procedure similar to the NCAA basketball tournament selection process.|$|E
