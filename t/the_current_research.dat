500|$|When {{deuterium}} (hydrogen-2) is {{bombarded with}} deuterium, the fusion reaction yields either tritium (hydrogen-3) plus a proton or helium-3 plus a neutron (...) [...] This {{is one of}} the most basic fusion reactions, and the foundation of the thermonuclear weapon and <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>research</b> on controlled nuclear fusion. At that time the stability of these two reaction products was unknown, but based on existing theories Hans Bethe thought that tritium would be stable and helium-3 unstable. Alvarez proved the reverse by using his knowledge of the details of the 60-inch cyclotron operation. He tuned the machine to accelerate doubly ionized helium-3 nuclei and was able to get a beam of accelerated ions, thus using the cyclotron as a kind of super mass spectrometer. As the accelerated helium came from deep gas wells where it had been for millions of years, the helium-3 component had to be stable. Afterwards Alvarez produced the radioactive tritium using the cyclotron and the [...] reaction and measured its lifetime.|$|E
500|$|Carme Juncadella {{produced}} a systematic review of research as of 2013 {{related to the}} impact of NVC on the development of empathy. She found 13 studies which met her inclusion criteria (three were published in peer reviewed journals; ten were unpublished theses or researcher reports). Eleven of these suggested an increase in empathy subsequent to the application of NVC (five of these with evidence of statistical significance) and two did not. Juncadella notes several shortcomings of her review. None of the studies she included were randomized and only three used validated instruments. As a result she used a narrative synthesis review format, which, [...] "lacks precision," [...] but allows the summarization of studies of different types, sizes, outcome measures and aims. She suggests the primary limitation of her review is that a number of relevant studies exist that could not be included due to lack of availability. She suggests these might have significantly altered her results. Finally, she includes the following caveat: [...] "I must mention the inevitable subjectivity bias present throughout the whole review. In spite of the efforts made towards 'disciplined subjectivity'... my decisions show a degree of uncertainty and inaccuracy born via the tension between the weak evidence of the studies and my own convictions about the NVC model." [...] Her overall assessment of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>research</b> on NVC's efficacy in promoting the development of empathy is that the results are promising, but [...] "would need to be confirmed with further studies bearing stronger designs and more appropriate measures." [...] She notes that a major shortcoming of the existing research is the [...] "mismatch between the constructs of the model and the validated empathy measures" [...] and suggests that improved instruments need to be developed to adequately test NVC.|$|E

2500|$|Lithium–sulfur {{batteries}} may succeed lithium-ion cells {{because of}} their higher energy density and reduced cost {{from the use of}} sulfur. Currently the best Li–S batteries offer specific energies on the order of 500W·h/kg, significantly better than most lithium-ion batteries, which are in the range of 150 to 200W·h/kg.

2500|$|Impulsivity is {{also related}} to the abstinence, relapse, and {{treatment}} stages of substance abuse. [...] People who scored high on the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) {{were more likely to}} stop treatment for cocaine abuse. [...] Additionally, they adhered to treatment for a shorter duration than people that scored low on impulsivity. [...] Also, impulsive people had greater cravings for drugs during withdrawal periods and were more likely to relapse. [...] This effect was shown in a study where smokers that test high on the BIS had increased craving in response to smoking cues, and gave into the cravings more quickly than less impulsive smokers. [...] Taken as a whole <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>research</b> suggests that impulsive individuals are less likely to abstain from drugs and more likely to relapse earlier than less impulsive individuals.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{published}} in The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice attempted to replicate the Rind study, correcting for methodological and statistical problems identified by Dallam and others.

It, however, acknowledged the limitations of the findings (college student sample, self-report data), and did not endorse Rind's recommendation to abandon {{the use of the term}} child sexual abuse in cases of apparent consent in favor of the term adult-child sex. In their conclusion, the authors address the objection that Rind's work and their own would give support to those who deny that child sexual abuse can cause harm: [...] "The authors of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>research</b> would hesitate to support such a general statement. Instead, our results, and the results of the Rind et al. meta-analysis, can be interpreted as providing a hopeful and positive message to therapists, parents, and children.
