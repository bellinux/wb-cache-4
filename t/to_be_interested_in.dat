5|$|Mido {{stated in}} March 2004 {{that he may}} leave Marseille {{at the end of}} the 2003–04 season. An English club and several Spanish clubs were {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> signing Mido, who had been overshadowed at Marseille by Didier Drogba. Atlético Madrid, Zaragoza, Osasuna and former club Celta Vigo were all rumoured <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> signing Mido, with Atlético's interest being confirmed by their Technical Director Toni Muñoz. Meanwhile, Mido was caught speeding on the way to Marseille's game against AS Monaco, which resulted in a court hearing. Reports suggested Roma were ready to sign Mido for a fee of €9million even though Mido would be out injured for the rest of the French football season. Turkish side Beşiktaş revealed they wanted to sign him, and Mido said he was to have talks with Bobby Robson about a possible move to Newcastle United.|$|E

Jim has learned the company's financial situation from Pam, but feigns uncertainty when asked if Michael is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> a buyout. At David and Charles's orders, Jim brings {{the idea of a}} buyout to Michael. While there he also reassures Michael that Dunder Mifflin is unaware of his company's financial situation. Dwight learns from a past client that Michael has been begging customers for more money and informs Charles, but Charles refuses to listen, having been embarrassed by Dwight's earlier ideas.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the 2004–05 season, several clubs were {{reported}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> signing Nasri, most notably English clubs Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle United. In {{an effort to}} decrease the speculation, Nasri was offered a three-year professional contract by Marseille officials led by president Pape Diouf and manager José Anigo. On 13 August 2004, Nasri agreed to the contract. Marseille officials had been eager to sign Nasri to a contract {{in an attempt to}} not undergo a situation similar to the departure of Mathieu Flamini, in which the player departed the club without Marseille receiving any compensation. As a result of his professional contract, Nasri was promoted to the senior team by Anigo and assigned the number 22 shirt. He began the season playing on the club's reserve team and appeared in four matches before earning a call up to the senior team in September 2004.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{began to}} attract the {{attention}} of big-name clubs in late 1987, with Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Rangers all reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> signing him. Manchester United quickly emerged as the front runners for his signature, and Bruce publicly expressed his desire to sign for the club. The deal came close to collapsing when Norwich asked for a transfer fee of £900,000 after initially agreeing to accept £800,000, leading to Bruce refusing to play any further matches for the club, which he felt was jeopardising his dream move. On 17 December 1987, shortly before his 27th birthday, the deal was concluded and Bruce officially left Carrow Road, for a fee reported as £800,000 or £825,000. Norwich fans remembered his contribution, and in 2002 voted him into the Norwich City Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E
5|$|Geilo Airport {{was opened}} in 1985 as a {{regional}} airport. On 20 June 1986, Coast Aero Center was awarded the concession for flying from Stavanger to Geilo Airport, Dagali until 1991. The airline used a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air on the service. At the same time, Norving started operations to Oslo. The ridership from Geilo {{turned out to be}} insufficient to make a profit, and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. Widerøe and Norsk Air said there was not enough ridership for them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested.</b> <b>In</b> 1989, Coast Air received a one-year concession to operate from Geilo to Oslo and Stavanger. The company used de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. The service was soon limited to two round trips each week.|$|E

He and his friend Albrecht Haushofer shared an interest in astrology, and Hess also was keen on clairvoyance and the occult. Hess continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> aviation. He won an air race in 1934, flying a BFW M.35 in a circuit around Zugspitze Mountain and returning to the airfield at Munich {{with a time of}} 29 minutes. He placed sixth of 29 participants in a similar race held the following year. With the outbreak of World War II, Hess asked Hitler to be allowed to join the Luftwaffe as a pilot, but Hitler forbade it, and ordered him to stop flying {{for the duration of the}} war. Hess convinced him to reduce the ban to one year.|$|E

5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the lives of the celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E
5|$|Although Arsenal were rumoured to be signing Robinson at the {{beginning}} of the 2010–11 season, no move materialized. Robinson was in goal during Blackburn's 7–1 defeat away to Manchester United on 27 November, with five of the goals being scored by Dimitar Berbatov. Despite this result, Blackburn reached as high as seventh position in the league in January, following a 2–0 victory over West Bromwich Albion. This resulted in Robinson being yet again linked with a move away from Blackburn, with Aston Villa, Liverpool and former club Tottenham all rumoured <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> signing him. Following the win over West Brom, however, Blackburn's form dipped sharply, with the club eventually finishing in 15th, having won just 2 out of its last 14 matches. Robinson kept 8 clean sheets in the 36 league matches he played in, while he also conceded the 500th league goal of his career towards the end of the season, becoming the fifth goalkeeper in Premier League history to do so. He also was voted the 2011 Player of the Year by the Blackburn Rovers' supporters club.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2005–06 season, Sevilla were {{reported}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Samaras as a replacement for Júlio Baptista. While Arsenal were also looking at him after they had missed out on signing Baptista, some news organisations had reported that Arsenal had already signed Samaras and that he would join {{at the end of the}} season. However, the player's father, Ioannis Samaras said that this was untrue and that his son wanted to stay at the club for another year. Samaras scored on the opening day of the season, on 20 August, when he helped Heerenveen to a 5–4 victory over Roda JC. He picked up a minor leg injury in September, which ruled him out of Heerenveen's UEFA Cup tie against Baník Ostrava. But he returned to action on 23 September, and scored as Heerenveen beat NEC Nijmegen 2–1. On 14 December, Samaras scored as Heerenveen came back from behind to beat Levski Sofia 2–1 in the UEFA Cup. On 30 December, Samaras scored twice as Heerenveen beat Ajax 4–2. In January 2006, Arsenal and Manchester City showed interest in signing the striker. Samaras tried to get released from his contract after Heerenveen had rejected a bid from Manchester City. However, the Dutch arbitration commission ruled that he had no grounds to end his contract. Samaras scored 25 goals in 88 appearances for Heerenveen.|$|E

5|$|Early in the 2008–09 season, Strachan praised Brown for re-inventing {{himself as}} a more {{defensive}}-minded player. Despite taking on these defensive duties, Brown still contributed some goals, such as against his former club Hibernian on 25 October. Brown won the SPL Player of the Month Award for October 2008. In the January transfer window he was linked with a £9 million move to Portsmouth, with Tottenham also reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> him. Brown stated {{that he did not}} want to leave Celtic and that he was happy with the club. Later in the month, he was named by FIFA as one of their players to watch in 2009. He scored his first brace for Celtic in a 7–0 victory over St Mirren on 28 February 2009. Brown was voted Man of the Match in the 2009 League Cup Final, which Celtic won 2–0 against Rangers at Hampden Park. and was awarded the SPFA Players' Player of the Year for the 2008–09 season. Due to a suspension, he missed the final Old Firm game of the season, which Celtic lost 1–0. This defeat proved crucial as Rangers regained the championship from Celtic. He suffered an ankle injury towards the end of the season and had to take injections in order to play matches. Brown played 48 times for Celtic during the 2008–09 season, scoring seven goals.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> aviation, {{learning to}} fly the more advanced aircraft that were coming into development {{at the start of}} World War II. On 10 May 1941 he undertook a solo flight to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody {{until the end of the}} war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war criminals in 1946. During much of the trial, he claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted of crimes against peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served a life sentence. Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win him early release were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
5|$|Woolford {{rejected}} {{a new contract}} with York {{during the summer of}} 2008, with Cheltenham Town and another club believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> signing him. He eventually joined League One club Scunthorpe United for an undisclosed fee on a three-year contract on 8 August 2008, with the fee believed to be a six-figure fee with a sell-on clause. He made his Football League debut as an 87th-minute substitute in a 1–0 victory against Peterborough United on 23 August 2008. He scored four minutes into his first start for Scunthorpe against Brighton & Hove Albion on 6 September 2008, giving his team the lead, in a match which eventually finished 4–1. He came on as a 77th-minute substitute for Scunthorpe in the 2009 Football League Trophy Final on 5 April 2009, which was lost 3–2 to League Two team Luton Town after extra time. Woolford scored the winning goal for Scunthorpe in the 2009 League One play-off Final against Millwall on 24 May 2009, with a goal in the 85th minute that gave the team a 3–2 victory, and also assisting the other two goals. This resulted in promotion to the Championship for Scunthorpe and he was named man of the match.|$|E
