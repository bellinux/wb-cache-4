5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited trial {{as part of the}} legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best interests of Norway and decided to use this {{as a starting point for}} the defence.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of 100% Love (2011), Akkineni Nagarjuna decided to act and produce in an all-star film along with his father, actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao and elder son Naga Chaitanya. Nageswara Rao {{suggested}} Nagarjuna to begin the film as early as possible, because of his age. After examining and rejecting many scripts due to a perceived lack of novelty, Nagarjuna was advised by actor Nithin's father and distributor Sudhakar Reddy {{to listen to a}} script by Vikram Kumar, who was directing Nithin and Nithya Menen in Ishq (2012). Although he liked the script after the first narration, he agreed <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film only after watching Ishq before its theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Chaitanya Krishna {{confirmed}} his {{inclusion in the}} cast {{by the end of}} March 2014. In late April 2014, Naresh was chosen {{to play an important role}} in the film, which he later described as one of the best roles of his career. Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. He did not feel that he was being typecast and he accepted the role, adding that it is not often that a Malayalam actor gets a chance <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Telugu films.|$|E
5|$|Gracy Singh as Gauri. Several actresses {{had offered}} <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, but Aamir needed someone who matched the {{description}} of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das and Ameesha Patel for the role, Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film.|$|E

For example, <b>the</b> Pleading <b>in</b> English <b>Act</b> 1362 was referred to as 36 Edw.

5|$|In an {{interview}} with America Magazine in December 2016, Scorsese stated that he first read Shūsaku Endō's novel in 1989 when he was invited by Akira Kurosawa to Japan <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead role {{of one of the}} vignettes in Kurosawa's film Dreams. Scorsese described in the interview how he read the novel while traveling between airports and hotels in Japan when he was being filmed acting the part of Vincent Van Gogh in Kurosawa's film.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1933, MGM staff {{realized}} that additional footage was needed to complete the film. This involved casting an actress for the role. The production staff visited San Francisco, California, to identify an actress for a minor female part. Ray Mala offered the role of Iva to Sadie Brower, a 17-year-old half-Inupiat girl. But after her father refused to let her appear in movies, a Japanese American (who could not speak any Eskimo) was cast in the role instead. According to Brower, this woman's Eskimo {{was so bad that}} it was unintelligible. Dortuk, Elik, Kemasuk, Nunooruk, and four other Inupiat actors were brought to California <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reshoots and new scenes.|$|E
5|$|The Trost {{brothers}} asked producer Brandon Barrera <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short film.

5|$|Wilson is also {{recognized}} {{for being a}} political pioneer in techniques for determining public opinion while he held office. In the 20th century, the straw poll and scientific public opinion polls by companies including Gallup became standard parts of political campaigns and media coverage of elections. During his Senate career, Wilson pioneered straw polling by sampling the views of Massachusetts voters through in person conversations and unscientific written surveys before making his own views known. These efforts were credited with helping Wilson build coalitions, win elections, make political allies, and determine the best time <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate on issues of importance.|$|E
5|$|In early 1935, McCann was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place of Blackburn, {{who was now}} the city coroner, during the latter's absence on leave and other duties. In the same year, McCann transferred back to the CMF officers' reserve, and was also appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (Civil Division) for services to returned soldiers and sailors. He also unsuccessfully ran for election {{as the president of}} the state branch of the RSSILA in the same year, became a justice of the peace, and was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. In 1938, McCann successfully ran for election as a councillor in the City of Burnside, and was re-elected as a state vice-president of the RSSILA, continuing in this role until 1949.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the cast}} in Vampyr were not {{professional}} actors. Jan Hieronimko, who plays the village doctor, was found on a late night metro train in Paris. When approached <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, Hieronimko stared blankly and did not reply. Hieronimko later contacted Dreyer's crew and agreed to join the film. Many of the other non-professional actors in the film were found in similar fashion in shops and cafes. The only professional actors in the film were Maurice Schutz, who plays the Lord of the Manor, and Sybille Schmitz, who plays his daughter Léone. Many crew members of Vampyr had worked with Dreyer on his previous film The Passion of Joan of Arc. Returning crew members included cinematographer Rudolph Maté and art director Hermann Warm.|$|E

5|$|Before leaving England in 1189, Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp's {{hands and}} {{appointed}} him jointly with Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, {{to the office}} of Chief Justiciar, at that time not strictly a judicial office. Instead, the justiciar was the person entrusted with much of the king's authority when the king was outside the kingdom, able <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> king's name. Along with Puiset, the king named Hugh Bardulf, William Briwerre, Geoffrey fitz Peter, and William Marshall as associates in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp. As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the shires on judicial visits, even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary. Longchamp and Puiset were unable to work together, and so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the River Humber to Hugh, and authority south of the river to Longchamp. Historian's opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time, or if in theory the two were supposed to co-equal in their respective spheres. By June, Longchamp had eased Puiset out of power and the justiciar's office. He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope Clement III at this time. Supposedly Richard paid 1,500marks (£1,000) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp.|$|E
5|$|The Rock {{lost the}} WWF Championship to Angle at No Mercy in October. Around this time, The Rock feuded with Rikishi and {{defeated}} him at Survivor Series. The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell {{match for the}} WWF Championship at Armageddon, which Kurt Angle won to retain the title. On December 18 on Raw, The Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, then losing it back to them the next night at a SmackDown! taping. In 2001, The Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out in February, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time. The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Mr. McMahon, who interfered on his behalf. On the next night's Raw Is War, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H came to the ring with a sledgehammer and it seemed he would help The Rock, because of the rivalry between Austin and Triple H (and an argument with McMahon earlier in the night), but he attacked him instead, allying with McMahon and Austin. Austin and Triple H formed a tag team called The Power Trip, while The Rock was indefinitely suspended. Johnson used this time off <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movie The Mummy Returns.|$|E
5|$|Upon Carroll's {{return to}} Maryland, Hart was incensed {{both at the}} threat to his own power {{and the idea of}} a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration {{confirming}} the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined {{when he came to the}} defense of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.|$|E
