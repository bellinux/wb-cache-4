5|$|The U.S public's {{perception}} of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated President John F.

5|$|A second labor action {{took place}} in July 1935, as {{construction}} on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike.

5|$|After the war, {{he moved}} back to Abingdon. During Reconstruction, Robertson {{was a member of}} the Committee of Nine, led by Alexander H. H.

The committee successfully negotiated with <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> have that clause voted on separately, so that Virginians would accept and ratify the new constitution and so rejoin the Union. He died on February 11, 1888, and was buried at Cobbs, Chesterfield County.|$|E
5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike, and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He called on <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> {{take full responsibility}} for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended {{that the federal government}} be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E

5|$|On June 22, 2015, Rachel Notley, Premier of the {{province}} of Alberta, issued a formal apology as a Ministerial Statement {{in a bid to}} begin to address the wrongs done by the government to the Indigenous peoples of Alberta and the rest of Canada.

5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> legislate civil {{rights for the}} States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{gun control}} advocates have voiced {{concern over the}} {{perceived}} loophole in legislation, and campaigned to require background checks and record-keeping for all gun sales.

5|$|The {{case has}} been cited in {{numerous}} law reviews.

5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. The plaintiff {{in the case}} was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818.

A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>to</b> compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E
