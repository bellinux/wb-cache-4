Section 2 starts with {{an explanation of}} the theory of monopolistic bottlenecks, which {{can be used as a}} basis for distinguishing between parts of a network where competition functions efficiently and those that enjoy stable, network-specific market power. Section 3 explores the opportunities for potential and active competition on the markets for transport services, while Section 4 explains the potential for auction competition in respect of air traffic and <b>train</b> <b>control</b> systems. <b>Section</b> 5 is devoted to regulation in connection with access to transport infrastructure, including the relationship between disaggregated regulation of bottlenecks and the essential facilities theory, and the development of an appropriate approach towards regulation of access charges.

40|$|The {{following}} {{report will}} introduce <b>train</b> <b>control</b> systems applied in railway lines in Japan. The report also {{will show that}} <b>train</b> <b>control</b> systems have been developed and these are classified four levels from “Level 0 ” to “Level 3 ”. We call these <b>train</b> <b>control</b> systems “East Japan <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> system ” (EJTC). “Level 0 ” system, the Automatic Train Stop device (ATS-S), was introduced into Japanese National Railways (JNR) to prevent train collision. This system has been replacing with Pattern type ATS (ATS-P); “Level 1 ” system. ATS-P was developed to eliminate the weaknesses of the ATS-S. The Automatic <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) system was originally developed to support safe, super-high speed railway transportation utilizing Japan’s Shinkansen and introduced into conventional commuter lines to shorten the train interval. However {{it was difficult to}} realize efficient operations in high-density lines due to limitations of existing ATC technology. Then the D-ATC system (Digital and Decentralized ATC) had been developed as “Level 2 ” system using ADS technology. In D-ATC system, the device on each train autonomously calculates permitted speed of each train. This system is introduced to Keihn-tohoku Line as D-ATC and Shinkansen Line as DS-ATC (Digital Communication & Control for Shinkansen-ATC). Recent remarkable progress in the field of information technology makes possible a new <b>train</b> <b>control</b> system where <b>train</b> itself detects its location and communicates with other trains through radio transmission. Therefore, we have been developing the “Level 3 ” <b>train</b> <b>control</b> system called ATAC...|$|R
