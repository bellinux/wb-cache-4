500|$|The Freemason Karl Leonhard Reinhold, in the 1780s, drew {{upon and}} {{modified}} Warburton's claims {{in an effort}} to reconcile Freemasonry's traditional origin story, which traces Freemasonry back to ancient Israel, with its enthusiasm for Egyptian imagery. He claimed that the sentence [...] "I am that I am", spoken by <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>God</b> in the Book of Exodus, had a pantheistic meaning. He compared it with an Egyptian inscription on a veiled statue of Isis recorded by the Roman-era authors Plutarch and Proclus, which said [...] "I am all that is, was, and shall be," [...] which led him to believe that Isis was a pantheistic personification of Nature. According to Reinhold, it was this pantheistic belief system that Moses imparted to the Israelites, so that Isis and the Jewish and Christian conception of God shared a common origin.|$|E

Professor Steven Bayme said gnosticism would be better characterized as anti-Judaism. Recent research into the origins of Gnosticism shows a strong Jewish influence, particularly from Hekhalot literature.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this point}} Elijah proposes a direct {{test of the}} powers of Baal and <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>God.</b> The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of Asherah are summoned to Mount Carmel. Two altars are built, one for Baal and one for God. Wood is laid on the altars. Two oxen are {{slaughtered}} and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. [...] "At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, ‘Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.’" [...] They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law). They continue praying until evening without success.|$|E

2500|$|Constantine's nephew Emperor Julian granted {{permission}} in {{the year}} 363 for the Jews to rebuild the Temple. In a letter attributed to Julian he wrote to the Jews that [...] "This you ought to do, in order that, when I have successfully concluded the war in Persia, I may rebuild by my own efforts the sacred city of Jerusalem, which {{for so many years}} you have longed to see inhabited, and may bring settlers there, and, together with you, may glorify the Most High God therein." [...] Julian saw <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>God</b> as a fitting member of the pantheon of gods he believed in, and he was also a strong opponent of Christianity. Church historians wrote that the Jews began to clear away the structures and rubble on the Temple Mount but were thwarted, first by a great earthquake, and then by miracles that included fire springing from the earth. However, no contemporary Jewish sources mention this episode directly.|$|E
2500|$|Elijah ( [...] , meaning [...] "My God is Yahu/Jah") or Elias ( [...] ; [...] Elías; [...] Elyāe; Arabic: إلياس or إليا, Ilyās or Ilyā) was {{a prophet}} and a miracle worker {{who lived in}} the {{northern}} kingdom of Israel during the reign of Ahab (9th century BC), according to the Books of Kings in the Hebrew Bible. In 1 Kings 18, Elijah defended the worship of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>God</b> over that of the Canaanite deity Baal. God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including resurrection (raising the dead), bringing fire down from the sky, and entering Heaven alive [...] "by a whirlwind". He is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as [...] "the sons of the prophets". Following his ascension, Elisha his disciple and most devoted assistant took over his role as leader of this school. The Book of Malachi prophesies Elijah's return [...] "before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD", making him a harbinger of the Messiah and of the eschaton in various faiths that revere the Hebrew Bible. References to Elijah appear in Ecclesiasticus, the New Testament, the Mishnah and Talmud, the Quran, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and Bahá'í writings.|$|E
2500|$|According to modernist higher {{criticism}} {{scholars who}} emerged since the 18th century in Protestant Europe: Early Christianity was a Jewish eschatological faith. The Book of Acts {{reports that the}} early followers continued daily Temple attendance and traditional Jewish home prayer. Other passages in the New Testament gospels reflect a similar observance of traditional Jewish piety such as fasting, reverence for the Torah (commonly translated as [...] "the Law" [...] in English translations of the Bible) and observance of Jewish holy days. The earliest form of Jesus' religion is best understood in this context. However, there was great diversity in local variations, as each succeeded or failed in different ways. Regardless, Jesus was a pious Jew, worshipping <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>God,</b> preaching interpretations of Jewish law and accepted as the Jewish Messiah by his disciples. Proponents of higher criticism claim that regardless of how one interprets the mission of Jesus, {{that he must be}} understood in context as a 1st-century Palestinian Jew, stemming from the 12 tribes of the Holy Land. Orthodox and Catholic Christianity, including the Church Fathers, on the other hand, tend to place a sharp distinction between Israel (which the Church claims to be the heir of) and the Pharisees (i.e. - [...] "Jews", forefathers of modern Judaism), as well as placing a central focus on his divine nature.|$|E
50|$|Some Christians {{believed}} {{instead that}} Christ, {{rather than being}} <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> messiah, was <b>God</b> made flesh, who died {{for the sins of}} humanity, and that faith in Jesus Christ offered eternal life (see Christology).|$|R

2500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was influenced}} by the ancient mystery initiations dedicated to Isis that were performed in the Greco-Roman world. Although these rites were developed in Hellenistic or Roman times, under the influence of earlier Greco-Roman mystery rites, both classical authors and 18th-century scholars assumed them to have been age-old features of ancient Egyptian religion. Many Freemasons, members of a European fraternal organization that attained its modern form in the early 18th century, adopted Egyptian motifs and came to believe their rituals could {{be traced back to the}} mysteries of Isis. One Freemason in the 1780s, Karl Leonhard Reinhold, tried to reconcile Freemasonry's traditional origin story, which traces Freemasonry back to ancient Israel, with its enthusiasm for Egyptian themes. To do so, he interpreted the first statement on the statue at Sais, [...] "I am all that has been and is and shall be," [...] as a declaration of pantheism, in which nature and divinity are identical. Reinhold claimed the public face of Egyptian religion was polytheistic, but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal the deeper, pantheistic truth to elite initiates. He also said the statement [...] "I am that I am", spoken by <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>God</b> in the Book of Exodus, meant the same as the Saite inscription and indicated that Judaism was a descendant of the ancient Egyptian belief system. Under the influence of Reinhold's interpretation, other Freemasons came to see the veiled Isis as a symbol of an impenetrable enigma, representing truth and being as well as nature, a deity that, as Assmann puts it, was regarded as [...] "too all-encompassing to have a name." ...|$|E
5000|$|This mistaken {{connection}} of Sabazios and Sabaos {{has often been}} repeated. In a similar vein, Plutarch maintained that the Jews worshipped Dionysus, and that the day of Sabbath was a festival of Sabazius. Plutarch also discusses the identification of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>God</b> with the [...] "Egyptian" [...] Typhon, an identification which he later rejects, however. The monotheistic Hypsistarians worshipped the Most High under this name, {{which may have been}} a form of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>God.</b>|$|E

And the animals which were allowed, it is only for being necessary at those times. It is like wine; though it is allowed, the Bible calls one who avoid it (Nazirite), sacred".|$|R
50|$|Among Pettinatos {{controversial}} claims, {{he suggested}} {{that there was a}} change in the theophoric names shown in many of the tablets from El to Yah, indicated in the example of the transition from Mikail to Mikaya. This change is represented by the cuneiform sign NI which Pettinato read as ya, he regards this as evidence for an early use of the divine name Yah, however, Pettinato doesnt conclude that this is <b>the</b> same <b>Jewish</b> <b>God</b> Yahweh (YHWH). Jean Bottéro has suggested that this shift may instead indicate the Akkadian god Ea (Ia).|$|R

5000|$|Some Roman writers used Caelus or Caelum {{as a way}} {{to express}} the monotheistic god of Judaism. Juvenal {{identifies}} <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>god</b> with Caelus as the highest heaven (summum caelum), saying that Jews worship the numen of Caelus; Petronius uses similar language. Florus has a rather odd passage describing the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Jerusalem as housing a [...] "sky" [...] (caelum) under a golden vine, which has been taken as an uncomprehending attempt to grasp the presence of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>god.</b> A golden vine, perhaps the one mentioned, was sent by the Hasmonean king Aristobulus to Pompeius Magnus after his defeat of Jerusalem, and was later displayed in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus.|$|E
