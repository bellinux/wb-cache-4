5|$|Klaus {{manages to}} escape {{and finds a}} hidden tower in Olaf's house that, if {{positioned}} correctly, can shine light. He discovers this way that it was Olaf who set <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> their old house. He uses this window to burn the marriage certificate before the marriage is officially complete, leading to Olaf's arrest. However, a jury of his peers overturn his sentence and Olaf vanishes.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{catastrophe}}: Astour says {{a natural}} catastrophe caused the blaze which ended the archive period. He says the destruction {{was limited to}} the area of the royal palace and there is no convincing evidence of looting. He dates <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> c. 2290 BC (Middle Chronology).|$|E
5|$|According to Brelsford, {{the elderly}} Harrison Clark {{remained}} highly respected among {{the indigenous people}} and was sometimes called upon to settle disputes. His last job was personnel manager at a local mine. He dedicated his final years to the writing of {{a book about his}} life, the manuscript for which was lost when his house burned down. Clark alleged that the BSAC orchestrated <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> stop him from publishing unflattering information about the early days of Company rule. He died from heart disease in Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67, and was buried in the Protestant section of the town cemetery. The modest savings he possessed {{at the time of his}} death were left to his sister in Port Elizabeth.|$|E

50|$|Speculation {{ascribed}} <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>to</b> various {{natural and}} supernatural causes. <b>The</b> <b>fires</b> stopped in August. In 2008 investigators concluded that <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> were arson cases.|$|R
50|$|Farmers using <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> clear {{land for}} {{planting}} combined with extreme drought caused the plants to dry out, allowing <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>to</b> run rampant.|$|R
5|$|According to the Accident Investigation Board Norway, {{the rescue}} work was {{hampered}} by, among other things: lack of fire crew at Voss {{to drive the}} fire engine, a defective helicopter bucket, and a three-hour delay from <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> a rail carriage with water was sent from Ål. Also, the fire carriage from Voss arrived six hours after the accident was reported. Concerns were raised regarding the fire hazards of wooden snow tunnels, and the National Rail Administration admitted {{that they should be}} made of a more fire-proof material, such as concrete or steel. Following the accident, the National Rail Administration decided that all welding would have to be monitored for several hours after completion of the work.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{under the}} PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, {{the day after}} <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>to</b> {{determine the cause of}} the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders.|$|E
5|$|At the {{northeast}} corner of Cross and River Streets stands the Thompson Block, a historic building which was used as barracks in the Civil War. The Thompson Block suffered a bad fire early in the morning on September 23, 2009, and the temporary supports reaching into adjacent streets, installed shortly after <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> stabilize the structure, blocked westbound traffic on Cross Street for more than three months and have resulted in legal tussles between the city and the property owner.|$|E
50|$|The ERT {{isolated}} as many fuel {{sources as}} possible and allowed smaller <b>fires</b> <b>to</b> burn off <b>the</b> uncontained hydrocarbons. It took {{a total of five}} days for all of <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>to</b> be extinguished. For a period of time, <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> blazed up <b>to</b> 800 ft in the air.|$|R

5|$|By Monday May 8, {{the fire}} {{perimeter}} extended from west of Highway 154, {{in the hills}} burned in the 1990 Painted Cave Fire, across the front country of the Santa Ynez Mountains east through Mission Canyon, Rattlesnake Canyon, and into the hills above Montecito, reaching the area burned by the Gap Fire in July 2008 and the Tea Fire in November 2008. Intense sundowner winds caused <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> spread rapidly during evening and nighttime hours during its first three days.|$|E
5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E
5|$|Fires in the {{workings}} hampered rescue efforts, {{and it took}} several days before they were under control. It took six weeks {{for most of the}} bodies to be recovered and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E

25|$|Who was fired: David, due {{to being}} judged {{to have made}} the biggest {{mistakes}} {{that led to the}} team's failure. Will, however, was warned after <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>to</b> be 'very careful now'.|$|R
50|$|Table Mountain Fire - 42312 acre. Located east of U.S. Route 97 near Blewett Pass in Kittitas County, <b>the</b> Table Mountain <b>Fire</b> {{threatened}} {{homes and}} historic structures near Liberty, Washington. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> grew <b>to</b> become contiguous with <b>the</b> Peavine Canyon <b>Fire</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north.|$|R
5|$|The Nazis took {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> advance their own political aims. The Reichstag Fire Decree, passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the German Communist Party were suppressed, and some 4,000 communist party members were arrested. Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but Rudolf Diels, head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order. Some researchers, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are {{of the opinion that}} the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence of}} a burglary.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the smoke {{indicates}} the results to the people assembled in St Peter's Square. Dark smoke (fumata nera) indicates that the ballot {{did not result in}} an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope was chosen. Originally, in the event a pope was not elected, damp straw was added to <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> create dark smoke. In the event a new pope was elected, the ballots were burned alone, creating white smoke.|$|E
50|$|The mortar {{consists}} of a smooth-bored barrel with a breech and a breech-block frame, a frame with shock absorbers, mount with training and equilibrating mechanisms, a two-wheel traveling carriage with the suspension, a boom for changing from <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traveling configuration, a baseplate and a towing bar with a lunette. The sights are carried separately and are mounted on the mortar only when <b>firing.</b> <b>The</b> shock absorbers are used to protect <b>the</b> sights from <b>firing</b> vibrations and also provide {{the link between the}} ordnance and the mount. It is also used when the mounting returns to the loading position after <b>firing.</b> <b>The</b> boom provides stability when firing and also has two winches to convert the mortar from <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traveling configuration.|$|R

5|$|The plugs-out test {{began on}} the morning of January 27, 1967, and {{immediately}} was plagued with problems. First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Algeciras on 9 July, the {{combined}} squadron {{was ready to}} sail again on 12 July, departing Algeciras to the westwards during the evening. The British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, having effected its own hasty repairs, set off in pursuit. Finding that his ships were falling behind, Saumarez instructed his captains to separate and attack {{the combined}} squadron as best they were able to. The fastest ship was HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, which sailed through the Spanish rearguard as a moonless night fell. Superb fired on the rearmost ships, setting the 112-gun Real Carlos on fire and capturing the Saint Antoine. Unable to determine friend from foe in the darkness, Real Carlos inadvertently engaged the Spanish ship San Hermenegildo, spreading <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> its compatriot. Both ships subsequently exploded with enormous loss of life. A second stage of the battle then developed, as HMS Venerable took {{the lead of the}} British line, attacking the rearmost French ship Formidable under Captain Amable Troude. In a furious and protracted engagement, Venerable suffered heavy damage and was driven ashore, allowing the remainder of the French force to return to Cadiz without further fighting.|$|E
5|$|California {{governor}} Jerry Brown {{declared a}} state of emergency for the city of San Francisco on August 23, after the fire caused damage to the power infrastructure serving the Bay Area, causing two out of the existing three hydroelectric power plants to shut down. The fire also threatened the Hetch Hetchy reservoir, the main source of water for San Francisco, providing up to 85% of the city's supply to 2.6 million customers. On August 26, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission moved water away from Hetch Hetchy into downstream reservoirs located in San Mateo and Alameda Counties as a precautionary measure, but did not expect <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> cause any disruption to the city's water supply. The fire advanced to within a mile of Hetch Hetchy by Monday, August 26, which was a concern to O'Shaughnessy Dam officials due to ash falling in the water.|$|E
50|$|By September 28, <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> {{had spread}} <b>to</b> 12000 acres and was 18 percent contained.

5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by {{cremation}}. The dead person's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> the corpse {{at the head}} for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|McCudden set {{out across}} the English Channel. Unsure of the dispositions on the ground after the German advance he checked the {{airfield}} he suspected to be Boffles but found it empty. Flying in heavy mist he decided to head to Auxi-le-Château, France, to get directions from the RAF personnel stationed there. He approached Corporal W.H. Burdett and L. E Vallins of 52 Squadron. Burdett had served with McCudden in 3 Squadron back in 1915. Burdett did not recognise him in his flying gear. They marked his map and McCudden returned to his machine. Around 90 seconds after takeoff from Auxi-le-Château, the S.E.5a plunged into the ground. 8 Squadron's Corporal W.H. Howard was on the scene within minutes and fought through <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> free McCudden who was lying {{next to one of}} the wings—he had not worn his safety belt. Burdett followed and recognised the pilot as soon as his headgear had been removed. He was taken to No. 21 Casualty clearing station and diagnosed with a fractured skull. He did not regain consciousness and died at 20:00.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2003, the {{original}} {{wing of the}} Briarcliff Lodge caught fire. The owner, Barrington Venture, had planned to raze the 100-year-old building and construct a 385-unit senior living center, which was opposed by local historians and architects. The fire thus ended the preservation effort. The fire started near the main entrance and was suppressed by mid-day; it was deemed suspicious by fire officials. Residents began calling at 6:37 am, after noticing smoke coming from the site. The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department {{was the first to}} arrive, at 6:40 am, later followed by Ossining, Sleepy Hollow, Millwood, Pleasantville, Chappaqua, Croton, and Pocantico Hills, totaling about 150 firefighters. The fire also spread to the lodge's 9-story west wing, through its wooden attic even though a concrete block firewall stood between both sections. The fire departments contained <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> prevent it from spreading north or to the village water tower, and therefore saved the water tower and village and commercial radio antennae. After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which sifted through the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson. Contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E
