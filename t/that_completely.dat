5|$|In regular service, the Pioneer Zephyr had {{its share}} of accidents. In 1939 it was {{involved}} in a head-on collision with a freight train <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed the cab. The train was rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident strengthened the desire of locomotive designers to move the cab back {{from the front of the}} locomotive to above a large nose, as on EMD F-unit and EMD E-unit locomotives.|$|E

5|$|The unusual genus, Entovalva, is endosymbiotic, {{being found}} only in the {{oesophagus}} of sea cucumbers. It has mantle folds <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> surround its small valves. When the sea cucumber sucks in sediment, the bivalve allows the water to pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles. To prevent itself from being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The sea cucumber is unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1929, Hiei was {{converted}} to a gunnery training ship to avoid being scrapped {{under the terms of}} the Washington Naval Treaty. She served as Emperor Hirohito's transport in the mid-1930s. Starting in 1937, she underwent a full-scale reconstruction <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> rebuilt her superstructure, upgraded her powerplant, and equipped her with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now fast enough to accompany Japan's growing fleet of aircraft carriers, she was reclassified as a fast battleship. On the eve of the US entry into World War II, she sailed as part of Vice-Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's Combined Fleet, escorting the six carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor on 7December 1941.|$|E
5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E

5|$|Loxton had an {{unproductive}} {{time during the}} 1950–51 Australian season. He lost his Test place after three matches, and in Sheffield Shield games his highest score for the season was just 62. In the first match of the season, he made four for Victoria against Freddie Brown's touring team, a portent of the coming season. However, he did bounce back in the final match before the Tests, scoring 62 and 37 and taking 3/24 against New South Wales. The First Test of the Ashes series at Brisbane was decided largely by a tropical storm <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> {{changed the nature of}} the pitch after the first day. The Australian all-rounder had by then been the victim of a spectacular catch by England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans, making 24 in Australia's 228. He picked up five catches—his first Test catches in his tenth match—as the Australians surrounded the English batsmen, who made 7/68 on the sticky wicket before Brown declared to force the Australian batsmen to suffer on the treacherous surface. Loxton was out for a duck in the second innings, unable to cope with the conditions, as did most of his compatriots. Australia collapsed to 3/0 before reaching 7/32, at which point Hassett declared after 78 minutes of batting. England fell to 6/30 at stumps in pursuit of 193. Twenty wickets had fallen in four hours, while only 102 runs had been scored. Australia eventually won the match by 71 runs.|$|E
5|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} to be representative of the Polish nation, its members being recruited from all parties and social classes (the only notable exception being communists sent by the Soviets, and the Soviet-created People's Army). The Home Army's growth was largely based on integrating, into its ranks, scores of smaller resistance organizations. Most other Polish underground armed organizations were incorporated into the Home Army (though they retained varying degrees of autonomy). The largest organization merged into the Home Army was the leftist Bataliony Chłopskie (Peasants' Battalions), about 1943-44. Parts of the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne (National Armed Forces) also came to be subordinated to the Home Army. As a result, individual Home Army units varied substantially in their political outlooks (notably in their attitudes toward ethnic minorities and toward the Soviets). The largest group <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> refused to join the Home Army was the pro-Soviet, communist People's Army, which at its height in 1944 numbered 30,000 people.|$|E

25|$|British rule brought several {{enduring}} social, economic, {{cultural and}} administrative changes <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> transformed the once-agrarian society. Most importantly, the British rule highlighted out-group {{differences among the}} country's myriad ethnic groups.

25|$|According to a {{study by}} the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council, levees and floodwalls {{surrounding}} New Orleans—no matter how large or sturdy—cannot provide absolute protection against overtopping or failure in extreme events. Levees and floodwalls should be viewed as a way to reduce risks from hurricanes and storm surges, not as measures <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> eliminate risk. For structures in hazardous areas and residents who do not relocate, the committee recommended major floodproofing measures—such as elevating the first floor of buildings to at least the 100-year flood level.|$|E

To evade heavy smoke <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> blocked the view, Azov dropped anchor {{to the port}} of {{its place in the}} line. The maneuver created a gap between Azov and Albion, wide enough to fit four Turkish frigates. Eventually they encircled Azov and Albion and both ships suffered abnormally high damage.

25|$|The {{strength}} of an acid refers to its ability or tendency {{to lose a}} proton (H+). A strong acid is one <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> ionizes (dissociates) in a solution (provided there is sufficient solvent). In water, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves yielding one mole of H+ (as hydronium ion H3O+) and one mole of the conjugate base, A−. Essentially, none of the non-ionized acid HA remains. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In aqueous solution, each of these essentially ionizes 100%.|$|E
25|$|A related {{notion is}} the one of a minimum {{bounding}} circle, which is the smallest circle <b>that</b> <b>completely</b> contains the polygon within it. Not every polygon has a circumscribed circle, as the vertices of a polygon {{do not need to}} all lie on a circle, but every polygon has a unique minimum bounding circle, which may be constructed by a linear time algorithm. Even if a polygon has a circumscribed circle, it may not coincide with its minimum bounding circle; for example, for an obtuse triangle, the minimum bounding circle has the longest side as diameter and does not pass through the opposite vertex.|$|E
