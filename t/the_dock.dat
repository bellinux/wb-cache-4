40|$|Existing {{self-reconfigurable}} robots achieve {{connections and}} disconnections by a separate drive of <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> system. In this paper, {{we present a}} new docking system with which the connections and disconnections are driven by locomotion actuators, {{without the need for}} a separate drive, which reduces the weight and the complexity of the modules. This self-reconfigurable robot consists of two types of fundamental modules, i. e., active and passive modules. By <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> system, two types of connections are formed with the fundamental modules, and <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> and undocking actions are achieved through simple control with less sensory feedback. This paper describes the design of the robotic modules, <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> system, <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> process, and <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> force analysis. An experiment is performed to demonstrate the self-reconfigurable robot with <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> system...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Liverpool <b>Docks</b> were {{controlled}} by <b>the</b> <b>Docks</b> Committee between 1825 and 1857. During this period, the total area of <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> was increased from 82 to 192 acre, {{and the length}} of the quays was 15 mi by 1857. Most of the increase was achieved by the construction of new docks, but they also purchased <b>the</b> Manchester <b>Dock</b> in 1851.

50|$|<b>The</b> Pirs <b>docking</b> {{compartment}} was {{manufactured by}} RKK Energia. <b>The</b> <b>Docking</b> Compartment {{is similar to}} <b>the</b> Mir <b>Docking</b> Module used on the Mir space station. <b>The</b> <b>docking</b> compartment's planned lifetime {{as part of the}} station was five years.|$|R
5|$|The site {{chosen for}} <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> {{to be built}} on was an area of land bordered by Salthouse Dock to the east, the {{entrance}} channel to Canning Dock {{to the north and}} by Duke's Dock to the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a pub, several houses and <b>the</b> <b>Dock</b> Trustee's Dockyard. Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of 'Navvies' were employed to dig out <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> basin and construct the new river wall. <b>The</b> <b>dock</b> basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to 'lay-up'.|$|E
5|$|At the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats {{could enter}} Fabian Bay, and named the area Port Tennant. His {{terminus}} was destroyed when the Prince of Wales Dock was {{constructed by the}} Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian Bay, and so a lock was constructed to enable boats to reach tidal water by passing through <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> and a wharf for the canal was constructed at {{the eastern end of}} <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal boats to enter <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one. A new branch of the canal was built in 1909, which included a lock into the newly constructed Kings Dock, where a lay-by berth was provided on its north side.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>docks</b> were {{originally}} built and managed {{by a number}} of competing private companies.

The PLA constructed the last of <b>the</b> <b>docks,</b> <b>the</b> King George V, in 1921, as well as greatly expanding <b>the</b> Tilbury <b>docks.</b>|$|R
5|$|There was a {{start of}} a {{demographic}} shift downwards when the Royal Navy pulled out of Deptford, and <b>the</b> <b>docks</b> moved into storage and freight.

5|$|Despite the {{official}} opening occurring in 1846, {{the construction of}} the Albert Dock was not fully completed until 1847. In 1848, a new dock office was built and <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> itself was upgraded to feature a hydraulic cargo handling hoist system, {{the first of its kind}} in the world. Over the next decade several more buildings where added including houses for the piermaster, his assistant & the warehouse superintendent; and a cooperage. Warehousing in <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> was also expanded to meet the increasing demand by joining together the eastern and western ends of the Southern Stack.|$|E

40|$|Keywords- mobile robots, {{wireless}} RF interface, HOLTEK microchip, laser {{range finder}} Abstract—The article develops an auto-charging system for mobile robots, and programs a new docking processing to enhance successful rate. The system contains a docking station and a mobile robot. <b>The</b> <b>docking</b> station contains a docking structure, a limit switch, a charger, two power detection modules and two wireless RF modules. The mobile robot contains a power detection module (voltage and current), an auto-switch, a wireless RF module, a charging connection structure and a laser range finder. <b>The</b> <b>docking</b> structure is designed with one active {{degree of freedom}} and two passive degrees of freedom. The power detection module is controlled by HOLTEK microchip. We calculate the power values using the redundant management method and statistical signal prediction method, and develop an auto-recharging processing using multiple sensors and laser range finder for mobile robots. The processing can enhances the successful rate to guide the mobile robot moving to <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> station. In <b>the</b> experimental results, {{the power of the}} mobile robot is under the threshold value. The mobile robot transmits the charging command to <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> station via wireless RF interface, and searches the landmark of <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> station using laser range finder (SICK). The laser range finder guides the mobile robot approach to <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> station. <b>The</b> mobile robot touches <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> station to trig the power detection device. <b>The</b> <b>docking</b> station supplies <b>the</b> power to the mobile robot by charger, and detects the current and voltage values of the charging processing. The charging current of <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> station is under the threshold value. <b>The</b> <b>docking</b> station turns off the charging current, and trigs the mobile robot leaving <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> station via wireless RF interface...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was the restoration of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys {{carried out by the}} MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E
5|$|The Commandos were aided {{in their}} {{planning}} for the operation by Captain Bill Pritchard of the Royal Engineers, who had pre-war experience as an apprentice in the Great Western Railway dockyards and whose father was <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> master of Cardiff Docks.

30|$|To {{carry out}} <b>the</b> blind <b>docking</b> protocol, <b>the</b> entire {{surface of the}} CYP 3 A 4 was divided into 90 focus docking regions.

Clustering of <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> poses was performed using a 0.2 nm RMSD cut-off. To identify the most preferred binding locations, we combined all docking results and ranked them with the lowest binding energy of <b>the</b> largest <b>docking</b> cluster. As we are not only interested in the binding energies as indicators for adequate binding, we defined a hit as <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> run that includes at least 20 % of the total population in its largest cluster. Finally, the solvent-exposed atoms that were used to construct <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> boxes have been used as markers for the binding locations.|$|R
