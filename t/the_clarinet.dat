5|$|<b>The</b> <b>clarinet</b> is {{prominent}} in Bulgarian wedding music also; {{it is an}} offshoot of Roma/Romani traditional music. Ivo Papazov is a well-known clarinetist in this genre. In Moravian dulcimer bands, <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> is usually the only wind instrument among string instruments.|$|E
5|$|The clarinet's {{place in}} the jazz {{ensemble}} was usurped by the saxophone, which projects a more powerful sound and uses a less complicated fingering system. The requirement for an increased speed of execution in modern jazz also did not favour <b>the</b> <b>clarinet,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> did not entirely disappear. A few players such as Buddy DeFranco, Tony Scott, and Jimmy Giuffre emerged during the 1950s playing bebop or other styles. A little later, Eric Dolphy (on bass clarinet), Perry Robinson, John Carter, Theo Jörgensmann, and others used <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> in free jazz. The French composer and clarinetist Jean-Christian Michel initiated a jazz-classical cross-over on <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> with the drummer Kenny Clarke.|$|E
5|$|Clarinet choir, which {{features}} {{a large number of}} clarinets playing together, usually involves a range of different members of <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> family (see Extended family of clarinets). The homogeneity of tone across the different members of <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> family produces an effect with some similarities to a human choir.|$|E

5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., {{and by the time}} of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> was a standard fixture in the orchestra.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>clarinet</b> {{is widely}} used as a solo instrument. The {{relatively}} late evolution of <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> (when compared to other orchestral woodwinds) has left solo repertoire from the Classical period and later, but few works from the Baroque era. Many clarinet concertos have been written to showcase the instrument, with the concerti by Mozart, Copland, and Weber being well known.|$|E
5000|$|Like the quintet by Mozart, {{the strings}} begin the piece. Only several bars after <b>the</b> <b>clarinet's</b> entry is it finally {{made clear that}} the key of the music is B minor rather than D major (the latter being the key in which the {{exposition}} ends, leading smoothly into the repeat of <b>the</b> <b>clarinet's</b> opening). This movement sets an autumnal mood {{for the rest of the}} composition.|$|R

5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating {{that of a}} cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while <b>the</b> <b>clarinet,</b> with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E
5|$|Theobald Boehm did not {{directly}} invent the key system of <b>the</b> <b>clarinet.</b> Boehm was a flautist who created the key system that is now used for the transverse flute. Klosé and Buffet applied Boehm's system to <b>the</b> <b>clarinet.</b> Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to that key system because {{it was based on}} that used for flute.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} has been adopted {{recently}} in Albanian folklore (around the 18th century), <b>the</b> <b>clarinet,</b> or gërneta as it is called, {{is one of the}} most important instruments in Albania, especially in the central and southern areas. <b>The</b> <b>clarinet</b> plays a crucial role in saze (folk) ensembles that perform in weddings and other celebrations. It is worth mentioning that the kaba (an instrumental Albanian Isopolyphony included in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list) is characteristic of these ensembles. Prominent Albanian clarinet players include Selim Leskoviku, Gaqo Lena, Remzi Lela (Çobani), Laver Bariu (Ustai), and Nevruz Nure (Lulushi i Korçës).|$|E

40|$|The Interloping Beguiler is an nineteen-minute concerto in four {{movements}} {{for bass}} clarinet solo and orchestra. The title {{refers to the}} role of the solo instrument, which continually thrusts itself into the affairs of the orchestra, deceiving and diverting the members of the orchestra away from their task of performing a "serious" orchestral composition. <b>The</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> portrays a comical, cartoon-like character whose awkward, and sometimes goofy, interjections cause chaos. Attempts are made by various members of the orchestra, especially the horns, to regain control of the work, but <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> always succeeds in its distracting antics. By the final movement of the composition, <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> has propelled <b>the</b> work into a cartoon-like landscape of quickly changing textures, dissonant intervals, and overlapping themes. The first movement, Introduction, sets the serious tone of the music to follow, or so it would seem. The entrance of <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> immediately changes this texture with its out-of-rhythm alternations between high and low pitches. This gesture provides a glimpse into the personality of <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet,</b> an instrument here to mislead the members of the orchestra. Deception truly begins in the second movement, The Interloping Initiates. <b>The</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> starts <b>the</b> movement with a driving theme and is immediately supported by the orchestra. As the movement progresses, <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> quickly begins altering the theme, making it more playful and cartoonish. A struggle ensues between the horns and <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet,</b> with <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> catapulting <b>the</b> piece into a latin-inspired section. The struggle continues through to the end of the movement. The third movement, Calm, is exactly what the title suggests. A sectional form distinguishes this movement from the second movement. Throughout Calm, <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> behaves with decorum, except for very large melodic leaps. The seed of anarchy planted by <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> in <b>the</b> second movement comes to fruition in the final movement, The Beguiling Builds. Here, <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> sends <b>the</b> work into chaos with sections recalling Looney Tunes cartoons, Hollywood western music, and children's folk songs...|$|R

5|$|Johann Christoph Denner is {{generally}} {{believed to have}} invented <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> in Germany around the year 1700 by adding a register key to the earlier chalumeau. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability.|$|E
5|$|More than a 'neutral' {{amount of}} air escapes from the instrument, which creates a slight vacuum or {{rarefaction}} in <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> tube. This rarefaction wave travels {{back up the}} tube (image 2).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> A <b>clarinet</b> and B <b>clarinet</b> {{have nearly}} <b>the</b> same bore, {{and use the}} same mouthpiece. Orchestral players using the A and B {{instruments}} in the same concert could use the same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) for both (see 'usage' below). The A and the B instruments have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of <b>the</b> E <b>clarinet</b> is brighter than that of <b>the</b> lower <b>clarinets</b> and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. <b>The</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while <b>the</b> alto <b>clarinet</b> is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|R
5000|$|... "Molly on the Shore" [...] mostly {{features}} the woodwind {{section of the}} band, especially <b>the</b> <b>clarinets</b> and saxophones. <b>The</b> opening 1st <b>clarinet</b> solo is a common audition excerpt in the key of B flat major for clarinet, or concert F major for C Flute or Bassoon.|$|R
5000|$|In {{collaboration}} with Leblanc, Bliss developed <b>the</b> Leblanc Bliss <b>clarinet.</b> Says Bliss of the line: [...] "I know I {{can pick up}} any Bliss clarinet {{and be able to}} perform at the level to which I am accustomed."

5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune <b>the</b> <b>clarinet.</b> As the pitch of <b>the</b> <b>clarinet</b> is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E

50|$|The tone of <b>the</b> Boehm system <b>clarinet</b> is {{more open}} than its predecessors' veiled tone. Fork- and cross-fingerings create {{a greater number of}} closed holes—another cause of <b>the</b> pre-Boehm <b>clarinet's</b> dull tone. Due to the advancements in keywork, <b>the</b> Boehm system <b>clarinet</b> does not rely on many such fingerings, {{allowing}} for more open holes and a more vibrant tone that forgoes the unique color of <b>the</b> pre-Boehm <b>clarinet.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> E♭ <b>clarinet</b> {{established}} a niche {{for itself in}} the military band, particularly in Germany, from about 1805, whereas <b>the</b> bass <b>clarinet</b> would be perfected by Adolphe Sax in 1838. Therefore, the defining moment {{with regard to the}} foundation of <b>the</b> full <b>clarinet</b> choir was <b>the</b> advent of Fontaine-Besson's successful clarinet-pedale design, exhibited in Paris in 1889 and patented in 1891.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{traditional}} Breton <b>clarinet</b> {{usually has}} only 13 keys (though sometimes {{as few as}} six), {{in contrast to the}} more common 'Boehm' instrument used in jazz, classical music and other fields.
