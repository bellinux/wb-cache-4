5|$|Georgia {{moved quickly}} {{following}} the Rose Revolution in 2003 to seek closer ties with NATO. Georgia's northern neighbor, Russia, opposed the closer ties, including those expressed at the 2008 Bucharest summit where NATO members promised <b>that</b> <b>Georgia</b> would eventually join the organization.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Infantry Brigade, {{the only}} one trained to NATO standards, was serving in Iraq at the {{beginning}} of the war; on 11 August, the United States Air Force airlifted it to Georgia. The elite Georgian troops were overdue from Iraq and could not participate in the fighting. The presence of prime 2,000 Georgian military and the most Georgian high-level government officials abroad before the war meant <b>that</b> <b>Georgia</b> did not intend to attack.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets {{entered the}} 2009 season after a 2008 {{campaign}} that saw them finish 9–4, including a season-ending 38–3 {{loss to the}} LSU Tigers in the 2008 Chick-fil-A Bowl. Georgia Tech head coach Paul Johnson, entering his second season {{as head of the}} Yellow Jackets, had high hopes <b>that</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech would be able to improve upon its 2008 performance. Others agreed with Johnson's assumption, as the Yellow Jackets were ranked No. 15 in the preseason Associated Press and USA Today coaches' polls.|$|E
50|$|The voting of Georgia in {{the final}} was based on 100% televoting due to a breach of the rules; The European Broadcasting Union {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>Georgia's</b> jurors did not vote independently, as each juror had the same top 8 acts.|$|R
25|$|Later that day, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said <b>that</b> <b>Georgia’s</b> {{spy plane}} {{had been shot}} down by Abkhazian air defence forces. It also reiterated that the {{conducting}} of flights over the conflict zone constituted {{a violation of the}} ceasefire treaty.|$|R

5|$|Georgian forces, {{among them}} special {{forces of the}} Ministry of Internal Affairs, entered Tskhinvali after taking the heights near the town. The {{centre of the town}} was reached by 1,500 men of Georgian {{infantry}} by 10:00. The Russian air force began bombing targets inside South Ossetia and Georgia proper after 10:00 on 8 August. According to Russia, it suffered its first casualties at around 12:00 when two servicemen were killed and five wounded following an attempt by the Georgian troops to storm the northern peacekeeping base in Tskhinvali. Georgia has stated that it only targeted Russian peacekeepers in self-defence, after coming under fire from them. Most of Tskhinvali and several villages had been secured by Georgian forces by the afternoon; however, they failed to achieve their objective of blocking the Gupta bridge and the key roads linking Tshkinvali with the Roki Tunnel and the Russian military base in Java. One Georgian diplomat told Kommersant {{on the same day that}} by taking control of Tskhinvali, Tbilisi wanted to demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>Georgia</b> wouldn't tolerate killing of Georgian citizens.|$|E
25|$|Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said <b>that</b> <b>Georgia</b> would declare Russian peacekeepers as {{occupiers}} and the breakaway {{territories of}} Abkhazia and South Ossetia as occupied territory. Saakashvili announced {{at a large}} rally outside parliament <b>that</b> <b>Georgia</b> would leave the Commonwealth of Independent States. Georgia filed a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice, accusing Russia of carrying out ethnic cleansing between 1993 and 2008.|$|E

25|$|The Russian Foreign Ministry reiterated its {{position}} <b>that</b> <b>Georgia's</b> spy plane {{had been shot}} down by an L-39 aircraft of the Abkhazian air force and that the spy plane's presence over the conflict zone constituted {{a violation of the}} 1994 Moscow agreement on ceasefire and separation of forces.|$|R
50|$|On 7 April 2009, Fitch Ratings {{had warned}} <b>that</b> <b>Georgia's</b> {{long-term}} credit could be downgraded {{because of the}} political instability ahead of the planned protests. 9 April 2009 the Prime Minister of Georgia Nika Gilauri warned that political standoff and protest rallies in the country would hit the Georgian economy.|$|R

25|$|Svante E. Cornell {{argued that}} {{although}} Tagliavini’s report did claim <b>that</b> <b>Georgia</b> started the war, {{that should not}} be confused with the question of responsibility. He also criticised the argument <b>that</b> <b>Georgia</b> was legally bound by agreements not to use force, because the mission failed to discuss their validity if broken by either the South Ossetians or by Russia. Cornell also criticised the report for not taking account of the considerable evidence accumulated by scholars such as Andrey Illarionov.|$|E
25|$|According to Soviet sources, {{relations}} with Georgia deteriorated over alleged {{violations of the}} peace treaty, re-arrests of Georgian Bolsheviks, obstruction of convoys passing through Georgia to Armenia, and a strong suspicion <b>that</b> <b>Georgia</b> was aiding armed rebels in the North Caucasus. For its part, Georgia accused Moscow of fomenting anti-government riots in various regions of the country, and of provoking border incidents in the Zaqatala region, disputed with the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The Lori “neutral zone” was another challenge, as Soviet Armenia categorically demanded <b>that</b> <b>Georgia</b> withdraw the troops that had been stationed in the region {{since the fall of}} the Armenian Republic.|$|E
50|$|The {{state of}} Georgia {{is divided into}} 159 {{counties}} (the largest number of any state other than Texas), {{each of which has}} had home rule since at least 1980. This means <b>that</b> <b>Georgia's</b> counties not only act as units of state government, but also {{in much the same way}} as municipalities.|$|R
40|$|The federal {{government}} and the states have recently enacted a slew of aid policies aimed at college students from middle- and high-income families. I estimate the impact of aid on the college attendance of middle- and upper-income youth by evaluating Georgia's HOPE Scholarship, the inspiration of the new federal Hope Scholarship. The results suggest <b>that</b> <b>Georgia's</b> program has had a surprisingly large impact on the college attendance rate of middle- and high-income youth. Using a set of nearby states as a control group, I find <b>that</b> <b>Georgia's</b> program has likely increased the college attendance rate of all 18 - to 19 -year-olds by 7. 0 to 7. 9 percentage points. The results suggest that each $ 1, 000 in aid ($ 1998) increased the college attendance rate in Georgia by 3. 7 to 4. 2 percentage points. Due to key differences between the federal and Georgia programs, these estimates should be treated as a generous upper bound on the predicted effect of the federal Hope Scholarship. Further, the evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>Georgia's</b> program has widened the gap in college attendance between blacks and whites and between those from low- and high-income families. The federal Hope Scholarship, should it have its intended effect on middle- and upper-income attendance, will also widen already large racial and income gaps in college attendance in the US. ...|$|R
