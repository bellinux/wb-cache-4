5|$|The Dalits {{strongly}} believe in his piety and portray Brahmins as {{the root cause}} of all <b>the</b> <b>misery</b> of the Nayanar. Nandanar fits in the Dalit narrative that proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. They say that Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'. The sashes round Nataraja's waist are interpreted as the legs of the saint, who merged into the god.|$|E
5|$|Being {{exceedingly}} {{alarmed at}} <b>the</b> <b>misery</b> into which I had fallen, {{and much more}} at that which threatened me in view of eternal death, I, duty bound, made it my first business to betake myself to your way, condemning my past life, not without groans and tears. And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me, but instead of defence, earnestly to supplicate you not to judge that fearful abandonment of your Word according to its deserts, from which in your wondrous goodness you have at last delivered me.|$|E

5|$|Finding a {{suitable}} {{name for the}} combined CCE and C routes proved a challenge for the LPTB {{and a number of}} variations were used including Edgware, Morden & Highgate Line in 1933 and Morden-Edgware Line in 1936. In 1937, Northern line was adopted in preparation for the uncompleted Northern Heights plan. Today, the Northern line is the busiest on the London Underground system, carrying 206.7 million passengers annually, a level of usage which led it to be known as <b>the</b> <b>Misery</b> line during the 1990s due to overcrowding and poor reliability.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back {{with the loss of}} a quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation as he and his followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers <b>the</b> <b>misery,</b> {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E

By April 2, South Vietnam had lost control of the northern provinces, as well as two army corps.|$|E

5|$|The state {{government}} {{made the decision}} to decommission Fremantle Prison in 1983, but it remained in operation until 30 November 1991. Prisoners were moved to a new metropolitan maximum security prison at Casuarina and the prison was transferred to the Building Management Authority. There were divergent views in the community over the site's future: some wanted it demolished and redeveloped, or turned into gardens with a small monument; others wanted the historic site to be preserved, but were opposed to turning <b>the</b> <b>misery</b> of prisoners into entertainment for tourists. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community.|$|E
5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} <b>the</b> <b>misery</b> and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, {{but by the end}} of the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the unrest in Sicily, a wave of rioting spread through Italy in August 1893, triggered by {{the killing of a}} number of migrant workers in the salt pans of Aigues Mortes in southern France escalated into a more generalized working-class revolt supported by anarchists and violent riots in Rome and Naples. Italy seemed to be slipping to a revolution. By the time Crispi returned to power in December 1893, Italy appeared to many to be on the brink of collapse. Crispi promised important measures of land reform for the near future. He was not blind to <b>the</b> <b>misery</b> and the need for social reform. Before 1891 he had been the patron of the Sicilian working-class and many of their associations had been named after him. Colajanni, the chief architect of Giolitti’s fall by exposing the Banca Romana scandal, was first offered the Ministry of Agriculture, which he refused, then sent to Sicily on a mission of appeasement.|$|E

5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the first time in many years, escaping from <b>the</b> <b>misery</b> she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her arms in the air.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{recorded}} {{their first}} win {{of the season}} on 9 September, beating newly promoted Charlton Athletic 4–1. Yorke and Ole Gunnar Solskjær each scored a brace to overturn the visitor's early lead. The match was marred with demonstrations in and around Old Trafford against the proposed takeover of the club by BSkyB. Obscene chants were directed at chairman Martin Edwards, who had given his support to the merger. A 2–0 victory against Coventry City the following week put United in perfect stead for the clash at home to Barcelona, but a comprehensive defeat to champions Arsenal left the team in 10th position. This was Arsène Wenger's third straight victory over Ferguson (four in all competitions); goals from Tony Adams, Nicolas Anelka and Freddie Ljungberg condemned Manchester United to their heaviest away defeat {{in more than two}} years. To compound <b>the</b> <b>misery</b> midfielder Nicky Butt, who had been sent off in the Champions League match earlier in the week, was handed a second red card in the space of four days after a lunge on French international Patrick Vieira. United ended the month with a win, beating rivals Liverpool 2–0 to move into fifth spot.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of all}} <b>the</b> <b>misery</b> the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E
