5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features of the story <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be taken up by Chaucer. Most obvious is that Troilus' love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is {{the introduction of the}} go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his love is unsuccessful, generous when it is.|$|E
5|$|In both paintings, Saint Francis of Assisi kneels by a rock as he {{receives}} the stigmata <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> stay {{on his body}} until his death. The composition is tonally similar to Giotto's 1295–1300 Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, but more grounded in earthly reality. The design is a mostly faithful representation of the original Franciscan texts, but differs in that Francis does not lean forward towards Christ.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{cultural}} practices <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> define Merina social and political life for centuries are credited to Andrianjaka. He designated the twelve sacred hills of Imerina <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> become the spiritual and political heartland of the Merina empire, contributing {{to the establishment of}} the kingdom's traditional boundaries; clans were assigned to specific regions within his kingdom, further defining {{the cultural}} landscape. He consolidated power through such measures as appropriating the folk tradition of sampy (community talismans), thereby ensuring all the powers traditionally attributed to these idols were {{under the control of the}} sovereign alone. Merina traditions related to the burial and mourning of sovereigns are also traced back to Andrianjaka's reign.|$|E

5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders {{were faced with}} the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} high mountain climbs along the course and {{the distinction of being}} the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{number of}} signal {{processing}} applications require {{the estimation of}} covariance matrices. Sometimes, the particular scenario or system imparts a certain theoretical structure on the matrices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> estimated. Using this knowledge allows the design of algorithms exploiting such structure, resulting in more robust and accurate estimators, especially for small samples. We study a scenario with a measured covariance matrix known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the Kronecker product of two other, possibly structured, covari-ance matrices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> estimated. Examples of scenarios in which such a problem occurs are MIMO-communications and EEG measurements. When the matrices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> estimated are Toeplitz structured, we show our algorithms <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> achieve the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound already at very small sample sizes.

5|$|After the war, the bad {{conditions}} and high casualties amongst the Anzac troops {{resulted in a}} reasonably prevalent view in Australia that these had been due to the incompetence of British officers commanding the Australian troops and their disregard for the casualties that resulted from poorly planned or ill-conceived attacks. Whether these claims are valid or not, {{there can be little}} doubt that the entire campaign was poorly conducted, and as a result there were many military lessons learnt <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be applied in later campaigns. Despite this, for Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign has come to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is a public holiday known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, and indeed in Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.|$|E

However, she received almost no formal education, a deficiency that caused significant problems for her in her college years.

5|$|And {{there were}} already {{problems}} with the system. The anti-personnel portion of the program had already failed. The presence and movements of enemy troops were to be detected by the utilization of small, wide-area Gravel mines <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> alert the acoustic sensors. Unfortunately, the mines rapidly deteriorated in the heat and humidity of Laos, nullifying their effectiveness. The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.|$|E

5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers <b>that</b> <b>were,</b> <b>to</b> all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E
