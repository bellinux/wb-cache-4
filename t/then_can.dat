5|$|If enough {{moisture}} exists, thunderstorms {{can form}} along sea breeze fronts that <b>then</b> <b>can</b> send out outflow boundaries. This causes chaotic wind/pressure regimes if the steering flow is weak. Like all other surface features, sea breeze fronts lie inside troughs of low pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{similarities between}} humans and other animals, especially primates, have led to more comparative research between the two groups.

5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} {{is used in}} {{analytical}} chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It <b>then</b> <b>can</b> be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very strong acid, such as perchloric acid.|$|E
5|$|In {{collections}} {{which contain}} fossils, high humidity can also affect pyrite (or its more reactive polymorph marcasite) (iron sulphide) fossils {{in a somewhat}} similar condition, which is known as pyrite disease. The iron sulfide can react with water and oxygen to form iron sulfates and sulfuric acid, which <b>then</b> <b>can</b> produce Bynesian decay.|$|E

In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl.

The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and <b>then</b> <b>can</b> remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E

Findlemeyer the second, has taken a vacation to Miami. Findlemeyer has taken {{the key to his}} safe with him, which prevents filming from commencing because the safe contains the film scripts. Seymour must blow the safe with dynamite to access the scripts and then collect 16 Academy Awards from around the game and award one to each of the actors. Only <b>then</b> <b>can</b> filming commence.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{time and}} disorder within nature {{that is the}} result of humanity following only science and not the divine.

5|$|When an {{ambulance}} is retired, {{it may be}} donated or sold to another EMS provider. Alternately, it may be adapted into a storage and transport vehicle for crime scene identification equipment, a command post at community events, or support vehicle, such as a logistics unit.

The game's bright and {{colorful}} visuals and dynamic music soundtrack were hallmarks of the game, earning it several awards from the gaming press in 2006. While the game did not sell high volumes, its success {{led to the development}} of four other LocoRoco titles – two sequels for the PSP (PlayStation Portable)/PSP Go, a spin-off for the PlayStation 3 and a mobile version (called LocoRoco Mobile and LocoRoco Hi, depending on the market) for cellular (mobile) telephones.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how <b>then</b> <b>can</b> mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E
5|$|Once woven, the {{material}} {{is sent to the}} BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, {{the material}}, if approved, is returned to the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only <b>then</b> <b>can</b> the flag be sold.|$|E
