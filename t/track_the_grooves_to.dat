50|$|The {{tone arm}} (or tonearm) holds the pickup {{cartridge}} over <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> <b>the</b> stylus <b>tracking</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> with <b>the</b> desired force {{to give the}} optimal compromise between good tracking and minimizing wear of the stylus and record groove. At its simplest, a tone arm is a pivoted lever, free to move in two axes (vertical and horizontal) with a counterbalance to maintain tracking pressure.|$|R
50|$|Holt was {{technically}} correct, as the Dynagroove process used tracing compensation, which pre-distorted <b>the</b> record <b>groove</b> <b>to</b> {{cancel out}} <b>the</b> distortion created by playback with a conical-shaped phonograph stylus, {{which could not}} <b>track</b> <b>the</b> record <b>groove</b> accurately in <b>the</b> high frequencies, especially in <b>the</b> inner <b>grooves</b> of an LP. The process worked well with playback via a conical stylus, typical of most phonograph cartridges prior to about 1964. However, if one played a Dynagroove record with an elliptical-shaped stylus, this pre-distortion became audible. As {{the decade of the}} 1960s progressed, high quality playback cartridges increasingly used elliptical styli. This development made tracing compensation obsolete by about 1970, and RCA quietly stopped using the technique.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{the crystal}} and ceramic pickups, the {{magnetic}} cartridge usually gives improved playback fidelity and reduced record wear by <b>tracking</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> with lighter pressure. Magnetic cartridges use lower tracking forces and thus reduce <b>the</b> potential for <b>groove</b> damage. They {{also have a}} lower output voltage than a crystal or ceramic pickup, {{in the range of}} only a few millivolts, thus requiring greater amplification.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, a {{new steel}} needle is {{required}} for every record played on an old acoustic phonograph. This is because the record contains abrasive material. In the first few silent tracks this abrasion hones the steel needle to a profile that <b>tracks</b> <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> properly. <b>The</b> needle continues to wear as it plays the record, {{so that by the}} end its diameter has increased {{to the point where the}} sharp edges may damage <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> on subsequent plays.|$|R
50|$|The {{coupling}} {{is defined}} by <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> count, <b>the</b> outer diameter of the cylindrical feature, the bottom angle of <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> axis of the cylindrical feature), and their depth. Hirth joints are designed as mating pairs and, unlike splines, there is no standardised off-the-shelf sizing system for them.|$|R

25|$|Cylinder phonographs {{generally}} used a {{worm gear}} to move the stylus in synchronization with <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> of <b>the</b> recording, whereas most disc machines relied on <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> <b>to</b> pull <b>the</b> stylus along. This resulted in cylinder records played {{a number of times}} having less degradation than discs, but this added mechanism made cylinder machines more expensive.|$|R
50|$|The microtonal tuning {{mechanism}} {{consists of a}} sliding bridge, a groove and buffers fitted to each note of the instrument. The bridge is in constant contact with the strings. If the musician slides the bridge along <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> <b>to</b> any point between the buffers, a precise microtonal interval change results.|$|R

50|$|Rifled barrels {{introduce}} ambiguity to {{measurement of}} caliber. A rifled bore consists of alternating <b>grooves</b> and lands. <b>The</b> distance across <b>the</b> bore from <b>groove</b> <b>to</b> <b>groove</b> {{is greater than}} the distance from land to land. Projectiles fired from rifled barrels must be of <b>the</b> full <b>groove</b> <b>to</b> <b>groove</b> diameter <b>to</b> be effectively rotated by the rifling, but the caliber has sometimes been specified as the land to land diameter before rifling <b>grooves</b> were cut. <b>The</b> depth of rifling <b>grooves</b> (and <b>the</b> consequent ambiguity) increases in larger calibers. Steel artillery projectiles may have a forward bourrelet section machined to a diameter slightly smaller than the original land to land dimension of the barrel and a copper driving band somewhat larger than <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> <b>to</b> <b>groove</b> diameter <b>to</b> effectively seal the bore as it becomes enlarged by erosion during prolonged firing. United States Navy guns typically used rifling depth between one-half and one percent of caliber. Projectile bourrelet diameter specification was 0.015 in less than land to land diameter with a minus manufacturing tolerance so average clearance was about 0.012 in. Driving band diameter was <b>groove</b> <b>to</b> <b>groove</b> diameter plus 0.02 in.|$|R

2500|$|In this system, each of two stereo {{channels}} {{is carried}} independently by a separate groove wall, each wall face moving at 45 {{degrees to the}} plane of the record surface (hence the system's name) in correspondence with the signal level of that channel. By convention, the inner wall carries the left-hand channel and the outer wall carries the right-hand channel. [...] While the stylus only moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording, on stereo records the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. During playback, the movement of a single stylus <b>tracking</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> is sensed independently, e.g., by two coils, each mounted diagonally opposite <b>the</b> relevant <b>groove</b> wall.|$|R
5000|$|Even on a {{perfectly}} flat LP, tonearms {{are prone to}} two types of tracking errors that affect the sound. As <b>the</b> tonearm <b>tracks</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> <b>the</b> stylus exerts a frictional force tangent to the arc of <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> and since this force does not intersect the tone arm pivot, a clockwise rotational force (moment) occurs and a reaction skating force is exerted on the stylus by <b>the</b> record <b>groove</b> wall away from center of the disc. Modern arms provide an anti-skate mechanism, using springs, hanging weights, or magnets to produce an offsetting counter-clockwise force at the pivot, making the net lateral force on <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> walls near zero. The second error occurs as the arm sweeps in an arc across the disc, causing the angle between the cartridge head and <b>groove</b> <b>to</b> change slightly. A change in angle, albeit small, will have a detrimental effect (especially with stereo recordings) by creating different forces on <b>the</b> two <b>groove</b> walls, {{as well as a}} slight timing shift between left/right channels. Making the arm longer to reduce this angle is a partial solution, but less than ideal. A longer arm weighs more, and only an infinitely long pivoted arm would reduce the error to zero. Some designs (Burne-Jones, and Garrard [...] "Zero" [...] series) use dual arms in a parallelogram arrangement, pivoting the cartridge head to maintain a constant angle as it moves across the record. Unfortunately this [...] "solution" [...] creates more problems than it solves, compromising rigidity and creating sources of unwanted noise.|$|R
25|$|Results {{have been}} mixed as the lack of {{mechanical}} grip {{has resulted in the}} more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip– pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn has resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car 'dirty' (turbulent), preventing other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> <b>grooved</b> tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> <b>grooved</b> tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip <b>the</b> <b>track</b> as well.|$|R

50|$|Towards the center, {{at the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> {{there is}} another wide-pitched section known as the lead-out.

On some recordings (for example Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles, Super Trouper by ABBA and Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd), the sound continues on <b>the</b> lock <b>groove,</b> which gives a strange repeating effect. Automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm, as it reaches the wider spacing in <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> <b>to</b> trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record.

25|$|Steam trams {{relied upon}} their weight and {{adhesion}} for propulsion {{and as the}} town streets were badly paved, dirt, stones, manure and water got into <b>the</b> rail <b>grooves.</b> Water boys and track cleaners were employed to clean out <b>the</b> rail <b>grooves</b> with long iron bars, which they dragged along the rails, it being essential to ensure the wheel flanges ran fully in <b>the</b> <b>grooves,</b> <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> wheel tread to grip <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> specification of performance was strict, the vehicle had to be silent, had to emit no smoke and was required to have no exposed parts which could provide a safety hazard to pedestrians and horses. In Nottingham, only one steam tram was operated and being considerably heavier than a horse-drawn car, it, no doubt, caused considerable damage to <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R

5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus <b>to</b> <b>track</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove.</b> Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|R
