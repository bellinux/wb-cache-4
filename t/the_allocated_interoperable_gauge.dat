40|$|In cost {{allocation}} problem, traditional DEA approaches <b>allocate</b> <b>the</b> fixed cost {{among a group}} of decision making units (DMUs), and treat <b>the</b> <b>allocated</b> cost as an extra input of each DMU. If costs except for the fixed cost are regarded as inputs in the {{cost allocation}} problem, then {{it is obvious that the}} fixed cost is a complement of other inputs rather than an extra independent input. Therefore it is necessary to combine <b>the</b> <b>allocated</b> cost with other cost measures in cost allocation problem. Based on this observation, this paper investigates the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>allocated</b> cost and <b>the</b> DEA efficiency score and develops a DEA-based approach to <b>allocate</b> <b>the</b> fixed cost among various DMUs.

30|$|Although the {{persistent}} scheduling is very efficient {{to reduce the}} overheads of L 1 /L 2 control channel signals, it is very inefficient to achieve some dynamic scheduling benefits such as early-termination gain and channel-dependent scheduling. The early-termination gain means that <b>the</b> <b>allocated</b> resources, which are assigned to a scheduled user, can be potentially available to other user {{when they are not}} used by <b>the</b> <b>allocated</b> user. It may be efficient in resource utilization. But, in the original persistent scheduling scheme, <b>the</b> <b>allocated</b> resources are not changed during the talk-spurt period. In other words, since the original persistent scheduling does not provide the early-termination gain, the available capacity of VoIP is limited. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a solution to improve the available VoIP capacity.|$|R
