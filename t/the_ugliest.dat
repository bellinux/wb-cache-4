40|$|<b>The</b> <b>ugly</b> {{has long}} been foundered on the rocks of {{exclusion}} for the locus classicus of aesthetics rotates in the main around the beautiful, setting <b>the</b> <b>ugly</b> as an anathema. Hence, the lens through which <b>the</b> <b>ugly</b> was refracted had been negative and <b>the</b> <b>ugly</b> was destined {{to fall into the}} cracks of aesthetics. However, Theodor Adorno shifts the focus from the beautiful and inducts <b>the</b> <b>ugly</b> into <b>the</b> aesthetic canon from a different perspective that challenges many ideological calluses; in his philosophy <b>the</b> <b>ugly</b> is closely related to the return of myth in modern art. Audre Lorde equally refuses to ride the aesthetic wave or fall under its governance; to accomplish that she also resorts to myth. Although The Black Unicorn (1978), her magnum opus, teems with mythical tales, it has never been interpreted from the Adornian doctrine. Myriad readings tackled Lorde's use of mythology principally as an endeavor to forge an African and feminist identity.   By reading her poetry through Adorno's <b>ugly,</b> <b>the</b> article argues that Lorde's use of African myths performs the same aesthetic role Adorno assigns to <b>the</b> <b>ugly</b> in reflecting and resisting society. </p...|$|R

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} burial of Hector, Penthesilea, {{queen of the}} Amazons, arrived with her warriors.

25|$|The two-year {{war between}} the ABA and the USBA was perhaps <b>the</b> <b>ugliest</b> rivalry that BMX has ever saw. It seems the USBA was making most of the {{aggressive}} moves. The motivation for rivalries like this was the $2 million to $4 million in revenue yearly that BMX generated at the time. Compared to other older more established sports like baseball, European football (soccer), American football and auto racing, this was a pittance but still enough to generate bad promoters and political infighting between and within sanctioning bodies. Track operators had quite thin profit margins to work with, which perhaps made the back biting even worse since there was so little to go around. There was a slump in the BMX racing market as mentioned {{with the growth of}} Freestyle, the resurgence of skateboarding siphoning off young people and the insurance crises to drain resources further. Pretty desperate times for the organizers of BMX racing, and desperate times generate desperate acts, including actions straight out of Watergate.|$|E

25|$|On November 16, during Week 11, a {{game between}} the Philadelphia Eagles and the Cincinnati Bengals at Paul Brown Stadium ended in a 13–13 tie, the first NFL tie game since November 10, 2002, when the Atlanta Falcons and the Pittsburgh Steelers ended in a 34–34 draw. After the game, Donovan McNabb {{mentioned}} {{that he did not}} know there were ties in the NFL, apparently confusing the NFL's postseason rules (where teams can and have played double overtime games because those contests continue until a team finally wins) with the regular season rules. This drew the ire of many fans, who thought that a quarterback of his caliber should know some fundamental rules; however, none of McNabb's critics accused him of not playing to win during the OT period in Cincinnati, and his play was tied into a game that was widely derided as one of <b>the</b> <b>ugliest,</b> most disjointed results in NFL history.|$|E
25|$|The first multi-team testing session {{took place}} at Circuit de Catalunya, Barcelona in November 2008, {{two weeks after the}} end of {{previous}} season.

On 9 March, testing at Barcelona featured for the first time Brawn GP, who made an immediate impact by leading the times early in the day. The test, the first in which all teams used their 2009 cars, had BMW Sauber leading the times while Brawn GP finished fourth. On day three, Brawn GP's Jenson Button was fastest by just over one second to Ferrari's Felipe Massa, while Button's teammate Rubens Barrichello went even faster the next day.

500|$|Only {{one copy}} of the Ormulum exists, as Bodleian Library MS Junius1 (Burchfield 1987, p.280). In its current state, the {{manuscript}} is incomplete: the book's table of contents claims that there were 242homilies, but only 32 remain (Matthew 2004, p.936). It {{seems likely that the}} work was never finished on the scale planned when the table of contents was written, but much of the discrepancy was probably caused by the loss of gatherings from the manuscript. There is no doubt that such losses have occurred even in modern times, as the Dutch antiquarian Jan van Vliet, one of its seventeenth-century owners, copied out passages that are not in the present text (Jack, George, in Matthew and Harrison 2004, pp.936–37). The amount of redaction in the text, plus the loss of possible gatherings, led J. A. W.

500|$|Furst {{and the art}} {{department}} deliberately mixed clashing architectural {{styles to}} [...] "make Gotham City <b>the</b> <b>ugliest</b> and bleakest metropolis imaginable". Furst continued, [...] "e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going". The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, [...] "We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s". The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed.|$|E
