In the Bier or Mines de Potasse case, the ECJ specified that the expression ‘place where the harmful event occurred‘ can encompass both “the place where the damage occurred and the place of the event giving rise to it”. Although this specification can be very helpful to the case, its implications, such as the possibility of a multitude of fora, have led to a rather extensive case-law governing the subject, making this provision a complex matter.|$|R

40|$|This {{writing is}} aimed {{to explain the}} {{expression}} "matters relating to contract" and "matters relating to <b>tort</b> <b>delict</b> or quasi-delict" as used in the Bruxelles and Lugano Convention on jurisdiction, especially focusing on the interpretation given by the ECJ. The Luxembourg Court has always intended the "relation to contract" literally, i. e. as implying in any case a contract {{as the source of}} obligation from which the litigation arises. On the contrary, it {{must be taken into account}} that "contractual" is a qualification that in civil law countries refers to obligation whatever is its source. At the same time, to limit "contractual" qualification to the obligations generated by a contract implies that liability deriving from violation of any other obligation leads only to an action in tort. This result is contradictory in that a liability deriving from a legal relationship ends up by taking its qualification as a tort, while this one is the category relating to damage caused outside any previous legal relationship...|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the thesis {{is the issue of}} {{determining}} jurisdiction in matters of <b>tort,</b> <b>delict</b> or quasi-delict with regard to the internet. The author finds that the general rules of determining jurisdiction are suitable for use even in disputes arising with connection to the internet. However, strict application of the aforementioned rules would lead to undesirable results. Therefore it is necessary to construe the general rules {{in such a way that}} takes into account the unique characteristics of the internet environment. Given the fact that courts are mainly responsible for the interpretation and application of the general rules, significant decisions of European and American courts are thoroughly analyzed. Even though the {{main focus of}} the thesis are the decisions of the courts, recent findings of jurisprudence and recommendations of the international bodies are taken into account as well. In the opening chapters, the unique characteristics of the internet and basic rules for determining the special jurisdiction are presented. Although the issue of determining jurisdiction in contracts is also mentioned in chapter 3, this topic exceeds the scope of this work and is discussed mainly in connection with the "targeting" criterion, which is also significant for out of contract issues.

50|$|Prior to Donoghue v Stevenson {{liability}} for personal injury in tort usually depended upon showing physical damage inflicted directly (trespass to the person) or indirectly (trespass on the case). Being made ill by consuming a noxious substance did not qualify as either, so the orthodox {{view was that}} Mrs Donoghue had no sustainable claim in law. However, the decision fundamentally created {{a new type of}} liability in law which did not depend upon any previously recognised category of tortious claims. This was an evolutionary step in the common law for <b>tort</b> and <b>delict,</b> moving from strict liability based upon direct physical contact to a fault-based system which only required injury. This evolution was taken further in the later decision of Letang v Cooper 1965 1 QB 232 when it was held that actions should not be jointly pleaded in trespass and negligence, but in negligence alone.|$|R
40|$|Many legal jurisdictions permit {{victims of}} {{targeted}} hate speech {{to sue for}} damages in civil courts. In the US plaintiffs may sue for damages using the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Indeed, back in 1982, Richard Delgado proposed {{the introduction of a}} new tort of racial insult to handle such cases. In South Africa, plaintiffs can use the delict of injuria. Although there have been some successful lawsuits, the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress has been an unreliable means of recovering damages for psychological harms caused by targeted hate speech. One major obstacle to recovery in the US has been the tendency the courts to view the use of racial insults, for instance, as too ordinary or commonplace to count as ‘extreme and outrageous conduct’. Even Delgado’s tort of racial insult would not recognize as a cause of action the mere use of a racial insult; the insult must demean. But once again this opens up significant leeway for courts to treat many commonplace racial insults as non-demeaning. In South Africa, the courts have interpreted the delict of injuria using the abstract test of whether the speech ‘impaired the plaintiff’s dignity’. The open-textured nature of this test has led courts to diverge in their understanding of the dignitary threat posed by almost identical forms of hate speech. In this article, I argue that these two <b>torts</b> and one <b>delict</b> should be comprehensively rethought. At the level of theory, we should think of them as protecting people’s fundamental rights to human dignity and the expression of human dignity as well as people’s fundamental rights to civic dignity and confidence in their civic dignity. And, at the level of practice, courts should adopt what I am proposing as two new legal tests for degradation and humiliation as a way of interpreting and operationalizing these two <b>torts</b> and one <b>delict</b> in cases of targeted hate speech...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{agreement}} establishing a Unified Patent Court (UPC), signed by 25 EU Member States on 19 February 2013 {{and its impact on}} the rules on jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters as contained in Regulation (EU) No. 1215 / 2012 (s. c. “Brussels I Recast Regulation”), which replaces the pre-existing Brussels I Regulation. The study analyzes the new rules introduced in the Brussels I Recast Regulation through Regulation (EU) No 542 / 2014, making provision for the application of the rules on jurisdiction as contained in the Regulation to the UPC as well as to the Benelux Court of Justice, as judicial bodies common to several Member States. As concerns the UPC, the new rules introduced by Regulation No 542 / 2014 appear welcome, insofar as they provide for the enlargement of the territorial scope of the competence of the UPC itself, a competence that the agreement itself considers as exclusive. Nonetheless, the new rules fall short of addressing effectively the problems of coordination of the exclusive jurisdiction provided for under Article 24. 4 of the Brussels I Recast Regulation in respect of actions concerning registration or validity of intellectual property rights, including European patents, with other heads of jurisdiction such as that provided for under Art. 7. 2 of the same Regulation in respect of actions in matters of <b>tort</b> or <b>delict,</b> such as those concerning infringement of the same rights...|$|R

The study analyzes the proposal submitted by the European Commission on 26 July 2013 (COM(2013) 554 final) providing for the amendment of Regulation Brussels I-bis in order to ease the application of the rules on jurisdiction as contained in the Regulation to the unified patent court, as a judicial body common to the Member States having established it. The amendments proposed by the Commission appear welcome in that they provide for the enlargement of the territorial scope of the competence of the unified patent court, a competence which the agreement itself grants as exclusive. Nonetheless, the proposal falls short of addressing effectively the problem of coordination of the exclusive jurisdiction provided for under Article 24. 4 of the Regulation (i. e. Article 22. 4 Brussels I) in respect of actions concerning registration or validity of intellectual property rights including European patents with other heads of jurisdiction such as that provided for under Art. 7. 2 of the same Regulation (i. e.

2500|$|<b>Torts,</b> {{sometimes}} called <b>delicts,</b> are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached {{a duty to}} another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball. Under the law of negligence, {{the most common form}} of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for their injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by Donoghue v Stevenson. A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of ginger beer (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a café in Paisley. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated.

50|$|South Africa has a 'hybrid' or 'mixed' legal system, {{formed by}} the {{interweaving}} {{of a number of}} distinct legal traditions: a civil law system inherited from the Dutch, a common law system inherited from the British, and a customary law system inherited from indigenous Africans (often termed African Customary Law, of which there are many variations depending on the tribal origin). These traditions have had a complex interrelationship, with the English influence most apparent in procedural aspects of the legal system and methods of adjudication, and the Roman-Dutch influence most visible in its substantive private law. As a general rule, South Africa follows English law in both criminal and civil procedure, company law, constitutional law and the law of evidence; while Roman-Dutch common law is followed in the South African contract law, law of <b>delict</b> (<b>tort),</b> law of persons, law of things, family law, etc. With the commencement in 1994 of the interim Constitution, and in 1997 its replacement, the final Constitution, another strand has been added to this weave.|$|R
40|$|Accidents {{involving}} vessels carrying oil {{or other}} hazardous and noxious substances {{have been in}} many cases the cause of spillage with devastating consequences on the local economic and the environment. This was highlighted by the Torrey Canyon incident, in March 1967, which proved that there is inadequate legal means, at international level, to cope with the problems in the recovery of the considerable expenditure involved in taking preventive measures, cleaning up and damage to the third parties and the environment. This thesis is an attempt to explore, analyse and develop a legal framework aimed at compensating and insuring against pollution liability at sea. The international response in providing liability and compensation and the role of insurance in solving these problems has been carefully considered throughout this thesis. This thesis is divided in 5 parts beginning with an introduction and ending with a conclusion and bibliography. Part one, which comprises six chapters, seeks to overview the range of legal cases whereby liability for compensation and insurance of pollution damage may be established. The role of <b>Tort</b> or <b>Delict,</b> principally Negligence, Trespass and Nuisance, in establishing liability forms section one of this part. Chapter two outlines the role of two voluntary agreements, TOVALOP and CRISTAL, in settling the question of the liability and financial cover of the casts of oil spillage by tankers. A descriptive and analytical approach, regarding the compensation and insurance, is linked to the discussion of mandatory conventional liability for oil and other noxious substances. This is considered in chapter three, chapter four and chapter five, under the MARPOL 73 / 78, CLC, FC and HNS in full. Chapter six considers the place of liability cover in the marine insurance market and seeks to find a place for pollution liability cover...|$|R
