It is crucial for {{an electronic}} throttle to design a controller that can offer an accurate and fast reference tracking performance {{in the presence of}} nonlinearities, such as friction in the gearbox and “limp-home ” nonlinearity. This paper presents a nonlinear dynamic inversion based control algorithm for electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>systems.</b> Using the proposed method, the specified control performance can be achieved by canceling inherent nonlinear characteristics of the electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>system.</b> The control performance is investigated through a set of simulation results...|$|R

The experiments are carried out with different mixture strength, stream velocity and throttle positions. It is observed that A/F ratio has no effect on SMD.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{an answer to}} the need of finding the optimal {{solution}} for the <b>throttling</b> <b>system</b> in refrigerating machines using CO 2 as working fluid; such a solution must combine reliability, low installation cost and high energy efficiency. To this purpose, different expansion systems are compared by means of a simulation programme, including a new one, operating with a differential valve, a liquid receiver and a thermostatic valve. The typical compression refrigerating cycle performed by CO 2 involves transcritical operations and therefore the upper pressure needs to be adjusted to the optimal value, that, unlike the traditional cycle, is not determined by heat transfer. The innovative system here proposed shows an intrinsic self-adjusting capability that leads to COP values quite close to the maximum ones when a fixed suitable value of the differential pressure is chosen, even if the temperature of the secondary fluid varies to a large extent...|$|E

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider {{delivers}} up to 32 million physics collisions per second. This rate is far {{too high}} to be processed by present-day computer farms, let alone stored on disk by the experiments for offline analysis. A fast selection of interesting events must therefore be made. In the CMS experiment this is implemented in two stages: the Level- 1 Trigger of the CMS experiment uses custom-made, fast electronics, while the experiment's high-level trigger is implemented in computer farms. The Level- 1 Global Trigger electronics has to receive signals from the subdetector systems that enter the trigger (mostly from muon detectors and calorimeters), synchronize them, determine if a pre-set trigger condition is fulfilled, check if the various subsystems are ready to accept triggers based on information from the Trigger <b>Throttling</b> <b>System</b> and on calculations of possible dead-times, and finally distribute the trigger ("Level- 1 Accept") together with timing signals to the subdetectors over the so-called "Trigger, Timing and Control" distribution tree of the experiment.

40|$|Temperature {{variations}} in {{large portions of}} the mantle are mainly controlled by the reversible and irreversible transformation of mechanical energy related to pressure and viscous forces into internal energy along with diffusion of heat and chemical reactions. The simplest approach to determine the temperature gradient is {{to assume that the}} dynamic process involved is adiabatic and reversible, which means that entropy remains constant in the system. However, heat conduction and viscous dissipation during dynamic processes effectively create entropy. The adiabatic and non-adiabatic temperature variation under the influence of a constant or varying gravitational field are discussed in this study {{from the perspective of the}} Joule–Thomson (JT) <b>throttling</b> <b>system</b> in relation to the transport equation for change of entropy. The JT model describes a dynamic irreversible process in which entropy in the system increases but enthalpy remains constant (at least in an equipotential gravitational field). A comparison is made between the thermal gradient from the JT model and the thermal gradient from two models, a mantle convection and a plume geodynamic model, coupled with thermodynamics including a complete description of the entropy variation. The results show that the difference is relatively small and suggests that thermal structure of the asthenospheric mantle can be well approximated by an isenthalpic model when the formulation includes the effect of the gravitational field. For non-dynamic or parameterized mantle dynamic studies, the JT formulation provides a better description of the thermal gradient than the classic isentropic formulation...|$|E
