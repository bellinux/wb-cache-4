[...] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time {{but it does not}} mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, {{you have to do it}} at least three times <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times." [...] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.|$|E

60|$|And what an {{expansion}} that <b>was,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure!</b> when <b>you</b> {{take into account}} the display of white teeth and red gums by which it was accompanied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Though <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> were disarming {{suspicion}} by so cautiously {{keeping the}} road between you. I {{should never have}} guessed what you had been at." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> {{shall have}} a lot of these for nothing, and some tobacco too," [...] said the trader, handing the gifts to the Indian.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a {{pleasant}} hearing. Mrs. Sterling has been praising you, but I wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> were as satisfied as she. And how does David wear? well, I hope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{the wild}} beasts, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b> Have <b>you</b> not heard that we <b>are</b> <b>to</b> have as {{passengers}} on the voyage home two leopards, an elephant, and a rhinoceros?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mr Heames, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b> Don't <b>you</b> go {{and have}} anythink {{to say to the}} other one, Miss Mealyer, pray don't; he ain't no good; he ain't indeed." ...|$|R

60|$|HUNT. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> ain't. (And do I blame you? Not me.) But, {{speaking}} as one {{man of the}} world to another, you naturally see a great deal of bad company.|$|E
6000|$|... "In this way, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure!</b> <b>You</b> have {{reminded}} me that I can provide for Miss Henley--and the sooner the better. There's our friend the doctor down-stairs, ready to be my reference. Don't you see it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{you poor}} thing, {{there you are}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure!</b> <b>You</b> don't know what fine times we have had at the palace! The King's son carried my {{daughter}} about, but the poor thing fell and broke her arm.' ...|$|E

60|$|But {{perhaps the}} best way to drive the hours before you four-in-hand, is to select a soft plank on the gun-deck, and go to sleep. A fine specific, which seldom fails, unless, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>you</b> have been {{sleeping}} all the twenty-four hours beforehand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure!</b> Now, <b>you</b> girls think that's {{a dreadful}} thing, but we men don't mind it. My hands are getting so hard, you've no idea. And, Mara, we caught a great shark." ...|$|R
