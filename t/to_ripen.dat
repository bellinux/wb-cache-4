5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity <b>to</b> <b>ripen</b> 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} use of {{the term}} Primitivo appears in Italian governmental publications of the 1870s. The name derives from the terms primativus or primaticcio, which refer to the grape's tendency <b>to</b> <b>ripen</b> earlier than other varieties. This name's appearance, 40 years after the first documented {{use of the}} term Zinfandel, was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic; however, this hypothesis has become unlikely since the discovery of the vine's Croatian origin.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed <b>to</b> <b>ripen</b> while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and pungent in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E

5|$|The cabbage tree's year {{begins in}} autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves {{projecting}} from {{the centre of}} each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers {{on the outside of}} the tree, exposed to insects and birds. Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and terpenes, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit <b>to</b> <b>ripen,</b> and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser of the seeds. Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in linoleic acid as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years. Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.|$|E

40|$|Non-destructive quality {{detection}} and automatic grading {{are important in}} fruit industry. The traditional way divides bananas into 7 -level ripening stages based on color. This study investigated the changes of peel color at three positions of banana fingers, i. e. stalk, middle and tip. A support vector machine method was used <b>to</b> classify the <b>ripening</b> stages by color value L*, a* and b* as input data. The ripening stages were classified by 10 -fold cross validation method of support vector machines with radial basis function kernel and linear function kernel.

25|$|The grape {{requires}} a long growing season, as it buds early and is slow <b>to</b> <b>ripen.</b> The grape requires sufficient warmth <b>to</b> <b>ripen</b> fully, {{but too much}} warmth and its flavours can become diluted. Harvests in Italy have traditionally begun after September 29, with modern harvest often taking place in mid-late October. A longer growing season gives the grapes time to develop richness and potential body. However, in cool vintages this can result in the grapes having high levels of acidity and harsh, unripened tannins. In regions (like some areas of Tuscany) that are prone to rainfall in October, {{there is a risk}} for rot due to the Sangiovese grape's thin skin. In other areas, such as the dry conditions of the Columbia Valley AVA of Washington State, the grape has good resistance to drought conditions and often requires little irrigation.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{emphasizes}} must weights {{because its}} climate {{makes it a}} challenge <b>to</b> <b>ripen</b> grapes fully, but many vintners believe that the classification system does not improve wine quality.

Data from planting dates trials conducted over the Kabotar-Abad Agricultural Research Station, Isfahan during 2003 - 2009 {{were used to}} develop models for estimating developmental stages duration of Sofea safflower variety. To model duration of each developmental stage, duration of each developmental stage considered {{as the dependent variable}} and various temperature variables, day length and combination of them considered as the independent variables in a stepwise regression procedure. A step of regression was considered appropriate when the highest R 2 was accompanied by the significant (p≤ 0. 05) regression coefficient and partial R 2. The number of days from planting to emergence, emergence to head visible, emergence to flowering, emergence <b>to</b> <b>ripening</b> and flowering <b>to</b> <b>ripening</b> were affected by planting dates. Developmental stages duration reduced as temperature increased. Day length had the highest effect on emergence to head visible and emergence to flowering durations and reduced as day length increased. Tmin, T 2 min and T 4 min were the variables which entered the regression model and explained about 91 % of variation of planting to emergence duration. Durations of emergence to head visible and emergence to flowering were explained by DL×Tmax and DL 2 ×T 2 max in accuracy of 90 % and 96 %, respectively. T 3 max and T 4 max explained the most variance (99. 64 %) of emergence <b>to</b> <b>ripening</b> duration.

40|$|Bird damage <b>to</b> <b>ripening</b> and {{sprouting}} agricultural crops is {{a serious}} problem in many Departamentos (States) in Uruguay and a limiting factor in the production of some crops. A total of about one million hectares of wheat, corn, sunflowers, grain sorghum, rice, soybeans, barley, oats, and peanuts are grown (De Grazio and Besser, 1975). Grain sorghum and sunflower crops are damaged most seriously by birds; corn and rice, soybeans, peanuts, and fruits (such as apples and pears), to a lesser extent. Three families of birds are responsible for most of the damage: doves and pigeons, parakeets, and blackbirds. Waterfowl and fringillids also contribute to bird damage problems in the production of cereal grains. Both cereal and oil grains are attacked as they sprout but more serious losses occur as crops ripen. Damage by the Eared Dove (zenaida auriculata) <b>to</b> <b>ripening</b> grain sorghum and sunflowers and by the Monk Parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) <b>to</b> <b>ripening</b> sunflowers and corn are the most serious problems. Eared Doves, the Spot-winged Pigeon (columba maculosa) and Picazuro Pigeons (columba picazuro) sometimes seriously damage emerging soybeans. Blackbirds, chiefly the Chestnut-capped Blackbird (Agelaius ruficapillus) and three species of cowbirds (Molothrus bonariensus, M. badius and M. rufoaxillarls), damage rice both when sprouting and ripening. Waterfowl, mostly the White-faced Tree Duck (Dendiocygna viduata), sometimes heavily damage rice seed in flooded paddies. Lesser amounts of damage are caused by parakeets <b>to</b> <b>ripening</b> wheat and grain sorghum fields and by pigeons and doves <b>to</b> <b>ripening</b> barley and oat plantings. To alleviate these losses, the Department of Plant Health of Uruguay (Direccion de Sanidad Vegetal) began organized campaigns nearly a decade ago to reduce the numbers of Monk Parakeets and Eared Doves in zones where crop damage was most severe. Some measure of success was attained in some areas by spraying the colonial nests of Monk Parakeets with contact toxicants and by baiting harvested fields with oral toxicants for Eared Doves (Martinez, 1971). In 1973, the Uruguayan Government sought the assistance of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, through the U. S. Agency for International Development, Department of State, for additional methods of protecting their crops from birds.
