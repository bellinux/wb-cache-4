40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{toxic chemical}} substance management in three U. S. manufacturing sectors from 1991 to 2008. Decomposition analysis applying the logarithmic mean Divisia index {{is used to}} analyze changes in toxic chemical substance emissions by the following five factors: cleaner production, end-of-pipe <b>treatment,</b> <b>transfer</b> for further management, mixing of intermediate materials, and production scale. Based on our results, the chemical manufacturing sector reduced toxic chemical substance emissions mainly via end-of-pipe treatment. In the meantime, transfer for further management contributed to the reduction of toxic chemical substance emissions in the fabricated metal industry. This occurred because the environmental business market expanded in the 1990 s, and the infrastructure for the recycling of metal and other wastes became more efficient. Cleaner production is the main contributor to toxic chemical reduction in the electrical product industry. This implies that the electrical product industry is successful in developing a more environmentally friendly product design and production process. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{objective}} is to explore changes over time in the information and participation preferences of newly diagnosed stage IIIb/IV non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Methods Patients were recruited by physicians in 13 hospitals and interviewed every 2 months until the fourth and every 4 months until the sixth interview. Results Sixty-seven patients were interviewed three times. Over a period of 4 months from diagnosis, half of patients changed their information preferences for palliative care and end-of-life decisions with a possible or certain lifeshortening effect (ELDs, e. g., non-treatment decisions) in both directions, from not wanting to wanting the information, but also-and as much-from wanting to no longer wanting it. The latter {{were more likely to}} be in a better physical condition. Preferences for participation in medical decision making also changed: 50 %to 78 %, depending on the type of decision (general, <b>treatment,</b> <b>transfer</b> or ELD), changed their preference towards wanting more or less participation. Pain seemed to be a trigger for patients wanting more involvement, which contrasts with studies suggesting that patients who are more ill tend to give up more control. Conclusions Doctors should regularly ask their advanced lung cancer patients how much information and participation they want because preferences do change in unexpected ways. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{transfer}} between bacteria has a {{long and}} storied history. Starting shortly after the discovery by Avery, MacLeod and McCarty that DNA was the genetic material, the exchange of DNA between bacteria confirmed that DNA transfer could stably change the phenotypic behavior of organisms.

Methodology: Included in the study were elderly patients (75 +) receiving health care in the municipality admitted to hospital emergency department or discharged to community health care with hip fracture or with a general medical diagnosis. Participant observations of admission and discharge transitions (n = 41) were carried out by two researchers. Results: Six main challenges with belonging descriptions have been identified: (1) next of kin (bridging providers, advocacy, support, information brokering), (2) patient characteristics (level of satisfaction, level of insecurity, complex clinical conditions), (3) health care personnel's competence (professional, system, awareness of others’ roles), (4) information exchange (oral, written, electronic), (5) context (stability, variability, change incentives, number of patient handovers) and (6) patient assessment (complex clinical picture, patient description, clinical assessment). Conclusion: Related to the six main challenges, several measures have been suggested to improve quality in transitional care, e. g. information to and involvement of patients and next of kin, staff training, standardisation of routines and inter-organisational staff meetings. </p...|$|E

Of 265 patients, 209 (79 %) completed at least 6 months' treatment, 3 (1 %) were treatment failures, 23 (9 %) died, 8 (3 %) defaulted from treatment and 22 (8 %) left the country. The proportion of successful treatments did not significantly differ between the 103 Swiss-born (80 %) and the 162 foreign-born (78 %) patients. There were 19 deaths (18 %) in the Swiss-born and 4 (2 %) in the foreign-born groups; death was caused by TB in two patients, 10 died of other causes (cause unknown in 11). In the foreign-born group there were 31 (19 %) potentially unsatisfactory outcomes (treatment failure, default from <b>treatment,</b> <b>transfer</b> abroad) and in the Swiss-born group 2 (2 %).

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of nitrogen source on rates of net N transfer between plants connected by a common mycorrhizal network, we measured transfer of N supplied as (NH 4 NO 3) -N- 15 -N- 14 or (NH 4 NO 3) -N- 14 -N- 15 in three Casuarina/Eucalyptus treatments interconnected by a Pisolithus sp. The treatments were nonnodulated nonmycorrhizal/nonmycorrhizal; nonnodulated mycorrhizal/mycorrhizal; and nodulated mycorrhizal/mycorrhizal. Mycorrhization was 67 % in Eucalyptus and 36 % in Casuarina. N- 2 fixation supplied 38 % of the N in Casuarina. Biomass, N and N- 15 contents were lowest in nonmycorrhizal plants and greatest in plants in the nodulated/mycorrhizal treatment. Nitrogen transfer was enhanced by mycorrhization and by nodulation, and was greater when N was supplied as (NH 4 +) -N- 15 than (NO 3 -) -N- 15. Nitrogen transfer rates were lowest in the nonmycorrhizal treatment for either N- 15 source, and greatest in the nodulated, mycorrhizal <b>treatment.</b> <b>Transfer</b> was greater to Casuarina than to Eucalyptus and where ammonium rather than nitrate was the N source. Irrespective of N- 15 source and of whether Casuarina or Eucalyptus was the N sink, net N transfer was low and was similar in both nonnodulated treatments. However, when Casuarina was the N sink in the nodulated, mycorrhizal treatment, net N transfer was much greater with (NH 4 +) -N- 15 than with (NO 3 -) -N- 15. High N demand by Casuarina resulted in greater net N transfer from the less N-demanding Eucalyptus. Net transfer of N from a non-N- 2 -fixing to an N- 2 -fixing plant may reflect the very high N demand of N- 2 -fixing species...|$|E

40|$|Trafficking {{pathways}} {{underlying the}} assembly of connexins into gap junctions were examined using living COS- 7 cells expressing a range of connexin-aequorin (Cx-Aeq) chimeras. By measuring the chemiluminescence of the aequorin fusion partner, the translocation of oligomerized connexins from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane was shown to occur at different rates that depended on the connexin isoform. Treatment of COS- 7 cells expressing Cx 32 -Aeq and Cx 43 -Aeq with brefeldin A inhibited the movement of these chimera to the plasma membrane by 84 ± 4 and 88 ± 4 %, respectively. Nocodazole treatment of the cells expressing Cx 32 -Aeq and Cx 43 -Aeq produced 29 ± 16 and 4 ± 7 % inhibition, respectively. In contrast, the transport of Cx 26 to the plasma membrane, studied using a construct (Cx 26 / 43 T-Aeq) in which the short cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail of Cx 26 was replaced with the extended carboxyl terminus of Cx 43, was inhibited 89 ± 5 % by nocodazole and was minimally affected by exposure of cells to brefeldin A (17 ± 11 %). The transfer of Lucifer yellow across gap junctions between cells expressing wild-type Cx 32, Cx 43, and the corresponding Cx 32 -Aeq and Cx 43 -Aeq chimeras was reduced by nocodazole treatment and abolished by brefeldin A treatment. However, the extent of dye coupling between cells expressing wild-type Cx 26 or the Cx 26 / 43 T-Aeq chimeras was not significantly affected by brefeldin A treatment, but after nocodazole <b>treatment,</b> <b>transfer</b> of dye to neighboring cells was greatly reduced. These contrasting effects of brefeldin A and nocodazole on the trafficking properties and intercellular dye transfer are interpreted to suggest that two pathways contribute to the routing of connexins to the gap junction...|$|E
40|$|A {{corpus of}} {{evidence}} suggests that T-helper type 1 (Th 1) -dependent cellular immunity plays {{a pivotal role in}} the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. This study was intended to find ways to prevent the devel-opment of NOD diabetes using a neutralizing anti–interleukin (IL) - 12 antibody (C 17. 8) that inhibits Th 1 cell differentiation. When C 17. 8 was administered from 5 to 30 weeks of age, NOD mice exhibited sup-pression of both insulitis and diabetes. However, when C 17. 8 administration ceased at 15 weeks of age, 8 of 13 recipients showed diabetes at 30 weeks of age. These results suggest that IL- 12 plays an important role not only in the development of effector cells but also in their activation. In contrast, when C 17. 8 was injected into 2 -week-old female NOD mice for 6 consecutive days, all 16 recipients showed diabetes at 30 weeks of age, whereas 12 of 20 control mice became diabetic. This result suggests that depletion of endogenous IL- 12 at a young age results in the enhancement of diabetes. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that activated memory T-cells were present in higher numbers after C 17. 8 <b>treatment.</b> <b>Transfer</b> of spleen cells from 15 -week-old C 17. 8 -treated NOD mice to NOD-scid mice resulted in an earlier onset and a higher incidence of diabetes. Furthermore, adminis-tration of C 17. 8 to 2 -week-old NOD mice also resulted in a much earlier onset of diabetes. These results sug-gest that short-term treatment with anti–IL- 12 antibody prohibits IL- 2 production at a young age, which may influence the expansion and apoptosis of pathogenic T-cells, resulting in the acceleration of autoimmune dia-betes.

The complete {{amino acid sequence}} of enterocin EJ 97 was elucidated after automated microsequencing of oligopeptides generated by endoproteinase GluC digestion and cyanogen bromide <b>treatment.</b> <b>Transfer</b> of the 60 -kb conjugative plasmid pEJ 97 from the bacteriocinogenic strain E. faecalis EJ 97 to E. faecalis OG 1 X conferred bacteriocin production and resistance on the recipient. The genetic determinants of enterocin EJ 97 were located in an 11. 3 -kb EcoRI-BglII DNA fragment of pEJ 97. This region was cloned and sequenced. It contains the ej 97 A structural gene plus three open reading frames (ORFs) (ej 97 B, ej 97 C, and ej 97 D) and three putative ORFs transcribed {{in the opposite direction}} (orfA, orfB, and orfC). The gene ej 97 A translated as a 44 -amino-acid residue mature protein lacking a leader peptide with no homology to other bacteriocins described so far. The product of ej 97 B (Ej 97 B) shows strong homology in its C-terminal domain to the superfamily of bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporters. The products of ej 97 C (Ej 97 C) and ej 97 D (Ej 97 D) could be proteins with 71 and 64 residues, respectively, of unknown functions and with no significant similarity to known proteins. There are two additional ORFs (ORF 1 and ORF 6) flanking the ej 97 module, which have been identified as a transposon-like structure (tnp). ORF 1 shows similarities to transposase of the Lactococcus lactis element ISS 1 and is up to 50 % identical to IS 1216. This is flanked by two 18 -bp inverted repeats (IRs) that are almost identical to those of ISS 1 and IS 1216. ORF 6 (resEJ 97) shows strong homology to the resolvase of plasmid pAM 373 and up to 40 to 50 % homology with the recombinase of several multiresistant plasmids and transposons from Staphylococcus aureus and E. faecalis. These data suggest that EJ 97 could represent a new class of bacteriocins with a novel secretion mechanism and that the whole structure could be a composite transposon. Furthermore, two additional gene clusters were found: one cluster is probably related to the region responsible for the replication of plasmid pEJ 97, and the second cluster is related to the sex pheromone response. These regions showed a high homology to the corresponding regions of the conjugative plasmids pAM 373, pPD 1, and pAD 1 of E. faecalis, suggesting that they have a common origin...|$|E
