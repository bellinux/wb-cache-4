5|$|Jeffrey {{insists on}} {{returning}} to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing ear, {{as well as the}} Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door,</b> Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. Dorothy and her son are reunited.|$|E
500|$|Kurt Cobain wrote [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] {{in early}} 1992. Cobain {{forgot about the}} song for a while, but began working on it again {{when he and his}} wife, Courtney Love, moved to a house in the Hollywood Hills. In a 1994 Rolling Stone interview, Love said she overheard him working on the song's riff in a closet. She said she asked him if she could use the riff for one of her songs, to which he replied, [...] " [...] off!" [...] and closed <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door.</b> [...] "He was trying to be so sneaky", said Love. [...] "I could hear that one from downstairs." [...] The couple shared a journal in which they would write lyrics; Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross noted that Love's songwriting {{sensibility}} informed Cobain's on the song. The song's name came from a heart-shaped box Love had given Cobain. However, Cobain had originally titled the song [...] "Heart-Shaped Coffin".|$|E
500|$|Spinks visits Rob at {{his home}} the {{following}} day, annoyed at being fired from Lucky Boy for lying about his criminal record. He confronts Rob with evidence of his role in Pankow's murder - a vial of Rob's diet pills with a bloody fingerprint on the lid - and attempts to blackmail him. Later that day, Rob intrudes Spinks' residence to retrieve his pills, but hides in a closet when Spinks returns; noticing that someone is in his home, Spinks arms himself with a baseball bat. As Spinks heads to the closet, Rob takes off his disguise, opens <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door,</b> and reveals his true self to a stunned Spinks before killing him. Rob later meets with Dr. Mindy Rinehart, a counselor hired by Lucky Boy to consult the employees following Pankow's killing. In session with her, Rob admits that he is battling an [...] "eating disorder." [...] Rinehart sends him to an Overeaters Anonymous meeting, not fully understanding Rob's true nature.|$|E
60|$|His feet freed, the {{boy looked}} about for some means by which to escape from <b>the</b> <b>closet.</b> <b>The</b> <b>door</b> was locked, as has been mentioned, {{but it was a}} poor affair, and Hal knew he could easily force it open with his shoulder.|$|R
50|$|It is an uptempo song sung by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), instructing the two children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber) {{to clean}} their room. But {{even though the}} task is daunting, with a good attitude, it can still be fun. The melody is heard {{throughout}} the film as Mary's leitmotif. As part of the interlude, she sees that Michael couldn't get out of <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>doors</b> that open and close rapidly.|$|R
60|$|Advancing up the room, {{looking as}} cool and {{careless}} as I possibly could, in short, ayant l'air de rien, I slightly {{pushed the door}} and found it was ajar. In an instant, and with sharpness, I had turned on her. In another instant she occupied <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was shut, and the key in my pocket.|$|R
500|$|In 1997, Gittings and Lahusen {{pushed the}} American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to grant couple's {{membership}} to them, for a reduced price on health insurance. One {{of her last}} acts as an activist was {{to come out in}} the newsletter published by the assisted living facility they reside in. On February 18, 2007, Gittings died in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania after a long battle with breast cancer. She is survived by her life partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen, and her sister, Eleanor Gittings Taylor. In 1999, Gittings summed up her inspiration for her activism: [...] "As a teenager, I had to struggle alone to learn about myself and {{what it meant to be}} gay. Now for 48 years I've had the satisfaction of working with other gay people all across the country to get the bigots off our backs, to oil <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> hinges, to change prejudiced hearts and minds, and to show that gay love is good for us and for the rest of the world too. It's hard work— but it's vital, and it's gratifying, and it's often fun!" ...|$|E
2500|$|While the Countess and Cherubino {{are waiting}} for Susanna to come back, they {{suddenly}} hear the Count arriving. Cherubino hides in the closet. The Count demands to be allowed {{into the room and}} the Countess reluctantly unlocks the door. The Count enters and hears a noise from the closet. He tries to open it, but it is locked. The Countess tells him it is only Susanna, trying on her wedding dress. At this moment, Susanna re-enters unobserved, quickly realizes what's going on, and hides behind a couch (Trio: Susanna, or via, sortite – [...] "Susanna, come out!"). The Count shouts for her to identify herself by her voice, but the Countess orders her to be silent. Furious and suspicious, the Count leaves, with the Countess, in search of tools to force <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> open. As they leave, he locks all the bedroom doors to prevent the intruder from escaping. Cherubino and Susanna emerge from their hiding places, and Cherubino escapes by jumping through the window into the garden. Susanna then takes Cherubino's former place in the closet, vowing to make the Count look foolish (duet: Aprite, presto, aprite – [...] "Open the door, quickly!").|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> {{was still}} open, and {{that gave me}} a sudden idea.|$|E
60|$|He {{was still}} a {{prisoner}} in <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of which was an old fashioned one and thick. But by bracing his feet against the back wall, Dick got a firm hold and soon his shoulder on the barrier caused it to bend and creak. Then the lock gave way and the door flew open with a bang.|$|R
50|$|Mike and Sulley {{are visiting}} Monsters University {{for the weekend}} to see how their Oozma Kappa {{fraternity}} brothers are doing. The group is throwing its first party, {{but no one has}} shown up. However, Mike and Sulley have a plan to liven up the house. Using a borrowed door station, they sneak into a party at the Roar Omega Roar fraternity and steal all of its food and guests to fill the Oozma Kappa house. The supply runs take them through <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>doors</b> of a married couple's bedroom, repeatedly disturbing their sleep.|$|R
60|$|So saying, he {{left the}} room, and rushed into an {{adjacent}} <b>closet,</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of which he locked and bolted.|$|R
60|$|This was {{immediately}} {{followed by a}} light single tap at <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{the head of}} the school strode to <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> and {{unlocked}} it.|$|E
60|$|Before Gaff spoke again, <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> {{once more}} opened, and a slender sprightly girl just budding into womanhood tripped across the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "They sure do {{look like}} some goats now!" [...] cried Andy gaily. Then {{the animals were}} shoved back into <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed.|$|R
50|$|On July 7, 1980, after Shiue {{left for}} work, Mary Stauffer managed {{to remove the}} hinge pin from <b>the</b> locked <b>closet</b> <b>door.</b> Despite being chained to each other, Mary and Elizabeth were able to reach {{the phone in the}} kitchen and call law enforcement. After making the call, they hid behind the car at Shiue's {{residence}} until police arrived. Both were immediately freed after seven weeks of imprisonment.|$|R
60|$|The gag was {{inserted}} in Hal's mouth, {{and then he}} was lifted up by Macklin and the others and dumped into the corner of <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was closed and locked upon him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That ram isn't {{going to}} do anything," [...] began Sam, in disgust, when there came a bang on <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> that caused {{everybody}} to jump.|$|E
60|$|Another bang on {{the door}} cut his speculations short. He struck a match and lit the light, and then {{unlocking}} <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door,</b> threw it wide open.|$|E
60|$|Another bang resounded on <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door.</b> The ram had {{finished}} the apple, and wanted his freedom. The teacher leaped {{to the middle of}} the bedroom floor.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{suspicion}} of foul play, the death was ruled an accident; {{a case of}} starvation and exposure as Barker was unable to escape <b>the</b> <b>closet.</b> Investigators concluded that Barker died on February 28, three days after her disappearance. As a result, <b>the</b> mayor ordered <b>closet</b> <b>doors</b> to open more easily. The press surrounding the Barker case also led to the first calls about the Boy in the Box.|$|R
50|$|There {{is similar}} {{decoration}} {{in the western}} parlor, but without the doorway cornices. Next to its fireplace is an original china <b>closet.</b> <b>The</b> <b>door</b> leads to the west entry to the house.|$|R
50|$|When Moe shoots at Joe up the chimney, you {{can hear}} Shemp Howard's yell from He Cooked His Goose. In a {{cost-saving}} measure, Joe Besser's voice was not dubbed over Shemp's for authenticity. In addition, when Larry is walking in the hallway from the elevator to meet Moe’s wife, Joe is hiding in <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> wearing a Santa Claus outfit; however, it is Shemp who is whistling at Larry. Also, Shemp’s face {{can be seen in}} the background peeking from underneath the bearskin rug and can be seen when he opens <b>the</b> janitor <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> and slams Larry in the hallway.|$|R
60|$|He opened <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> cautiously, and peeped out. Hardwick sat in an easy-chair, smoking savagely, {{as if he}} {{were out}} of humor. No one else was in the place.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{have they}} done?" [...] wailed the hired girl. [...] "I just {{went into the}} pantry and opened <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> and out jumped about a {{thousand}} mice at me!" ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he pushed}} open <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> and stepped forth. Miss Longstreth had her head lowered upon {{her arms and}} {{appeared}} to be in distress. At his touch she raised a quivering face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is {{an apple}} he can have--that will keep him quiet for awhile," [...] said Roger, {{and put it}} in <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> locking <b>the</b> <b>door</b> as before. The ram was hungry, and began to munch the fruit with satisfaction.|$|R
40|$|Sport psychologists work in {{a variety}} of settings, often with athletes who have qualities that most people find attractive. For athletes, their worlds are usually filled with people who have agendas other than their {{happiness}} (e. g., medals, fame, future financial gains). The sport psychologist may be the only person with whom the athlete can talk about deeper issues than training and performance. Romantic or erotic attraction between sport psychologists and those in their care probably occurs more often than many would believe, or want to believe. The topic is so taboo that it is often kept in <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> in <b>the</b> training and education of sport psychologists. Erotic feelings in service are often disturbing, shocking, and sources of professional and personal shame. Helping students and practitioners of sport psychology understand the roots of these phenomena may go a long way towards a better understanding of our all-too-human responses to those we serve. In Part I we review the literature on erotic transference and countertransference in psychotherapy and sport psychology service delivery and make suggestions for opening <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>doors</b> on these phenomena for educators, students, supervisees, and supervisors. ...|$|R
5|$|In 2009, Boom! Studios {{produced}} a Monsters Inc. comic book mini-series that ran for four issues. The storyline takes {{place after the}} movie and focuses on Sulley and Mike's daily struggles to operate Monsters Inc. on its new laughter-focused company policy. At the same time, their work is impeded by the revenge schemes of Randall and Waternoose, {{as well as a}} human child (indirectly revealed to be Sid Phillips from the Toy Story franchise) who has hijacked <b>the</b> company's <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> technology to commit a string of toy thefts throughout the human world.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, what is {{the next}} move in this game of chess?" [...] he mused, {{as he took the}} key of <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door</b> from his pocket and thoughtfully {{contemplated}} this tiny engine of his far-reaching and elaborate schemes.|$|E
60|$|He {{seized the}} poker from the {{fireplace}} and delivered two rapid blows on <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door.</b> The wood was splintered. A third blow smashed the flimsy lock. The closet, with any skeletons it might contain, was open for all to view.|$|E
60|$|Rollo's father {{accordingly}} arose, {{and came}} to <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> <b>door.</b> He opened the door wide, and then explained to the boys, that {{the beginning of the}} movement of the door, when it was wide open, did not drive out any air.|$|E
5000|$|Leeds Student {{has stirred}} debate over {{a variety of}} articles. These range from a full-page {{interview}} with BNP leader Nick Griffin, in which a remark that homosexuals {{should be kept in}} <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind them [...] "kept firmly shut" [...] (as well as other, race-based comments) caused great offence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sold him!"

60|$|He {{led the way}} to {{an alley}} halfway down the block. This ran {{to the rear of the}} tavern, where there was a door {{communicating}} with a hallway and a back stairs. Under the stairs was a closet filled with discarded cooking utensils. <b>The</b> <b>closet</b> had two <b>doors,</b> one opening into a drinking-room behind the main bar-room of the tavern.|$|R
