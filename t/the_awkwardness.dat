5|$|Van Eyck {{does not}} shy from showing the {{physical}} {{effects of the}} canon's illness, including worn, crevassed and tired skin, weak vision, enlarged temporal arteries and swollen fingers. <b>The</b> <b>awkwardness</b> with which van der Paele clutches his breviary suggests weakness in his left arm; van de Paele probably suffered acute arm and shoulder pain, borne out by early 1430s church records documenting that he was excused from morning duties, and absent all day by 1434. His condition has been diagnosed by modern doctors as possibly polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, McCreery {{suggested}} {{reforms to}} the Order of Canada that would avert <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> around appointing those in Canada's royal family as full {{members of the}} order: He theorized that the Queen, as the order's Sovereign, could simply appoint, on ministerial advice, anyone as an extra member, or the monarch could issue an ordinance allowing for her relations to be made regular members when approved. Similarly, McCreery proposed that a new division of the order could be established specifically for governors general, their spouses, {{and members of the}} Royal Family, a version of which was adopted in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Clannad story {{revolves}} around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year {{high school student}} who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him {{to distance himself from}} others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.|$|E

He was a blunderer. Instinct told her that, if she met Freddie, he would talk of Derek, and, if thinking of Derek was touching an exposed nerve, talking of him would be like pressing on that nerve with a heavy hand. She shivered.|$|R
5|$|For the {{majority}} of its history the area now recognised as the Rhondda Valley was an exclusively Welsh speaking area. It was only in the early 20th century that English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned while travelling through Ystradyfodwg, that he had only met one person with whom he could talk, and then {{with the help of an}} interpreter. This situation was repeated with John George Wood, who on his visit to the area complained of <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were on times difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand. This dialect was once called 'tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran' ('the dialect of the men of Gloran').|$|E
5|$|LC filters at low {{frequencies}} become awkward; the components, especially the inductors, become expensive, bulky, heavy, and non-ideal. Practical 1H inductors require many {{turns on a}} high-permeability core; that material will have high losses and stability issues (e.g., a large temperature coefficient). For applications such as a mains filters, <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> must be tolerated. For low-level, low-frequency, applications, RC filters are possible, but they cannot implement filters with complex poles or zeros. If the application can use power, then amplifiers {{can be used to}} make RC active filters that can have complex poles and zeros. In the 1950s, Sallen–Key active RC filters were made with vacuum tube amplifiers; these filters replaced the bulky inductors with bulky and hot vacuum tubes. Transistors offered more power-efficient active filter designs. Later, inexpensive operational amplifiers enabled other active RC filter design topologies. Although active filter designs were commonplace at {{low frequencies}}, they were impractical at high frequencies where the amplifiers were not ideal; LC (and transmission line) filters were still used at radio frequencies.|$|E
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E

25|$|Anti-clockwise {{direction}} from the M25, the main carriageway continues directly on to the M26 at junction 5. To remain on the M25, traffic must turn on to the slip road which connects to the M25 spur coming north from Sevenoaks, which is multiplexed with the A21. <b>The</b> <b>awkwardness</b> of junction 5 {{is a result of}} the history of the two motorways' planning and construction.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1860s, Trollope {{had reached}} a fairly senior {{position}} within the Post Office hierarchy, despite ongoing differences with Rowland Hill, who {{was at that time}} Chief Secretary to the Postmaster General. Postal history credits Trollope with introducing the pillar box (the ubiquitous mail-box) in the United Kingdom. He was earning a substantial income from his novels. He had overcome <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> of his youth, made good friends in literary circles, and hunted enthusiastically.|$|E

25|$|The {{system had}} some weaknesses. The line was {{composed}} {{of a series of}} contiguous boxes. The boundaries were defined by the limitations of the Würzburg radar. <b>The</b> <b>awkwardness</b> of the plotting system used within each box prior to 1942 and the absence of an air-mounted IFF (Identification Friend or Foe), meant that only one fighter at a time could be controlled from the ground. One Würzburg controlled the fighter, the other tracked the bomber. The two plots were not represented on a single radarscope; they came from two different individual operators, each of whom projected a different coloured circle on a plotting table. The controller radioed directions to the fighter on the basis of data provided by the plotting table. Until IFF became available, blips could not be identified.|$|E
25|$|In theater, {{there are}} quite a few plays and musicals that have lesbian {{characters}} or focus on lesbian themes. One particular musical that has received a lot of recognition in the past few years is Fun Home. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Fun Home is a personal account of Alison Bechdel's self-discovery as a lesbian. The show also features themes of the decision to come out, having sex for the first time, and coming to terms with one's sexuality. Many of the songs in the show focus on these themes, such as the moment of recognition one knows they are gay, when they find gay role models, and <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> and authenticity that comes with first time sex. This show stands out because it normalizes the lesbian experience and speaks of lesbian sex without the fetishation found in much other media platforms.|$|E
500|$|John Walker, former {{director}} of the National Gallery of Art, referred to the subject as [...] "outré", but believed that despite <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> of her individual features, the model was nonetheless [...] "strangely beautiful".

500|$|Another {{frequently}} used technique is Hooper's tendency {{to use a}} variety of focal length camera lenses to distort the resulting picture. In The Damned United he used a 10mm lens, notably in the scene where Clough stays inside during the Derby–Leeds match. Hooper operated the camera in this scene himself. In The King's Speech, Hooper used [...] "typically 14mm, 18mm, 21mm, 25mm and 27mm" [...] lenses and put the camera close to the actors' faces. Hooper said the use of this method in the first consulting room scene served to [...] "suggest <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> and tension of Logue and Bertie's first meeting".|$|E
500|$|In their 1995 book The Unauthorized Trek: The Complete Next Generation, James Van Hise and Hal Schuster {{said that}} the episode was not as funny as it thought it was, and {{that the success of}} the Picard and the other {{children}} resulted in the adult crewmembers looking [...] "ineffectual". Mark Jones and Lance Parkin, in their 2003 book Beyond the Final Frontier : An Unauthorised Review of Star Trek, praised the child actors seen in [...] "Rascals", in particular the work of Birkin. They also added that the scene between Miles and Keiko was a highlight of the episode due to <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> portrayed.|$|E

500|$|Film scholar Peter Hames has {{summarized}} three {{themes of}} Loves of a Blonde {{that have been}} discussed repeatedly in critical writings on the film, themes that have {{been something of a}} constant throughout Forman's career: [...] "the impermanence of young love, the confusion and despair of middle age, and the gulf between the generations". [...] Another theme that is often identified involves <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> and confusion surrounding sex in a repressed society. Most critics have also commented on the confluence of comedy and sadness in the film's depiction of everyday life in a totalitarian state, [...] although while some consider Loves of a Blonde Forman's most pointed critique of Czech society under communism, others point out that the grim conditions are not solely due to misguided public policy, but that individuals create their own isolation as well.|$|E
500|$|Meyerbeer's {{relationship}} with Heine displays <b>the</b> <b>awkwardness</b> and prickliness {{of the social}} personae of both parties. Meyerbeer, apart from any of his personal feelings, needed Heine onside as an influential personality and writer on music. He genuinely admired Heine's verse, and {{made a number of}} settings from it. Heine, living in Paris from 1830, always equivocal about his loyalties between Judaism and Christianity, and always short of money, asked Meyerbeer to intervene with Heine's own family for financial support and frequently took loans and money from Meyerbeer himself. He was not above threatening Meyerbeer with blackmail by writing satirical pieces about him (and indeed Meyerbeer paid Heine's widow to suppress such writings). And yet, at Heine's death in 1856, Meyerbeer wrote in his diary 'Peace be to his ashes. I forgive him from my heart for his ingratitude and many wickednesses against me.' ...|$|E

60|$|She {{decided that}} it would be indecent to drive to Marcia's under the circumstances, and she walked; though with all the time this gave her for {{reflection}} she had not wholly banished this smile when she looked into Marcia's woe-begone eyes. But she found herself incapable of <b>the</b> <b>awkwardnesses</b> she had deliberated, and fell back upon the native motherliness of her heart, into which she took Marcia with sympathy that ignored everything but her need of help and pity. Marcia's bruised pride was broken before the goodness of the girl she had hated, and she performed her sacrifice to Bartley's injured memory, not with the haughty self-devotion which she intended should humiliate Miss Kingsbury, but with the prostration of a woman spent with watching and fasting and despair. She held Clara away for a moment of scrutiny, and then submitted to the embrace in which they recognized and confessed all.|$|R
