5|$|In August 1941 an {{artillery}} unit {{was formed to}} attack Italian forts more effectively. Initially it used a QF 4.5-inch howitzer carried on a 10-ton Mack NR 4 truck, with an accompanying light tank as an armoured observation post. However, these were {{handed over to the}} Free French at Kufra. The unit was then issued a 25 pounder portee. The LRDG successfully attacked and captured the fort at El Gtafia using the gun, but later the <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> to be abandoned and the experiment ended.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E

25|$|The {{skeletal}} remains of two adults and one child were discovered by two hunters {{in a remote}} spot on November 15–16, 2013, {{more than four years}} after the family went missing, and less than three miles away from where the family's pickup <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> been abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Assistant Trade Minister for the TFG, Abdifitah Ibrahim Rashid, accused men {{loyal to}} Defense Minister Col. Barre Hiiraale of killing ten civilians and {{kidnapping}} ten others near Dinsor, Bay region. The incident {{came after a}} man was caught driving a pickup truck loaded with ammunition and explosives.

25|$|The {{family had}} been unable to contact Urban since 16:00. Żurawski {{suspected}} that the <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> been hijacked based on its GPS coordinates, as well as indications that the truck was being driven erratically. Żurawski later identified the victim found in the truck as his cousin Urban, the original driver of the semi-trailer. It is believed that Urban was killed by the perpetrator of the attack. According to a post-mortem examination cited by the German media, Urban {{was shot in the head}} between 16:30 and 17:30.|$|E
25|$|In mid-April, Gardaí and the PSNI {{informed}} {{the public that}} the investigation teams were looking for information {{in relation to a}} white coloured Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) that was parked on the Shean Road, Forkhill, Armagh in Northern Ireland either side of 9.45 pm on 25 January 2013, the night Donohoe lost his life. The white lorry may have been broken down, and a number of people were reportedly seen around the vehicle. The two police forces added that they wanted to speak to anyone who owned the <b>truck,</b> <b>had</b> recovered or serviced it, or anyone who saw any activity of this nature on the Shean Road on the night of 25 January.|$|E
25|$|When {{the column}} of {{vehicles}} stopped suddenly during this exchange, T1 Patrol's Breda-carrying truck {{collided with the}} back of the wireless truck, wrecking its radiator; the <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> to be stripped and abandoned and the crew joined other trucks. While the wireless truck was able to continue the loss of the Breda's firepower was a setback to the unit. In addition a G1 Patrol vehicle wrecked its sump after hitting a rock and this too was stripped and abandoned. T1 Patrol's wireless truck separated from the column and parked in a field at Sidi Selim (about 12km south-east of Barce) to act as a rendezvous point after the attack; this truck was also to keep a constant radio watch for messages from Lt Col David Stirling's SAS unit operating that night against Benghazi ("Operation Bigamy").|$|E

25|$|The worst {{experience}} for Libyan Jews {{in the war}} was the internment of Cyrenaican Jews in Giado, a concentration camp located 235 kilometres from Tripoli. In January 1942, the Italian authorities began to apply Mussolini’s “Sfollamento” order to Libyan Jews. Mussolini ordered the Jews of Benghazi, Derna, Tobruk, Barce, Susa and other towns {{in the region to}} be sent to a concentration camp in Gharian in retaliation. An eyewitness described these horrifying moments: “In the synagogue they started hanging up lists every day of 20-30 families that had to leave...They took Jews from Benghazi and from the vicinity: Derna, Brace, Tobruk...The journey took five days. We travelled about 2,000 km. from Benghazi to Giado. They took us like animals to the slaughter house. Forty people in each truck and each <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> two Italian policemen. They took only Jews. According to the rumour it was the Germans who gave the order”.|$|E
500|$|The {{design was}} {{relatively}} simple, consisting of racks of parallel rails on which rockets were mounted, with a folding frame {{to raise the}} rails to launch position.

500|$|To {{create the}} scene where Jones brings a semi truck from the {{parallel}} universe, the special effects crew took a smaller truck and dressed it enough so that {{it seemed like the}} longer semi with the help of CGI; the result was that in the episode, the viewer is led to believe that the <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> been [...] "cut" [...] in half after unsuccessfully entering the prime universe doorway. It was rigged so that it appeared to be on a tilt, and cables linked it to smash into a passing car. As the production crew considered William Bell to be a [...] "Renaissance man", they filled Bell's office with [...] "things that inspire him," [...] such as a prototype of Nina's mechanical arm and other items that [...] "evoke images and stimulate thought".|$|E

50|$|In the past, many {{different}} types of bogie (<b>truck)</b> <b>have</b> been used under tramcars (e.g. Brill, Peckham, maximum traction). A maximum traction <b>truck</b> <b>has</b> one driving axle with large wheels and one nondriving axle with smaller wheels. The bogie pivot is located off-centre, so more than half the weight rests on the driving axle.|$|R
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{then was}} followed by a worldwide press corps, and crowds of spectators gathered in various European cities along the route. Crossing the Sahara, where the truck repeatedly got stuck in the sand, proved both a dangerous and laborious task. Once the <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> made it through the desert, however, and reached its final destination, it was revealed that the ice block had lost only about 11% of its original weight. When the expedition reached its goal it generated much media attention for the company. It was called [...] "the world's greatest publicity stunt". To mark the 50th anniversary of the event in 2009, the company made the original documentary of the expedition available online. They also released a new interview with the expedition's leader Sivert Klevan, who was 84 {{years old at the time}} of the interview.|$|E
2500|$|As a road stabilizer, {{magnesium}} chloride binds gravel and clay particles {{to keep them}} from leaving the road. The water-absorbing (hygroscopic) characteristics of {{magnesium chloride}} prevent the road from drying out, which keeps gravel on the ground. The road remains continually [...] "wet" [...] as if a water <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> just sprayed the road.|$|E

2500|$|Authorities {{eventually}} {{determined that}} Sparkman's {{death was a}} suicide, staged {{to look like a}} homicide. Initially, police said that Sparkman's death was not natural, but hadn't ruled whether it was a homicide, a suicide, or an accident. [...] After an investigation lasting more than two weeks by the Kentucky State Police, Sparkman's 19-year-old son, Josh Sparkman, expressed frustration and called it [...] "disrespectful" [...] that suicide or accident were still being considered. [...] In the ensuing days, Sparkman's son further said he was certain the death was a homicide, noting his father's <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> been [...] "ransacked" [...] with items stolen, such as Sparkman's census laptop and a family wedding ring, items not discovered by investigators.|$|E
2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{attributed}} {{the cause of}} the wreck to the truck driver's reaction to the grade crossing signals. [...] Thinking he could beat the train across the tracks, the driver chose to proceed onto the tracks in front of the train. [...] The driver reported that the crossing signal did not activate until his vehicle was [...] "right on top of the track," [...] but he also stated {{that he did not want}} to brake quickly to avoid a shifting load that could hit the back of the truck's cab. [...] Witnesses stated that the gates came down after the <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> entered the grade crossing. [...] One witness stated that the gate clipped the truck's trailer and that part of the gate may have broken off as a result.|$|E
2500|$|The LRDG reached Benia, about 24km to {{the south}} of Barce, on 13 September, and set up camp on a hill in a belt of trees; the 1,858km journey had taken 11 days. One <b>truck</b> <b>had</b> been {{concealed}} at a rear rendezvous point [...] "G5" [...] along with small supplies of rations and water. [...] For {{the rest of the day}} the trucks were hidden amongst the trees while the men prepared their weapons and explosives; at 3 pm Major Easonsmith held a final briefing, assisted by Major Peniakoff who knew the layout of the town. T1 Patrol would attack the airfield, which was the main target, while G1 Patrol would create a diversion by attacking the main Campo Maddelena barracks, three km south-west of Barce, and the railway station {{to the south}} of the town.|$|E
