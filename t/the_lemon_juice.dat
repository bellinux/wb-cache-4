5|$|The {{original}} {{notion of}} lemon juice being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured containers {{was the brainchild of}} Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand lemon juice in the plastic containers, using juice from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand lemon juice. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving <b>the</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for lemon juice in plastic lemon containers under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|E

5000|$|The first printed {{recipe for}} orange marmalade, though without the chunks {{typically}} used now, was in Mary Kettilby's 1714 cookery book, A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts (pages 78-79). Kettilby called for whole oranges, {{lemon juice and}} sugar, with the acid in <b>the</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> helping to create the pectin set of marmalade, by boiling the lemon and orange juice with the pulp. Kettilby then directs: [...] "boil the whole pretty fast 'till it will jelly" [...] - the first known {{use of the word}} [...] "jelly" [...] in marmalade making. Kettilby then instructs that the mixture is then poured into glasses, covered and left until set. As the acid would create a jelly, this meant that the mixture could be pulled from the heat before it had turned to a paste, keeping the marmalade much brighter and the appearance more translucent, as in modern-day marmalade.|$|E
