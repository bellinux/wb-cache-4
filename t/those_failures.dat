5|$|Sebree's final mission {{before his}} {{retirement}} saw him lead the Pacific Fleet {{on a tour}} of ports in east Asia. The fleet left San Francisco on September5, 1909, sailing west to the Philippines, with only brief stops en route. Speed testing was a major goal of {{the early part of the}} voyage and he and his fleet of eight ships broke speed records by sailing to Honolulu in just over four days. Six of the eight ships were able to make the voyage in that time; the Colorado and West Virginia had mechanical failures which prevented them from completing the voyage on time. On the Colorado, <b>those</b> <b>failures</b> led to the deaths of two crewmen due to a steam pipe explosion. From Hawaii, the fleet moved on to Manila where the ships performed target practices and exercises, as well as being cleaned and repainted, before resuming their primary mission by sailing to Yokohama, Japan. In Japan, the fleet dispersed and small groups of cruisers were dispatched to the ports of British-controlled Hong Kong, Wusong in China, and Kobe, Japan. Afterwards, the fleet returned home. Just before Sebree's retirement the Pacific Fleet was split into two: a smaller Pacific Fleet and an Asiatic Fleet commanded by Rear Admiral John Hubbard. On February19, 1910, Sebree officially retired and was replaced as head of the Pacific Fleet by Rear Admiral Giles B. Harber.|$|E

2500|$|A {{collection}} of various criticisms {{can be found}} in the book Hundert Autoren gegen Einstein (A Hundred Authors Against Einstein), published in 1931. It contains very short texts from 28 authors, and excerpts from the publications of another 19 authors. The rest consists of a list that also includes people who only for some time were opposed to relativity. Besides philosophic objections (mostly based on Kantianism), also some alleged elementary failures of the theory were included; however, as some commented, <b>those</b> <b>failures</b> were due to the authors' misunderstanding of relativity. For example, Hans Reichenbach described the book as an [...] "accumulation of naive errors", and as [...] "unintentionally funny". Albert von Brunn interpreted the book as a backward step to the 16th and 17th century, and Einstein said, in response to the book, that if he were wrong, then one author would have been enough.|$|E

Lydgate's nature demanded this combination: he was an emotional creature, with a flesh-and-blood sense of fellowship which withstood all the abstractions of special study.

50|$|Of <b>those</b> <b>failures,</b> 15-20% {{are likely}} to be ectopic pregnancies. 84% of <b>those</b> <b>failures</b> {{occurred}} a year or more after sterilization. According to one study, approximately 5% of women who have had tubal ligation will have a failure due to ectopic pregnancy. Time seems to be a factor as the risk of failure increases after 1 or more years post-surgery. The risk of ectopic pregnancy is 12.5% for women who have had tubal ligation, which is a greater risk than for those who have not had the surgery. Recanalization or formation of tuboperitoneal fistulas occur, the openings of which are large enough for passage of sperm but too small to allow an ovum to push through, resulting in fertilization/implantation in the distal tubal segment.|$|E

In the process of an FMEA, analysts compile lists of component failure modes and try to infer the effects of <b>those</b> <b>failure</b> modes on the system. System models, typically simple engineering diagrams, assist analysts in understanding how the local effects of component failures propagate through complex architectures and ultimately cause hazardous effects at system level.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{interconnect}} reliability {{has a long}} history. The technology has advanced by miniaturization, integrating more and more transistors on a single chip. By necessity the interconnect structure has complex architectures, diverse materials and small features.

Therefore, electromigration, thermomigration and thermomechanical failures are serious reliability concerns for integrated circuits.

Second, it is optimized for <b>those</b> <b>failure</b> scenarios that are more likely to occur than others. In particular, it uses a very simple and fast algorithm to recover from single failures. Furthermore, the group communication service is not interrupted, if a failure suspicion turns out to be a false alarm. Third, this protocol incurs minimal processing load during failure-free periods.
