5|$|By {{an act of}} Congress on October 1, 1942, during Olds' Second Class year, {{the academy}} began a three-year {{curriculum}} {{for the duration of}} <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>for</b> cadets entering after July 1939. Cadets applying to the Air Corps were classified as Air Cadets, with a modified curriculum that provided flying training but eliminated Military Topography and Graphics required for Ground Cadets. Olds' class was given an abridged second class course of study until January 19, 1943, when it began an abridged first class course.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>for</b> many Italians {{the name}} of Kesselring, whose {{signature}} appeared on posters and printed orders announcing draconian measures adopted by the German occupation, had become synonymous with the oppression and terror that had characterised the German occupation.

5|$|Gliding did {{not return}} to the Olympics after <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>for</b> two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.|$|E

Shoup blamed the American education system for {{what he saw as}} discouraging independent thought and stressing obedience.|$|E

5|$|Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and {{underwent}} further refitting from 1939 to 1943.

5|$|Reenlisted {{prisoners of}} war formed a large section of the {{approximately}} 30,800 former Austria-Hungarian citizens who were registered as active on the Romanian side by late 1917. By the time it stopped recruiting (January 1918), the Corps had enlisted some 8,500 to 10,000 men. However, the Kornilov order came too late in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>for</b> there {{to have been a}} more significant Transylvanian-Bukovinan contribution to the Romanian effort.|$|E

5|$|The German and the Soviet armies used horses {{until the}} end of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>for</b> {{transportation}} of troops and supplies. The German Army, strapped for motorised transport because its factories were needed to produce tanks and aircraft, used around 2.75 million horses—more than it had used in World War I. One German infantry division in Normandy in 1944 had 5,000 horses. The Soviets used 3.5 million horses.|$|E
5|$|The Khazars {{themselves}} first campaigned in the Caucasus {{during the}} Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628, {{as a subject}} of the Western Turkic Khaganate. The Turks sacked Derbent and joined the Byzantines in their siege of Tiflis. Their contribution proved decisive for the eventual Byzantine victory in <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> <b>For</b> a few years afterwards, until ca. 632, the Khazars exercised some control over Caucasian Iberia (approximately modern Georgia), Caucasian Albania (modern Republic of Azerbaijan) and Adharbayjan (modern Iranian Azerbaijan).|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a turning point in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>for</b> North Korean forces, which had seen {{previous}} victories owing to superior numbers and equipment, with the distances and demands exacted on them at P'ohang-dong rendering their supply lines untenable.|$|E

5|$|The {{efficiency}} of major industries improved markedly during <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> <b>For</b> example, the Singer Clydebank sewing machine factory received over 5000 government contracts, and made 303 million artillery shells, shell components, fuzes, and airplane parts, {{as well as}} grenades, rifle parts, and 361,000 horseshoes. Its labour force of 14,000 was about 70 percent female at war's end.|$|E

However, it became pinned down until the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross {{the next day and}} capture the village. Private James Crichton, a member of the trapped platoon, earned the VC, the last of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>for</b> the New Zealand Division, for his efforts in relaying messages between his companions and his company commander. He also defused demolition charges on the bridge spanning the Scheldt River.|$|E
