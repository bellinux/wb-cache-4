500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] {{is a song}} by American band Selena Gomez & the Scene, {{from their}} third studio album When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>Down</b> (2011). The song was {{originally}} written by Britney Spears; after she started working on her sixth studio album Circus (2008), Spears contacted Nicole Morier to write songs with her. Together, they wrote [...] "Mmm Papi", [...] "Rock Me In" [...] and [...] "Whiplash". The latter, which was produced by co-writer Greg Kurstin, {{failed to make the}} album. In 2011, Selena Gomez recorded the song with her band for When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>Down.</b>|$|E
500|$|On April 11, 2011, it was {{reported}} by MTV News that [...] "Whiplash" [...] would be recorded by Selena Gomez & the Scene for their third studio album When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>Down.</b> Lead singer Selena Gomez is a Spears fan, and after Kurstin played her the track for the first time, she [...] "fell in love with it", unaware of Spears's contribution to the song. Gomez explained, [...] "I came and sang and saw that she had co-written it, so I was very excited. [...] It was an honor and I'm completely stoked." [...] The song leaked online in early June 2011, several weeks prior to the album's release.|$|E

500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] is a dance {{song with}} {{influences}} of electro, relying {{heavily on the}} usage of synthesizers. The pre-chorus has a sing-rap section in which Gomez delivers the lyrics in a thick British accent. [...] "Whiplash" [...] is musically different and much more aggressive {{than the rest of}} the album, and its lyrics speak of a blossoming romance; it has been compared to the work of Spears. [...] "Whiplash" [...] received mixed to positive reviews. While some critics called it one of the standout tracks of When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>Down,</b> others dismissed its rap sections and lyrics. Selena Gomez & the Scene performed the song at shows while on the We Own the Night Tour (2011).|$|E
500|$|Some People Change was {{the title}} of Montgomery Gentry's fifth album, which was {{released}} in 2006 under the production of Rutherford and Wright. Its title track, co-written by Neil Thrasher, Jason Sellers, and Michael Dulaney, was previously recorded by Kenny Chesney on his 2004 album When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>Down.</b> Gentry told the Edmonton Sun that Some People Change [...] "is based more on family issues, {{the love of the}} family, the love of neighbors, relationships", and said that the title track [...] "is about being able to challenge your inner demons and the things that can bring people down, alcoholism, or hatred or racism." [...] Montgomery Gentry's version of the song peaked at number 7, followed by the two-week number 1 hit [...] "Lucky Man" [...] and the number 3 [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". In 2008, [...] "Lucky Man" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, the duo's first Grammy nomination.|$|E
500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] is a dance {{song with}} {{influences}} of electro. It features a heavy usage of synthesizers, which {{were compared to}} those in Christina Aguilera's [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] (2010). During the pre-chorus, there is a sing-rap section in which Gomez delivers several phrases in a thick British accent, before the pulsating chorus begins. [...] "Whiplash" [...] has a much more aggressive vibe than the typical teen pop sound. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, it is written in the key of D minor. The song runs through a shuffle beat and maintains a tempo of 138 beat per minute. Gomez's vocal range spans from the high-tone of A3 to the lower register of B4. It is also musically different and a departure from other songs in When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>Down</b> which are more straightforward pop, such as [...] "Who Says" [...] and [...] "Bang Bang Bang".|$|E

500|$|In 1895, Krøyer {{wrote to}} his friend Oscar Björck: [...] "I am also {{thinking}} of painting a large portrait of {{my wife and me}} together — but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year." [...] In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created the large painting Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife. The result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Rap the dog. The painting again presents the blue half-light. Krøyer particularly appreciated [...] "l'heure bleue": [...] "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> <b>down,</b> when the moon rises up out of the sea ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Get Back" [...] was {{directed}} by Philip Andelman and shot in one day. The video premiered on Disney Channel on August 22, 2008, following the premiere of [...] It was later made available for digital download on iTunes Store on September 16, 2008. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Manhattan Bridge, Lovato and her band are then seen on a small stage on top of a building. Lovato sports black clothing, a beaded scarf and red gloves. Throughout the first verse and chorus, Lovato dances around on stage with Manhattan Bridge visible in the background. Following the first chorus, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> and an aerial shot of the city's nightlife is shown. The second verse and chorus are performed during night. During the song's bridge, a daytime shot is shown of Lovato while sitting alone on the rooftop and looking away from the camera. After this, she is back on stage and performing the last chorus during nighttime with bright lights in the background. The video ends with the performance being finished, with Lovato turning around and walking towards her band.|$|E
500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Tim Sendra of Allmusic selected {{it as one}} of the 'track picks' of When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> <b>Down,</b> calling it a [...] "stomping jam" [...] and one of the surprises of the album. He stated that the song [...] "adds some welcome weirdness to an otherwise straightforward record." [...] In a positive review, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post suggested that [...] "Whiplash" [...] was better than at least five songs from Spears's seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011), saying [...] "what I can't figure out is {{why in the world would}} [...] give up this hot track". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "the top-shelf collaborators don't hurt — see: the grinding 'Whiplash,' co-penned by one Britney Spears." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush gave the song four stars out of five, explaining that it [...] "possesses a hook that will send people running for the dance floor", although [...] "Gomez's vocal is pretty flat [...] but then again, this isn't the kind of song to show off any sort of vocal gymnastics." ...|$|E

Mark arrives at the lake and sees Leonard from the balcony and tells him that he forgot to sign his retirement forms. Leonard explains how {{to come to the}} secret entrance to Mark, which the demons hear. Later, Mark meets Leonard and Lionel at the entrance, where he signs his forms and is ready to retire. Moments later, when initiation ceremony begins at Mount Magic, the demons invade the compound and a battle between wizards and demons commences, while Lionel runs away to be with Callie, who, being the camp's [...] "sexy counselor", has sex with him before Mark interrupts. Grimes arrives with his army of bears and soon thereafter, Doug arrives in a hole that he dug; the hole collapses the floor and all the demons and bears are consumed by it. As the battle ends, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> and it is too late for Lionel to be circumcised and take over as the Wizard of Social Services, so Leonard continues to work and begins to raise a new egg.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{obligation}} {{that was}} incumbent upon an Israelite or Jew was {{to separate from}} his harvested grain (wheat, barley, spelt, etc.), wine (including unpressed grapes) and oil (including unpressed olives) the one-fiftieth portion of these products (or one-fortieth, {{if he were a}} man of generosity; and one-sixtieth if he were stingy) and to give the same to a man of Aaron's lineage (priestly stock), who, in turn, would eat such fruits in a state of ritual cleanness, in accordance with a biblical command, [...] "...and let him not eat of the holy things, until he bathes his flesh in water. And when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> <b>down</b> down, he will be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things because it is his food" [...] (...) [...] This obligation was contingent upon the fact that such fruits grew in the Land of Israel. Later, the Rabbis made it an obligation {{to do the same for}} all fruits and vegetables grown in the Land of Israel, and not only to such fruits as grain, grapes and olives. With the destruction of the Temple and the cessation of ritual purity, the obligation to separate the Terumah continued unabated, although it was no longer given to a priest of Aaron's lineage, since bodily defilement was now pervasive. The general practice after the Temple's destruction was to separate the Terumah from all fruits and vegetables by removing even the slightest portion thereof, and to immediately discard it by burial or some other means of disposal (since it can no longer be eaten in the current state of ritual uncleanness, and those doing so would make themselves liable to extirpation).|$|E
