40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. An {{understanding}} of the behaviour of chromium in mattes equilibrated with chrome-saturated slags {{is essential for the}} prediction and control of chromium deportment in these melts. The main ore reserves of South Africa’s platinum group metals (PGM) are associated with the Merensky and UG 2 reefs of the Bushveld Complex. The gradual depletion of the pyroxenitic Merensky reef over the years has necessitated the PGM industry to exploit the underlying chromiterich UG 2 reef. The problem with UG 2 reef is that it contains significant amounts of chromium, this being typically 5 % (reported as Cr 2 O 3) against < 1 % for the Merensky reef (in concentrates). Chromium has a number of deleterious effects on base-metal smelting processes. Under given conditions, it forms chromite spinels, which can accumulate and, over a period of time, form undesirable build-ups resulting in reduced furnace operational volume. The chromite spinels also tend to increase slag viscosity, thereby impacting negatively on the slag/matte separation, which leads to matte entrainment in slag. Moreover, high viscosities lead to problems with <b>tapping</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> <b>melts.</b> Finally {{it can be said that}} chromium that deports to the matte during smelting will normally tend to precipitate as spinels during subsequent converting, and lead to the formation of very stable and unwanted slag foams in the converter. In literature, there exists very little published work on the behaviour of chromium in sulphur-saturated systems such as matte-smelting furnaces. The few publications that exist in this area do not cover the effect of controlling all the pertinent variables simultaneously on the behaviour of chromium in mattes in equilibrium with chromium-containing slags. Hence the main focus of the oxygen fugacities on the mineralogical and deportment behaviour of chromium in a matte-slag system. All the three variables (temperature, oxygen fugacity (pO 2), and sulphur fugacity (pS 2)) were investigated at three levels. Temperatures studied were 1300 °C, 1400 °C, and 1500 °C. Oxygen and sulphur fugacities were established by controlling the mix-ratios of purified carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and argon. Oxygen fugacities were maintained at 10 - 10 atm, 10 - 8 atm, and 10 - 6 atm; whereas sulphur fugacities were maintained at 10 - 6 atm, 10 - 4 atm, and 10 - 2 atm. In order to investigate the effect of each of these three variables (temperature, pS 2, and pO 2) at different levels of the other variables, a completely randomised 33 full factorial experimental design was adopted. The study revealed that chromium is generally present in matte as both dissolved CrS and as precipitated oxidic and sulphidic chromium spinel phases. It was shown that as the conditions become more oxidising (pO 2 = 10 - 6 atm), CrS (which is soluble in matte) becomes a predominant phase, and as the conditions become more reducing (pO 2 = 10 - 10 atm), the sulphospinel, daubreelite (FeCr 2 S 4), becomes a more predominant phase. Oxidic chromium spinels were found to be present in matte under the more oxidising conditions (pO 2 of 10 - 6 atm) of this investigation. The presence of the above-mentioned phases was confirmed using X-ray diffraction. Subject to the experimental conditions employed in this research, chromium was found to partition the least to matte under the conditions of; low temperature, high pO 2, and low pS 2. Conversely, chromium was found to partition the most to matte under the conditions of; high temperature, low pO 2, and high pS 2...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Each of described methods has undoubted advantages but also has a number of disadvantages. In foundry engineering practice the most essential parameters of this process are to obtain as high as possible degree of carbon assimilation from carburizer, in as short as possible time, with high process repeatability. Findings: Decrease of share or elimination the whole amount of the pig iron from charge materials causes reduction cost of gray or ductile cast irons melt. Now the very important issue is working out the effective and, repeatable in industrial conditions, carburization method.

The description of processes, which are taking place during the glass melting, is for the high temperature very difficult. Therefore we can use either physical modelling or mathematical modelling. For mathematical modelling was the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code Fluent and Fluent/UNS used. The thesis is divided in three parts. In the first part, the combustion space <b>of</b> glass <b>melting</b> <b>furnace</b> was modelled, where the temperature distribution influence on fuel input was predicted. The influence was studied {{on the model of}} the FLOAT Nashville furnace. The modelled variants are proposed to simulate the temperature maximum shifting, extension of temperature maximum range, boosting using fuel input changing to the ports. The modelling results were compared with measured data (TC 21) and with the results from other modelling laboratory (TNO). The results show very good agreement with measured data. The second part deals with melting tank modelling. This model was used to simulate the melting conditions during <b>melting</b> life <b>of</b> the <b>furnace,</b> where the corrosion has a very important influence on the cooling rate and on the throat-temperature. Using results from the modelling, it is possible to describe the relationship between the throat-temperature, size of the furnace and cooling rate (heat transfer through side walls). The last part deals with VELLO forehearth modelling where the relationships between pull rate, overflow rate, overflow location and refractories heat loss were studied.

The individual components <b>of</b> a glass <b>melting</b> <b>furnace</b> have been designed, coordinated, optimized and developed further for this R and D project in order to develop one <b>of</b> the largest <b>melting</b> <b>furnaces</b> for container glass and to install a trend-setting prototypical full scale unit for the first time which now represents the third generation of a well-known and proven glass <b>melting</b> <b>furnace</b> type. Since glass <b>melting</b> <b>furnaces</b> are a very complex system, many of their parameters cannot be simply applied from one scale to the next so that certain specific tasks had to be redefined, resimulated, retraced and resolved by means of physical model tests and corresponding mathematical computer calculations in order to achieve the aim of this R and D project and to reduce the economic risks with the implementation of the development results. The primary environmental technology involved in the standard LoNOx"c"i"r"c"l"e"d"R Melter does not require any external add-on systems and so the furnace compaign can be extended and savings are achieved in both material and labour costs which will finally result in a lower final unit cost of glass produced.
