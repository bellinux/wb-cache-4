50|$|Carranza {{felt that}} it had been a mistake to include {{promises}} of social reform in <b>the</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> San Luis Potosí because this had created unrealistic expectations in the populace, and had resulted in them growing disillusioned with the Revolution after it failed to deliver on its promises. He then drafted a different constitution, <b>the</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> Guadalupe. This new proposed constitution only promised to restore the 1857 Constitution of Mexico without the promised social reforms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> San Luis Potosí. A few weeks after Carranza had issued <b>the</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> Guadalupe, he met a delegation from Sonora headed by Adolfo de la Huerta in Monclova, and the Sonorans agreed to support <b>the</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> Guadalupe.

5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the Hampstead Railway in only seven years, its opening {{was not the}} financial success that had been expected.

The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be greatly over-optimistic, as did the improvement in passenger numbers expected on the newly electrified MDR – in each case achieving only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E
