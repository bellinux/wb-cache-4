25|$|Edward {{asserted}} that the king of Scotland owed him feudal allegiance, which embittered Anglo-Scottish relations {{for the rest of}} his reign. Edward intended to create a dual monarchy by marrying his son Edward to Margaret, Maid of Norway, who was the sole heir of Alexander III of Scotland. When Margaret died there was no obvious heir to the Scottish throne. Edward was invited by the Scottish magnates to resolve the dispute. Edward obtained recognition from the competitors for the Scottish throne that he had the 'sovereign lordship of Scotland and the right to determine our several pretensions'. He decided the case in favour of John Balliol, who duly swore loyalty to him and became king. Edward insisted that Scotland was not independent and that as sovereign lord he had the right <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>in</b> England appeals against Balliol's judgements, undermining Balliol's authority. At the urging of his chief councillors, John entered into an alliance with France in 1295. In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing and exiling Balliol.|$|E

25|$|Hearing {{begins in}} utero, but the central {{auditory}} system continues to develop {{for at least}} the first decade. There is considerable interest in the idea that disruption to hearing during a sensitive period may have long-term consequences for auditory development. One study showed thalamocortical connectivity in vitro was associated with a time sensitive developmental window and required a specific cell adhesion molecule (lcam5) for proper brain plasticity to occur. This points to connectivity between the thalamus and cortex shortly after being able <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> (<b>in</b> vitro) as at least one critical period for auditory processing. Another study showed that rats reared in a single tone environment during critical periods of development had permanently impaired auditory processing. ‘Bad’ auditory experiences, such as temporary deafness by cochlear removal in rats leads to neuron shrinkage. In a study looking at attention in APD patients, children with one ear blocked developed a strong right-ear advantage but were not able to modulate that advantage during directed-attention tasks.|$|E
25|$|A {{second round}} of secret {{diplomacy}} by Anderson in February 1956 was equally unsuccessful. Nasser sometimes suggested during his talks with Anderson that {{he was interested in}} peace with Israel if only the Americans would supply him with unlimited quantities of military and economic aid. In case of Israeli acceptance to the return of the Palestinian refugees to Israel and to Egypt annexing the southern half of Israel, Egypt would not accept a peace settlement. The United States or the United Nations would have to present the Israeli acceptance to all Arabs as a basis for peace settlements. It is not clear if Nasser was sincerely interested in peace, or just merely saying what the Americans wanted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>in</b> the hope of obtaining American funding for the Aswan high dam and American weapons. The truth will likely never be known as Nasser was an intensely secretive man, who managed to hide his true opinions on most issues from both contemporaries and historians. However, the British historian P. J. Vatikitos noted that Nasser's determination to promote Egypt as the world's foremost anti-Zionist state as a way of reinforcing his claim to Arab leadership meant that peace was unlikely.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{happy to}} be home, Hay quickly grew restive, and he was glad <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> <b>in</b> early June 1867, {{that he had been}} {{appointed}} secretary of legation to act as chargé d'affaires at Vienna. [...] He sailed for Europe the same month, and while in England visited the House of Commons, where he was greatly impressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Benjamin Disraeli. The Vienna post was only temporary, until Johnson could appoint a chargé d'affaires and have him confirmed by the Senate, and the workload was light, allowing Hay, who was fluent in German, to spend much of his time traveling. It was not until July 1868 that Henry Watts became Hay's replacement. [...] Hay resigned, spent the remainder of the summer in Europe, then went home to Warsaw.|$|E

[...] John Mendelsohn gave the album a favorable review in Rolling Stone, writing that it [...] "represents at least a modest oasis in the desert of dreary blue-jeaned aloofness served up in concert by most American rock-and-rollers." [...] However, referring to [...] "Black Juju" [...] {{he also said that}} [...] "the one bummer on this album is so loud a bummer that it may threaten to neutralize the ingratiating effect" [...] of the other tracks. [...] Robert Christgau rated it B−, stating that he [...] "never would have figured this theatre type to come up with it" [...] and calling [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] "as archetypal a hard rock single as you're liable <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>in</b> this flaccid year, or maybe ever".|$|E

Tim Lee from musicOMH called it [...] "an absolutely stomping pop song" [...] and [...] "possibly the best mass market pop song since Girls Aloud's heyday", complimenting its brass production and call and response. According to Lee, the track is [...] "all shot through with such sassiness that you nearly forget it sounds {{an awful lot like}} 'Ain't No Other Man' by Christina Aguilera." [...] Joe Rivers of No Ripcord gave the song a rating of nine out of ten, regarding it as [...] "vivacious, fun, brash and confident", and noting its [...] "absolute belter of a chorus".

500|$|Following the events, {{as well as}} {{the release}} of Carey's {{succeeding}} album, Charmbracelet (2002), she began working on new material for The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Aside from the dance-influenced tracks and the ballads, Carey created a concept, in which a song's lyrics would reach out to God. She created the song's choral lyrics, melody and main instrumentation, before calling James [...] "Big Jim" [...] Wright for a collaboration. During their meeting, Wright helped Carey arrange the song's chord structure, as well as produce the introduction, while Carey finished the rest of the lyrics. Once completing [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Carey had her pastor, Clarence Keaton, read two verses from the Bible on the song, [...] "Weeping may endure for the night, but joy comes in the morning" [...] during the introduction, and [...] "He said 'He'll never forsake you, or leave you alone' Trust him". According to Carey, the song, {{as well as the}} Biblical verses, were included on her [...] "comeback album" [...] because they helped her get through many difficult situations in the past. She described moments that were difficult growing up, during which she reached out to God, as well as during her breakdown, when she used such verses to give her faith. Carey explained how although the verses helped her greatly, no one had ever said them to her. For this reason, she wanted {{to make sure they were}} there for fans and listeners <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> <b>in</b> order to give them faith and assurance lest they be in a grave situation.|$|E

[...] He was {{appreciative of the}} support, especially from the Asian-American community, but he preferred to concentrate on his play without all the attention when he had not [...] "proven anything to anybody". Smart saw that Lin was skilled at getting to the paint, but needed to learn to pass because, he said, Lin [...] "couldn't shoot the ball at all". The coach also noticed that Lin always arrived early for practice and left late. Lin studied and rehearsed Steve Nash's and other top point guards' pick-and-roll plays. Frank Hughes of Sports Illustrated wrote that Lin spoke with the occasional [...] "seeds of self-doubt", which he said was uncommon <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>in</b> the NBA. Hughes also found it rare when Lin compared himself to the Phoenix Suns' then-backup point guard Goran Dragić. [...] "Neither of us is a freak athlete, but we're both effective {{and know how to}} play the game," [...] Lin said. Lin and Stephen Curry, the 2009–10 runner-up Rookie of the Year, received more interview requests than any other Warrior. Team officials regularly denied requests for Lin to help him keep his focus. He was approached to be the subject of documentaries. Smart planned to take pressure off Lin since Lin had a tendency to be hard on himself and get frustrated, but the coach admitted that he once succumbed to the home crowd's wishes and put Lin into a game in the wrong situation.|$|E
500|$|Peter Lavezzoli, {{author of}} The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, has written of Harrison's first solo single: [...] "'My Sweet Lord' was {{everything}} that people wanted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>in</b> November 1970: shimmering harmonies, lustrous acoustic guitars, a solid Ringo Starr backbeat, and an exquisite [...] guitar solo." [...] Reviewing the single for Rolling Stone, Jon Landau called the track [...] "sensational". In {{an era when}} songs by Radha Krishna Temple and adaptations of the Christian hymns [...] "Oh Happy Day" [...] and [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] were all worldwide hits, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone observed that the substituting of Harrison's [...] "Hare Krishna" [...] refrain for the trivial [...] "Doo-lang, doo-lang, doo-lang"s of [...] "He's So Fine" [...] was [...] "a sign of the times". John Lennon told a reporter, [...] "Every time I put the radio on, it's 'Oh my Lord' – I'm beginning to think {{there must be a}} God." [...] In his December 1970 album review for NME, Alan Smith bemoaned the apparent lack of a UK single release for [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and noted that the song [...] "seems to owe something" [...] to [...] "He's So Fine". To Gerson, it was an [...] "obvious re-write" [...] of the Chiffons hit, and within two months US music publisher Bright Tunes had served a writ on Harrison citing unauthorised copyright infringement. In a January 1971 review for NME, Derek Johnson expressed surprise at Apple's delay in releasing the single in the UK, before declaring: [...] "In my opinion, this record – finally and irrevocably – establishes George as a talent equivalent to either Lennon or McCartney." ...|$|E
500|$|He wrote [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] {{after the}} death of his uncle. The two were not on {{speaking}} terms after his uncle forced him out of his home before Cudi could find another living situation. A [...] bitter Cudi never apologized to him before his death, which he now regrets. Other songs on the album expand upon themes discussed in that single. Back in 2007, Drake, who was one of Cudi's first supporters, had shown interest in doing an official remix of [...] the song with him. However, Cudi chose against it since he was not interested in working with people who are in the [...] "same creative realm" [...] as him and because he was in the midst of creating his own works. Beginning in the fourth grade, and getting more tense after his father's death when he was 11, Cudi began dreaming of his own death (which usually was an automobile accident). He channeled these things into his material. Speaking to BlackBook in May 2009, Cudi said of the album and its content, [...] "Each song is a message. All the hooks are stadium-worthy, crowd sing-along, powerful joints that I can't wait for people <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>in</b> stadium magnitude. My album definitely needs to be heard loudly, but it's also a great album if you're smoking and you need to go to sleep. So far I have the lineup of how I want the first seven tracks on my album and if I play the first seven from the beginning to the end, I'm zoned out and it's the best trip ever. You need to be high to appreciate the instrumentation and how everything is put together on the album—but you don't have to be high just to enjoy it in general." ...|$|E
