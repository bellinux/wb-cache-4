6000|$|The {{work being}} now {{about ten feet}} in height, {{admitted}} of a rope-ladder being distended[16] between the beacon and the building. By this [...] "Jacob's Ladder," [...] as the seamen termed it, a communication was kept up with the beacon while the rock was considerably under water. One end of it being furnished with tackle-blocks, was fixed to the beams of the beacon, {{at the level of}} the mortar gallery, while the further end was connected with the upper course of the building by means of two Lewis bats which were lifted from course to course as the work advanced. In the same manner a rope furnished with a <b>travelling</b> <b>pulley</b> was distended for the purpose of transporting the mortar-buckets, and other light articles between the beacon and the building, which also proved a great conveniency to the work. At this period the rope-ladder and tackle for the mortar had a descent from the beacon to the building; by and by they were on a level, and towards the end of the season, when the solid part had attained its full height, the ascent was from the mortar gallery to the building.|$|E
40|$|DE 3213983 A UPAB: 19930925 The pallet {{carrying}} carriages for a warehousing or {{stacking system}} has a frame housing a motor and transmission elements for its driving wheels, and a load supporting platform {{which can be}} raised and lowered. Interconnected with the transmission elements is a chain which <b>travels</b> around four <b>pulleys</b> rotating about vertical axes and around two pulleys mounted on front and rear spindles. The rear spindle is the axle for the rear wheels and the upper four pulleys are mounted on the platform. This enables the platform to move for a short distance {{in the opposite direction}} to the direction of travel, so that the platform is lifted. The platform has supports carrying rollers which travel along sloping surfaces on the base frame are the lifting action results from the movement of the rollers along these surfaces. The carriage has smaller wheels behind the main wheels, so that jolts are reduced where gaps in the track occur...|$|R
2500|$|Tilt {{and rotate}} {{movements}} are {{transferred to the}} ball carrier (the mechanism that supports the type element), which moves across the page, by two taut metal tapes, one for tilt and one for rotate. The tilt and rotate tapes are both anchored {{to the right side}} of the carrier. [...] They both wrap around separate pulleys at {{the right side of the}} frame; the tilt pulley is fixed, while the rotate pulley is attached to the shift arm, actuated by the Shift and Caps Lock keys. [...] The tapes extend across the machine behind the carrier, and then wrap around two separate pulleys at the left side of the frame. [...] The tilt tape is then anchored to a small, quarter-circle pulley which, through a link, tips the tilt ring (the device to which the type element is connected) to one of four possible locations. [...] The rotate tape is wrapped around a spring-loaded pulley located in the middle of the carrier. [...] The rotate pulley under the tilt ring is connected through a universal joint (called a [...] "dog bone", which it resembles) to the center of the tilt ring. [...] The type element is spring-latched onto that central post. [...] The type element rotates counter-clockwise when the rotate tape is tightened. [...] The spiral [...] "clock" [...] spring underneath the rotate pulley rotates the element in the clockwise direction. [...] As the carrier moves across the page (such as when it returns), the tapes <b>travel</b> over their <b>pulleys,</b> but the spring-loaded pulleys on the ball carrier do not pivot or rotate.|$|R
