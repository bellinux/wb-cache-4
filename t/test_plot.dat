5000|$|The grain yield monitor is an {{excellent}} tool that provides producers an effective evaluation tool on a field and farm basis. The accuracy of the yield monitor is approximately 1-3% when properly calibrated, but is on an averaging basis for this accuracy. [...] On a pass to pass basis the accuracy decreases significantly {{with a range of}} accuracy of 0-10% error in most studies. [...] The average of multiple loads remains within the projected 1-3%, but individual loads have a much higher variability. These errors are present from issues listed in the [...] "Impact Based Mass Flow Measurement" [...] section of this page. The effects of individual load variability limits its ability to be used for smaller scale comparison such as <b>test</b> <b>plot</b> comparisons. Test plots are usually single planted strips of a single crop hybrid at approximately the width of the combine harvester head. Harvesting a <b>test</b> <b>plot</b> results in single harvested load and yield estimation for the single hybrid. Comparing one hybrid to another based on single loads can be difficult as the load is essentially a sub sample of a larger mean.|$|E

50|$|Boron {{concentration}} in soil water solution higher than one ppm is toxic to most plants. Toxic concentrations within plants are 10 to 50 ppm for small grains and 200 ppm in boron-tolerant {{crops such as}} sugar beets, rutabaga, cucumbers, and conifers. Toxic soil conditions are generally limited to arid regions or {{can be caused by}} underground borax deposits in contact with water or volcanic gases dissolved in percolating water. Application rates should be limited to a few pounds per acre in a <b>test</b> <b>plot</b> to determine if boron is needed generally. Otherwise, testing for boron levels in plant material is required to determine remedies. Excess boron can be removed by irrigation and assisted by application of elemental sulfur to lower the pH and increase boron solubility.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Live {{barriers}} are promoted {{as an effective}} soil conservation strategy for tropical steeplands but farmer adoption rates are poor. Research in Honduras evaluated the performance of live barriers of Vetiveria zizanioides (vetiver grass) on steep slopes typical of those cultivated by small-holder farmers across Central America. Maize yields were measured for three years on 24 <b>test</b> <b>plots</b> (each 24 m 5 m) through both harvests (primera and postrera) of a normal annual cycle. Local farmers were engaged to cultivate the <b>test</b> <b>plots</b> using traditional methods, sowing local maize varieties along the contour and using {{the same number of}} crop rows on each <b>plot.</b> Twelve <b>test</b> <b>plots</b> were planted with vetiver barriers at 6 -m spacing. Results show no significant differences between per-row maize yields on control plots and those with live barriers. The one exception was the postrera harvest of 1997, during unusually dry conditions caused by El Niño, when maize yields in the rows immediately above the barrier were significantly greater those on the control plot. Vetiver barriers accumulated soil on their up-slope side, which helped store soil water. In drought conditions, this permitted an increase in productivity that was not evident at other times. To be attractive to farmers, soil conservation works must produce obvious benefits regularly. These may be limited when technologies, such as live barrier, are used alone...|$|R

5000|$|Fall rye {{crops are}} {{susceptible}} to the crop disease ergot, ergot causes the growth of purplish-black bodies, replacing some of the grains {{on the head of}} the crop. Ergot is harmful to both humans and animals, and if found in grain, should be removed by immersing infested rye grain in a water-salt solution. To prevent the incidence of ergot, fall rye should be put in a 2-3 year rotation. The allelopathic effects of fall rye may affect or inhibit the growth of other grass-like crops including corn, to determine whether this may be an issue, a farmer should grow a small <b>test</b> <b>plot</b> to determine inhibition due to the rye. Many other crops such as soybean, tobacco, and potatoes can still be grown in rotation with rye without the allelopathic effects ...|$|E
40|$|Four {{field test}} plots were {{constructed}} in 1997 on a sloped waste rock surface at the Myra Falls Operations of Boliden Westmin (Canada) Limited to evaluate hydraulic performance of alternate cover system designs. The field <b>test</b> <b>plot</b> cover systems {{were designed to}} control oxygen ingress and water infiltration to the underlying waste rock while providing a medium for a grass and legume vegetation cover. The test plots consisted of a bare waste rock surface (control plot), and three additional plots consisting of native compacted till placed directly on the waste rock surface, overlain by non-compacted till. Two of the test plots included a compacted till layer ameliorated with flyash and bentonite, respectively, to improve moisture retention and reduce permeability. The third <b>test</b> <b>plot</b> consisted of a compacted layer of native till overlain by non-compacted till. A performance monitoring system was installed in each <b>test</b> <b>plot</b> to evaluate net percolation and oxygen ingress to the underlying waste rock.

Established approaches to estimating canopy water status the Crop Water Stress Index, the Water Deficit Index and the Equivalent Water Thickness involve measurements in the thermal or reflective infrared.
