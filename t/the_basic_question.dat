25|$|The {{discovery}} of human antiquity {{was a major}} achievement of science {{in the middle of}} the 19th century, and the foundation of scientific paleoanthropology. The antiquity of man, human antiquity, or in simpler language the age of the human race, are names given to the series of scientific debates it involved, which with modifications continue in the 21st century. These debates have clarified and given scientific evidence, from a number of disciplines, towards solving <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>question</b> of dating the first human being.|$|E
25|$|Syntactic {{dependencies}} are {{the focus}} of most work in dependency grammar, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many dependency grammars can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. <b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>question</b> about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of dependency grammars is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of constituency grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic constituency tests being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis constituency tests. Etymological considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution. When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.|$|E

[...] If this is true, then there must be quantum mechanisms underlying classical chaos (although this may not be a fruitful way of examining classical chaos).

2500|$|Chief Justice Earl Warren {{strongly}} {{criticized the}} majority's narrow {{reliance on the}} question of whether a prohibition on [...] "words" [...] uttered against the flag is constitutional or not. [...] In deciding the case on such a narrow ground, the majority [...] "declined to meet and resolve <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>question</b> presented in the case.". This is not to say that he dissents from [...] "the general rule that this Court should not treat broad constitutional questions when narrow ones will suffice to dispose of the litigation," [...] but rather, neither the prosecution nor the defense based their arguments {{on the question of}} whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional to prohibit the utterance of [...] "words" [...] against the flag. [...] Instead, both sides argued vigorously regarding the Constitution allows states to prohibit the burning of the flag. [...] Furthermore, Chief Justice Warren's reading of the trial transcript was that the burning was the central issue of the case, the defense theory of the case being that the defendant [...] "burned the flag in a dignified manner," [...] (emphasis added); thus, in his opinion, the narrow focus on the [...] "words" [...] uttered by the defendant and prohibited by the state law was simply not in accord with the facts of the case. [...] However, Warren was of the opinion that laws against flag-burning are constitutional, and that therefore the defendant's conviction should have been affirmed.|$|E
2500|$|However, Lucretius, {{describing}} atomism in his De rerum natura, gives {{very clear}} and compelling empirical arguments for the original atomist theory. He observes that any material is subject to irreversible decay. Through time, even hard rocks are slowly worn down by drops of water. Things have the tendency to get mixed up: Mix water with soil and mud will result, seldom disintegrating by itself. Wood decays. However, there are mechanisms in nature and technology to recreate [...] "pure" [...] materials like water, air, and metals. The seed of an oak will grow out into an oak tree, made of similar wood as historical oak trees, the wood of which has already decayed. The conclusion is that many properties of materials must derive from something inside, that will itself never decay, something that stores for eternity the same inherent, indivisible properties. <b>The</b> <b>basic</b> <b>question</b> is: Why has {{everything in the world}} not yet decayed, and how can exactly some of the same materials, plants, and animals be recreated again and again? One obvious solution to explain how indivisible properties can be conveyed in a way not easily visible to human senses, is to hypothesize the existence of [...] "atoms". These classical [...] "atoms" [...] are nearer to humans' modern concept of [...] "molecule" [...] than to the atoms of modern science. The other central point of classical atomism is that there must be considerable open space between these [...] "atoms": the void. Lucretius gives reasonable arguments that the void is absolutely necessary to explain how gasses and liquids can flow and change shape, while metals can be molded without their basic material properties changing.|$|E
