Many buildings in al-Ubulla were made of teakwood and were constructed close together; as a result, the fire soon {{spread throughout}} the city, destroying much of it. Many residents were killed; others attempted to flee into the waterways and drowned. The Zanj then began to plunder al-Ubulla and collected large number of spoils, but by that point most of the city's goods had been destroyed by the flames.|$|E
25|$|The Bavarians {{soon came}} under the {{dominion}} of the Franks, probably without a serious struggle. The Franks regarded this border area as a buffer zone against peoples to the east, such as the Avars and the Slavs, and {{as a source of}} manpower for the army. Sometime around 550 AD <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> under the administration of a duke - possibly Frankish or possibly chosen from amongst the local leading families - who was supposed to act as a regional governor for the Frankish king.

They took that 'Jenny from the Block' side of me, which is still {{very much a part of}} who I am and will always be, and <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> right there on that track". According to Scott Shetler of PopCrush, [...] "Run the World" [...] contains an optimistic message and upbeat melody.

500|$|Four of {{the songs}} on Almost There ("Call to Worship", [...] "Cannot Say Enough", [...] "I Can Only Imagine", and [...] "In You") had {{previously}} appeared on the band's independent records. All of the other songs on the album were new songs which had not been recorded before. All {{of the songs}} of the album were written by Millard or the band except [...] "I Worship You", which was written by Kipley and Reggie Hamm. The band included the song after Kipley brought it to them; although the band wanted to write their own material, they liked the song so much that <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> as the first song on the album. [...] "Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)" [...] was written {{at the request of}} the label, who wanted to capitalize off of the success of the popular Bruce Wilkinson book The Prayer of Jabez. The band did not want to record the song, but eventually acquiesced. MercyMe pushed the label to include [...] "House of God", an upbeat rock song, since they felt that they had been pushed a little too far towards the adult contemporary genre.|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Your Love" [...] {{appeared}} on Minaj's unofficial mixtape Barbie World (2010), with different lyrics included in the pre-chorus along with a faster pace. Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak and I was so upset <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. Next thing you know, people started {{falling in love with}} it." [...] Whilst on set on the music video for [...] "Your Love", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, [...] "I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But then I heard it one day, somebody told me it was online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything — I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it." ...|$|E

She told VH1, [...] "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button.

The [...] "GHV2 Megamix"s accompanying music video, directed by Dago Gonzalez of Veneno Inc., was compiled of images of Madonna's live performances and previous music videos and premiered on November 2, 2001, through Total Request Live (TRL) and MTV's website. Chuck Taylor from Billboard complimented the remix, saying that [...] "its quite a trip down 80s memory lane from an artist whose continually evolving body of work stands strong—even when summarized in this novel context." ...|$|E
500|$|Marrara Oval {{became the}} 89th Test venueand the eighth in Australia. On {{a slow and}} low drop-in pitch airlifted from Melbourne {{a month before the}} match, Australia won the toss and elected to field. Bangladesh {{collapsed}} and were bowled out for 97 within three hours, with only Mohammad Ashraful (23) and Khaled Mahmud (21) providing resistance. [...] All four Australian bowlers chimed in, as Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee took three wickets apiece. McGrath and Jason Gillespie surpassed the duo of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall as Australia's most successful opening-bowling combination. Bangladesh's shot selection did not impress coach Dav Whatmore who said, [...] "A few players presented their wickets and that's just the area we're trying to improve." [...] Australia initially struggled {{to come to terms with}} the pitch, falling to 2/43 when Ricky Ponting was dismissed for 10. Darren Lehmann started the carnage, scoring his second Test century (110). Steve Waugh then became only the second player after Gary Kirsten to score a century against all Test playing nations. Upon reaching the milestone, he promptly declared Australia's innings on 7/407. Only Bangladesh's fastest bowler, Mashrafe Mortaza proved threatening, taking three wickets for 74 runs (3/74) in 23 overs. After the days play, Lehmann said, [...] "It was hard work out there. They stuck to their guns pretty well, <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the right areas and made it tough to score runs."

500|$|Hamels {{is known}} {{throughout}} baseball for possessing {{one of the}} better changeups in the game. In 2012, Fangraphs ranked Hamels as having the fourth best changeup in the game trailing only Jason Vargas, Tommy Milone, and Félix Hernández. The Hardball Times called his changeup a [...] "killer" [...] pitch to right-handed hitters, noting that while it is also effective against left-handed hitters, when <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in play, they generally have success. Rangers pitching coach Mike Maddux said of Hamels, [...] The development of Hamels' changeup is attributed by his high school pitching coach, Mark Furtak, to the fact that in high school he broke his arm. He could no longer work on his curveball for several months, and was forced to focus on the changeup. Chipper Jones, who was a star-third baseman for the rival Atlanta Braves commented that Hamels is the [...] "best lefthander in the National League ... you have to respect his fastball, and his change-up is devastating. If you're guessing fastball and you get change-up, you're way out in front of it. His change-up is a soft sinker that just falls down." [...] Aside from the changeup, he throws a four-seam fastball in the low 90s (can reach [...] ), a cutter , and an [...] "inconsistent" [...] curveball that sometimes loops and other times is sharp, and hovers in the mid-70s (around [...] ). Prior to the conception and advent of his cutter, he briefly threw a two-seam fastball around 2008 and 2009, before debuting his cutter in 2010. Once he attained a [...] "feel" [...] for how to effectively utilize his cutter, it helped him increase his groundball rate (percentage of balls in play that were groundballs), including to over 50-percent in 2011.|$|E

2500|$|When {{initially}} discovered, Dendrogrammas {{relationships were}} unclear.

As <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> however, [...] "we refrain from erecting such a high-level taxon for the time being, because new material is needed to resolve many pertinent outstanding questions."

[...] At least three genera of Ediacarans—Albumares, Anfesta, and Rugoconites—share similarities with Dendrogramma; all three appear to have possessed a disc with an internal network of forking channels. This possibility generated considerable excitement: Simon Conway Morris of the University of Cambridge stated that the discovery is [...] "a very interesting surprise, and it poses {{lots and lots of}} questions." [...] He noted the [...] "most intriguing similarity to certain Ediacaran forms," [...] but cautioned that [...] "the similarities are exactly that. They are intriguing rather than compelling."
