5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> it stayed dry.|$|E

When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that the vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket.

Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
