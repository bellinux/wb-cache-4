When they investigate <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> and the area, Mulder concludes that the encounter was a constructed hoax, intended to convince the duo to cease further pursuit. With help from MUFON and NICAP, Mulder tracks Druce and the E.B.E. to a power plant in Mattawa, Washington.

50|$|Since {{fresh food}} was {{prepared}} on <b>the</b> <b>trucks,</b> they required power for refrigeration, and therefore either idled or ran gasoline generators. In the early 1990s, {{in an effort}} to reduce the noise, pollution and visual blight along College Avenue, as <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> obstructed <b>the</b> view of Voorhees Mall, <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> were prohibited from parking along the thoroughfare, and Rutgers provided a corner of a faculty parking lot (#8) across the street. The vendors were put under contract with the university, which provided <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> with space and electricity. Some trucks were open during the day, and others in the evening, with a couple of hours of overlap around dinner time. <b>The</b> <b>trucks</b> would rotate positions within the lot monthly, so that no one vendor would receive a competitive advantage based on location.|$|R
5|$|The duo {{tries to}} make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them, and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, {{thinking}} Woody eliminated RC as well, attack and toss him off <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody, and continue after <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake, and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> before they soar into the air.

5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or hyperthermia. <b>The</b> <b>truck</b> carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran out of fuel. When <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E

In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children {{want to go back to}} save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E

He awakes to discover that <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E

30|$|Hauling {{is another}} mining {{activity}} {{needed to be}} optimized for mining cost minimization. The production rate and cost of hauling are substantially influenced by {{the magnitude of the}} payloads of <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> (Dickerson et al. 1986) which highly depends on a fill factor decided by the particle size of the blasted material. Lower fragmentation size results in higher fill factor and higher production rate for <b>the</b> <b>trucks.</b> However, when weight capacity of <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> is reached, production rate remains constant even if fragmentation size decreases. In this case, unnecessary fragmentation causes an increase in unit cost of drilling and blasting. If the bulk density of the loaded material is small, the lowering the fragmentation size can be considered to increase <b>the</b> <b>truckâ€™s</b> production. Otherwise, <b>the</b> weight limit of <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> does not allow to increase production even though the fragmentation size decreases.|$|R

5|$|Local {{officials}} in Allegan have proposed {{creation of a}} truck route around the town. Concerned about the traffic and noise, residents have formed the Citizens for a Safer Community.
