500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E

His struggles continued throughout {{the first half of the}} season, as he posted the worst ERA among starters in the AL (6.92) along with a 7–9 record. Quoted in the Los Angeles Times in July, Kazmir said [...] "It kind of feels like I'm thinking too much about where I'm throwing the ball and things start snowballing, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you don't really know what's going on." ...|$|E

[...] Murfreesboro's mayor, Ernest Burgess, called Robertson's claims [...] "so ridiculous they do not deserve a response." [...] Opposition was also fanned by a local newspaper, the ultra-conservative Rutherford Reader, which published numerous anti-Islamic articles. After protests from readers over these, some of its advertisers boycotted the newspaper. As the barrage of criticism from right-wingers continued, the ICM received a series of threatening and offensive anonymous telephone messages.|$|E
2500|$|Owen said he grew {{up around}} [...] "a mob of entertaining, troublesome, fascinating" [...] actors {{involved}} in challenging the Lord Chamberlain during {{some of the most}} exciting days of a very controversial Royal Court Theatre. When he was at Highgate School, because his father was an actor, his teachers thought that {{he should be able to}} act, too. However, at first he was not interested. [...] "I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then I was made to take part in a school play and I didn't want to do that either but I started to get approval for my acting. I was reasonably academic, good at sport, but somehow with the acting, people said 'that was fantastic'.

I'm an NRA National Rifle Association member, a life member as a matter of fact. I'm more for the belief of making the punishment tougher for the criminals to start with. I think that sends much more of an incentive for people to not commit crimes of any type than taking away guns.

But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Perry and McKee {{first met}} in 2004, {{they both were}} [...] "really into Lolita" [...] and [...] "had a mutual fascination with the {{adolescent}} state of mind." [...] They explored the themes in their first records: Perry wrote One of the Boys, which touched on {{the early stages of}} discovering that boys could be more than friends, whereas McKee wrote [...] "Confessions of a Teenage Girl", which was about using sexual power to one's advantage. For the Teenage Dream sessions, Perry and McKee had a [...] "forever young" [...] idea in mind. Perry at first wrote a lyric about Peter Pan, but they later deemed it as [...] "too young" [...] since [...] "we wanted it to have more edge, more sex." [...] Another version included the lines [...] "And <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> / You're a mom in a minivan", which made them laugh uncontrollably for an hour. There was a final version that was based around the metaphor of [...] "" [...] comparing clothes to sex, in a similar manner to Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Dress You Up". It was rejected by the producers, as McKee explained, [...] "Luke always makes us 'Benny Proof' everything. He says that if Benny doesn't get it, America won't get it." [...] Blanco showed them The Teenagers's 2007 single [...] "Homecoming" [...] and asked them to write in a similar style.

60|$|Archie {{was not a}} man who readily {{allowed himself}} to become worried, {{especially}} about people who were not in his own immediate circle of friends, but {{in the course of the}} next week he was bound to admit that he was not altogether easy in his mind about his father-in-law's mental condition. He had read all sorts of things in the Sunday papers and elsewhere about the constant strain to which captains of industry are subjected, a strain which sooner or later is only too apt to make the victim go all blooey, and it seemed to him that Mr. Brewster was beginning to find the going a trifle too tough for his stamina.

2500|$|Navarro's joining and Kiedis's {{continued}} {{drug addiction}} {{had a profound}} effect on the band and the subsequent sound of their next album, One Hot Minute (1995). With Frusciante no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been something Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John had been a true anomaly when it came to song writing.

That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] To compensate, Kiedis and bassist Flea took several vacations together, during which entire songs were conceived and with Kiedis often absent from recording due to his drug problems or struggling to come up with lyrics, Flea took a much bigger role in the writing process; coming up with ideas for many songs including full lyrics and even singing lead on his own song, [...] "Pea".|$|R
