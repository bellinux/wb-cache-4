40|$|Abstract. Stratospheric heating, condensation, {{convective}} {{transport of}} non-equilibrium species, and deep radiative energy transport are important processes in <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of <b>the</b> solar jovian planets. They likely affect <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs as well. Stratospheric temperatures control thermal fluxes in strong molecular bands, and may dramatically affect observed spectra. Condensation processes affect {{the appearance of}} an object, alter the abundances of atmospheric species, and influence the fluxes of both reflected and emitted radiation. Convection can dredge up non-thermochemical equilibrium species from <b>the</b> deep <b>atmosphere</b> to <b>the</b> observable <b>atmosphere.</b> Finally deep radiative zones can limit the effectiveness of deep convection and alter the boundary condition at which the planet radiates energy to space. Here I discuss the role these processes may play in <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets. 1...|$|R
