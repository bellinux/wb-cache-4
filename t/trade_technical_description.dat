40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} investigates the {{perception}} of <b>technical</b> <b>descriptions</b> and of stories where the events are driven by the motivations and emotions of their characters. The study is explorative, using mixed qualitative and quantitative methods and {{with a total of}} 10 participants. The participants accepted the use of stories and strongly preferred stories with emotional and dramatic elements. The study indicates that human-centered stories encourage and facilitate detailed discussions of social aspects and situations of use, whereas <b>technical</b> <b>descriptions</b> may block such discussions. The study indicate that stories are not a reliable mean of changing the attitudes of the readers, and it shows that stories are not better than <b>technical</b> <b>descriptions</b> for communicating factual or technical information...|$|R
