5|$|In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, {{a veteran}} of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle. In 1932 he found <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> of Royal Savages hull, which he {{successfully}} raised in 1934. Stored for more than fifty years, <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> were sold by his son to the National Civil War Museum. As of March 2009, <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> were in a city garage in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The city of Plattsburgh, New York, has claimed ownership of <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> and would like them returned to upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} were made to locate <b>the</b> <b>remains</b> of Yagan's body, which were believed to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of Belhus. A remote sensing survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful. Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite <b>the</b> <b>remains.</b>|$|E
