40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{linearization}} technique for stereophonic reproduction systems with nonlinearity {{by using the}} MINT and Volterra filters. In the proposed technique, the linearization is achieved by incorporat-ing Volterra filters into the MINT, which can realize exact linear inverse filtering. The linearization perfor-mance of the proposed technique is consequently very high. The proposed technique can simultaneously lin-earize <b>two</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> systems in the stereophonic re-production systems, also. On the other hand, the con-ventional linearization technique for monaural reproduc-tion systems cannot realize exact linear inverse filtering. The linearization performance consequently deteriorates remarkably. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique has about 20 dB higher performance than the conventional one. The proposed technique also has smaller computational complexity than the conven-tional one. ...|$|R

40|$|In virtual {{acoustic}} imaging systems, {{the perception of}} a sound source anywhere in space can theoretically be reproduced for one listener by using only <b>two</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> and an appropriate set of filters, called crosstalk cancellation (CTC) filters. However, the ideal position of the loudspeakers in such systems is still a question that is currently addressed by many researchers. Several analytical models {{with varying degrees of}} complexity have been used to analyze this matter. The fact is that, so far, all implemented CTC systems were built for a single listener use. When it comes to two listener CTC systems, the conditioning of the matrix of transfer functions between the loudspeakers and the listener&# 039;s ear seems to be more irregular than the conditioning of the matrix for a one listener CTC system. Using a simplified model made it possible to verify that the position of the sound sources also plays a major role as far as the two listeners system&# 039;s performance is concerned. Now, the influence of the presence of the listener&# 039;s head in this model is evaluated. The free-field model of a two listener CTC system is expanded by modelling the listeners&# 039; heads as two rigid spheres.

50|$|Ambiophonics is {{a method}} {{in the public domain}} that employs digital signal {{processing}} (DSP) and <b>two</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> {{directly in front of the}} listener in order to improve reproduction of stereophonic and 5.1 surround sound for music, movies, and games in home theaters, gaming PCs, workstations, or studio monitoring applications.

Ambiophonics eliminates crosstalk inherent in the conventional ‚Äústereo triangle‚Äù speaker placement, and thereby generates a speaker-binaural soundfield that emulates headphone-binaural, and creates for the listener improved perception of ‚Äúreality‚Äù of recorded auditory scenes. A second speaker pair can be added in back in order to enable 360¬∞ surround sound reproduction. Additional surround speakers may be used for hall ambience, including height, if desired.|$|E

40|$|A multi-driver {{loudspeaker}} system is discussed. Methods of dividing the input frequency spectrum between loudspeaker drivers are presented. It is proposed that an optimal crossover {{is one in}} which the acoustic recombination of the signal in the listening area is a perfect replica of the input signal. Loudspeaker pressure response is discussed when <b>two</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> drivers are separated by a finite distance on a common acoustic baffle. The pressure response of the {{loudspeaker system}} is shown to depend not only on the crossover transfer functions but also the loudspeaker transfer functions. It is shown that by using two non-coincident drivers to reproduce the audio spectrum, an angle-off-axis dependent time delay is introduced. Constant voltage filters and their relation to real driver frequency responses are discussed. Cascaded Butterworth and Butterworth filters are related to real driver parameters with the cascaded Butterworth shown to cause the two drivers to interact over the smallest bandwidth. Three loudspeakers were designed demonstrating that the loudspeaker transfer function could be designed into the overall crossover transfer function by careful driver selection and enclosure tuning. Low distortion driver/enclosures were demonstrated of this type. Three separate active crossovers were constructed to enable the tests of the three loudspeaker systems. A crossover was designed using standard Butterworth two pole sections that could be switched to a number of different combinations for all three proposed systems. Overall system response tests were performed that verified theory with respect to a symmetrical radiation in the vertical plane. Off axis response abberations at high frequencies were shown to exist due to the angle-off-axis time delay...|$|R
