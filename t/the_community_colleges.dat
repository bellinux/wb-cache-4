25|$|Three {{community}} colleges {{had been established}} by early 1961, when the city's public colleges were codified by {{the state as a}} single university with a chancellor at the helm and an infusion of state funds. But the city's slowness in creating <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> as demand for college seats was intensifying, had resulted in mounting frustration, particularly on the part of minorities, that college opportunities were not available to them.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, {{during the}} same period, the Golden State also {{attracted}} commercial and industrial expansion at astronomical rates. The adoption of a Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 allowed {{the development of a}} highly efficient system of public higher education in <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> and the University of California and California State University systems; by creating an educated workforce, it attracted investment, particularly in areas related to high technology. By 1980, California became recognized as the world's eighth-largest economy. Millions of workers were needed to fuel the expansion. The high population of the time caused tremendous problems with urban sprawl, traffic, pollution, and, to a lesser extent, crime.|$|E
500|$|While {{supported}} by the state's smaller, regional universities, HouseBill1 immediately drew the ire of University of Kentucky president Charles T. Wethington, Jr. Before becoming university president, Wethington had administered the community-college system. Most of <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> and the constituencies in their communities also opposed the plan. The university and <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> ran advertisements encouraging opposition to the plan; Patton characterized these ads as [...] "mean". Patton was disappointed when Greg Stumbo, {{a leader in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives and former advocate of an independent community-college system, announced his opposition the plan. Stumbo represented the community of Prestonsburg, an eastern Kentucky coal mining town, and Patton surmised that he was still angry about the worker's compensation bill. Prestonsburg was also the home of Prestonsburg Community College (now Big Sandy Community and Technical College). In the face of this opposition, Patton negotiated with individual legislators until he was convinced that he had a majority in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. He then pushed forward and was able to get the legislation passed.|$|E
500|$|In the 1997 legislature, Patton {{began his}} mission of {{reforming}} the state's system of higher education. Noting that the state's community colleges, {{under the control}} of the University of Kentucky, and technical schools, {{under the control of}} the state government, were too often competing with each other in the same community, he proposed removing <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> from the university's control. Part of the plan was upgrading the technical schools to colleges, allowing them to award associate's degrees, not just diplomas and certificates. Control of the community and technical colleges would be invested in a new entity, the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Patton believed that severing <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> from the University of Kentucky would allow the university to reallocate resources toward becoming a [...] "Top 20" [...] research university in the nation. The plan also charged the University of Louisville with becoming a nationally recognized urban university. The state's Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) would help eliminate duplication of programs among the colleges and oversee the improvements in the state's two major universities. In addition, the CPE was to oversee the formation of a [...] "Commonwealth Virtual University" [...] that would serve as a clearinghouse for all the distance learning opportunities offered by the colleges and universities of Kentucky. The new CPE president, , appointed former University of Kentucky engineering faculty and then Databeam Corp. co-founder Lee T. Todd to chair the new [...] which created the [...] (now the Kentucky Virtual Campus) and the , and worked with the Kentucky Department of Education to create the Kentucky Vitual High School (now the [...] ). [...] Patton's plan was outlined in the Kentucky Postsecondary Education Improvement Act of 1997, nicknamed HouseBill1.|$|E
