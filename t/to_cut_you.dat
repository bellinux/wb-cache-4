500|$|... "One of These Days" [...] was {{developed}} around an ostinato bassline created by Roger Waters, by feeding the output through a Binson Echorec. [...] The bass line {{was performed by}} Waters and Gilmour using two bass guitars, one on old strings. [...] Drummer Nick Mason's abstruse [...] "One of these days I'm going <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> into little pieces" [...] line was recorded at double speed using a falsetto voice, and replayed at normal speed.|$|E
500|$|Eisenberg fondly {{recalled}} {{working on}} [...] "Initiations" [...] {{both because of}} his familiarity {{with much of the}} crew who had previously worked on Deep Space Nine, as well as the opportunity to [...] "goof around" [...] with Robert Beltran (Chakotay) on set. [...] He would later say to Cinefantastique that he [...] "had a blast" [...] working on the episode, especially the opportunity to play someone [...] "really trying to kill someone." [...] Beltran would later compare the fun they had on set as akin to working with Don Rickles and that Eisenberg was [...] "very quick-witted and not afraid <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> down." ...|$|E
500|$|Snyder's {{first cut}} of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself [...] "the gatekeeper" [...] of the comic's easter eggs, [...] "while [...] conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost {{perspective}} on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've got <b>to</b> <b>cut.</b> <b>You</b> don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about? Of course you do. Are you crazy? How will people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me." [...] Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized {{there was a way}} to further trim the film: removing the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which [...] "was easy without destroying the movie".|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{looks as}} if he was going <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> at <b>you</b> with that sword," [...] said the Professor. [...] "Come away and see the Temple of Horrors." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{are taking}} Monsieur Douaille ashore," [...] Richard explained, {{as the two}} men shook hands. [...] "He really doesn't belong to that gang and he wants <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> adrift. <b>You</b> {{understand}} my orders exactly, captain?" [...] he asked, as they stepped down the iron gangway.|$|R
500|$|... {{and later}} saying the song [...] "has classic {{written all over}} it". Kerrang! magazine's Paul Rees {{described}} [...] "Vow" [...] as [...] "edgy dislocated pop with a sparkling chorus" [...] and [...] "the most brilliant pop song of 1995". Select's Ian Harrison liked the song, but felt that it [...] "pilfers from The Smiths 'How Soon Is Now?'". In a review for Billboard, Larry Flick rated [...] "Vow" [...] his Critic's Choice and wrote, [...] "Move over Courtney Love. Garbage combine the tough-headed hooks of Hole with an unforgettable vocal prowl which rivals 'Miss World'. A numbed female vocal cries before a raging guitar riff begins to shatter a pain-filled pop texture. Commit to it." [...] Dan Dinello, of Alternative Press, described [...] "Vow" [...] as [...] "menacing tale of violence and revenge sounds like Patti Smith fronting The Clash while quoting the Beatles [...] "No Reply"." [...] Spins Charles Aaron likened the band to [...] "Bunnymen wannabes doing '90s reverb angst" [...] and compared Erikson's guitar to Aldo Nova, but ultimately considered that [...] "even though they sound totally prefab, the singer hints at a pleasantly pissed personality". Jude Rogers of The Guardian described the song as a [...] "Kerrang-friendly rout of skronky rawk guitars, with Ms Manson offering a gentle hello: [...] "I came <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> UP/I came knock you DOWN/I came around to TEAR your little WORLD a-PART!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Quoth JANE, [...] "Well, {{as you put}} the case, I'm true enough, no doubt, But then, you see, in {{this here}} place There's none <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> out.|$|E
6000|$|... "How are you, Jack? What {{on earth}} {{have you been}} doing to yourself? You look a {{complete}} guy in these clothes. I was half tempted <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> downright." ...|$|E
25|$|If {{they do not}} adopt {{anything}} very extravagant {{either with}} respect <b>to</b> colour or <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> allow them <b>to</b> follow their own taste {{with respect to the}} choice of their clothes ?—Yes.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Hardy {{raised a}} hand {{to show that he}} heard, and as he approached, Charley shouted again, 'Sweep well round the fence, well round it, for them <b>to</b> try and <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> off.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose it}} does mean anything. But she's always talking about Lupex being jealous; {{and if he was}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> up rough, <b>you</b> wouldn't find it pleasant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is one," [...] she replied, [...] "who would come, and, coming, dare <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> {{down upon}} your own throne, {{if he thought}} that you had offered affront to Thuvia of Ptarth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am yet {{young enough}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> into ribbons, you dog, if I were minded to dishonour myself by meeting you." [...] And turning to Ombreval for sympathy, he vented a low laugh of contemptuous wonder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They are the signal. I {{should have}} told you all this in the village, but I dared not be seen {{speaking}} with you. I galloped through the woods <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> off, and concealed both my horse and myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you really}} mean {{to kill the}} old men?" [...] said Lord Alfred Percy to me one day; [...] "regularly <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> their throats, <b>you</b> know, and carry them out and burn them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! Still. That it is a {{great work}} <b>to</b> have <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> away from father's life, and to have made a new and good beginning. So there am I, Charley, left alone with father, keeping him as {{straight}} as I can, watching for more influence than I have, and hoping that through some fortunate chance, or when he is ill, or when--I don't know what--I may turn him to wish to do better things.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Smoke's heart warmed. [...] "Look here, Carson. The {{thing for}} you to do is <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the rope. <b>You</b> can never get me up, and there's no use both of us being lost. You can make it out with your knife." ...|$|R
60|$|MARGARET. And now {{he wants}} me <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> dead {{to keep him in}} countenance. Well, I shant: not if my whole family were there. But I'll cut him dead if he doesnt treat you properly. [To Bobby, with a {{threatening}} move in his direction] I'll educate you, you young beast.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, you {{are very}} important,' said the Eldest Magician. 'Shall I ask the Man here <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> with kris? Shall I send for Raja Moyang Kaban, the King of the Elephants, to pierce you with his tusks, or shall I call Raja Abdullah, the King of the Crocodiles, to bite you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} strangely importunate. If it should appear, after all, {{that what you}} have to say does not concern me--and I don't know how it can, and don't expect that it will--you will allow me <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> short with but little ceremony. Say {{what you have to}} say, if you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Dampierre," [...] he said, [...] "you are {{not going}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> me, are <b>you?</b> There has been no quarrel between us, {{and the last time}} we met was when we were lying next {{to each other in the}} ambulance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> choose <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> up rough <b>you</b> can do so. I would {{propose that}} we should fix upon some sum which shall be yours at his death,--just {{as though he had}} left it to you. Indeed, he shall fix the sum himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw you in {{the court}} room, when the honourable judge sought after our guilt," [...] he began. [...] "Very good. And do you {{remember}} that Ah Chow, whose head is <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> off--do <b>you</b> remember that he--Ah Chow--was a tall man? Look at me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, let's {{have the}} rest, old man," [...] shouted Sammy, contritely, [...] "I didn't mean <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> off. I'm {{not much of}} a poetry expert, you know. I never saw a poem that didn't look like it ought to have {{terminal}} facilities {{at the end of every}} verse. Reel off the rest of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, look here," [...] said Dick, [...] "this {{thing has}} got to be settled. You say I'm trying <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> out. I like that!

6000|$|... "I {{have run}} {{all the way}} in order <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> off, Dr. Watson," [...] said she. [...] "I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid mistake I made in {{thinking}} that you were Sir Henry. Please forget the words I said, which have no application whatever to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Merrick," [...] he resumed, in a harsh voice; [...] "I {{warn you}} that if your company holds up the payment of my {{royalties}} it will break the contract, and I will forbid them <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> another tree. <b>You</b> are doubtless aware {{that there are a}} dozen firms willing to take your place and pay me higher royalties." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{of course}} he will get some of it. That's to be expected--she's his grandchild--of course I know that," [...] and Mrs. Wilkinson again nodded her head. [...] "But, George, you must look very close after the old gentleman. It won't at all do <b>to</b> let Harcourt <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> out altogether. I do hope you mean {{to be a good}} deal down at Hadley. It won't last for long, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Huh! As if you didn’t know why!” replied Roger, with {{something}} like a chuckle. “Don’t they both know that Jessie is the very apple of your eye, and that anything that brings trouble <b>to</b> her will <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the heart? Of course they know that, Dave, and you can rest assured that {{they will try to}} hurt you quite as much through Jessie as they’ll try to hurt you direct.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm her own cousin," [...] {{retorted}} Frank. [...] "I reckon I can {{say what}} I please about her. I don't want that dude Easterner <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> out. She guided him over here, and gave him her slicker to keep him dry, and I can see she's terribly taken with him. She's headstrong as a mule, once she gets started, and if she takes a notion to Norcross it's all up with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Having, therefore, {{considered}} {{all these}} things, and fully reflected upon them, as I see I {{have not been}} able to engage you by any motives to do as you ought, I have come to the conclusion to lay before you, in writing, this my last determination, resolving, however, to wait still a little longer before I come to a final execution of my purpose, in order to give you one more trial to see whether you will amend or no. If you do not, I am fully resolved <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> off from the succession.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} {{will not be}} able to sit down to it--nothing would stay on the table a minute. There will be no regular breakfast today. You must get the steward <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> a chunk of cold meat, put it between two slices of bread, and make a sandwich of it. As to tea, ask him to give you a bottle and to pour your tea into that; then, if you wedge yourself into a corner, you will find that you are able to manage your breakfast comfortably, and can amuse yourself watching people trying to balance a cup of tea in their hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut the {{business}} off short," [...] suggested his brother-in-law. [...] "You've <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> it somewhere, <b>you</b> know, or you'll never get away; and, as it's my business, I hereby authorize you to neglect it from this moment {{until the day}} of our return. When we get back {{you can pick up}} the details again and worry over it as much as you please." ...|$|R
5000|$|Executive {{producer}} D. B. Weiss said of Rigg's {{final scene}} as Olenna, [...] "What I love {{about the way}} she plays the scene is that even though you leave the scene knowing she’s soon going to be dead shortly after <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> black <b>you</b> still feel like she won. She’s probably the only character to win her own death scene." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you won't. Set {{down and}} {{stay where you}} are. I ain't going to hurt you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your secret, and trust me. I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll help you. So'll my old man if you want him to. You see, you're a runaway 'prentice, that's all. It ain't anything. There ain't no harm in it. You've been treated bad, and you made up your mind <b>to</b> <b>cut.</b> Bless <b>you,</b> child, I wouldn't tell on you. Tell me all about it now, that's a good boy." ...|$|R
