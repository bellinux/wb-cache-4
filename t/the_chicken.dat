5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse <b>the</b> <b>chicken.</b> <b>The</b> <b>chicken</b> pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E

5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E

5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of <b>the</b> <b>Chicken</b> Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. president Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it's too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite <b>the</b> <b>Chicken</b> Whopper's initial success, just over a year after <b>the</b> <b>Chicken</b> Whopper's introduction enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name. As of November 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Chicken</b> Whopper is the current grilled chicken sandwich sold by Burger King in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, BK {{introduced}} its BK Baguette line of sandwiches designed to replace <b>the</b> <b>Chicken</b> Whopper. The sandwiches were introduced at {{the insistence of}} the new CEO, former Darden Restaurants executive Bradley (Brad) Blum, shortly after the company was acquired by TPG Capital in 2002. The sandwiches were designed to be a lower fat alternative with 5g of fat and 350 or fewer calories. The line was a health conscious oriented product that got its taste from ingredients instead of fat. They were formally introduced in 2004 as its BK Baguette line of sandwiches, that replacing <b>the</b> <b>Chicken</b> Whopper sandwiches.|$|E

50|$|During {{shipping}} {{from the}} CAFO farm to <b>the</b> abattoir, <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> are usually placed inside shipping crates that usually have slatted floors. Those crates are then piled 5 to 10 rows {{high on the}} transport truck to the abattoir. During shipment, <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> tend to defecate, and that chicken manure tends to sit inside the crowded cages, contaminating the feathers and skin of <b>the</b> <b>chickens,</b> or rains down upon <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> and crates on {{the lower levels of}} the transport truck. By the time the truck gets to <b>the</b> abattoir, most <b>chickens</b> have had their skin and feathers contaminated with feces.|$|R
25|$|In 1879, his assistant, Charles Chamberland (of French origin), {{had been}} {{instructed}} to inoculate <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> after Pasteur went on holiday. Chamberland failed {{to do this and}} went on holiday himself. On his return, the month-old cultures made <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> unwell, but instead of the infections being fatal, as they usually were, <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> recovered completely. Chamberland assumed an error had been made, and wanted to discard the apparently faulty culture, but Pasteur stopped him. He inoculated <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> with virulent bacteria that killed other chickens, and they survived. Pasteur concluded that the animals were now immune to the disease.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of an Escherichia coli (E. coli) aroA-live vaccine {{in the prevention}} of colibacillosis in chickens following intratracheal challenge with a virulent strain of E. coli O 78 was investigated. Thirty-six, one day old broiler chickens were divided into 3 groups of 12 each. Chickens in each group were randomly divided into 2 replicates. <b>The</b> <b>chickens</b> in group 1 that were not vaccinated and challenged served as a negative control. <b>The</b> <b>chickens</b> in group 2 that were not vaccinated but received E. coli serotype O 78 served as a positive control. <b>The</b> <b>chickens</b> in group 3 were vaccinated by the oral route at 5 days of age with E. coli aroA-vaccine and challenged with E. coli serotype O 78. All <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> in groups 2 and 3 were challenged intratracheally at 4 weeks of age with 0. 5 ml (1. 2 x 109 cfu/ml) per dose of E. coli O 78. <b>The</b> <b>chickens</b> were monitored for 7 days after infection for feed conversion ratio (FCR), and the post-mortem pathology was assessed. The results revealed that the vaccine tends to prevent E. coli infection. <b>The</b> <b>chickens</b> in group 3 tended to show lower pathological findings including airsacculitis, pericarditis, perihepatitis, peritonitis and arthritis than <b>the</b> <b>chickens</b> in group 2 but the FCR was not different in each group (p> 0. 05) ...|$|R
5|$|Sanders {{was unhappy}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan, {{but he refused to}} deep fry <b>the</b> <b>chicken,</b> which he {{believed}} lowered the quality of the product. If he pre-cooked <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> in advance of orders, there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables. Sanders bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to fry chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, while, in the opinion of Sanders, retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|The Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are {{a line of}} {{sandwiches}} {{developed by}} the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 {{as part of a}} new product line designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as <b>the</b> <b>chicken</b> sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.|$|E

From 1955 they also started running on the Rodeløkka Line. The TO trailers were usually run with <b>the</b> <b>Chickens,</b> although they were also hauled by the larger Høka units. The tramway experienced that <b>the</b> <b>Chickens</b> did not have sufficient pneumatic capacity to keep a tram and trailer at ease while stopped on slopes, as separate compressors in the trailers were not installed. This made operating trailers with <b>the</b> <b>Chickens</b> a safety hazard and soon they were only seen i solitude.|$|R
