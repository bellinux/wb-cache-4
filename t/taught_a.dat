40|$|Abstract Nowadays, early foreign {{language}} learning in the Netherlands is booming and generally preferred over language learning starting at a later stage due to its presumed positive effects on pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar acquisition (Groot & Deelder, 2014). In (early) second language acquisition classrooms, native speaker teachers are often preferred over non-native speaker teachers due the model of language they can present; native speakers have reached the so-called target L 2 learners try to obtain (Cook, 2008, p. 185). Furthermore, in the Netherlands, it is generally assumed that learners who are <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> native speaker will become more proficient in the target language than learners who are <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> non-native speaker, {{especially in terms of}} pronunciation (SLO, 2011). However, hardly any research has focused on whether this assumption is true. This research attempts to fill this gap by examining whether early English language learners <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> native speaker attain a more native-like pronunciation than learners <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> non-native speaker. Pupils of two Dutch primary schools were tested on their English pronunciation (segmentals), with one group following an early learning programme in which they were (partly) <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> native speaker teacher, and another group following such a programme during which they were <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> non-native speaker. Results show that learners <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> non-native speaker produce more native-like consonants than speakers <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> native speaker. In addition, learners <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> non-native speaker produce fewer Dutch-like vowels than learners <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> native speaker. However, it cannot be concluded with certainty that, therefore, the learners <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> non-native speaker also produced more native-like vowels. Yet, {{based on the results of}} this research, it can be concluded that, in terms of pronunciation, learners <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> native speaker teacher are not more native-like than learners <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> non-native speaker. It is arguable that being <b>taught</b> by <b>a</b> native speaker teacher does not lead to better pronunciation results...|$|R

Librescu, who <b>taught</b> <b>a</b> solid {{mechanics}} class in Room 204 in the Norris Hall during April 2007, held {{the door of his}} classroom shut while the gunman attempted to enter it. Although he was shot through the door, Librescu managed to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until most of his students had escaped through the windows. He was struck by five bullets, with a shot to the head proving to be fatal. Of the 23 registered students in his class, only one, Minal Panchal, died.|$|E
5|$|Hill and his {{brothers}} {{had taken over the}} management of their father's school in Birmingham in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school <b>taught</b> <b>a</b> radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage.|$|E

5|$|Impressed by Betances' credentials, Angiolillo later {{approached}} Betances {{before the}} incident, and discussed his plans with him, which originally implied killing {{one or more}} young members of the Spanish royal family. Betances then dissuaded him from doing this. Angiolillo then apparently suggested Cánovas as a target instead. There is evidence that Betances financed Angiolillo's travel to Spain, and used his contacts to have Angiolillo reach and enter Spanish territory under a false identity. Further speculation that Angiolillo used a firearm that Betances himself furnished for him appears to be unfounded (although Betances, who was a fan of firearms himself —he <b>taught</b> <b>a</b> Cuban revolutionary leader {{on how to use}} a Remington machine gun once— gave at least one as a gift to one of his acquaintances).|$|E

Isenhour and Bernstein both believed it was the first class of its type, and said the two had a very cordial relationship despite representing opposite political parties. Isenhour also taught about electoral politics at other educational institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania, Central Penn College and The Washington Center.|$|E
5|$|The hardy plants Robinson {{endorsed}} {{were not}} all natives by any means: two chapters {{are devoted to}} the hardy plants from other temperate climate zones that were appropriate to naturalising schemes. The narcissus he preferred were the small, delicate ones from the Iberian peninsula. Meadowflowers included goldenrod and asters, rampant spreaders from North America long familiar in English gardens. Nor did Robinson's 'wild' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he <b>taught</b> <b>a</b> specific gardening method and aesthetic. The nature of plants' habit of growth and their cultural preferences dictated the free design, in which human intervention was to be kept undetectable.|$|E

5|$|Ahn's co-founding of the Association for Teachers of English in Korea (ATEK), and {{subsequent}} {{development of a}} controversial public information campaign protesting government discrimination against foreign teachers resulted in dozens of foreign teachers filing formal complaints against the Korean government with the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Parties opposing Ahn's work countered with a smear campaign against him, spreading completely fabricated allegations of sex crimes in order to discredit him.

Ahn <b>taught</b> <b>a</b> graduate-level course on digital public relations at De La Salle University, speaks on the subject of digital public relations at a wide variety of industry conferences, and writes on the subject.

5|$|Al-Azhar {{nevertheless}} {{remained the}} seat of Arabic philology and a place of learning throughout this period. While official classes were discontinued, private lessons were still offered in the mosque. There are reports that a scholar, possibly al-Baghdadi, <b>taught</b> <b>a</b> number of subjects, such as law and medicine, at al-Azhar. Saladin reportedly paid him a salary of 30 dinars, which was increased to 100 dinars by Saladin's heirs. While the mosque was neglected by Saladin and his heirs, {{the policies of the}} Sunni Ayyubid dynasty would have a lasting impact on al-Azhar. Educational institutions were established by Sunni rulers as a way of combating what they regarded as the heretical teachings of Shi'a Islam. These colleges, ranging in size, focused on teaching Sunni doctrine, had an established and uniform curriculum that included courses outside of purely religious topics, such as rhetorics, math, and science. No such colleges had been established in Egypt by the time of Saladin's conquest. Saladin and the later rulers of the Ayyubid dynasty would build twenty-six colleges in Egypt, among them the Salihiyya Madrasa.|$|E

Copeland began her ballet studies at the age of 13 at the San Pedro Dance Center when Cynthia Bradley began picking her up from school. After three months of study, Copeland was en pointe.|$|E
