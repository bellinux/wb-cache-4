The advent of low Earth-orbiting, large satellites and platforms necessitates that atmosphere be included in the optimization process. A practical means of studying this topic is as a problem in minimum-fuel orbital maintenance is optimized through periodic thrusting as opposed to forcing Keplarian motion by nullifying the effects of drag with thrust. Further, this must be optimized by primary vectoring. This thesis examined the efficiency of a simple method of orbital maintenance using fixed-angle <b>transverse</b> <b>thrusting.</b> Results show that for the purpose of fuel-minimization, the width of the radial band in which the satellite is to be maintained, is dependent upon thruster size. in nearly all cases, a thrust-angle of 70 degrees maximized the fuel saved.

40|$|The {{transverse}} momentum {{distribution of}} the diffractive final state provides an interesting test of models of diffractive deep-inelastic scattering at HERA. We present a comparison of several colour-singlet exchange models with <b>thrust</b> <b>transverse</b> momentum data from a recent H 1 analysis.

We are able to fit the large transverse momentum part of the data with a two-gluon dijet model. The results of this analysis are compared with a previous study of large pseudo-rapidity gap structure function data, and we discuss ways in which one might reconcile the results of the two analyses.

40|$|The {{electric}} {{solar wind}} sail produces thrust by centrifugally spanned high voltage tethers {{interacting with the}} solar wind protons. The sail attitude can be controlled and attitude maneuvers are possible by tether voltage modulation synchronous with the sail rotation. Especially, the sail can be inclined {{with respect to the}} solar wind direction to obtain <b>transverse</b> <b>thrust</b> to change the osculating orbit angular momentum. Such an inclination has to be maintained by a continual control voltage modulation. Consequently, the tether voltage available for the thrust is less than the maximum voltage provided by the power system. Using a spherical pendulum as a model for a single rotating tether, we derive analytical estimations for the control efficiency for two separate sail control modes. One is a continuous control modulation that corresponds to strictly planar tether tip motion. The other is an on-off modulation with the tether tip moving along a closed loop on a saddle surface. The novel on-off mode is introduced here to both amplify the <b>transverse</b> <b>thrust</b> and reduce the power consumption. During the rotation cycle, the maximum voltage is applied to the tether only over two thrusting arcs when most of the <b>transverse</b> <b>thrust</b> is produced. In addition to the <b>transverse</b> <b>thrust,</b> we obtain the thrusting angle and electric power consumption for the two control modes. It is concluded that while the thrusting angle is about half of the sail inclination for the continuous modulation it approximately equals to the inclination angle for the on-off modulation. The efficiency of the on-off mode is emphasized when power consumption is considered, and the on-off mode can be used to improve the propulsive acceleration through the reduced power system mass.

40|$|Most of the {{underwater}} vehicles have control surfaces to enable manoeuvring. The problem with an underwater vehicle with control surfaces is operating it at low speed. At low speed, the control surfaces become inoperative as {{the magnitude of}} the generated lift relates to the water speed passing over the control surfaces. A novel device, which is a potential solution to this problem, is the collective and cyclic pitch propeller (CCPP). The CCPP can generate both axial and transverse thrusts in one device. The research focused on the performance of the CCPP and the performance of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP. The information about the true performance of this CCPP has not been investigated. Assessing the true performance in a straight line of the CCPP was the first objective of this research. The development of the simulation program was the second objective of this research in order to assess the motion control of an underwater vehicle by using the CCPP. The performance in a straight line of the CCPP behind an underwater vehicle was assessed by using a captive test in the Towing Tank at the Australian Maritime College. In the experiment, the propeller was set at various pitch angles, and it was tested at various advance coefficients. Polynomial equations for estimating the thrust and the torque coefficients of the propeller with the collective pitch setting were established. In addition, the effects of the collective pitch, cyclic pitch, and advance coefficient related to the magnitude and direction of the <b>transverse</b> <b>thrust</b> were studied. Increasing {{the magnitude of the}} collective pitch setting caused the direction of the <b>transverse</b> <b>thrust</b> to rotate clockwise when looked at from aft. The magnitude of the transverse thrusts increased as the collective pitch setting increased. Different types of cyclic pitch setting affected the direction of the <b>transverse</b> <b>thrust</b> differently. Increasing the magnitude of the cyclic pitch setting raised the magnitude of the <b>transverse</b> <b>thrust.</b> According to the experimental information, the direction and the magnitude of the <b>transverse</b> <b>thrust</b> was found to be difficult to control manually. Hence a motion control system of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP was developed in order to assist an operator to control the vehicle. The proportional integral derivative control law was used to develop the control system. The capability of the motion control system and the manoeuvrability of {{the underwater}} vehicle equipped with the CCPP were assessed by using a developed simulation program. In addition, the numerical simulation of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP is an essential tool to develop the CCPP in the future. The simulation program was developed by using the mathematical model of a test underwater vehicle. Furthermore, the forces of the CCPP were modelled by using the experimental results and the performance prediction program. The simulation study has shown that the underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP has flexible manoeuvrability, and controllability. The CCPP is capable of controlling an underwater vehicle in all directions. For further development, the free running test should be conducted in order to demonstrate the performance of the underwater vehicle and to verify the simulation program...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} for hadronic {{transverse}} energy $E_T$ in hadron-hadron collisions, the classic Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) {{argument for the}} cancellation of Glauber gluons breaks down {{at the level of}} two Glauber gluons exchanged between the spectators. Through an argument that relates the diagrams with these Glauber gluons to events containing additional soft scatterings, we suggest that this failure of the CSS cancellation actually corresponds to a failure of the `standard' factorisation formula with hard, soft and collinear functions to describe $E_T$ at leading power. This is because the observable receives a leading power contribution from multiple parton interaction (or spectator-spectator Glauber) processes. We also suggest that the same argument can be used to show that a whole class of observables, which we refer to as MPI sensitive observables, do not obey the standard factorisation at leading power.

Event-shape observables measured using charged particles in inclusive Z-boson events are presented, using the electron and muon decay modes of the Z bosons. The measurements are based on an integrated luminosity of 1. 1 fbâ 1 of proton-proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at theLHCat a centre-of-mass energy â s = 7 TeV. Chargedparticle distributions, excluding the lepton-antilepton pair from the Z-boson decay, are measured in different ranges of transverse momentum of the Z boson. Distributions include multiplicity, scalar sum of transverse momenta, beam thrust, <b>transverse</b> <b>thrust,</b> spherocity, and F-parameter, which are in particular sensitive to properties of the underlying event at small values of the Z-boson transverse momentum. The measured observables are compared with predictions from Pythia 8, Sherpa, and Herwig 7. Typically, all three Monte Carlo generators provide predictions that are in better agreement with the data at high Z-boson transverse momenta than at low Z-boson transverse momenta, and for the observables that are less sensitive to the number of charged particles in the event...|$|E
