30|$|Roll {{flattening}} is {{an important}} component in the roll stack elastic deformation, which has important influence on controlling of the strip crown and flatness. Foppl formula and semi-infinite body model are the most popular analytical models in the roll flattening calculation. However, the roll flattening calculated by traditional flattening models has a great deviation from actual situation, especially near the barrel edges. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of roll flattening, a new model is proposed based on the elastic half plane theory. The calculation formulas of roll flattening are deduced respectively under the assumptions of plane strain and plane stress. Then, the two assumptions are combined through the method of introducing an <b>transition</b> <b>coefficient,</b> and the distribution rules of roll flattening for different rolling force, flattening width, roll length and roll diameter are analyzed by using the FEM analysis software Marc. Regarding the ratio of the length to roll end and the roll diameter as variable to fit the <b>transition</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the new model of roll flattening is established based on the elastic half plane theory. Finally, the <b>transition</b> <b>coefficient</b> is fitted to establish the model.

Several dozen data sets were collected in a hydraulic laboratory, each including the measurement of upstream and downstream water depth for five different gate openings, and 17 different steady-state discharges from 0. 02 to 0. 166 m 3 /s. Various approaches were tested to define the limits of the non-orifice-to-orifice regime transition; one of these uses the specific-energy equation for open-channel flow. Once the transition limits were defined, an estimation of the non-orifice-to-orifice <b>transition</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Co, was made. The <b>transition</b> <b>coefficient</b> was defined as the ratio of gate opening to upstream water depth. The experimental results indicate that orifice flow always exists when Co is less than 0. 83, and non-orifice flow always exists when Co is greater than 1. 00.

40|$|Technological type control objects {{specific}} feature, which distinguish them {{among many}} mobile or electro technical types, is more low-frequency parametric disturbances spectral composition than spectral composition of coordinate disturbances. Most often parametric disturbances reveal themselves in changing control object transmission coefficient in the channel ―controller control action – control variable‖. On {{a number of}} occasions transmission coefficient can change in a wide range – in 2 … 10 times more than initial value. Coordinate disturbances change control variables but don’t change control object features. Besides spectral density of control variable change, under the impact of coordinate disturbances, has its peak in low-frequency range and characterize forced component of automatic control system motion. Parametric disturbances have influence on control variables and on control object properties, in particular on its <b>transition</b> <b>coefficient.</b> In this case, character of transient processes change, i. e. free motion component of the system. Spectral density of control variable changes, under the influence of <b>transition</b> <b>coefficient</b> change, has its peak, in general, in mid-frequency range. In the case, when using filters, even approximately, it is possible to separate out mid-frequency component from the overall process, which characterizes generally free motion of automatic control system, then it is possible to estimate current value of control object transmission coefficient using parameters change of this component. Such control variable components motions separation is used for designing selftuning ACS.

Many properties of materials can be described using integration over the Brillouin zone such as core-level and low-loss EELS and optical spectra. This integration is performed computationally using a grid of k-points. The discrete energy eigenvalues must be interpolated into a continuous spectra. The most common method broadens the eigenvalues using a Gaussian function. Gaussian broadening suffers from slow convergence with number of k-points and a difficulty in resolving fine spectral features. Solution method:. OptaDOS  improves the underlying Brillouin zone integration beyond fixed-width Gaussian broadening by using band gradients to perform adaptive and linearly extrapolated broadening.

Along with the usual band energies, band gradients are used to generate the linear extrapolation and adaptive broadening schemes producing a superior output able to represent both dispersive and localised bands concurrently.
