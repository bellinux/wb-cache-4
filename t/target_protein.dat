5|$|Proteins are {{targeted}} for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue {{that requires the}} coordinated reactions of three enzymes. In the first step, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (known as E1) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule. This is then transferred to E1's active-site cysteine residue {{in concert with the}} adenylylation of a second ubiquitin. This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the last step, a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases (E3) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this <b>target</b> <b>protein.</b> A <b>target</b> <b>protein</b> must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid. It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system. The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type, but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{activity}} occurs along a protein's active site. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to {{this site}} and blocking its activity, {{under the assumption}} that the <b>target</b> <b>protein</b> exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain allosteric sites which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very computationally costly. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} subcomponents {{are often}} referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient (denoted S). The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome, which is about 2000 kilodaltons (kDa) in molecular mass containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded; openings at the two ends of the core allow the <b>target</b> <b>protein</b> to enter. Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple ATPase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core. An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially {{the same manner as}} the 19S particle; the 11S {{may play a role in}} degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus.|$|E

25|$|Protein {{purification}} tags: Some {{expression vectors}} include proteins or peptide sequences {{that allows for}} easier purification of the expressed protein. Examples include polyhistidine-tag, glutathione-S-transferase, and maltose binding protein. Some of these tags may also allow for increased solubility of the <b>target</b> <b>protein.</b> The <b>target</b> <b>protein</b> is fused to the protein tag, but a protease cleavage site positioned in the polypeptide linker region between the protein and the tag allows the tag to be removed later.|$|E
25|$|Immunoaffinity {{chromatography}} {{uses the}} specific binding of an antibody-antigen to selectively purify the <b>target</b> <b>protein.</b> The procedure involves immobilizing a protein to a solid substrate (e.g. a porous bead or a membrane), which then selectively binds the target, while everything else flows through. The <b>target</b> <b>protein</b> can be eluted {{by changing the}} pH or the salinity. The immobilized ligand can be an antibody (such as Immunoglobulin G) {{or it can be}} a protein (such as Protein A). Because this method does not involve engineering in a tag, it can be used for proteins from natural sources.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are 22 {{nucleotides}} {{long non-coding}} RNAs and exert their function either by transcriptional or translational inhibition. Although many microRNA profiles in different tissues and disease states {{have already been}} discovered, only {{little is known about}} their <b>target</b> <b>proteins.</b> The microRNA miR- 155 is deregulated in many diseases, including cancer, where it might function as an oncoMir. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We employed a proteomics technique called "stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture" (SILAC) allowing relative quantification to reliably identify <b>target</b> <b>proteins</b> of miR- 155. Using SILAC, we identified 46 putative miR- 155 <b>target</b> <b>proteins,</b> some of which were previously reported. With luciferase reporter assays, CKAP 5 was confirmed as a new target of miR- 155. Functional annotation of miR- 155 <b>target</b> <b>proteins</b> pointed to a role in cell cycle regulation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To {{the best of our knowledge}} we have investigated for the first time miR- 155 <b>target</b> <b>proteins</b> in the HEK 293 T cell line in large scale. In addition, by comparing our results to previously identified miR- 155 <b>target</b> <b>proteins</b> in other cell lines, we provided further evidence for the cell line specificity of microRNAs...|$|R

In contrast to ubiquitin, SUMO is not used to tag proteins for degradation.

25|$|The first {{discovered}} {{function of the}} PDZ domains was to anchor receptor proteins in the membrane to cytoskeletal components. PDZ domains also have regulatory functions on different signaling pathways. Any protein may have one or several PDZ domains, which can be identical or unique (see figure to right). This variety allows these proteins to be very versatile in their interactions. Different PDZ domains in the same protein can have different roles, each binding {{a different part of}} the <b>target</b> <b>protein</b> or a different protein altogether.|$|E
25|$|Caspases ({{cysteine}}-aspartic proteases, cysteine aspartases or cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases) are {{a family}} of protease enzymes playing essential roles in programmed cell death (including apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis) and inflammation. They are named caspases due to their specific cysteine protease activity – a cysteine in its active site nucleophilically attacks and cleaves a <b>target</b> <b>protein</b> only after an aspartic acid residue. As of 2009, there are 11 or 12 confirmed caspases in humans and 10 in mice, carrying out a variety of cellular functions.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{efficient}} fluorescent proteins such as {{the green}} fluorescent protein (GFP) have been developed using the molecular biology technique of gene fusion, a process that links {{the expression of the}} fluorescent compound to that of the <b>target</b> <b>protein.</b> This combined fluorescent protein is, in general, non-toxic to the organism and rarely interferes with the function of the protein under study. Genetically modified cells or organisms directly express the fluorescently tagged proteins, which enables the study of the function of the original protein in vivo.|$|E

40|$|ISG 15, {{a protein}} {{containing}} two ubiquitin-like domains, is an interferon-stimulated gene product that functions in antiviral response and is conjugated to various cellular proteins (ISGylation) upon interferon stimulation. ISGylation occurs via a pathway {{similar to the}} pathway for ubiquitination that requires the sequential action of E 1 /E 2 /E 3 : the E 1 (UBE 1 L), E 2 (UbcH 8), and E 3 (Efp/Herc 5) enzymes for ISGylation have been hitherto identified. In this study, we identified six novel candidate <b>target</b> <b>proteins</b> for ISGylation by a proteomic approach. Four candidate <b>target</b> <b>proteins</b> were demonstrated to be ISGylated in UBE 1 L- and UbcH 8 -dependent manners, and ISGylation of the respective <b>target</b> <b>proteins</b> was stimulated by Herc 5.

25|$|If no {{fluorescence}} is detected, {{an interaction}} may still {{exist between the}} proteins of interest, as {{the creation of the}} fusion protein may alter the structure or interaction face of the <b>target</b> <b>protein</b> or the fluorescence fragments may be physically unable to associate. To ensure that this result is not a false negative, that there is no interaction, the protein interaction must be tested in a situation where fluorescence complementation and activation requires an external signal. In this case, if the external signal fails to cause fluorescence fragment association, {{it is likely that the}} proteins do not interact or there is a physical impediment to fluorescence complementation.|$|E
25|$|By {{replacing}} the gene {{with a new}} version fused to a green fluorescent protein (or similar) marker, expression may be directly quantified in live cells. This is done by imaging using a fluorescence microscope. It {{is very difficult to}} clone a GFP-fused protein into its native location in the genome without affecting expression levels so this method often cannot be used to measure endogenous gene expression. It is, however, widely used to measure the expression of a gene artificially introduced into the cell, for example via an expression vector. It {{is important to note that}} by fusing a <b>target</b> <b>protein</b> to a fluorescent reporter the protein's behavior, including its cellular localization and expression level, can be significantly changed.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen {{itself is}} a prodrug, having {{relatively}} little affinity for its <b>target</b> <b>protein,</b> the estrogen receptor (ER). It is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 into active metabolites such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (afimoxifene) and N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen (endoxifen) which have 30–100 times more affinity with the ER than tamoxifen itself. These active metabolites compete with estrogen in the body for binding to the ER. In breast tissue, 4-OHT acts as an ER antagonist so that transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is inhibited. Tamoxifen has 7% and 6% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, whereas 4-OHT has 178% and 338% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ.|$|E

25|$|The large {{geometry}} change {{associated with}} azobenzene photoisomerization {{has also been}} used to control protein activity with light. Azobenzene has been attached to ligands (drug) to photo-modulate their affinity for proteins. Azobenzene has been employed as a photoswitchable tether between a ligand and the protein: {{one end of the}} azobenzene is substituted with a reactive group that attaches to the <b>target</b> <b>protein.</b> The other end displays a ligand for the protein. Depending on where the azobenzene is attached, either the cis or trans isomer will present the ligand to the ligand-binding site, while the other isomer prevents the drug from reaching the site. Again, photoswitching between isomers turns the protein on and off. When applied to ion channels in the nervous system, this approach affords optical control of electrical activity in neurons.|$|E
25|$|Expanded-bed {{adsorption}} (EBA) chromatography is {{a convenient}} and effective technique for {{the capture of}} proteins directly from unclarified crude sample. In EBA chromatography, the settled bed is first expanded by upward flow of equilibration buffer. The crude feed, a mixture of soluble proteins, contaminants, cells, and cell debris, is then passed upward through the expanded bed. Target proteins are captured on the adsorbent, while particulates and contaminants pass through. A change to elution buffer while maintaining upward flow results in desorption of the <b>target</b> <b>protein</b> in expanded-bed mode. Alternatively, if the flow is reversed, the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an elution buffer. The mode used for elution (expanded-bed versus settled-bed) depends {{on the characteristics of}} the feed. After elution, the adsorbent is cleaned with a predefined cleaning-in-place (CIP) solution, with cleaning followed by either column regeneration (for further use) or storage.|$|E
25|$|The {{isoelectric point}} (pI) is the pH of a {{solution}} at which the net primary charge of a protein becomes zero. At a solution pH that is above the pI {{the surface of the}} protein is predominantly negatively charged and therefore like-charged molecules will exhibit repulsive forces. Likewise, at a solution pH that is below the pI, the surface of the protein is predominantly positively charged and repulsion between proteins occurs. However, at the pI the negative and positive charges cancel, repulsive electrostatic forces are reduced and the attraction forces predominate. The attraction forces will cause aggregation and precipitation. The pI of most proteins is in the pH range of 4–6. Mineral acids, such as hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used as precipitants. The greatest disadvantage to isoelectric point precipitation is the irreversible denaturation caused by the mineral acids. For this reason isoelectric point precipitation is most often used to precipitate contaminant proteins, rather than the <b>target</b> <b>protein.</b> The precipitation of casein during cheesemaking, or during production of sodium caseinate, is an isoelectric precipitation.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influences of}} the excluded volume of molecules on biochemical reaction processes on 2 -dimensional surfaces using a model of signal transduction processes on biomembranes. We perform simulations of the 2 -dimensional cell-based model, which describes the reactions and diffusion of the receptors, signaling <b>proteins,</b> <b>target</b> <b>proteins,</b> and crowders on the cell membrane. The signaling proteins are activated by receptors, and these activated signaling <b>proteins</b> activate <b>target</b> <b>proteins</b> that bind autonomously from the cytoplasm to the membrane, and unbind from the membrane if activated. If the <b>target</b> <b>proteins</b> bind frequently, the volume fraction of molecules on the membrane becomes so large that the excluded volume of the molecules for the reaction and diffusion dynamics cannot be negligible. We find that such excluded volume effects of the molecules induce non-trivial variations of the signal flow, defined as the activation frequency of <b>target</b> <b>proteins,</b> as follows. With {{an increase in the}} binding rate of <b>target</b> <b>proteins,</b> the signal flow varies by i) monotonically increasing; ii) increasing then decreasing in a bell-shaped curve; or iii) increasing, decreasing, then increasing in an S-shaped curve. We further demonstrate that the excluded volume of molecules influences the hierarchical molecular distributions throughout the reaction processes. In particular, when the system exhibits a large signal flow, the signaling proteins tend to surround the receptors to form receptor-signaling protein clusters, and the <b>target</b> <b>proteins</b> tend to become distributed around such clusters. To explain these phenomena, we analyze the stochastic model of the local motions of molecules around the receptor. ar X i...|$|R
