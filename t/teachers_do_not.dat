25|$|In {{rural areas}} of the state, there is {{extremely}} limited education offerings beyond elementary school. Indigenous people comprise 33% of the state population, of which only 5% ever attain an education beyond the primary grade levels. In addition, 90% of all indigenous <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have satisfactory academic backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|However, other languages—including Romance family members—all {{have their}} own interpretations of the Latin phonological system, applied both to loan words and formal study of Latin.

25|$|However, {{to impose}} sanctions, {{plagiarism}} {{needs to be}} detected. It {{has been found that}} a significant share of (university) <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> use detection methods such as using text-matching software. A few more try to detect plagiarism by reading term-papers specifically for plagiarism, while the latter method might be not very effective in detecting plagiarism – especially when plagiarism from unfamiliar sources needs to be detected.|$|E

25|$|Child-directed speech also {{catches the}} child's attention, and in {{situations}} where words for new objects are being expressed to the child, this form of speech may help the child recognize the speech cues and the new information provided. Data shows that children raised in highly verbal families had higher language scores than those children raised in low verbal families. Continuously hearing complicated sentences throughout language development increases the child's ability to understand these sentences and then to use complicated sentences as they develop. Studies have shown that students enrolled in high language classrooms have two times the growth in complex sentences usage than students in classrooms where <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> frequently use complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|Charter {{schools are}} state funded schools which operate {{outside of the}} normal state system. They began in 2014 with 5 small schools. Charter schools {{do not have to}} operate with any {{registered}} or trained teachers. <b>Teachers</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have to have current practicing certificates. They do not have to have a principal. They are allowed to benefit from profit making. They do not have to follow the national curriculum. They receive approximately 3 times the level of funding per student than normal state schools. If the charter school roll drops during the year, the school keeps the extra funding, unlike normal state schools, where funding is matched to students actually attending. If a charter school fails the management/owners are allowed to keep the land and buildings and other capital assets. Charter schools have less compliance with regulations than State schools although teachers must undergo police vetting.|$|E
25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E

Most of the <b>teachers</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> ask for revisions while the research findings underscore the positive effect of revision on improving learners’ writings.

500|$|Of the Central Atlas Tamazight {{speakers}}, 40–45% are monolingual, {{while the}} others use Arabic as a second language. Monolingual speakers consist mostly of older generations and children. Women {{are more likely to}} be monolingual than men, since they typically stay in the village while the men go to work in the cities. [...] Since Tamazight is the language of the home, girls grow up speaking Berber languages and pass them on to their children — this gender stratification helps to preserve the language. Bilingual Berber speakers have learned Moroccan Arabic via schooling, migration, media, or through the government. Most rural Berber children are monolingual. [...] They struggle to succeed in schools where the <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> speak Berber, and require them to learn both Arabic and French.|$|E
2500|$|Standardized testing {{places a}} lot of stress and {{pressure}} on children and teachers. Teachers are put under {{a lot of}} stress because the better students do on the test the more federal funding that school and district will receive. This causes teachers to teach to the test rather than teach to the life skills children will [...] use and need. In some cases, schools have shortened or removed recess so that more time can be spent preparing and practicing for the standardized tests. The pressure of this and the removal of a stress outlet, recess, means that children, along with teachers, are going to become depressed and sleep-deprived. Being depressed and sleep-deprived causes children to act out more than usual which places more stress on the teachers. <b>Teachers</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> get the results back {{until the end of the}} summer which means they will not be able to use those results to help those children because they will already be on to the next grade. Standardized tests place an unnecessary amount of stress on teachers and students without yielding any information in a timely manner.|$|E
60|$|<b>Teachers</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> perhaps always consider, how {{entirely and}} {{essentially}} distinct these three are {{from all the}} rest. They are arts; the acquisition of them {{is not to be}} considered as knowledge, so much as the means, by which knowledge may be obtained. A child, who is studying Geography, or History, or Natural Science, is learning facts,--gaining information; on the other hand, the one who is learning to write, or to read, or to calculate, may be adding little or nothing to his stock of knowledge. He is acquiring skill, which, at some future time, he may make the means of increasing his knowledge, to any extent.|$|E

Now shall we, because a good nature inclines us to virtue's side, say, There are no doubts,--and lie for the right? Is life to be led in a brave or in a cowardly manner? and is not the satisfaction of the doubts essential to all manliness? Is the name of virtue to be a barrier to that which is virtue? Can you not believe that a man of earnest and burly habit may find small good in tea, essays, and catechism, and want a rougher instruction, want men, labor, trade, farming, war, hunger, plenty, love, hatred, doubt, and terror, to make things plain to him; and has he not a right to insist on being convinced in his own way?

Results may surprise even those composition scholars familiar with the research of Sommers (1982), Hayes and Daiker (1984) and Sperling and Freedman(1987), which suggested that students and teachers will often have different interpretations of written comments on student papers. Inthe present study, interviews with students and teachers after conferences revealed that substantial misunderstandings resulted evenin the course of verbal exchanges.
