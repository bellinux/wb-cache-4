5|$|The breed was {{originally}} a multipurpose horse, used for agriculture, cavalry and pulling diligences (a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage).</b> Because {{of a lack}} of support from a breeding syndicate, such as the one in existence for the Mérens horse, once the need for a multipurpose breed declined, the population of the Castillonnais dwindled. Many horses were crossbred with draft horses, and the breed almost became extinct. The intervention of a group of supporters in 1980 saved the breed from extinction, and in 1992 L'Association Pyrénéenne Ariégeoise du Cheval Castillonnais (the Ariege Pyrenees Association of Castillonnais Horses) was formed, with support from several French government agencies and stud farms. Annually, in August, the association holds a small competition and sale for the breed in Castillon-en-Couserans, which also includes inspections to register horses for the breed studbook.|$|E

500|$|Although the Dream Pool Essays is {{certainly}} his most extensive and important work, Shen Kuo wrote other books as well. [...] In 1075, Shen Kuo wrote the Xining Fengyuan Li ( [...] ; The Oblatory Epoch astronomical {{system of the}} Splendid Peace reign period), which was lost, but listed in a 7th chapter of a Song Dynasty bibliography. [...] This was the official report of Shen Kuo on his reforms of the Chinese calendar, which were only partially adopted by the Song court's official calendar system. [...] During his years of retirement from governmental service, Shen Kuo compiled a formulary known as the Liang Fang ( [...] ; Good medicinal formulas). Around the year 1126 it was combined with a similar collection by the famous Su Shi (1037–1101), who was ironically a political opponent to Shen Kuo's faction of Reformers and New Policies supporters at court, yet it was known that Shen Kuo and Su Shi were nonetheless friends and associates. Shen wrote the Mengqi Wanghuai Lu ( [...] ; Record of longings forgotten at Dream Brook), which was also compiled during Shen's retirement. [...] This book was a treatise in the working since his youth on rural life and ethnographic accounts of living conditions in the isolated mountain regions of China. [...] Only quotations of it survive in the Shuo Fu (...) collection, which mostly describe the agricultural implements and tools used by rural people in high mountain regions. [...] Shen Kuo also wrote the Changxing Ji ( [...] ; Collected Literary Works of [...] Changxing). [...] However, this book was without much doubt a posthumous collection, including various poems, prose, and administrative documents written by Shen. By the 15th century (during the Ming Dynasty), this book was reprinted, yet only the 19th chapter remained. [...] This chapter was reprinted in 1718, yet poorly edited. [...] Finally, in the 1950s the author Hu Daojing supplemented this small yet valuable work with additions of other scattered poems written by Shen, in the former's Collection of Shen Kua's Extant Poetry (Shanghai: Shang-hai Shu-tian, 1958). In {{the tradition of the}} popular Song era literary category of 'travel record literature' ('youji wenxue'), Shen Kuo also wrote the Register of What Not to Forget, a traveler's guide to what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> is suitable for a journey, the proper foods one should bring, the special clothing one should bring, and many other items.|$|E
