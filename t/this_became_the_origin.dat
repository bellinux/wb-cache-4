The bird's irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or [...] "masting" [...] events of particular plant species such as the Rimu which led Māori to credit the bird with the ability to tell the future.

5000|$|The Second Siege of Jinju was {{a battle}} during 1593 in Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea at Jinju Fort, Korea, between Japan and Korea.

50|$|The {{field of}} {{anthropology}} originated from Europe and England designed in late 19th century. It spread its roots to the United States {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century. Some of the main contributors like EB Tylor (1832-1917) from Britain and Lewis H Morgan (1818-1881), an American scientist were considered as founders of cultural and social dimensions. Franz Boas (1858-1942), Bronislaw Malinowski (1858—1942), Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead (1901-1978), were a group of researchers from the United States who contributed the idea of cultural relativism to the literature. Boas's approach focused on the use of documents and informants, whereas, Malinowski stated that a researcher should be engrossed with the work for long periods in the field and do a participant observation by living with the informant and experiencing their way of life. He gives the viewpoint of the native and <b>this</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of field work and field methods.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse some {{essential}} events concerning the relationship between Spain and Macao in the middle of the 19 th century. Macao remained as a privileged spot for the commercial activities of Spain in China after the opening of the international ports agreed upon in the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842. This encouraged Spanish diplomatic representatives to render special attention to the Portuguese enclave. <b>This</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of a shocking proposal for the military conquest of Macao and its surrounding territories by one of these representatives, Sinibaldo de Mas. Although this proposal was never taken under consideration, it helps us to better understand the role Macao played in Spanish strategies in China. Years later, Mas participated as a mediator when the Chinese government attempted to regain sovereignty over Macao by paying an economic compensation to Portugal. The involvement of Sinibaldo de Mas in this project has a strong symbolic meaning, making him a key agent in the relations between Spain and Macao in the 19 th century. El propósito de este trabajo es analizar algunos hechos esenciales relativos a la relación entre España y Macao a mediados del siglo XIX. El propòsit d'aquest treball és analitzar alguns fets essencials relatius a la relació entre Espanya i Macao a mitjan segle XIX...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} a model on an extra dimension $S^ 1 $ where plenty of effective boundary points described by point interactions (zero-thickness branes) are arranged. After suitably selecting the conditions on these points {{for each type}} of five-dimensional fields, we realize the tiny active neutrino masses, the charged lepton mass hierarchy, and lepton mixings with a CP-violating phase, simultaneously. Not only the quark's but also the lepton's configurations are generated in a unified way with acceptable accuracy, with neither the see-saw mechanism nor symmetries in Yukawa couplings, by suitably setting the model parameters, even though their flavor structures are dissimilar each other. One remarkable point is that a complex vacuum expectation value of the five-dimensional Higgs doublet in <b>this</b> model <b>becomes</b> <b>the</b> common <b>origin</b> of <b>the</b> CP violation in both quark and lepton sectors. The model can be consistent with the results of the precision electroweak measurements and Large Hadron Collider experiments.
