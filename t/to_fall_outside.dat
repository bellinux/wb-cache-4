5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Chick-fil-A Bowl, the number of controversies {{surrounding}} Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin continued to grow. Throughout the regular season, he was linked to violations of NCAA rules and actions that appeared <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>outside</b> the norm for SEC coaches. He was mentioned in a rap song by Lil Wayne, and his combative attitude toward opposing coaches caused friction within the SEC. In the second week of December, he was connected to an ongoing scandal in which Tennessee hostesses allegedly helped lure recruits to Tennessee, violating NCAA rules. Despite these problems, he was a successful recruiter, and gained commitments from sought-after recruits in the leadup to the Chick-fil-A Bowl.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the judge}} noted that whether a {{discretionary}} power {{is subject to}} any precedent fact depends {{on the construction of}} the legislation creating the power, and that it is open to Parliament to express its intention in plain and unequivocal words to take a discretion conferred on a public authority out of the precedent fact category, thus excluding judicial review of the discretion even if the liberty of a person affected by the exercise of the discretion is implicated. On the facts of the case, the discretion conferred on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act to detain without trial persons believed to threaten national security, to suspend detentions and to revoke such suspensions, was held <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>outside</b> the precedent fact category. Consequently, the Court could not go beyond determining if the detention decisions violated administrative law rules relating to illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety.|$|E

5|$|After two failed {{attempts}} {{to capture the}} fort by straight forward attacks, the British resorted to attrition tactics. On 28 November, instead of launching another infantry assault, the fort was encircled from all sides and placed under siege. This prevented Nepalese reinforcements from entering the fort. Mawbey then instructed his gunners, by now strongly reinforced, to fire into the fort. He also sent scouts to locate and cut off the fort's external water source. The water situation was made worse for the defenders when about a hundred earthen vessels stocked with water, stored in a portico, were destroyed in the bombardment. The eastern and northern walls of the fort were razed to the ground. The continuous bombardment also caused {{three of the four}} cannons installed on the fort's battlements <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>outside</b> the fort, while the other fell inside. The other cannons that the Nepalese possessed were unusable, having either been disabled by misfiring during previous attacks, or because they had been buried under rubble in the British bombardment. Left without any cannons to reply, the garrison suffered heavy casualties. They continued to resist using gunfire and stones, but eventually the few people that remained in the fort became desperate and could not hold on any longer. That night, despite threats to their person and property, desertion became rampant.|$|E

At the time the government were concerned that the Burmah Oil Company would take advantage of the new right to contest the legality of the War Damage Act 1965 depriving the company of the right to compensation for damage caused during World War II as recognised by a House of Lords' decision, the acceptance was timed <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>outside</b> the six-month limitation period for challenges to the Act and the United Kingdom's acceptance also explicitly stated that it applied only to claims arising after its effective date.

Those participants who received some follow-up care perceived it as untailored to their specific needs.

2500|$|The first {{important}} {{case was}} O'Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc. Some waiters worked various dinner {{functions in the}} Grosvenor House Hotel. They tried to form a union. They were dismissed. They claimed that this was unfair, and to do that, they had to show they were [...] "employees" [...] {{within the meaning of}} the unfair dismissal legislation. [...] The word [...] "employee" [...] had hitherto always been taken to mean someone who is obviously not in business on his own account (i.e. not [...] "self employed"), but recognised as subordinate labour, economically dependent on the employer. However, Alexander Irvine QC argued that the waiters had no [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] with the employer: they were not bound to accept work engagements when they were called up, and the employer was under no obligation to call them up. They could leave, or be fired, at will. Sir John Donaldson accepted this argument and deemed the waiters <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>outside</b> of the scope of unfair dismissal legislation.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{that does}} not meet the {{criteria}} of [...] "fundamental research" [...] cannot involve foreign persons without export licenses; however, research activities that are considered fundamental typically can involve foreign persons, even when they involve the design and construction of defense articles, as the US State Department has deemed such research activities <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>outside</b> of the purview of training activities that would constitute the illegal export of a [...] "defense service." [...] The need to make this distinction has led many U.S. research universities to adopt ITAR policies and compliance programs. These measures can vary widely; for example, MIT states that [...] "the intent of the ITAR is that research conducted on campus, without restrictions on publication or participation, is fundamental research from inception to publication as long as the intent is to publish the results," [...] while Stanford University maintains a more nuanced and restrictive approach to research involving defense articles.|$|E
2500|$|Not all judges {{took the}} same view. In Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner home-working ladies {{stitching}} flaps onto trousers were held to be employees {{within the meaning of}} the Act. The leading judge, Stephenson LJ, held that [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] was {{nothing to do with the}} promise of future work, but simply the exchange of work for a wage, and control over one's job by the employer in the employment contract. Before the case reached the Court of Appeal, a young Tony Blair had been arguing the exact opposite in the Employment Appeals Tribunal, that O'Kelly's case should be followed. Agency workers were presumed <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>outside</b> the scope of protective employment legislation. In 1997, when Tony Blair led New Labour to election victory, the approach to employment policy he brought was one of upholding labour market flexibility. The position of agency workers was reaffirmed when Derry Irvine was appointed Lord Chancellor, and he sat in on, and gave the leading judgement in, Carmichael v National Power plc. He reasserted his view of [...] "mutuality of obligation". It is notable that the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 removed the power of the Lord Chancellor to decide on cases in this manner; it now being an incursion on the separation of powers within government.|$|E

2500|$|In many cases, low paid, {{vulnerable}} workers, especially agency {{workers have}} been held <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>outside</b> the scope of those rights in the Act which are only for [...] "employees". This is because some judges have taken the view {{that there was not}} sufficient [...] "control" [...] or [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] to establish a contract of employment. What those judges have meant by [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] is that the terms of the contract, especially an obligation to work or not work at any given time and the promise of work in future, were not reciprocal enough. So in O'Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc [...] ICR 728, Sir John Donaldson MR held that some waiters who were hired through an agency to do dinner functions were not [...] "employees" [...] (either of the function hall or the agency) because they did not, technically, have to turn up to work for a shift, and they could be sacked at any time. Sir John Donaldson MR said therefore, that the contract lacked [...] "mutuality" [...] and could not be described as one between an [...] "employee" [...] and [...] "employer". The legal effect was to put them in the same boat as the [...] "self employed" [...] and that they were not covered by the Act. The practical effect was they had no right to fair dismissal and could be sacked for organising a trade union.|$|E
