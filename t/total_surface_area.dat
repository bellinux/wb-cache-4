The column is internally illuminated by fibre optic cables with a faint blue light, symbolising the blue lamp which traditionally hangs outside police stations in the United Kingdom.

5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the <b>total</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area.</b> The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E

5|$|Kīlauea {{has been}} active {{throughout}} its history. Since 1918, Kīlauea's only prolonged period of rest was an 18-year pause between 1934 and 1952. The bulk of Kīlauea consists of solidified lava flows, intermittent with scattered volcanic ash and tephra sourced from relatively lower-volume explosive eruptions. Much of the volcano is covered in historical flows, and 90 percent of its surface dates from the last 1,100 years. Kīlauea built itself up from the seafloor over time, and thus much of its bulk remains underwater; its subaerial surface {{is in the form}} of a gently sloping, elongate, decentralized shield with a surface area of approximately , making up 13.7 percent of the island's <b>total</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|The unusual surface {{appearance}} of the cerebellum conceals {{the fact that most}} of its volume is made up of a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex. Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a folium. It is estimated that, if the human cerebellar cortex were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of neural tissue about 1meter long and averaging 5centimeters wide—a <b>total</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of about 500square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6cm × 5cm × 10cm. Underneath the gray matter of the cortex lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from the cortex. Embedded within the white matter—which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{enjoys a}} {{diversity}} of temperate ecologies, incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodlands, and moorland, montane, estuarine, freshwater, oceanic, and tundra landscapes. Approximately 14% of Scotland is wooded, much of it forestry plantations, but prior to human clearing {{there would have been}} much larger areas of boreal Caledonian and broad-leaved forest. Although much reduced, significant remnants of the native Scots Pine woodlands can be found in places. 17% of Scotland is covered by heather moorland and peatland. Caithness and Sutherland have some {{of the largest and most}} intact areas of blanket bog in the world, supporting a distinctive wildlife community. 75% of Scotland's land is classed as agricultural (including some moorland) with urban areas accounting for around 3% of the total. The number of islands with terrestrial vegetation is nearly 800, about 600 of them lying off the west coast. Scotland has more than 90% of the volume and 70% of the <b>total</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of fresh water in the United Kingdom. There are more than 30,000 freshwater lochs and 6,600 river systems.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2002 The {{activation}} of green '"'Smartie"" coke (a mixture of medium temperature pitch and waxy oil coke) {{was investigated in}} a laboratory scale fluidised bed (FB) and a rotary kiln as function of (1) heat treatment temperature (HIT) and (2) heat treatment time (HTt). Activation in the FB was more effective (in terms of <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> development) and the product obtained from this type of reactor had {{a larger percentage of}} mesopores than the products from the rotary kiln. It was possible to produce a product with an iodine number equal to 745 mg iodine per gram carbon. The study revealed {{that it is possible to}} tune the pore structure of "Smartie" coke derived activated carbons by changing the activation device and systematically changing the activation conditions. It was possible to obtain products ranging from a predominantly microporous structure to products with a predominantly mesoporous structure. Unfortunately, in comparison to commercially available activated carbons, the <b>total</b> <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> were still too low and it will be necessary to perform further investigations focused on increasing the <b>total</b> <b>surface</b> <b>areas.</b> The gold adsorption tests performed on the activated carbon compared well to those of activated carbon currently in use in the gold industry...|$|R

Industries largely consist of manufacturing of forestry, agriculture, husbandry, chemistry, textile and mining products. There are 81 active industrial plants in the province, most of them located at the central district of Erzurum, and are small and medium enterprises. Due to their relatively small sizes, these industries mainly serve local markets causing lower capacity usage, low productivity and unemployment. About 40 plants are currently out of use, mostly due to high operating costs.|$|E
