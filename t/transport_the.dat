40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this paper is how to allocate the environmental aspect of <b>transports</b> to <b>the</b> cargo <b>transported.</b> <b>The</b> cargo type was limited to high volume, low value cargo. The problem was also addressed from a <b>transport</b> purchasing perspective. <b>The</b> research was both case study inspired as well as action research oriented. The model was developed in a company where the researcher actively participated in its development. The company in the case study is a major European transport purchaser for high volume, low value cargo. The results of the case study have been generalised into a method for allocating the environmental aspect of <b>the</b> <b>transport</b> to <b>the</b> cargo itself. The practical implication is a method which enables transport purchasers to allocate environmental aspect of <b>transports</b> to <b>the</b> cargo <b>transported.</b> <b>The</b> method accounts for <b>transport</b> flow characteristics, <b>the</b> utilisation of <b>the</b> means of <b>transport,</b> and <b>the</b> characteristics of <b>the</b> cargo <b>transported,</b> such as packaging characteristics. The theoretical implication is a contribution to developing a general allocation theory for determining the environmental aspect of transported cargoes...|$|R
