5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through <b>the</b> <b>network</b> and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and <b>the</b> <b>network</b> about how <b>the</b> <b>network</b> is to handle the data; if <b>the</b> <b>network</b> cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{moved to}} Los Angeles in 2011 {{to work for}} Cartoon Network.

Jones contrasted the physical limitations of animating in time and energy to the animation of the pilot itself. He cited having the character of AJ run up a wall in one scene as an example of this.|$|E

5|$|The Buenos Aires Underground has had {{among the}} longest serving and most varied rolling {{stock in the}} world, {{in part due to}} <b>the</b> <b>network</b> having been {{originally}} built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities between the lines. <b>The</b> <b>network</b> began with uniform rolling stock, with the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company Anglo-Argentine Line A using La Brugeoise cars (with {{the exception of a few}} UEC Preston cars), the three CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) using Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel stock and Lacroze's Line B using Metro Cammell cars. However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made <b>the</b> <b>network</b> less uniform, particularly with regards to the problematic Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>network</b> {{was also}} used heavily by {{government}} officials and rescue personnel, who used PDAs or laptops to log on to <b>the</b> <b>network.</b> It was used by rescue workers who were floating {{in the middle of}} the river and who could receive the signal to communicate with the headquarters in charge of the rescue operations. The wireless service was integral in sending large GIS files to the scene for rescuers to use in locating survivors. It was also utilized by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, the American Red Cross, and media outlets, both local and national. Retroactively, various Minneapolis officials deemed the presence of <b>the</b> <b>network</b> essential to the success of the response to the collapse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The paper {{focuses on}} the roles of {{intellectual}} property rights (IPRs) in <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> enterprise. <b>The</b> issue raised implies {{to better understand the}} role of IPRs not only in the strategy but also in the organization of <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> enterprise. <b>The</b> paper shows that IPRs have several roles in <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> enterprise. <b>The</b> first one can be called a ‘coordination role’, making easier the relationships between all the fragmented parts of <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> enterprise. <b>The</b> coordination role is gaining ground in the context of collaborative innovation (innovation <b>networks).</b> <b>The</b> second role is the ‘incentive/defensive role’, aiming at protecting and thus giving incentives to the constitution of <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> firm’s innovation potential, called here ‘knowledge capital’. The third role is an ‘offensive’ one which largely contributes to define the place of <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> enterprise within <b>the</b> innovation <b>network</b> to which it usually belongs. The paper concludes by stressing the relationship between the roles of IPRs for <b>networked</b> enterprises and <b>the</b> strengthening of IPRs at the global level.

40|$|Abstract—This note {{proposes a}} multirate sampleddata system {{to model the}} {{discrete}} schedule feature of <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> singular control systems. Sampleddata system with time-delay in its discrete-time subsystem shows some nice features to admit many network-induced topics, for example, time-delay, packet dropout. Beside of <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> control systems with different combinations of the time-driven or event-driven mode of the devices, including the samplers, the controllers and the holders, this work concerns with <b>the</b> <b>networks</b> with multirate devices. By transforming the time-delay in the discrete-time subsystem into the continuous-time singular subsystem, a less conservative time-delay dependent stability result for <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> singular control systems is obtained. The stability condition guarantees that <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> singular system is regular, impulse free and stable. Furthermore, a stabilized control law for <b>the</b> <b>networked</b> singular systems is presented. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate {{the potential of the}} proposed techniques...|$|R
