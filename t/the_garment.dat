5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch {{character class}}es, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere {{with the use of}} Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of <b>the</b> <b>Garment</b> Grid they are wearing. <b>The</b> <b>Garment</b> Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|E
5|$|Geraldine Ferraro {{was born}} on August 26, 1935 in Newburgh, New York, the {{daughter}} of Antonetta L. Ferraro (née Corrieri), a first-generation Italian American seamstress, and Dominick Ferraro, an Italian immigrant (from Marcianise, Campania) and owner of two restaurants. She had three brothers born before her, but one died in infancy and another at age three. Ferraro attended the parochial school Mount Saint Mary's in Newburgh when she was young. Her father {{died of a heart}} attack in , when she was eight. Ferraro's mother soon invested and lost the remainder of the family's money, forcing the family to move to a low-income area in the South Bronx while Ferraro's mother worked in <b>the</b> <b>garment</b> industry to support them.|$|E

The women viewing <b>the</b> <b>garments</b> responded in a program/questionnaire during the fashion show. A significant number of women indicated that they liked more than a majority of <b>the</b> <b>garments.</b> <b>The</b> <b>garments</b> to which <b>the</b> women responded most favorably were those made of bright colors. It was found that there was not a significant difference between age and lifestyle of the women and their opinions of a majority of <b>the</b> <b>garments</b> viewed. However, {{there was a significant difference}} between age and lifestyle of the women and the appropriateness of <b>the</b> <b>garments</b> for their lifestyles. The location of <b>the</b> <b>garments</b> within a store was also considered. A significant number of women indicated that they would like to see the clothes in a separate section rather than throughout the store. It was concluded that there is a need for specifically designed clothes for elderly women and that clothing manufacturers and pattern companies should be made aware of this need...|$|R
5|$|Hsu fled to Hong Kong {{and lived}} there from 1992 to 1996 {{while working in}} <b>the</b> <b>garment</b> industry. He started at least two {{companies}} there, both with vague charters. Aided by what others described as a magnetic personality, he prospered for a while, living in a luxury building. However the companies were dissolved in 1997 and 1998, and by 1998 Hong Kong courts had declared Hsu once again bankrupt. He would not emerge from this Hong Kong bankruptcy until 2006.|$|E
5|$|Hsu then {{returned}} to the United States in the late 1990s, despite his fugitive status, and established several addresses in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas. He became an investor in Silicon Valley, invested in real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area, and still had engagements in <b>the</b> <b>garment</b> industry. He later relocated to New York, where he seemed to become involved in the apparel business once again and lived in a luxury apartment in SoHo while flying chartered jets.|$|E
5|$|The True Cost is a 2015 {{documentary}} film directed by Andrew Morgan {{that focuses on}} fast fashion. It discusses several aspects of <b>the</b> <b>garment</b> industry from production—mainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries—to its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Using an approach that looks at environmental, social and psychological aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.|$|E
50|$|Current {{practice}} at garment or apparel industry plants {{is to apply}} metal detecting after <b>the</b> <b>garments</b> are completely sewn and before garments are packed to check whether there is any metal contamination (needle, broken needle, etc.) in <b>the</b> <b>garments.</b> This {{needs to be done}} for safety reasons.|$|R

He joined the Pioneers of Liberty, the first Jewish anarchist group in the U.S. The group was affiliated with the International Working People's Association, the organization to which the Haymarket defendants had belonged, and they regarded the Haymarket men as martyrs. Since most of its members worked in <b>the</b> <b>garment</b> industry, the Pioneers of Liberty took part in strikes against sweatshops and helped establish {{some of the first}} Jewish labor unions in the city. Before long, Berkman was one of the prominent members of the organization.|$|E
5|$|The Orkneyinga saga relates how {{after the}} death of Earl Hákon Pálsson, his sons, Haraldr Hákonsson, and Páll Hákonsson, divided the earldom between themselves. However, the half-brothers soon began to {{disagree}} with one another, and their vassals divided into competing factions. The saga relates how one day Frakökk, and her sister Helga (mother of Earl Haraldr), were sewing a snow-white garment embroidered with gold. This garment was enchanted, and the two sisters had intended it for Earl Haraldr's half-brother, Earl Páll. Unfortunately for the sisters, Earl Haraldr noticed the beautiful garment and, despite their protestations, put <b>the</b> <b>garment</b> on and soon after died. The saga states that Earl Páll immediately took control of his deceased half-brother's possessions, and that he was highly suspicious of the two sisters. In consequence, Frakökk and Helga were no longer welcome in the earldom, and they left for Caithness, and from there move to Sutherland where Frakökk had an estate. In time, several of Frakökk's descendants were brought up in Sutherland—including her daughter, Steinnvör 'the Stout', and grandson, Ölvir.|$|E
5|$|The film {{shows how}} the demand for cotton in India {{has led to the}} {{planting}} of genetically modified (GM) cotton, and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton, leading to suicides among farmers who lose their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices. GM crops need more pesticides, causing environmental damage, birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people, and an increased rate of cancer. The film claims that sometimes the companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications. A similar scenario occurs in contaminated cotton fields in Texas, where pesticides are causing brain tumors. <b>The</b> <b>garment</b> industry is the second-most-polluting industry the world, according to the film, which is illustrated by leather tanneries pouring chromium into the Ganges River in Kanpur, India.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, {{improvements}} in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, {{including the use}} of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of northern river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in <b>the</b> <b>garment</b> industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. Otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas. Otter harvests correlate positively with the beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. River otter pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of <b>the</b> <b>garment</b> {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The HD remaster covers both Final Fantasy X and its sequel Final Fantasy X-2. The {{first game}} follows {{the journey of}} the {{teenager}} Tidus who is transported {{to the world of}} Spira after an encounter with a creature known as Sin. He becomes one of the guardians of the summoner Yuna, protecting her on a pilgrimage to defeat Sin and finding out how the creature is linked to Tidus' and Yuna's late fathers. Gameplay relies on the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system that allows for swapping party members in mid-combat. Characters are leveled up by means of the Sphere Grid on which the player may choose a specific skill to learn or attribute to improve. The second game is set two years after the events of X and features Yuna as a treasure hunter in search of spheres leading her to Tidus. It reintroduces the series' classic job system in the form of <b>the</b> <b>Garment</b> Grid: jobs can be acquired as dresspheres, costumes that give the player characters different abilities, throughout the game and may be changed in battle. X-2 includes multiple minigames such as Sphere Break and blitzball, the latter of which also featured prominently in X.|$|E

5000|$|The High Priest, {{like all}} priests, would {{minister}} barefoot {{when he was}} serving in the Temple. Like all of the priests, he had to immerse himself in the ritual bath before vesting and wash his hands and his feet before performing any sacred act. The Talmud teaches that neither the kohanim nor the Kohen Gadol were fit to minister unless they wore their priestly vestments: [...] "While they are clothed in <b>the</b> priestly <b>garments,</b> they are clothed in the priesthood; but {{when they are not}} wearing <b>the</b> <b>garments,</b> <b>the</b> priesthood is not upon them" [...] (B.Zevachim 17:B). It is further taught that just as the sacrifices facilitate an atonement for sin, so do <b>the</b> priestly <b>garments</b> (B.Zevachim 88b). <b>The</b> High Priest had two sets of holy garments: the [...] "Golden Garments" [...] detailed above, and a set of white [...] "Linen Garments" [...] (bigdei ha-bad) which he wore only on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) (...) [...] On that day, he would change his holy garments four times, beginning in <b>the</b> golden <b>garments</b> but changing into <b>the</b> Linen <b>Garments</b> for <b>the</b> two moments when he would enter the Holy of Holies (the first time to offer the blood of atonement and the incense, and the second time to retrieve the censer), and then change back again into <b>the</b> golden <b>garments</b> after each time. He would immerse in the ritual bath before each change of garments, washing his hands and his feet after removing <b>the</b> <b>garments</b> and again before putting the other set on. <b>The</b> linen <b>garments</b> were only four in number, those corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>garments</b> worn by all priests (undergarments, tunic, sash and turban), but made only of white linen, with no embroidery. They could be worn only once, new sets being made each year.|$|R
