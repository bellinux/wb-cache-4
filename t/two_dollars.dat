He put slips of paper in some of the sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid <b>two</b> <b>dollars</b> for the same sack of potatoes.|$|E

25|$|The book's initial failure {{has been}} {{attributed}} to several factors: at <b>two</b> <b>dollars,</b> it was priced relatively high for the Great Depression era. Also, the book's depiction of nudity, though it was intended for adults and was very restrained, led to cold reception.|$|E

25|$|The Australian pound, {{introduced}} in 1910 and officially distinct in value from the pound sterling since devaluation in 1931, {{was replaced by}} the dollar on 14 February 1966. The rate of conversion for the new decimal currency was <b>two</b> <b>dollars</b> per Australian pound, or ten Australian shillings per dollar. The exchange rate was pegged to the pound sterling at a rate of $1 = 8 shillings ($2.50 = UK £1). In 1967, Australia effectively left the sterling area, when the pound sterling was devalued against the US dollar and the Australian dollar did not follow. It maintained its peg to the US dollar at the rate of A$1 = US$1.12.|$|E
25|$|The {{composer}} subsequently scored Leone's other <b>two</b> <b>Dollars</b> Trilogy (or Man With No Name Trilogy) spaghetti westerns: For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). All three films starred the American actor Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name and depicted Leone's own intense {{vision of}} the mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music {{to be an important}} part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are so slow.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{expected}} to be eventually reimbursed, Waters Smith {{had to pay for}} the care of the Africans from his own pocket. (In the end, Smith was reimbursed for only part of what he had spent, and he had to mortgage his home to cover the rest.) To partially cover his expenses, he hired the Africans out to plantation owners at <b>two</b> <b>dollars</b> per month each. Boys too young for field work were placed as servants in private homes. Several of the men were blind or sick, and could not be put to work. At this point the condition of the Africans rescued from Guerrero was indistinguishable from slavery. The Africans were in a legal limbo. There were laws covering Africans seized while being illegally imported into the United States, but they did not apply to Africans who entered the country accidentally. In April 1828 President John Quincy Adams requested Congress to pass a supplementary law dealing with the Guerrero Africans, but it failed to act. A year later, in March 1829, Congress appropriated funds to reimburse Waters Smith and transport the Guerrero Africans to Liberia.|$|E

500|$|Before the General Assembly {{could act}} on his recommendations, Blackburn began {{granting}} pardons to relieve prison overcrowding. He particularly favored clemency for the incurably sick {{so they could}} go home to die with their families. During his term, Blackburn pardoned over one thousand individuals, earning him the nickname [...] "Lenient Luke". The pardons were extremely unpopular with {{both the public and}} the Democratic political establishment. Several newspapers claimed that Blackburn sold pardons for <b>two</b> <b>dollars</b> apiece, though no evidence exists to support such an accusation.|$|E

By the end of the Press's 1946 fiscal year it had printed 103,000 copies. Smyth held the copyright to the work to prevent others from claiming it, but he permitted widespread reproduction, essentially releasing it into the public domain.

500|$|In {{order to}} fulfill {{one of its}} primary {{purposes}} of establishing a library for its members, the Romney Literary Society gradually began to acquire volumes for such a use. The society's library began with the April 23, 1819 appropriation {{for the purchase of}} two books: Plutarch's Parallel Lives and Emer de Vattel's The Law of Nations. On July 2, 1819, the balance of available funds in the treasurer's account was <b>two</b> <b>dollars</b> and forty-six cents, but by October 23, there were sufficient funds to purchase the following volumes: Charles Rollin's Ancient History, Lewis' Roman History, and William Robertson's History of the Reign of Charles the Fifth.|$|E
500|$|The comic's story also {{received}} positive reactions. Following the Nerds Bowling called it [...] "extremely well-written", commending {{its ability to}} attract readers and make them empathize with the characters. Paltridge of PopGeeks declared the story [...] "even better" [...] than Druckmann's work on The Last of Us (2013). Ellner of The Pullbox praised the story, noting a particular connection with the character of Johnny early in the story. Lopez of Fanboy Comics found that the [...] "character complexity is a bit lacking", but felt that the pacing {{of the story is}} helpful in understanding plot points. Doreen Sheridan, writing for I Want My <b>Two</b> <b>Dollars!,</b> felt that the [...] "dialogue is a little clunky, but it's a satisfying read nonetheless". ComicBuzzs Murray criticized the short length of the story, commenting on the lack of time dedicated to providing depth for the characters or plot.|$|E
500|$|Fodor's called The Dime Store [...] "bright and hip", {{offering}} [...] "office {{workers and}} hotel guests a much-appreciated source of seasonally driven, well-prepared comfort fare".

That same month, Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson included the diner in his list of the [...] "11 Best New Restaurants in Portland", writing: Billing itself as a [...] "finer diner", this old-school space feels {{a bit like the}} diner in Twin Peaks. There's a magazine and candy counter in one corner that no one seems to touch; just quick enough service that once you start questioning whether or not you'll get another cup of coffee, one arrives; plus a menu full of classics. All-in-all it's one of the only places you can go in Downtown and feel like you're transported somewhere else entirely.|$|E
