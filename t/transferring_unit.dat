40|$|Academics {{acknowledge}} {{that students are}} often unable to link and extend first year, first semester foundation material throughout their undergraduate degree. The use of a pedagogically sound interactive digital game-based learning (DGBL) resource to engage first year biological science students in recalling, linking and applying foundation knowledge and increasing their learning outcomes has been explored. According to the current literature there exists no evidence that DGBL resources have previously been used to address this transfer and linking of knowledge and core skills. Results from our study of student perceptions and student learning outcomes suggest that our creatively designed resource has effectively targeted a mixed cohort of students to retain, link and extend foundation knowledge. Our study also indicates that DGBL resources have a valid role in enabling students, {{many of whom are}} classed as “digital natives”, to demonstrate positive learning outcomes by successfully recalling and <b>transferring</b> <b>unit</b> content into new learning domains...|$|E
40|$|Lung {{fibrosis}} is {{a process}} in which collagen is laid down and the delicate capillary-alveolar relationship is disturbed. The architectural changes which occur in the capillaries, a main element of the oxygen <b>transferring</b> <b>unit,</b> are difficult to illustrate without a three-dimensional tool, such as scanning electron microscopy. Therefore, a scanning electron microscopic study was undertaken to show the capillary changes of lung fibrosis. Fibrosis was induced in rats by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. After 30 days the rats were sacrificed, and the vascular tree of the lung was cast with methacrylate. The fibrosis was patchy. The intercapillary space became wider; and some capillaries had large, irregular dilatations. Occasionally giant capillaries (up to 19 mu in diameter) were noted. The pleural and alveolar capillary diameters increased (P less than 0. 01), and the branching frequency decreased (P = 0. 02). The center of the capillary rings, which has been suggested to be the site of contractile interstitial cells, increased in size (P = 0. 03). The appearance of irregularly shaped capillaries and an increase in diameter without a change in density of alveolar capillaries, resulting in a loss of surface area and a decrease in branching, are the main scanning electron microscopic findings of the remodeling which occurs in pulmonary capillaries in lung fibrosis. These changes may partially explain the functional derangement of this disease...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Justification of optimum heat {{treatment}} of ball <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> body {{was developed and}} patented by "Victoria Ltd. " (Ukraine). These modes of {{heat treatment}} had to assure the maximum carrying capacity of ball <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> {{and its ability to}} withstand the load impact with given impact energy. Also the state of unit operability was investigated subject to applied static loading. Design/methodology/approach. The special experimental equipment was designed and manufactured for research. It allowed to simulate the real working conditions of ball <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> during the experiments. Entire test cycle was divided into three phases. Initially the units were subjected to impact loading with falling weight under increasing impact energy up to destruction of a body. The influence of steel body hardness on unit dynamic strength was estimated. Then samples of ball <b>transfer</b> <b>units</b> were loaded with static forces applied to central ball. Maximum failure load was determined and real safety factors were calculated subject to body hardness. Also unit operability at maximum load was investigated. It was estimated by possibility of full twisting central ball in the unit body. Findings. Optimum regimes of hardening of the body and the actual ultimate load safety factor at the normal loading of the unit were defined. Originality. New results on structural strength of ball <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> with steel punching body were obtained. ???????????? ?????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ??????????????? ????????? ? ????????????????? ???? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???

A material <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> allows for constant material feed to the paver without contact, providing a better end surface. When a dump truck is used to fill the hopper of the paver, it can make contact with the paver or cause it to change speed and affect the screed height.|$|R

40|$|The {{height of}} an overall <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> has been {{evaluated}} in a gas—solid packed column at trickle flow by measuring column performance during steady state adsorption experiments. Results have been interpreted with an extraction model: mass transfer and axial dispersion in both phases. Using Bodenstein numbers for the gas and solid phases from a previous investigation {{the height of a}} true <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> has been calculated. The column was filled with dumped Pall rings, the solid phase was a freely flowing catalyst carrier, and the gas phase was air at ambient conditions containing freon- 12 as adsorbing component. At low gas velocities column performance is entirely determined by axial dispersion but at higher gas velocities mass transfer limitations become important. For conditions of practical importance the height of a true <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> corresponds to 4 – 9 Pall ring layers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new type}} of packing {{apparatus}} with high efficiency and uniform flow was developed to deal with wall effect and scaling effect of packed column. A desorption experiment was made in a circular cold-model experiment packed column by using air-water-CO 2 as working substance, determining the height of mass <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> of liquid phase of the cold-model experiment packed column under different gas-liquid loads, with and without the packing apparatus. The experimental results show that under different spray densities, the height of mass <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> of liquid phase of the packed column added with the packing apparatus decreased approximately above 19 % more than that not added the packing apparatus; the height of mass <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> of liquid phase lowers more with the decrease of the spray density, which demonstrated that the mass transfer efficiency of the packed column added with the packing apparatus was much higher than that of the column not added the packing apparatus...|$|R
