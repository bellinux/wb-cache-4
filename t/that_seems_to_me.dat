60|$|ELLIE [naively]. Do {{you never}} read Shakespeare, Hesione? <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so extraordinary. I like Othello.|$|E
60|$|Then {{you would}} only have them on one level and one line?--In general; <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the {{common-sense}} principle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Entirely so. <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the {{greatest}} difficulty before us. So few men {{are willing to}} deal with the question with perfect sincerity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth," [...] Maraton replied calmly, [...] "I {{did not see the}} faintest reason why I should shorten my visit to Mr. Foley. We had {{arranged}} to meet here to-day and <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be quite sufficient." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{opened the}} envelope, which was {{addressed}} in a bold, round hand <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> typical of the writer, and read as follows: ...|$|R
60|$|Well, <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> put {{the lid on}} it. I didn't mind a heart-to-heart talk, {{but this}} was mere abuse. I changed the subject.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't, I can't! I don't {{understand}} how you can wish me to marry Mary Clibborn when I don't love her. <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> dishonourable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my lads," [...] he said, with {{a kindly}} smile as they entered, [...] "you find me meditatin' over a verse <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> full o' suggestive thoughts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will manage}} it somehow, Terence. I {{have no fear}} of you getting me through the country. It is {{getting out of the}} country <b>that</b> <b>seems,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the difficulty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought Lady Jane {{nervous and}} excited this morning," [...] said Mr. Mercer: [...] "but <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be chiefly about the Colonel's return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{the more}} I've thought the deeper I've sunk! And <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{the case with}} you this morning," [...] I added, [...] "the more you thought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought it. And when I {{gave it to}} you, I {{said some}} words <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> well spoken at the time. What were they? I cannot remember. Have you also forgotten?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “The {{only kind}} that count. It tells {{you with a}} {{perfection}} <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> quite final all the author thinks, for instance, about {{the advent of the}} ‘larger latitude.’” ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{looked at}} him askance. [...] "Why, <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> his only fault--that one can't pity him a little. He appears to have everything, to know everything, to be everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a brilliantly {{daring and}} {{delightful}} {{thing for her}} to say, and jolly of her to use my Christian name too! [...] "I believe I scratched," [...] she adds.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hadn't the nerve. You {{always seemed}} so--I don't {{know how to}} put it--I always seemed such a worm. I was just trying to get the courage to propose when I caught the mumps, and <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> finish it. No girl could love a man with three times the proper amount of face." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a {{very good}} idea, for there might be many chances against our {{slipping}} away after the British had landed, and I urged that the change of base be made without delay.|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> such obvious {{good sense}} that I {{wondered}} to myself the police hadn't thought long since of it; but I supposed {{they had some}} good ground of their own for holding it all this time in their own possession.|$|R
6000|$|... "You an't surely in earnest!" [...] exclaimed Opportunity, {{flushing}} up {{with surprise}} and pleasure. [...] "Why, {{you told me}} the price was four dollars, and even <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> desperate little!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Spenser's mind always demands {{this large}} elbow-room. His {{thoughts}} are never pithily expressed, {{but with a}} stately and sonorous proclamation, as if under the open sky, <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> very noble. For example,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> wisest. In fact, {{there is}} nothing else for you to do, and surely you are {{comfortable}} here as any four so-called rebels {{to be found in the}} colony could be." ...|$|E
60|$|At first, Toby, with {{a degree}} of fastidiousness <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ill-timed, was for picking out the minute {{particles}} of tobacco with which the spongy mass was mixed; but against this proceeding I protested, as by such an operation we must have greatly diminished its quantity.|$|R
60|$|I refuse <b>to</b> answer <b>that.</b> It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{excessively}} impertinent.|$|R
60|$|Instead of {{trembling}} {{or looking}} pale, as I {{might have expected}} to see her, Waboose looked {{at me in the}} most composed manner, and with something on her lip <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like a smile of amusement. In some confusion, I thanked her for having saved my life.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Philip,' it is soon done, {{and thank}} you for letting me do it. But, Amy, I would not alter your choice; yet there is one <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> more {{applicable}} [...] "Greater love hath no man--"' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Feeling {{that very}} strongly,' {{continued}} Caldigate, merely {{shaking his head}} in token of displeasure at Bollum's interruption, 'I have determined to repay Mr. Crinkett an amount <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be fair. He shall have back twenty thousand pounds.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it was terrible! And she didn't say {{a single}} word in praise of what the soldier had done for her. Now <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> downright ungrateful, {{and not at all}} what I should have thought of Miss Armstrong." ...|$|E
30|$|An {{understanding}} of the nature of psychological, and neuroscientific, explanations may help clarify the difference between psychology and neuroscience. As an editor, I have repeatedly had to deal with papers <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> provide explanations that should not count as psychological, or even scientific. These cases forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think about what would count. I have come to think that psychological explanations follow certain templates (schemata), basic forms with details to be filled in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Maude, [...] "they're {{not very}} original. I don't say they're not good, in away, but they lack a certain imagination. It's {{difficult}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> express what I mean, 'machine made' isn't precisely the idea, but {{there should be}} a certain irregularity in art--shouldn't there? I saw a reproduction in one of the architectural journals of a house in Boston by a man named Frey, <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have great charm." ...|$|R
60|$|Don ceased barking. How strange <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> We were {{no longer}} man and hound, but companions, brothers, each one relying on the other. A {{protruding}} corner shut us from sight of what was beyond. Don slipped around. I had to go sidewise and shuddered as my fingers bit into the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} call you madama," [...] he {{announced}} as the result of his labours. [...] "That is what the Mexicans will call you--they're nearly all Mexicans on the ranch, you know. <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about the proper thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|MAYOR. I see. A--a {{domestic}} disagreement. Very well, {{that charge}} is withdrawn. You {{do not appear}} to have been hurt, and <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> quite proper. Now, tell me what you know of the assault on the constable. Is his account correct? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{a little}} after that Dulphemia and Charlie Mostyn and I were walking to Mrs. Buncomhearst's musical, and we'd only just started along the street, when she stopped and sent me back for her music--me, mind you, not Charlie. <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> awfully significant." ...|$|E
60|$|I seized it. He {{instantly}} stooped down, grasped Okandaga {{round the}} waist, and without stopping, swung her, with an exertion of strength <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> incredible, into his arms. We gained {{the mouth of}} the cavern; Jack dropped Okandaga, who immediately ran in, {{while the rest of us}} stopped abruptly and faced about.|$|R
60|$|Carefully I picked my {{way between}} {{and over the}} {{soldiers}} until I had gained the rack {{at the far side}} of the room. Here I turned to survey the sleeping men. All were quiet. Their regular breathing rose and fell in a soothing rhythm <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the sweetest music I ever had heard.|$|R
60|$|I {{replied with}} sincerity <b>that</b> there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> much truth {{in what he}} said.|$|R
