5|$|This {{version of}} the story appears in Virgil's Aeneid, in a passage {{describing}} a series of paintings decorating <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> temple of Juno. The painting immediately next to the one depicting Troilus shows the death of Rhesus, another character killed because of prophecies linked to the fall of Troy. Other pictures are similarly calamitous.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez {{was doing}} {{geologic}} research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gorge whose limestone layers included strata both {{above and below}} the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary is a thin layer of clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and much else became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{relations}} between Egypt {{and its neighbors}} were peaceful during Djedkare's reign. In particular, {{one of the earliest}} known depictions of a battle or city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the 21st nome of Upper Egypt, who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty. The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> near eastern fortress on ladders. More generally, ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in Canaan during the later Old Kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there.|$|E

5|$|Menkauhor is attested {{by three}} hieroglyphic sources, {{all from the}} much later New Kingdom period. His name is given on the 31st entry of the Abydos King List, which was inscribed on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> temple {{during the reign of}} Seti I (1290–1279 BC). He is also {{mentioned}} on the Saqqara Tablet (30th entry) and on the Turin canon (third column, 23rd row), both of which were written during the reign of Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC). The Turin canon credits Menkauhor with a reign of eight years. These sources indicate that Menkauhor succeeded Nyuserre Ini and preceded Djedkare Isesi on the throne, making him the seventh pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} any liquid is an {{interface}} between that liquid {{and some other}} medium. The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the liquid and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> container. And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.|$|E

25|$|Kinetic theory {{explains}} macroscopic {{properties of}} gases, such as pressure, temperature, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and volume, by considering their molecular composition and motion.

25|$|Options for {{non-combustible}} construction include floors, {{ceilings and}} roofs made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete. For walls, concrete masonry technology and Insulating Concrete Forms (ICFs) are additional options. ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are stacked {{to form the}} shape of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.|$|E
25|$|The Naneghat {{inscription}} of Nayanika, {{recorded on}} <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Buddhist monastic cave, mentions {{that her husband}} Satakarni I performed several Vedic sacrifices, including ashvamedha (horse sacrifice), rajasuya (royal consecration), and agnyadheya (fire ceremony). The inscription also records subsantial fees paid to Brahmin priests and attendees for these sacrifices. For example, 10,001 cows were granted for the Bhagala-Dasaratra sacrifice; and 24,400 coins were granted for another sacrifice, whose name is not clear.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, V.V. Radlov {{published}} {{a collection of}} drawings of deer stones in Mongolia. Radlov's drawings showed the highly stylized images of deer on the stones, {{as well as the}} settings in which they were placed. Radlov showed that in some instances the stones were set in patterns suggesting <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grave, and in other instances, the deer stones were set in elaborate circular patterns, suggesting use in rituals of unknown significance.|$|E

25|$|By the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), the {{socioeconomic}} class of farmers grew {{more and more}} indistinct from another social class in the four occupations: the artisan. Artisans began working on farms in peak periods and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth. The distinction between what was town and country was blurred in Ming China, since suburban areas with farms were located just outside {{and in some cases}} within <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city.|$|E
25|$|By {{varying the}} {{apparatus}} and catalyst loading, Shirakawa and coworkers {{were able to}} synthesize polyacetylene as thin films, rather than insoluble black powders. They obtained these films by coating <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reaction flask under inert conditions with a solution of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst and adding gaseous acetylene, resulting in immediate formation of a film. Enkelmann and coworkers further improved polyacetylene synthesis by changing the catalyst to a CoNO3/NaBH4 system, which was stable to both oxygen and water.|$|E
25|$|Television {{presenter}} Noel Edmonds {{often used}} hidden cameras to record celebrities in Candid Camera-like situations for his television programme, Noel's House Party.

The cameras recorded footage of Geller from angles {{he was not}} expecting, and they showed Geller grasping a spoon firmly with both hands as he stood up to display a bend in it.|$|E

25|$|Second-generation fuels require either higher {{confinement}} temperatures {{or longer}} confinement time than those required of first-generation fusion fuels, but generate fewer neutrons. Neutrons are an unwanted byproduct of fusion reactions in an energy generation context, {{because they are}} absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fusion chamber, making them radioactive. They cannot be confined by magnetic fields, {{because they are not}} electrically charged. This group consists of deuterium and helium-3. The products are all charged particles, but there may be significant side reactions leading to the production of neutrons.|$|E
25|$|Lewis is a gold prospector, who hasn't {{had much}} luck. After trading his land claim, with Fergus for a pocket knife, {{he now has}} nothing and spends his time {{painting}} his life story on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sea cave. Fergus still gripped with gold fever tries to reason with Lewis and realises that some things {{are more important than}} gold. In 1997 the children visit an art gallery, and see a painting by Lewis Bast, the same Lewis from 1867. The painting is of an unknown girl, but the children notice that the girl is Constance.|$|E
25|$|When Guinness is poured, the gas bubbles {{appear to}} travel {{downwards}} in the glass. The effect {{is attributed to}} drag; bubbles that touch <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> glass are slowed in their travel upwards. Bubbles in {{the centre of the}} glass are, however, free to rise to the surface, and thus form a rising column of bubbles. The rising bubbles create a current by the entrainment of the surrounding fluid. As beer rises in the centre, the beer near the outside of the glass falls. This downward flow pushes the bubbles near the glass towards the bottom. Although the effect occurs in any liquid, it is particularly noticeable in any dark nitrogen stout, as the drink combines dark-coloured liquid and light-coloured bubbles.|$|E
