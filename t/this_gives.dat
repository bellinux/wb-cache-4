5|$|The {{advantage}} of this re-statement is that one can exploit theorems from linear algebra on {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent, simultaneously perpendicular vectors. <b>This</b> <b>gives</b> another way to calculate the maximum number of solutions and extend the theorem to higher-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|When {{the actual}} {{reduction}} is 1.00 / 1.30, or about 0.770, the perceived reduction is about 0.877, or 1.00 / 1.14. <b>This</b> <b>gives</b> a maximum perceived increase of 14% between apogee and perigee moons {{of the same}} phase.|$|E
5|$|Committees {{have two}} types of members: full members and {{participating}} members. In the case of standing committees, full members are the six outlined above. In addition, however, any Senator may arrange for the Senate to agree to their being made a participating member of the committee. <b>This</b> <b>gives</b> them {{the same rights as}} full members, with the important exception of being unable to vote on motions in private meetings of the committees.|$|E

5|$|Disney {{learns that}} Travers is {{actually}} her pen name, {{taken from her}} father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff, and she's actually Australian, not British. <b>This</b> <b>gives</b> Disney new insight into Travers, and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her door, Disney tells her that {{he also had a}} less-than-ideal childhood, but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges Travers to not let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. Travers relents and grants Disney the film rights.|$|E
5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds. USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds. <b>This</b> <b>gives</b> Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E
5|$|For {{some species}} of waders, {{migration}} success {{depends on the}} availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route. <b>This</b> <b>gives</b> the migrants an opportunity to refuel for the next leg of the voyage.

5|$|In Ong Ah Chuan and the {{subsequent}} decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor (1981), the Privy Council declined to set out a comprehensive list of fundamental rules of natural justice and merely stated some principles {{to deal with the}} issues at hand. At a 2000 conference, the Attorney-General Chan Sek Keong, who became Chief Justice in 2006, remarked that <b>this</b> <b>gives</b> the Court of Appeal a free hand to determine the scope of the fundamental rules of natural justice unencumbered by precedent.|$|E
5|$|Juno rotates in a {{prograde}} direction with an axial tilt {{of approximately}} 50°. The maximum temperature on the surface, directly facing the Sun, was measured at about 293 K on October 2, 2001.

5|$|Kraken Unleashed {{operates}} {{with three}} floorless trains. Each train seats 32 riders in eight rows of four. <b>This</b> <b>gives</b> the ride a theoretical hourly capacity of 1500 riders per hour. The open-air trains feature seats which leave riders' legs dangling above the track. Riders are restrained with over-the-shoulder restraints (OTSRs). As the trains are floorless, the station has a retractable floor for safe boarding.|$|E
5|$|One {{year after}} the death of the Joker during the events of , Batman is {{struggling}} {{to come to terms with}} the absence of his nemesis and the uncomfortable feeling that the pair shared a bond deeper than either could admit. Without the Joker's chaotic presence, Gotham's citizens have never felt safer, and crime in the city has dramatically declined. However, <b>this</b> <b>gives</b> Batman's enemies, including Penguin, Two-Face, and Harley Quinn, a chance to unite with the singular goal of killing Batman.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals such as}} many moths, mantises and grasshoppers, have a {{repertory}} {{of threatening}} or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots or patches of bright and contrasting colours, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator. <b>This</b> <b>gives</b> the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are a bluff, not an honest signal.|$|E

5|$|The Georgia Tech {{campus is}} located in Midtown, an area north of {{downtown}} Atlanta. Although a number of skyscrapers—most visibly the headquarters of AT, The Coca-Cola Company, and Bank of America—are visible from all points on campus, the campus itself has few buildings over four stories and {{has a great deal}} of greenery. <b>This</b> <b>gives</b> it a distinctly suburban atmosphere quite different from other Atlanta campuses such as that of Georgia State University.|$|E
