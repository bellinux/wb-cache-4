5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> {{of them on}} the couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
5|$|If a ball travels {{outside of}} the playing area, play is {{restarted}} by possession being awarded to the opponents of the team which last touched the ball, unless the ball goes out of bounds due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> or a deflected shot. In that case, possession is awarded to the player that is closest to the ball when it leaves the playing area.|$|E

5|$|On 7 November, Vale conceded {{twice in}} one game {{for the first time}} in the season, as Peel Park saw their Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2–2 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck in the mud and then Les Cocker scored the {{equalising}} goal after Ray King failed to hold on <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot.</b> By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6–0, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier.|$|E
5|$|The film opens <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of an {{abandoned}} office, where the main character (Pierre Jolivet), who is only identified as 'The Man' in the end credits, is having intercourse with a sex doll. The Man is then seen attempting to salvage parts from abandoned vehicles, but returns to his dwelling empty handed, where he works on building a makeshift aircraft. The Man ventures outside the office building he lives in, which {{is surrounded by a}} desert wasteland. A group of men are shown surviving in the wasteland. They hold a man, 'The Dwarf' (Maurice Lamy), captive, and force him to retrieve water for them. The Man, who has been observing the survivors, makes his way to their camp, stabs their leader, 'The Captain' (Fritz Wepper) and retrieves a car battery. Survivors pursue The Man, though he is able to escape in his now completed aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} two men street dancing in a white hall, with {{speakers}} and chairs scattered around. Shots of an audience lead to Roberts walking to a microphone positioned on a stage before she starts lip-synching, wearing a 1970s style outfit. After knocking over the microphone stand, Roberts performs a routine with three female back-up dancers in front of multiple speakers. During the chorus, she dances with the same three dancers, whilst shots of men watching them are shown. Roberts then leads the three women through the hall before they perform a dance section in {{the bridge of the}} track. Three men marching in a small white room are shown, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Roberts marching alongside a marching band of drummers. She is then shown in a multi-coloured sweater-dress, stood atop a speaker and surrounded by dancers. Final shots show Roberts producing shapes of letters L, O, V, and E with cheerleaders. The video ends with Roberts casually interacting with her dancers.|$|E

5|$|The video then cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of {{the band}} playing the game before {{returning}} to the map screen as 'Docks' or 'Stage 02' flashes. The second level begins {{in much the same way}} as the first with the two characters shooting zombies who appear from the right. The villain again stands in front of the players, laughing before disappearing. A boat/submarine then enters from the right and begins firing bombs at the players who destroy it with laser beams. Another cut scene follows in which the crippled boat returns to a hangar in the sea with 'Evil' written above the entrance. The hangar explodes and disappears before flying out of the water, now with mechanical claws attached, and the video returns again to live action footage of the Super Furries playing the game.|$|E
5|$|Queen's Park {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{early on in}} the second half, and a series of rapid attacks followed the break. The Scottish team were only prevented from scoring in one goal mouth scramble by the teamwork of Arthur and Suter. Rovers appeared to have switched to a defensive posture, and conceded a further corner kick, but nothing came of it as Gow kicked it behind the goal. A further handball just inside the Queen's Park half resulted in a solitary attack for Blackburn, ending in Brown sending the ball over the crossbar. Further attacks Queen's Park followed, but one further attack from Blackburn led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> from Brown which many in the crowd thought crossed the line before Gillespie cleared it. Blackburn dominated the final five minutes of the game, and the match ended 2–1; all three goals were scored in the first half. The medals and trophy had been expected to be awarded by Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, however due to his death on the day before the final, they were not presented publicly. Instead, Major Marindin handed them over in the dressing rooms.|$|E

25|$|In the 2003 American League Division Series, the Red Sox rallied from a 0–2 series deficit {{against the}} Oakland Athletics {{to win the}} best-of-five series. In extra innings of game three at Fenway pinch hitter Trot Nixion belted a homer into the center field bleachers to give the Sox victory. Derek Lowe, who had become a starter after several years as a relief pitcher, {{returned}} to his former role to save Game 5, a 4–3 victory, by striking out the A's Terrence Long with the tying run on third base. The team then faced the New York Yankees in the 2003 American League Championship Series. In the deciding seventh game Boston took a 4–0 lead on home runs by Nixon and Kevin Millar. But two Giambi homers made it 4–2. Boston led 5–2 thanks <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> by David Ortiz in the eighth inning, but Pedro Martínez, who was still pitching into the 8th inning, allowed three runs to tie the game, including a two-run bloop double by Jorge Posada. The Red Sox could not score off Mariano Rivera {{over the last three}} innings and eventually lost the game 6–5 when Yankee third baseman Aaron Boone hit a solo home run off Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield.|$|E
500|$|Before [...] "Sugar & Spice" [...] aired, CBS, fearing sponsor pullouts and viewer backlash, demanded {{revisions}} to the kissing scene. According to Kelley in a Los Angeles Times interview, the network initially suggested fading to black before the second more intimate kiss, then suggested cutting away before the kiss <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of one of Kimberly's brothers eavesdropping. Eventually, the network and Kelley settled on reshooting the kissing scene in darkness. In the episode as aired, a line of dialog is inserted over {{a shot of the}} exterior of the Brock house to explain why the room is suddenly dark.|$|E
500|$|Welles used an aural {{technique}} {{from radio}} called the [...] "lightning-mix". Welles used this technique to link complex montage sequences via {{a series of}} related sounds or phrases. For example, Kane grows from a child into {{a young man in}} just two shots. As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him a Merry Christmas, the sequence suddenly jumps <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene. The film's sound cost $16,996, but was originally budgeted at $7,288.|$|E

When it is decided that the Ring must be destroyed, Frodo offers to take the Ring to Mordor, and Elrond proclaims the {{formation}} of the Fellowship of the Ring. The elf was dubbed [...] "Figwit" [...] by Tolkien fan Iris Hadad; after seeing Frodo agree to take the ring, saying [...] "I will take it", the film switches <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> where Figwit can be seen standing on the far right, and Hadad's initial reaction was [...] "Frodo is grea...who is THAT?!?" [...] Later, Hadad corresponded with her university friend Sherry de Andres, and the two created the first Figwit fan website, www.figwitlives.net, calling him [...] "Legolas for the thinking woman".|$|E
500|$|The third chorus {{features}} similar footage to {{the first}} two—a singer walking down a set of stairs.

The video cuts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of a baby sitting between two nuclear missiles before a zoomed out model of the Earth shows multiple mushroom clouds as the planet explodes (this image was used as the front cover for Digipak CD version of the single).

500|$|One antisemitic {{theme that}} is {{introduced}} {{at the beginning}} of the film is the portrayal of Süß as the typical [...] "Jew in disguise", a concept which Welch describes as [...] "the inherent rootlessness of the Jew and his ability to assimilate himself into whichever society he chooses." [...] Süß is presented to the audience first in traditional ghetto attire and then a quick cutaway <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of him in elegant clothes riding in a carriage on his way to Stuttgart. Thus, Süß is shown to be hiding his true identity as a marginalized Jew and posing as a respected member of German society. However, despite Süß's attempts to fit into Württemberg high society, Harlan will not let the audience forget that he is ultimately depicted as a [...] "dirty Jew" [...] and underlines this point by juxtaposing him with the elderly Rabbi Löw. In an interview with Der Film, a German film magazine, Harlan explained: ...|$|E

[...] Gaga sits in the throne, giving birth to a [...] "new race within the race of humanity." [...] She explains that this was followed by the birth of evil, due to which Gaga splits into two opposing forces of good and evil. Her new half gives birth to a machine gun and fires it.

500|$|Allemand's boat {{crews were}} unable to {{influence}} the passage of Cochrane's flotilla as the sea was now too rough for them {{to operate in the}} channel, and the fireship crews consequently endured great difficulty returning to the British frigate line. The Aix Road was now a scene of [...] "sublime horror": [...] blazing fireships drifted randomly across the anchorage, some passing amid the great hulls of the French line. Shells from Aetna and thousands of rockets burst amid the confusion as the forts and all ships fired their guns at threats real and imagined; [...] "a scene [...] [...] [...] peculiarly awful and sublime." [...] The fireships reached the French frigate line at 21:45, as the frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated southeast down the channel. The blazing vessels then struck the French line; Régulus was hit, the crew desperately fending off the fireship for 15 minutes while the drifting ship of the line crashed into Tourville. Cassard was also badly hit, losing 20 men killed and wounded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> from a fireship, and several other French ships were badly damaged in the confusion.|$|E
