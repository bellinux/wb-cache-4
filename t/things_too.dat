25|$|By February 1920 Wilson's Staff {{wanted to}} reduce {{commitment}} to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), despite inevitable loss of prestige, as {{occupation of the}} whole country was not necessary to safeguard the southern Persian oilfields. In May 1920 Wilson submitted a joint paper with Churchill and Trenchard (Chief of Air Staff) complaining {{about the cost of}} keeping 10,000 British and 50,000 Indian troops there. When revolt broke out in Mesopotamia, Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull out of Persia to send reinforcements (he also needed troops for Ireland and the UK), but Lloyd George said that Curzon “would not stand it”. By October 1920 the local British commander Sir Aylmer Haldane managed to restore order but on 10 December Wilson minuted his agreement to an appraisal by the Director of Military Operations that “we ran <b>things</b> <b>too</b> fine and that a great disaster was only narrowly avoided”. Wilson was privately scathing about what he called “Hot Air, Aeroplanes & Arabs” – Trenchard's plan for Air Defence backed by Arab levies, announced by Churchill at the Cairo Conference in July 1921 – although glad at the reduction in military commitment, and wrote to Rawlinson that when trouble came Churchill would “hop into an aeroplane and fly away, waving Ta-Ta to any poor bloody native who is stupid enough to back us”.|$|E
25|$|Australian born Tony Smith {{took charge}} of England in 2008 and his first game was against France in Toulouse where his Lions won 56–8. In his second game England were missing St Helens and Leeds Rhinos players but the team still created history with a record 74–0 win over Wales in Doncaster. It was England's biggest win they {{recorded}} over Wales since 1978. Smith {{has been living in}} England since he first arrived to play for Workington in 1996 and he controversially became a neutralised British citizen on 8 September 2008 in Huddersfield. It was World Cup year and he announced his ambitions that he wanted England to win their first World Cup since 1972 when Great Britain represented the country at the event. In the event they were placed in Group A alongside hosts Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. England faced a scare in their opening game against Papua New Guinea as the Lions were trailing 16–12 at halftime but they did go on to win the game. They were humiliated in their second game against the hosts suffering their biggest defeat to date, beating their 43-point margin against New Zealand eight years ago. In their final pool game against New Zealand they produced a much better performance but for only 28 minutes as they gave up a 24–8 lead to lose 24–36. Before and during the match England were accusing New Zealand of being soft, however after the match media outlets were calling England the biggest losers of the tournament. Controversy also occurred before the game kicked off, when England refused to face New Zealand's haka challenge. Smith said 'In some cultures poking your tongue out at others could be seen as insulting and the Kiwis pushed <b>things</b> <b>too</b> far by crossing into England’s side of halfway.' They took on New Zealand again in the semi-final. This time they never had the lead over the Kiwis as they lost the match by 10 points. After rumours Smith would be sacked from his position, the RFL announced they'd keep faith in Smith for the remainder of his contract. The World Cup players took the blame for their performances.|$|E
500|$|Hawke's next {{role was}} in the Generation X drama Reality Bites (1994), in which he played Troy, a slacker who mocks the ambitions of his love {{interest}} (played by Winona Ryder). Film critic Roger Ebert called Hawke's performance convincing and noteworthy: [...] "Hawke captures all the right notes as the boorish Troy." [...] The New York Times noted, [...] "Mr. Hawke's subtle and strong performance {{makes it clear that}} Troy feels <b>things</b> <b>too</b> deeply to risk failure and admit he's feeling anything at all." [...] Nonetheless, the film was a box office disappointment.|$|E

[...] They also commented that the game [...] "treats its history with intelligence" [...] and [...] "its returning characters...just as clever". Further positive reaction came from RPGamer, with one staff reviewer summarizing X-2 as [...] "a light-hearted fun game" [...] that [...] "may ... be the most enjoyable thing {{to come from the}} series in several years", while another regarded its battle system as innovative and [...] "very simple to navigate".|$|E

I try not to get nervous – I don't like to think about <b>things</b> <b>too</b> much beforehand, otherwise I worry too much. I like to deal with the situation when it happens." [...] A beatboxer from Norfolk, Tom Povey, was picked to perform with her on stage after he was seen performing in a London pub. Povey, who performs with the stage name Intensi T, said it was the highlight of his career. Roberts also performed the song on British chat-shows Daybreak and Paul O'Grady Live.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, One by One won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, {{while one}} year earlier at the 45th Grammy Awards [...] "All My Life" [...] {{was chosen as}} Best Hard Rock Performance. While the band had a {{positive}} opinion about the record following release, as Grohl said the songs were [...] "the best we've ever written", he {{and the rest of}} the Foo Fighters eventually grew distasteful about the results. Grohl stated that he was frustrated at himself for rushing on the album: [...] "four of the songs were good, and the other seven I've never played again in my life." [...] Hawkins said that [...] "if you think about <b>things</b> <b>too</b> much, they kinda get sterile, as we found out there", and Shiflett declared that [...] "there are great songs , and then there are... parts of great songs".|$|E

500|$|According to twelfth-century monk Guibert of Nogent, William was [...] "powerful in words, {{but less}} so in action...a man who {{set out to}} do <b>things</b> <b>too</b> great for him." [...] William {{was a member of the}} French {{contingent}} which marched into Spain in 1087 to assist Alfonso VI of Castile with the siege of Tudela against the Almoravids. He may have been one of the leaders, along with Eudes I, Duke of Burgundy, who was the nephew of Alfonso's wife Constance. The French army never made it to Tudela and withdrew with little success. Guibert says that William [...] "retreated like a wretch, leaving countless men stranded by his flight." [...] William's actions in Spain may have been the inspiration for the character of Ganelon in the Chanson de Roland, which was possibly written in the early twelfth-century, based on similar events that had occurred during the reign of Charlemagne centuries earlier.|$|E
500|$|In November 1943, Kesselring {{met with}} Hitler. Kesselring gave an optimistic {{assessment}} {{of the situation in}} Italy and gave reassurances that he could hold the Allies south of Rome on the Winter Line. Kesselring further promised that he could prevent the Allies reaching the Northern Apennines for at least six months. As a result, on 6 November 1943, Hitler ordered Rommel and his Army Group B headquarters to move to France to take charge of the Atlantic Wall and prepare for the Allied attack that was expected there in the spring of 1944. On 21 November 1943, Kesselring resumed command of all German forces in Italy, combining Commander-in-Chief South, a joint command, with that of Army Group C, a ground command. [...] "I had always blamed Kesselring", Hitler later explained, [...] "for looking at <b>things</b> <b>too</b> optimistically ... events have proved Rommel wrong, and I have been justified in my decision to leave Field Marshal Kesselring there, whom I have seen as an incredible political idealist, but also as a military optimist, and it is my opinion that military leadership without optimism is not possible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} the What's Going On album, Gaye recorded {{a cover of}} the song, [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary, including Curtis Mayfield. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by The Temptations in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social {{events such as the}} 1965 Watts riots and once asked himself, [...] "with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?"

It transpires that immediately following the performance Arthur, remaining in character, made unspecified advances to a fellow actor in a male role, for which he received a bruise on his forehead, lost his role, and was expelled from the University. The narrator comments: [...] "He had carried <b>things</b> <b>too</b> far. Well, such are the risks run by the sincere, self-revealing artist."(294) Cope finds the social atmosphere has turned chilly, Randolph declines Cope's request for help in finding Arthur new employment, and Arthur returns to Winnebago before the term ends.|$|E
