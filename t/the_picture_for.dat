25|$|After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Diaghilev stayed abroad.

25|$|By their nature, these {{additive}} {{systems were}} very wasteful of light. Absorption {{by the color}} filters involved meant that only a minor fraction of the projection light actually reached the screen, resulting in an image that was dimmer than a typical black-and-white image. The larger the screen, the dimmer <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> <b>For</b> this and other case-by-case reasons, the use of additive processes for theatrical motion pictures had been almost completely abandoned by the early 1940s, though additive color methods are employed by all the color video and computer display systems in common use today.|$|E

25|$|Because the Mona Lisas poplar support expands and {{contracts}} {{with changes in}} humidity, the picture has experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>for</b> an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the Mona Lisa was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces. This flexible frame, which is used {{in addition to the}} decorative frame described below, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further. In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after {{it was found that the}} beechwood had been infested with insects. In 2004–05, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the play with the {{illusion}} of space in the painting {{can be seen in}} the young man at the top of the ladder holding the nails withdrawn from Christ's body. Campbell points out that this servant behind the cross appears to have caught his sleeve in the wooden tracery depicted at the top of the painting. The head of one of the bloody nails that he holds is in front of the fictional wooden picture frame, though the point of the other nail is behind the tracery. Campbell argues that, in order to prevent these spatial distortion from becoming too obvious, Rogier took pains to conceal the principal pictorial junctions in <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> <b>For</b> example, the ladder is in an impossible perspective: its top is behind the cross while its foot appears to be in front of the cross. To conceal the points at which the Cross and the ladder meet the landscape, Rogier has greatly lengthened the Virgin's left leg, so that her left foot and mantle cover the base of the Cross and one upright of the ladder.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>for</b> Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

In 1954, architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner wrote [...] "as one approaches Ely on foot or on a bicycle, or perhaps in an open car, the cathedral dominates <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>for</b> miles around… and offers from everywhere an outline different from that of any other English cathedral".

These also perfectly typify the Bourbon Street honky-tonks that Mr. Curtiz and his fine photographer, Russ Harlan, have beguilingly drenched with atmosphere.

500|$|Shooting {{began on}} January 2, 1935, with a {{projected}} budget of US$293,750 ($ as of [...] )– {{almost exactly the}} budget of the original– and an estimated 36-day shooting schedule. On the first day, Karloff waded in the water below the destroyed windmill wearing a rubber suit under his costume. Air got into the suit and expanded it like an [...] "obscene water lilly". Later that day, Karloff broke his hip, necessitating a stunt double. Clive had also broken his leg. Shooting was completed on March 7, 1935. The film was ten days over schedule because Whale shut down <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>for</b> ten days until Heggie became available to play the Hermit. With a final cost of $397,023 ($ as of [...] ), Bride was more than $100,000 ($ as of [...] ) over budget. As originally filmed, Henry died fleeing the exploding castle. Whale re-shot the ending to allow for their survival, although Clive is still visible on-screen in the collapsing laboratory. Whale completed his final cut, shortening the running time from about 90 to 75 minutes and re-shooting and re-editing the ending, only days before the film's scheduled premiere date.|$|E
500|$|Mark Robson was {{strongly}} considered {{and was in}} talks to direct, but after seeing The Omen, the producers hired Richard Donner.

[...] "They had prepared <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>for</b> a year and not one bit was useful to me." [...] Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in Tom Mankiewicz to perform a rewrite. According to Mankiewicz [...] "not a word from the Puzo script was used." [...] "It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, 'You can't shoot this screenplay because you'll be shooting for five years'," [...] Donner continued. [...] "That was literally a shooting script and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is plenty for a script, so even for two features, that was way too much." [...] Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a crest resembling a different letter, justifying the 'S' on Superman's costume. The Writers Guild of America refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a creative consultant credit, much to the annoyance of the Guild.|$|E

500|$|The one reel format {{was very}} {{restrictive}} {{in terms of}} allowing complex plots to be told while still being showing action in the production. The release of St. Elmo in March 22, 1910 was the first adaptation and second film to be released by the Thanhouser Company. The film was reviewed by critics to be too reliant {{on the use of}} inter-titles to tell the story. The company's adaptation of The Winter's Tale would require foreknowledge of the plot to understand the film, but some theaters employed aids to inform the audience of such productions By the adaptation of Uncle Tom's Cabin the coherency in the story was praised by critics, but this story was both popular and well-known subject. The Moving Picture World review provides specific insight to the Thanhouser adaptation's ability to convey the story to audiences: [...] "To those who have read Lena Rivers with pleasure the picture will be more than ordinarily entertaining. To those who have not read the story the film presents a narrative not without its interest in offering a quarter hour's diversion well worthwhile." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror would commend <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>for</b> its acting and also confirm the adaptations coherency, [...] "The well-known novel is adapted for a film story with considerable success in this picture.

2500|$|Humanity {{has lost}} meaning because the {{accepted}} criterion {{of reality and}} truth is ambiguous and subjective thought—that which cannot be proven with logic, historical research, or scientific analysis. Humans cannot think out choices in life, we must live them; and even those choices that we often think about become different once life itself enters into <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> <b>For</b> Kierkegaard, the type of objectivity that a scientist or historian might use misses the point—humans are not motivated and do not find meaning in life through pure objectivity. Instead, they find it through passion, desire, and moral and religious commitment. These phenomena are not objectively provable—nor do they come about through any form of analysis of the external world; they come about through a direct relationship between one and the external world. Here Kierkegaard's emphasis is on relationship rather than analysis. This relationship {{is a way of}} looking at one’s life that evades objective scrutiny.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{interpretations of}} the meaning of the picture have been offered: the {{conflict}} between youth and old age, time as the devourer of all things, the wrath of God and an allegory of the situation in Spain, where the fatherland consumed its own children in wars and revolution. There have been explanations rooted in Goya's relationships with his own son, Xavier, the only of his six children to survive to adulthood, or with his live-in housekeeper and possible mistress, Leocadia Weiss; the sex of the body being consumed can not be determined with certainty. If Goya made any notes on the picture, they have not survived; as he never intended <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>for</b> public exhibition, he probably had little interest in explaining its significance.

[...] Walter Pater's famous essay of 1869 described the sitter as [...] "older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in the deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her." [...] By the early 20thcentury some critics started to feel the painting had become a repository for subjective exegeses and theories, and upon the painting's theft in 1911, Renaissance historian Bernard Berenson admitted that it had [...] "simply become an incubus, and I was glad to be rid of her." ...|$|E
