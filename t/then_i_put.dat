500|$|The {{overall effect}} of Starr's {{drumming}} for the Beatles has received high praise from notable drummers. Starr commented: [...] "I'm no {{good on the}} technical things ... I'm your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I'm really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can't roll around the drums because of that." [...] Beatles producer George Martin stated: [...] "Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life", although Martin later added, [...] "He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier." [...] Starr commented: [...] "I've always believed that the drummer is not there to interpret the song"; comparing his drumming to painting, he stated: [...] "I am the foundation, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> a bit of glow here and there ... If there's a gap, I want to {{be good enough to}} fill it." ...|$|E
500|$|Wainwright {{attended}} McGill University in Montreal for a {{short time}} to study Classical music composition. With his mother's support, he began writing pop songs and learned how to play guitar. Wainwright started performing at the night club Sarajevo, and eventually recorded a demo tape with record producer Pierre Marchand, a family friend, who had worked with Kate and Anna and who later produced Wainwright's second studio album Poses. Songs were recorded at Marchand's studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec, and no edits were made to the simple live tunes. The tape impressed Wainwright's father, who passed the songs along to producer Van Dyke Parks, who in turn presented them to DreamWorks executive Lenny Waronker. Waronker had signed McGarrigle to Warner Bros. Records in the 1970s. Describing his initial reaction to Wainwright's music, Waronker stated: [...] "When I was about to listen to his tape, I remember clearly I was thinking, 'Gee, if he has the mom's musicality and smarts, and the dad's smarts and voice, that'd be nice.' <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it on and I said, 'Oh, my God, this is stunning. Wainwright acknowledged that having musicians as parents gave him a [...] "foot in the door", but attributed his success to hard work.|$|E

2500|$|Hoppus used three {{different}} bass guitars while recording Enema of the State: a Fender Precision Bass, Fender Jazz Bass and a Music Man StingRay. Hoppus primarily recorded {{with the two}} Fender basses, and merged the two together for the Fender Mark Hoppus Jazz Bass, which debuted in 2000. [...] "I took a Jazz Bass body because I thought it looked really cool and gives a good tone and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> a P-Bass neck on it because it's a wider neck and it's easier to play—especially for my style, which isn't so much finger work," [...] he said.|$|E

I looked again, and I could still see the same Lady. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> my hand into my pocket, and took my rosary.

2500|$|Many hip hop {{artists and}} rappers use scat singing {{to come up}} with the rhythms of their raps. Tajai of the group Souls of Mischief states the {{following}} in the book How to Rap: [...] "Sometimes my rhythms come from scatting. I usually make a scat kind of skeleton and then fill in the words. I make a skeleton of the flow first, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> words into it." [...] The group Lifesavas describe a similar process. Rapper Tech N9ne has been recorded demonstrating exactly how this method works, in an audio segment covered by The Washington Post. Gangsta rapper Eazy-E uses it extensively in his song [...] "Eazy Street".|$|E

2500|$|Through weekly {{shows at}} Cafe Sarajevo, Wainwright {{was on the}} Montreal club circuit and {{eventually}} cut a series of demo tapes produced by Pierre Marchand, who later produced Wainwright's album Poses. The resulting tapes impressed his father Loudon, who passed them on to his friend Van Dyke Parks. Parks sent the recordings to Lenny Waronker, the DreamWorks executive who eventually signed Wainwright to his label. Waronker stated the following of Wainwright: [...] "When I was about {{to listen to his}} tape, I remember clearly I was thinking, 'Gee, if he has the mom's musicality and smarts, and the dad's smarts and voice, that'd be nice.' <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it on and I said, 'Oh, my God, this is stunning.'" ...|$|E
