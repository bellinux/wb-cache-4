With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing {{completion}} in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be [...] "very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> no artistic merits in it." [...] He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that [...] "I shan't be at all surprised and offended {{if you find that}} it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts." [...] Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, [...] "the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best." ...|$|E

Everyone has their {{memories}} back, and we’re right at the point the season started. So, presumably, we won’t be getting any more flashbacks. Rather, the story will move forward, hopefully, and show us just how the Darkness and the Light will clash. Knowing Once Upon a Time, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> some sort of compromise, but I think it’d be bold if the show snuffed out one or the other, just to show us what a world without Light, or a world without plot-driving evil, looks like." ...|$|E

Nazi Germany had conquered much of Europe and in 1941 was still bombing Britain.

The lyrics refer to the RAF and RCAF fighter pilots (in their blue uniforms) as [...] "bluebirds" [...] and expresses confidence that they would prevail. [...] Notable phrases include [...] "Thumbs Up!" [...] which was an RAF and RCAF term for permission to go, and [...] "flying in those angry skies" [...] where the air war <b>was</b> taking place. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> never <b>be</b> wild bluebirds over the White Cliffs of Dover as the bluebird is not indigenous to Europe and is non-migratory.|$|R
