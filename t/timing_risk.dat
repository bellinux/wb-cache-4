Under the discounted expected utility (DEU) model, such evaluations depend only on intertemporal preferences. We obtain several testable hypotheses using the DEU model as a benchmark and test these hypotheses in three experiments. In general, our {{results show that}} the DEU model is a poor predictor of intertemporal choice behavior under <b>timing</b> <b>risk.</b> We found that individuals are averse to <b>timing</b> <b>risk</b> and that they evaluate timing lotteries in a rank-dependent fashion.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{mathematical}} contribution on the semi-static hedge of <b>timing</b> <b>risk</b> associated to positions in American-style options under a multi-dimensional market model. Barrier options are considered in the paper and semi-static hedges are studied and discussed for a fairly large class of underlying price dynamics. <b>Timing</b> <b>risk</b> is identified with the uncertainty associated to the time at which the payoff payment of the barrier option is due. Starting from the work by Carr and Picron (1999), where the authors show that the <b>timing</b> <b>risk</b> can be hedged via static positions in plain vanilla options, the present paper extends the static hedge formula proposed in Carr and Picron (1999) by giving sufficient conditions to decompose a generalized <b>timing</b> <b>risk</b> into an integral of knock-in options in a multi-dimensional market model. A dedicated study of the semi-static hedge is then conducted by defining the corresponding strategy based on positions in barrier options. The proposed methodology allows to construct not only first order hedges but also higher order semi-static hedges, that can be interpreted as asymptotic expansions of the hedging error. The convergence of these higher order semi-static hedges to an exact hedge is shown. An illustration of the main theoretical results is provided for i) a symmetric case, ii) a one dimensional case, where the first order and second order hedging errors are derived in analytic closed form. The materiality of the hedging benefit gain of going from order one to order two by re-iterating the <b>timing</b> <b>risk</b> hedging strategy is discussed through numerical evidences by showing that order two can bring to more than 90 % reduction of the hedging 'cost' w. r. t. order one (depending on the specific barrier option characteristics) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of Akahori-Barsotti-Imamura (2017) and where the authors i) showed that a payment at a random time, which we call <b>timing</b> <b>risk,</b> is decomposed into an integral of static positions of knock-in type barrier options, ii) proposed an iteration of static hedge of a <b>timing</b> <b>risk</b> by regarding the hedging error by a static hedge strategy of Bowie-Carr type with respect to a barrier option as a <b>timing</b> <b>risk,</b> and iii) showed that the error converges to zero by infinitely many times of iteration under a condition on the integrability of a relevant function. Even though many diffusion models including generic 1 -dimensional ones satisfy the required condition, a construction of the iterated static hedge that is applicable to any uniformly elliptic diffusions is postponed to the present paper because of its mathematical difficulty. We solve the problem in this paper by relying on the symmetrization, a technique first introduced in Imamura-Ishigaki-Okumura (2014) and generalized in Akahori-Imamura (2014), and also work on parametrix, a classical technique from perturbation theory to construct a fundamental solution of a partial differential equation.

40|$|Optimal trade {{execution}} aims at {{balancing price}} impact and <b>timing</b> <b>risk.</b> With {{respect to the}} mathematical formulation of the optimization problem, we primarily focus on Mean Variance (MV) optimization, {{in which the two}} conflicting objectives are maximizing expected revenue (the flip side of trading impact) and minimizing variance of revenue (a measure of <b>timing</b> <b>risk).</b> We also consider the use of expected quadratic variation of the portfolio value process as an alternative measure of <b>timing</b> <b>risk,</b> which leads to Mean Quadratic Variation (MQV) optimization. We demonstrate that MV-optimal strategies are quite different from MQV-optimal strategies in many aspects. These differences are {{in stark contrast to the}} common belief that MQV-optimal strategies are similar to, or even the same as, MV-optimal strategies. These differences should be of interest to practitioners since we prove that the classic Almgren-Chriss strategies (industry standard) are MQV-optimal, in contrary to the common belief that they are MV-optimal. From a computational point of view, we extend theoretical results in the literature to prove that the mean variance efficient frontier computed using our method is indeed the complete Pareto-efficient frontier. First, we generalize the result in Li (2000) on the embedding technique and develop a post-processing algorithm that guarantees Pareto-optimality of numerically computed efficient frontier. Second, we extend the convergence result in Barles (1990) to viscosity solution of a system of nonlinear Hamilton Jacobi Bellman partial differential equations (HJB PDEs). On the numerical aspect, we combine the techniques of similarity reduction, non-standard interpolation, and careful grid construction to significantly improve the efficiency of our numerical methods for solving nonlinear HJB PDEs...|$|E

40|$|First paragraph: Induction of labour {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} performed procedures in maternity care in developed countries, experienced by over 20 % of pregnant women (approximately 160, 000 women annually in the UK (UK National Statistics)). Current guidelines suggest that it should be used in situations where the risks to mother or baby of continuing pregnancy outweigh the risks of artificially bringing the pregnancy to an end (NICE, 2008). Where medical complications (for example, pregnancy hypertension, renal or liver disease or diabetes) are present the dangers are relatively clear and thus the balancing of risks is reasonably straightforward. However, around 50 % of labour inductions are performed in the absence of recognised medical complications ([Grivell et al., 2011] and [Stock et al., 2012]).

This paper addresses the problem of pricing and hedging a random cash-flow received at a random date in a general stochastic environment.

In that context, we provide an explicit characterization of the set of equivalent martingale measures, as well as a necessary and sufficient condition for a convenient separation between adjustment for market risk and <b>timing</b> <b>risk.</b> We also present price bounds consistent with perfect replication in the absence of arbitrage for an asset paying off a random amount at a random time.

40|$|AbstractÐSoftware risk {{management}} {{can be defined}} as an attempt to formalize risk oriented correlates of development success into a readily applicable set of principles and practices. By using a survey instrument we investigate this claim further. The investigation addresses the following questions: 1) What are the components of software development risk? 2) how does {{risk management}} mitigate risk components, and 3) what environmental factors if any influence them? Using principal component analysis we identify six software risk components: 1) scheduling and <b>timing</b> <b>risks,</b> 2) functionality risks, 3) subcontracting risks, 4) requirements management, 5) resource usage and performance risks, and 6) personnel management risks. By using one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons we examine how risk management (or the lack of it) and environmental factors (such as development methods, manager's experience) influence each risk component. The analysis shows that awareness of the importance of risk management and systematic practices to manage risks have an effect on scheduling risks, requirements management risks, and personnel management risks. Environmental contingencies were observed to affect all risk components. This suggests that software risks can be best managed by combining specific risk management considerations with a detailed understanding of the environmental context and with sound managerial practices, such as relying on experienced and well-educated project managers and launching correctly sized projects...|$|R

The betas or factor loadings generated by the structural model indicate that fluctuations in the risk factors have significant effects on the time variation of stock returns. However, the effects are more pronounced after the onset of the Asian financial crisis than before.
