40|$|This thesis {{examines}} public discourses concerning global warming. More specifically, {{it works}} {{to understand how}} the American media talks about environmentalism within the context of <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocols.</b> This study is rooted in Foucault’s notions of power and discourse and also looks to the theoretical tenets of critical rhetoric developed by McKerrow (1989) and McGee (1990) {{to understand how the}} American debate over the protocols might create problematic approaches to environmentalism. These understandings may result from troubling articulations of ideographic fragments, which operate as texts in a postmodern society. As <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocols</b> are set to expire, it is important to explore what influence <b>the</b> discourses surrounding <b>Kyoto</b> may have had. As the effects of humanity upon the environment become clearer, this study questions discourses that not only justify our impact, but may allow us to ignore it altogether. This thesis also contributes to the study of Environmental Communication. Consequently, this thesis examines discourses present in three popular American news magazines to observe how environmentalism is articulated in debates over <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocols</b> and climate change.

The NZEUR has {{the role}} of issuing, holding, {{transferring}} and retiring emission units in terms of <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol.</b> The initial use of the NZEUR was to record Kyoto emission units allocated to firms enrolled in the Ministry for the Environment’s Projects to Reduce Emissions and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements programmes, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s Permanent Forest Sink Initiative.|$|E

It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries.

The following month, opposition members on a special Commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the government's Clean Air Act.
