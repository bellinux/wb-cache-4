5|$|The tide of war turns {{against the}} Confederacy after the Battle of Gettysburg {{in which many}} of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another {{unsuccessful}} appeal to Ashley while he is visiting on Christmas furlough, although they do share a private and passionate kiss in <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> on Christmas Day, just before he returns to war.|$|E
5|$|The {{general layout}} of the home's {{interior}} has remained basically the same throughout the remodelings; the rooms on each floor are accessed via a large central hallway which ends in an elegant rotunda. However, {{some of the changes}} made in 1910 and 1911 did alter the interior appearance. <b>The</b> <b>parlor</b> was converted into the library and the library was converted into the dining room after an extension was added on. In the home's northwest corner a large kitchen was added, on the second-floor, the room above the kitchen became servant's quarters.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technological demo designed {{to show off}} the graphical capabilities of the GameCube. The full motion video footage had scenes seen in later trailers and commercials for the game, but were never used in the final release. This footage includes Luigi running from an unknown ghost in the Foyer, ghosts playing cards in <b>the</b> <b>Parlor,</b> ghosts circling around Luigi, and Luigi standing outside the mansion with lighting flashing. Soon after its creation, Nintendo decided to make the demo into a full-fledged video game. A year later, Luigi's Mansion was later shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the GameCube console. A newer version of the game, more closely related to the final version, was later revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001.|$|E

5000|$|Starting in 2007, Julep opened four nail <b>parlors</b> in <b>the</b> Seattle {{area that}} offer manicures, pedicures, facials, and waxing. CEO Jane Park saw {{a rise in}} {{popularity}} for nail care products, prompting her to focus on selling new products online and through television. While expanding <b>the</b> <b>parlors</b> as a [...] "third place" [...] for women was the initial business model, Park now says she uses <b>the</b> <b>parlors</b> as a testing ground for new products.|$|R
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Luigi having won a mansion in a contest. Despite not having entered any contest, he {{promptly}} told Mario about the mansion, {{and the two}} agreed to meet up outside it that evening. Luigi takes a flashlight {{with him and he}} follows the map to the mansion. Upon finally arriving at his new mansion, which looks much more sinister than the supplied photo, Mario is nowhere to be found. Luigi proceeds inside the mansion, entering <b>the</b> <b>Parlor</b> after he gains the key from a strange ghost-like shape. Upon entry, he is soon assaulted by a Gold Ghost, only to be saved by a little old man wielding a vacuum cleaner. The old man, however, is unable to reel in the ghost and is soon overpowered. After being helped to his feet by Luigi, the old man introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd. The two retreat from the mansion when more of the Gold Ghosts appear.|$|E
5|$|The 1828 {{construction}} {{features a}} central hall with three {{rooms on the}} east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail {{is believed to have been}} used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the front room as a public reception room and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the rooms from each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the main block follows the standard 18th-century center-hall plan, with the kitchen {{on one side and}} <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> on the other. The outlet is partitioned into five rooms, three connecting to the kitchen side of the house and two to <b>the</b> <b>parlor.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{house was}} used for social events. Visitors {{included}} many local and state dignitaries, including future President James A. Garfield. Rugs in <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> were often rolled up for dancing. Family activities {{took place in the}} library; Alphonso was an avid book collector.|$|E
25|$|It is Christmas Eve. Family {{and friends}} have {{gathered}} in <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> {{to decorate the}} beautiful Christmas tree {{in preparation for the}} party. Once the tree is finished, the children are sent for. They stand in awe of the tree sparkling with candles and decorations.|$|E
25|$|The porch columns are the {{original}} woodwork, tapered and turned; a simple balustrade connects them. Much {{of the interior}} is also original, including the oak staircase in the entrance hall and a marbleized mantelpiece in <b>the</b> <b>parlor.</b> The upper floor and attic are finished, and were used as bedrooms and servants' quarters originally.|$|E

50|$|Ninety years later, in the 1930s, another owner {{expanded}} the house, {{this time in}} the Colonial Revival style. The rear wing was added, new stonework was put in on the south and on the first floor a wall was removed to make a larger space of one of <b>the</b> <b>parlors.</b> <b>The</b> northeast <b>parlor</b> was also decorated in that style. The most visible Colonial Revival touch from that work is the front porch with its classically inspired columns and entablature.|$|R

25|$|The Spirit of Progress was {{launched}} on 17 November 1937 in {{a blaze of}} publicity, which included dramatic footage being taken of the new train racing Airco DH.4 aeroplane VH-UBZ Spirit of Melbourne on its demonstration run to Geelong. In an elaborate launch ceremony at Spencer Street station, Premier Albert Dunstan opened <b>the</b> <b>Parlor</b> Car with a gold key.|$|E
25|$|Life on a {{dairy farm}} {{revolves}} around the milking parlor. Each lactating cow will visit <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> {{at least twice a}} day to be milked An incredible amount of engineering has gone into designing milking parlors, and milking machines. Efficiency is crucial; every second saved while milking a single cow adds up to hours over the whole herd.|$|E
25|$|The three {{fireplaces}} on {{the first}} floor use a combination of Georgian, Spanish and Italian marbles as well as Brazilian onyx. The library featured cotton wall coverings, and <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> featured silk damask wall coverings imported from Paris. The grand staircase is made of oak, and was part of the 1888 expansion replacing an iron spiral staircase. A Tiffany chandelier hangs over the dining room table.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was not a}} {{relic of}} the past. The house was furbished and resplendent--it was gilded--it was frescoed--it was à la Pompadour, and à la Louis Quinze and Louis Quatorze, and à la every thing Frenchy and pretty, and gay and glistening. For, though <b>the</b> <b>parlors</b> at first were the only apartments {{contemplated}} in this renaissance, yet it came to pass that <b>the</b> <b>parlors,</b> when all tricked out, cast such invidious reflections on the chambers that the chambers felt themselves old and rubbishy, and prayed and stretched out hands of imploration to have something done for them! ...|$|R
50|$|Thereafter, sales {{dropped and}} most of <b>the</b> <b>parlors</b> were sold off in the 1980s. In 1982, Marriott sold the chain {{to a group of}} private investors. By 1990, almost all Farrell's {{locations}} had closed.|$|R
25|$|The {{small size}} is deceiving as the Parker House is spacious. The turret bays have walls {{that are more}} than half {{consisted}} of windows. The fireplace {{is set in the}} center of the house which allows it to heat and service two rooms, <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> and the dining room. The side elevations of the Parker House are symmetrical but adjacent buildings are built too close for the design to be seen clearly.|$|E
25|$|During the night, after {{everyone}} else has gone to bed, Clara returns to <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> {{to check on her}} beloved nutcracker. As she reaches the little bed, the clock strikes midnight and she looks up to see Drosselmeyer perched atop it. Suddenly, mice begin to fill the room and the Christmas tree begins to grow to dizzying heights. The nutcracker also grows to life size. Clara finds herself {{in the midst of a}} battle between an army of gingerbread soldiers and the mice, led by their king. They begin to eat the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} floor are located <b>the</b> <b>parlor,</b> the library, two dining rooms, and the kitchen. One of the dining rooms {{is located in the}} western wing, off of the hallway, and was used {{primarily}} used by the family for smaller meals like breakfast or tea. The kitchen is also in the wing, directly adjacent to the dining room. The other dining room, located in the front western side of the main house, was used only for formal dinners and as the sitting room where the men would converse after dinner. The fireplace in the room was enclosed in marble when Buchanan bought Wheatland and had a furnace installed. Across the hall, {{on the other side of}} the main house is <b>the</b> <b>parlor,</b> where the women guests would congregate after dinner. The library is located off the hallway in the east wing. The woodwork, doors, a bookcase, and a bookshelf built into the wall were grained to resemble oak. The shelves in the bookshelf no longer exist; but, the backboard of the bookshelf is visible, as is the plaster wall made to resemble wood. Two mahogany bookcases, flanking the fireplace in the library, were furnished by Jenkins and having been sold to each successive owner by the previous one. The library was primarily used by Buchanan as the place to meet with guests.|$|E
6000|$|They alighted at the [...] "Bells." [...] His lordship bespoke supper, invited Mr. Caryll to join them, and, {{what time}} {{the meal was}} preparing, went into a noisy doze in <b>the</b> <b>parlor's</b> best chair.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{main floor}} plan formed an asymmetrical cross with <b>parlors</b> dominating <b>the</b> {{front and center}} portions and dining room, study, and kitchens occupying the rear and west pavilions. <b>The</b> <b>parlors</b> were separated by massive sliding doors. Most essential features of the plan, {{as well as the}} sliding doors, decorative cove moulding in <b>the</b> <b>parlors,</b> and <b>the</b> staircase were retained in the 1920s remodeling. The iron gazebo and the fountain, which features a cast zinc sculpture depicting three children with a dolphin are original to the house, although they were relocated in the remodeling. The gazebo and the fountain sculpture may have been made at the Kohler foundry.|$|R
25|$|In rotary parlors, {{the cows}} are loaded {{one at a}} time onto the {{platform}} as it rotates. The milker stands near the entry to <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> and puts the cups on the cows as they move past. By the time the platform has completed almost a full rotation, another milker or a machine removes the cups and the cow steps backwards off the platform and then walks to its feed. Rotary cowsheds, as they are called in New Zealand, started in the 1980s but are expensive compared to Herringbone cowshed - the older New Zealand norm.|$|E
25|$|Hollybush was {{originally}} {{the home of}} the Whitney family, {{and it was the first}} of its kind in South Jersey. It set a certain precedent with its Italianate architectural style, and its interior decorations attest to this precedent. Two of these significantly unique features of the house are the trompe de l'oeil ceilings in <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> as well as the Summit Room, and the painted glass archway above and around the front door. The stone that was used in construction of Hollybush was New Jersey Ironstone, a sedimentary type stone that is found in the low hills and ridges of South Jersey.|$|E
25|$|A 600 gallon {{water tank}} was {{filled in the}} non-freezing months {{providing}} running water for bathing, cleaning and a bathroom. Another amenity that was unusual for the time period was master bedroom on the first floor. The original Quezal Art Glass Company brass chandelier remains in <b>the</b> <b>parlor</b> with its iridescent shades. A {{lot of the other}} original furnishings were sold by the family or future tenants so other period pieces were used. Tiny fragments of original wallpaper were found in most rooms during reconstruction and a Swedish company hand-made custom replica wallpaper. The three upstairs bedrooms contain donated historical items like the community's first sewing machine, a bed warmer, and a trunk.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Marianne and I {{come out}} entirely {{at the little}} end of the horn," [...] said Jenny, laughing; [...] "yet I wash the breakfast cups and dust <b>the</b> <b>parlors,</b> and have always fancied myself a notable housekeeper." ...|$|R
50|$|Inside many {{original}} finishings remain. The doors have {{white pine}} molded surrounds like their exterior counterparts, {{and one of}} <b>the</b> <b>parlors</b> has a fireplace mantel also of pine. Slate and marble are used for the other two fireplaces on the first story.|$|R
5000|$|Furness {{designed}} {{an addition}} to [...] "Lindenshade" [...] in 1877, possibly <b>the</b> <b>parlor's</b> expansion southward. <b>The</b> kitchen ell and cistern tower had been added by 1882. Later additions included the study (by 1890), the greenhouse (by 1894), and HHF's fireproof library ( [...] 1895).|$|R
