5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or at {{any time}} of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the <b>trigger</b> <b>event,</b> especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} conifers, {{the largest group}} of gymnosperms, are {{enclosed}} in a cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from the cone. Sometimes the seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a <b>trigger</b> <b>event</b> to liberate it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and also enriches the forest floor with wood ash and removes competing vegetation. Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.|$|E

Until now, no approach has been put forth that addresses valuations {{based upon the}} <b>triggering</b> <b>events,</b> which produce different values to different interests. The proposed conditional probability approach provides a totally transparent, objective fair market valuation of a specific noncontrolling interest when 1) <b>triggering</b> <b>events</b> do not occur, 2) a <b>triggering</b> <b>event</b> fails to provide a formula, or 3) the agreement fails to fully specify what the parties intend by fair market value. ...|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{analyze the}} source {{location}} {{and timing of}} seismic energy release for the <b>triggered</b> <b>event</b> by employing the back-projection method (Spudich and Cranswick 1984). In the waveform data, contaminations of coda waves from the mainshock into the onset of body waves from the <b>triggered</b> <b>event</b> are found at most stations, {{making it difficult to}} identify the onset. The back-projection method determines the event location and timing by evaluating coherent signals in stacked waveform and does not use the onset data. It is anticipated that the method may provide an alternative approach to estimating the source location and timing for such event data. We also reproduce observed waveforms of the <b>triggered</b> <b>event</b> by using waveforms of smaller-sized events as Green’s functions and infer the source mechanism of the <b>triggered</b> <b>event.</b> We verify the estimated source location and mechanism by calculating synthetic waveforms. These source data investigated in this study would contribute to quantitatively studying the causes of observed strong motions, seismic activity around the <b>triggered</b> <b>event,</b> and stress transfer from the mainshock to the <b>triggered</b> <b>event.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study {{was to develop a}} conceptual model {{through the use of a}} grounded theory approach, which explains how <b>trigger</b> <b>events</b> are related to leadership development. <b>Trigger</b> <b>events</b> are experience that cause developmental growth and may result in an increased ability to lead (Luthans and Avolio (2003). In this study, there were two phases of data collection. First participants completed the Washington University Sentence Completion Test (WUSCT), where their respective leadership developmental stage was measured. Second, participants were involved in two in-depth interviews where an understanding was reached as to how various <b>trigger</b> <b>events</b> have impacted their leadership development. From these data, a conceptual model was developed to explain the relationship between <b>trigger</b> <b>events</b> and leadership development. Participants described <b>trigger</b> <b>events</b> as being important developmental periods, during which time they grew as people and became more capable leaders...|$|R

25|$|With {{triggered}} sweeps, {{the scope}} will blank the beam {{and start to}} reset the sweep circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme {{right side of the}} screen. For a period of time, called holdoff, (extendable by a front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets completely and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The <b>trigger</b> <b>event</b> is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negative—trigger polarity).|$|E
25|$|In the smelt water {{explosion}} {{even a few}} {{liters of}} water, when mixed with molten smelt can violently turn to steam in few tenths of a second. Char bed and water can coexist as steam blanketing reduces heat transfer. Some <b>trigger</b> <b>event</b> destroys the balance and water is evaporated quickly through direct contact with smelt. This sudden evaporation causes increase of volume and a pressure wave of some 10 000 – 100 000 Pa. The force is usually sufficient to cause all furnace walls to bend out of shape. Safety of equipment and personnel requires an immediate shutdown of the recovery boiler {{if there is a}} possibility that water has entered the furnace. All recovery boilers have to be equipped with special automatic shutdown sequence.|$|E
40|$|Many {{instances}} of aggression result in excessive retaliation {{in response to}} a seemingly trivial <b>triggering</b> <b>event.</b> The <b>triggered</b> displaced aggression paradigm (TDA; Miller, Pedersen, Earleywine, & Pollock, 2003) provides an experimental vehicle for exploring such occurrences. Participants were either provoked or not and were subsequently exposed to a neutral, mild, or moderately strong <b>triggering</b> <b>event</b> from a second bogus participant. Consistent with TDA theory (Miller et al., 2003), disjunctively escalated aggressive behavior occurred only among previously provoked participants when responding to the mild <b>triggering</b> <b>event,</b> but not the moderately strong or neutral trigger. Independent of provocation, the neutral <b>triggering</b> <b>event</b> elicited very low levels of aggression, whereas the moderately strong trigger elicited moderate levels of aggression. Implications for {{instances of}} real world aggression are discussed...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} detect locally <b>triggered</b> <b>events,</b> {{we use a}} two-way Butterworth band-pass filter in the {{frequency}} range of 10 – 30  Hz. As we have experimented before (Shimojo et al. 2014), such a filtering ensures good detection of locally <b>triggered</b> remote <b>events,</b> while avoiding {{at least in part}} high-frequency noise. In many cases, the remote detections were confirmed by identifying the P- and S-wave arrival times of the <b>triggered</b> <b>events.</b>|$|R
500|$|A tsunami is {{an unusual}} form of wave caused by a sudden and {{powerful}} event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption, or a collapse of land into the sea. These events can temporarily lift or lower {{the surface of the}} sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water. Tsunamis, therefore, travel much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. Despite traveling at speeds of over , tsunamis in deep seas have wavelengths from [...] and an amplitude of less than three feet. Standard surface waves in the same region may only have wavelengths of a few hundred feet and speeds up to [...] but, when compared to their possible amplitudes of up to , tsunamis at this stage are often able to pass unnoticed. Tsunami warning systems rely on the fact that seismic waves caused by earthquakes travel around the world at around [...] per hour, allowing threatened regions to be alerted to the possibility of a tsunami. Measurements from a network of sea-level measuring stations make it possible to confirm or cancel a tsunami warning. A <b>trigger</b> <b>event</b> on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually but is spread out over the wave front. As the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will generally be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions and this affects the direction of the wave front. This effect, known as refraction, can focus the strength of an advancing tsunami on some areas while weakening it in others, according to the undersea topography along its path.|$|E

Finally, some plants release all of their seed spontaneously after a period of seed storage, but the occurrence of a <b>trigger</b> <b>event</b> curtails the seed storage period, causing all seed to be released immediately; such plants are essentially non-serotinous, or facultatively serotinous.|$|E

Using a longitudinal data set developed out of the Income Supplement to the Household Labour Force Survey, this research examines <b>trigger</b> <b>events</b> (like losing a job or losing an adult from the household) and responses to these triggers by families, as a means of considering child poverty dynamics in New Zealand. It compares New Zealand’s dynamic experiences with Britain and West Germany. The comparative approach provides information on whether it is differences in frequency of <b>trigger</b> <b>events</b> or in responses to <b>trigger</b> <b>events</b> across countries that drives cross-national differences in chances of children moving into or out of poverty.
