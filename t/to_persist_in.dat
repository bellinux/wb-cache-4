5|$|In early July2007, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather began <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> the South China Sea roughly 155mi (250km) {{southeast of}} Hainan. The Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 0000UTC on July3 after the storm had organized sufficiently, however, other tracking agencies did not indicate that tropical cyclogenesis had occurred at the time. However, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began to monitor the disturbance for potential signs of tropical cyclogenesis at 0100UTC later that day, At the time, the storm system was situated in an area of weak to moderate wind shear, exposing the disturbance's low-level circulation center. Despite the prevailing conditions and proximity to land, the storm continued to organize, and as such the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 0130UTC the following day.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species may}} be in risk of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which {{are very sensitive to}} habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} week of December, a westward-moving upper-level low led to the {{formation}} of a broad surface trough well to the east of the northern Lesser Antilles. With a strong ridge to its northeast, the trough tracked slowly westward, producing scattered convection and some cyclonic turning. On December 8 convection began <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> association with the trough and an upper-level low. Early on December 9, officials at the Tropical Prediction Center began classifying the system using the Hebert-Poteat technique, and several tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated its development of tropical characteristics. The system, which consisted of a sharp trough with an area of gale force winds to its north, continued westward through an area of moderately warm sea surface temperatures. On December 10 a low-level circulation developed within the system, though its convection had become disorganized and well-removed from the center. Southerly wind shear left the structure asymmetric, and convection steadily increased closer to the center. With an upper-level low situated just south of the center, the National Hurricane Center classified it as Subtropical Storm Olga at 0300UTC on December 11 while located about 55miles (85km) east of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E

40|$|Theories of {{how people}} {{construct}} linguistic form during production are largely based on English and closely related languages. We report three experiments that used a structural priming paradigm to investigate grammatical encoding in Mandarin Chinese, in particular the way conceptual information is mapped onto grammatical structure. The results show that, <b>in</b> addition <b>to</b> <b>persisting</b> <b>in</b> using the same syntactic form across utterances, speakers of Mandarin <b>persisted</b> <b>in</b> their mappings from conceptual elements to syntactic elements, including both grammatical functions and linear surface word order positions. The results thus argue against a two-stage model where conceptual representations are first mapped onto grammatical functions, which are then in turn mapped onto surface linear positions. Instead, the results support a one-stage model where the processor computes in a single stage a structure that specifies both the linear order and the grammatical functions of its constituents...|$|R

25|$|In {{people with}} predisposing lung diseases—such as {{persistent}} asthma or cystic fibrosis (or rarer {{diseases such as}} chronic granulomatous disease or Hyper-IgE syndrome)—several factors lead to {{an increased risk of}} ABPA.

However, he claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B.

30|$|The {{expectations}} for success and subjective task value are presumed to directly influence achievement-related tasks, performance, and persistence (Wigfield and Eccles 2000). When {{expectations for}} success {{and value of}} STEM fields and majors are high, the person {{is much more likely}} <b>to</b> seek, <b>persist</b> <b>in,</b> and graduate from STEM majors. The opposite is true when both factors are low. However, these factors are not always aligned. One can have low perceived value for STEM but high expectations for success, and vice versa. The interaction of these factors is expected to have differing effects on decisions <b>to</b> seek out, <b>persist</b> <b>in,</b> and graduate from STEM majors and is thus important to researchers seeking to understand the reasons some women do not choose STEM majors or choose to leave STEM majors.|$|R
25|$|Domesday Book {{records that}} the largest landowners in Surrey {{at the end of}} Edward's reign were Chertsey Abbey and Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex and later king, {{followed}} by the estates of King Edward himself. Apart from the abbey, most of whose lands were within the shire, Surrey was the not the principal focus of any major landowner's holdings, a tendency which was <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> later periods. Given the vast and widespread landed interests and the national and international preoccupations of the monarchy and the earldom of Wessex, the Abbot of Chertsey was therefore probably the most important figure in the local elite.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) are cancer cells (found within tumors or {{hematological}} cancers) that possess characteristics associated with normal stem cells, specifically {{the ability to}} give rise to all cell types found in a particular cancer sample. CSCs are therefore tumorigenic (tumor-forming), perhaps in contrast to other non-tumorigenic cancer cells. CSCs may generate tumors through the stem cell processes of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types. Such cells are hypothesized <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> tumors as a distinct population and cause relapse and metastasis by giving rise to new tumors. Therefore, development of specific therapies targeted at CSCs holds hope for improvement of survival {{and quality of life}} of cancer patients, especially for patients with metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|Alternations in Italian {{heteroclitic}} nouns such as l'uovo fresco ("the fresh egg") / le uova fresche ("the fresh eggs") {{are usually}} analysed as masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, with an irregular plural in -a. However, {{it is also}} consistent with their historical development to say that uovo is simply a regular neuter noun (ovum, plural ova) and that the characteristic ending for words agreeing with these nouns is -o in the singular and -a in the plural. The same alternation in gender exists in certain Romanian nouns, but is considered regular as it is more common than in Italian. Thus, a relict neuter gender can arguably be said <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> <b>in</b> Italian and Romanian.|$|E
