50|$|The {{principle}} of any power reserve device {{is that when}} the mainspring is wound either automatically or manually, a special <b>train</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> connected to the ratchet wheel or the barrel arbor drives the power reserve indication showing the extent of the wind. The barrel’s teeth are also connected {{to the other side of}} this differential train so that as the mainspring's power is used, the power reserve indication moves in the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|Where {{electrical}} power or rotating parts are not available, fans may be drive by other methods. High-pressure gases such as steam {{can be used}} to drive a small turbine, and high-pressure liquids {{can be used to}} drive a pelton wheel, which can provide the rotational drive for a fan. Large, slow-moving energy sources such as a flowing river can also power a fan using a water wheel and a <b>train</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> or pulleys.|$|E
50|$|According to Strabo, a water powered mill {{was built}} in Kaberia {{of the kingdom of}} Mithridates during the 1st century BC. Use of water wheels in mills spread {{throughout}} the Roman Empire over the next few centuries. Some were quite complex, with aqueducts, dams, and sluices to maintain and channel the water, along with systems <b>of</b> <b>gears,</b> or toothed-wheels made of wood and metal to regulate the speed of rotation. More sophisticated small devices, such as the Antikythera Mechanism used complex <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> and dials to act as calendars or predict astronomical events. In a poem by Ausonius in the 4th century AD, he mentions a stone-cutting saw powered by water. Hero of Alexandria is credited with many such wind and steam powered machines in the 1st century AD, including the Aeolipile and the vending machine, often these machines were associated with worship, such as animated altars and automated temple doors.|$|R
50|$|Another {{breakthrough}} by Bromley {{concerned a}} <b>train</b> <b>of</b> <b>gearing</b> {{which appeared to}} have 15 and 63 teeth, for which Price {{had been unable to}} discover a purpose. Price considered these numbers to be too difficult to work with, and assumed that they should be corrected to 16 and 64, theorising that it could have operated a four-year cycle on the device. Bromley worked with the original count of 15 and 63 teeth, discovering that the train's cycle was four and a half years; four of such cycles equalled 18 years, a duration equal to the cycle of eclipses. With this gearing, the mechanism worked correctly, with the pointer moving into a new square for each new moon, as the handle is turned, meaning that each square on a dial represented one month. Over 223 months, or 18 years, the complete cycle is shown.|$|R

50|$|Also, the {{traversing}} mandrel {{was introduced}} around 1700, and instantiated {{the design of}} a lathe mandrel able to slide axially in its bearings {{under the control of the}} operator, so that components having short lengths of thread could be produced, such as screws. The traversing mandrel was primarily employed by clockmakers and ornamental turners during this era. Eventually the device was superseded by a mandrel-driven device called a leadscrew, which uses a <b>train</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> that can be altered as required for the turning application.|$|E
5000|$|The weight drive used by Christiaan Huygens in {{his early}} clocks acts as a {{maintaining}} power. In this layout, the weight which drives the clock is carried on a pulley and the cord (or chain) supporting the weight is wrapped around another pulley which has spikes which allow the cord to turn the pulley without slipping. It is this pulley which turns the <b>train</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> in the clock movement. The cord is kept in engagement with this pulley by a small tensioning weight which is also carried on its own pulley. The cord is endless and is looped over a fourth pulley before {{going back to the}} drive weight. The fourth pulley also has spikes to stop the cord slipping and has a ratchet that only allows it to turn in one direction. As the drive weight descends and turns the clock, the tensioning weight rises. When the drive weight needs to be re-wound, either the fourth pulley is turned directly to lift the weight or the cord supporting the tensioning weight is pulled down and draws the fourth pulley round with it. [...] The principle was later applied by the French clockmaker Robert Robin who automated the re-winding in his remontoire. The drive- and tensioning-weights were made much smaller and drove the escape wheel directly. It was re-wound by the main train of the clock which turned the fourth pulley and was controlled by a lever attached to the tensioning weight. When this had risen to its upper limit, it started the re-winding process. As the drive weight rose, the tensioning weight fell and at the bottom of its travel it stopped the re-winding.|$|E
5000|$|Windhoff Motorradenbau GmbH built {{motorcycles}} in Berlin, Germany, from 1924-1933. The factory {{was located}} at Bülowstrasse 106, Berlin W57, {{under the direction}} of factory owner Hans Windhoff. Windhoff initially produced radiators for cars, trucks, and aircraft, setting up a factory with his brother Fritz in Rheine in 1902, then on his own in Berlin from 1907-24. In 1924 he entered the burgeoning German motorcycle market with a water-cooled two-stroke of 125cc. The engine was built under license from a design by Hugo Ruppe, whose ladepumpe (an extra piston used as a supercharger to compress the fuel/air mix) design was used most successfully by DKW in their Grand Prix racers. Windhoff had much racing success with these small two-strokes, although an experiment with enlarged two-stroke racers of 493cc and 517cc were less reliable. [...] In 1926, a totally new machine was designed; a dramatic and technically fascinating 746cc overhead camshaft, oil-cooled 4-cylinder. Only Granville Bradshaw (creator of the ABC motorcycle) had successfully used an oil-cooled engine in a motorcycle. The engine, designed by Ing. Dauben (who later joined Mercedes on the W144 - W146 racers) had no external oilways, making a very clean design. The engine finning acted as a giant radiator, with recirculating oil the cooling agent. The single overhead camshaft was driven by a <b>train</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> {{at the front of the}} engine. Very few 4-cylinder production motorcycles of the pre-War period had an overhead camshaft (a notable rival was the first iteration of the Ariel Square Four of 1931). The 63x60mm short-stroke engine produced 22 hp at 4,000rpm, which gave an 80 mph+ top speed. The Windhoff chassis had no ‘frame’ to speak of, and the engine/gearbox unit was used as a stressed member, with the forks and rear subframe (4 parallel tubes) bolt directly onto it. The trailing-link forks use double leaf springs for damping, with no rear suspension; the rear frame tubes emerge straight out of the gearbox casting, and hold the final drive housing for the shaft drive, and rear hub and brake. Despite its massive appearance, the total weight of the machine was only 440 lbs. The price when new was 1,750DM, a bit more than the contemporary 750cc BMW R63 (1,600DM). Hans Windhoff designed a new machine for 1929, with a side valve flat-twin motor of 996cc, but the economic Crash of 1929 meant very few were produced. Windhoff struggled on with small two-stroke motorcycles of 298cc, with engines produced under license from Villiers. The company ceased operations by 1933.|$|E

40|$|Gears with {{involute}} profile {{have been used}} broadly as power transmission mechanisms. High speed reduction ratios can be obtained with <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears,</b> resulting in high power losses due to friction. Compound planetary gears allow obtaining high speed reduction ratios with a lower number <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> involved in the power transmission, hence transmitting it with higher efficiency. Although high efficiency is a main requisite for speed reducers, for some applications it may be desirable to have an irreversible mechanism. A modern trend in power transmission systems is to use cycloidal profile gears. These systems present low backlash, high load capability and higher efficiency due to the rolling motion. Furthermore, their large transmission ratio in single stage allows more compact designs. The present paper deals {{with the development of}} a simplified model for the calculation of efficiency of cycloidal speed reducers. The followed approach takes into account the main parameters influencing the efficiency, in particular, the friction and the geometrical properties of the components. The resulting model is used to investigate the relation among efficiency and reduction ratio in order to define the conditions for the irreversibility. A test bench is developed for the validation of the results...|$|R

25|$|The drive {{within the}} casing is {{provided}} by a <b>train</b> <b>of</b> spur <b>gears.</b> Accessories are arranged {{on both sides of}} the driveshaft entry, in reducing order of their speed. The gears are usually plain spur gears, running in roller bearings. Idler gears are commonly used between them, to increase the spacing between accessories. Helical gears are sometimes used for the high-torque drives, typically the starter, as these give smoother running. However helical gears also generate an end-thrust, which then requires a more complicated thrust bearing to support them.|$|R
50|$|The AEGs were {{developed}} in Japan and the Japanese company Tokyo Marui is credited with creating the original gearbox system. In a Tokyo Marui AEG, the motor drives a <b>train</b> <b>of</b> 3 <b>gears</b> mounted inside a gearbox, which then loads a pump piston against a spring. Once the spring is released, it pushes the piston plunger forward through the pump cylinder to propel a pellet resting within the chamber forward through the barrel {{and out of the}} muzzle. Many manufacturers have now more or less replicated this basic model, adding reinforced parts or minor improvements.|$|R
50|$|If {{the ring}} gear is held {{stationary}} and the sun gear is used as the input, the planet carrier will be the output. The gear ratio {{in this case will}} be 1/(1 + N/N).

The planet and sun gears mesh {{so that the}}ir pitch circles roll without slip. A point on the pitch circle <b>of</b> the planet <b>gear</b> traces an epicycloid curve. In this simplified case, the sun gear is fixed and the planetary gear(s) roll around the sun gear.|$|R

One of the more important aspects of the EHEA is to support the autonomous study of the students. Taking into account this new approach, the virtual laboratory of the subject Mechanisms of the Aeronautical studies at the Technical University of Madrid is being migrated to an on-line scheme. This virtual laboratory consist on two practices: the design of cam-follower mechanisms and the design <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> <b>gears.</b> Both practices are software applications that, in the current situation, need to be installed on each computer and the students carry out the practice at the computer classroom of the school under the supervision of a teacher. During this year the design of cam-follower mechanisms practice has been moved to a web application using Java and the Google Development Toolkit. In this practice the students has to design and study the running of a cam to perform a specific displacement diagram with a selected follower taking into account that the mechanism must be able to work properly at high speed regime. The practice has maintained its objectives in the new platform but {{to take advantage of the}} new methodology and try to avoid the inconveniences that the previous version had shown. Once the new practice has been ready, a pilot study has been carried out to compare both approaches: on-line and in-lab. This paper shows the adaptation of the cam and follower practice to an on-line methodology. Both practices are described and the changes that has been done to the initial one are shown. They are compared and the weak and strong points of each one are analyzed. Finally we explain the pilot study carried out, the students impression and the results obtained...|$|R
50|$|One of Thomson's {{designs for}} the calculating part of a tide-predicting machine {{is shown in the}} figure (right), closely similar to the third machine of 1879-81. A long cord, with one end held fixed, passed {{vertically}} upwards and over a first upper pulley, then vertically downwards and under the next, and so on. These pulleys were all moved up and down by cranks, and each pulley took in or let out cord according to the direction in which it moved. These cranks were all moved by <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> wheels <b>gearing</b> into the wheels fixed on a drive shaft. The greatest number of teeth on any wheel was 802 engaging with another of 423.

40|$|Quality {{assessment}} <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> wheels is {{an important}} task for the automobile industry and suppliers. Various kinds of faults have to be detected: cracks, structural damage, tiny inclusions or any contamination of the raw material. We propose a pattern recognition approach of ultrasonic signals induced in the test objects which is capable of distinguishing between good and bad parts. A signature analysis device was built at Fraunhofer IZFP Dresden. It contains an ultrasonic actuator for excitation and two sensors for data acquisition. From every sensor signal a short-term power spectrum is calculated. In a training stage models are created for two classes (good and bad) from a classified <b>training</b> set <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> wheels. These models are evaluated against a disjoint test set. A correlation coefficient based classifier was used as baseline system.

We compared this approach to a statistical classifier based on hidden MARKOV models which can be trained without any user input. We used a good class and measured the divergence of all test parts from the good class. The final decision on a test part is made by an threshold. Below this threshold a part is classified as good, above it as bad. Only the HMM classifier was able to classify all parts in our experiments correctly...|$|R

25|$|We find Hipparchus's {{mathematical}} signatures in the Antikythera Mechanism, {{an ancient}} astronomical computer {{of the second}} century BC. The mechanism {{is based on a}} solar year, the Metonic Cycle, which is the period the Moon reappears in the same star in the sky with the same phase (full Moon appears at the same position in the sky approximately in 19 years), the Callipic cycle (which is four Metonic cycles and more accurate), the Saros cycle and the Exeligmos cycles (three Saros cycles for the accurate eclipse prediction). The study of the Antikythera Mechanism proves that the ancients have been using very accurate calendars based on all the aspects of solar and lunar motion in the sky. In fact, the Lunar Mechanism {{which is part of the}} Antikythera Mechanism depicts the motion of the Moon and its phase, for a given time, using a <b>train</b> <b>of</b> four <b>gears</b> with a pin and slot device which gives a variable lunar velocity that is very close to the second law of Kepler, i.e. it takes into account the fast motion of the Moon at perigee and slower motion at apogee.

40|$|Gears {{are common}} {{mechanical}} components used to transfer torque. A <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> consists <b>of</b> multiple <b>gears</b> on multiple gear shafts {{with the purpose}} of producing an output torque or speed proportional to an input torque or speed. Gear trains are usually housed in a gearbox, which contains the gears, gear shafts, bearings, and some sort of lubrication. Gearboxes are found in many applications including automotive transmissions, wind turbines, helicopter engines, and geared motors. Essentially anywhere a rotational motion is produced, gears can be used to transfer that motion using a constant of proportionality to the output torque and speed. Gearboxes are prone to mechanical failure due to the surface contact between and fluctuating stresses on the gear teeth. Fatigue cracks, pitting, wear, and lubrication degradation are common precursors to severe failure such as chipped or missing gear teeth, which could have catastrophic effects on the gearbox and surrounding mechanical components. ^ Gearbox diagnostic methods could allow for the detection of deterioration in the health <b>of</b> the <b>gear</b> <b>train.</b> The use <b>of</b> a torque transducer on a gear shaft to measure the torsional vibrations <b>of</b> the <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> has the potential to detect gearbox faults. Such a detection system could make the user of a gearbox aware of the need for repair or replacement of gearbox components before more serious failure occurs. This research presents techniques that are used to mathematically model a gearbox and faults within the gearbox in order to predict the capabilities of the torque transducer to detect gear failure. The effects <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> failure and deterioration on the torsional vibrations of the gearbox are also analyzed. Data collected during experimentation with a gearbox fitted with a torque transducer is presented and compared to the analytical model. The modeling techniques accurately calculated the gear mesh stiffness properties for a wide range <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> tooth health conditions. Then, the same modeling techniques within a simulation environment were able to show the effects <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> damage on the dynamic response of the system measured by a torque transducer. The simulation results correlated well with the experimental data, but due to the lightly loaded nature of the test gearbox, the dynamic effects of the included faults were not as clear in the experimental results as in the simulation results where the load was increased. ...|$|R
