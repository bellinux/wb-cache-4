5|$|As the First Baltic {{began moving}} towards Lithuania and into eastern Latvia, {{it became clear}} that Army Group North would attempt to outflank Bagramyan's forces near Daugavpils, as he had {{previously}} predicted. Vasilevsky, keeping his promise, appealed to Stalin to allow Bagramyan to move to Daugavpils but he refused to do so. Vasilevsky in turn, <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> his own initiative and gave Bagramyan the go ahead. However, with the loss of 4th Shock Army, Bagramyan was left shortchanged since his promised 39th Army had not only not arrived but was composed of only seven divisions (in comparison to 4th Shock's ten). Feeling that time was being lost, he pressed on with the units he had.|$|E
5|$|Filitti's death {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} a Romanian communist regime came into existence. He was {{survived by his}} wife and son. An aristocrats by blood and conservatives by conviction, Ioan C.'s descendants and relatives suffered heavily {{as a result of the}} new policies: the outspoken anti-communist Filitti-Robănești became a political prisoner, as did his cousin Puiu Filitti, who had been the King's Adjutant. Alexandrina Filitti was stripped of virtually all her land during the land reform and nationalization, but still forced to meet agricultural quotas imposed by the government; when she failed to do so, Manole Filitti <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> himself to face the consequences, and spent some three years in communist jails.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> himself to authorize the decorations rather than {{to go through the}} standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to forbid Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid's {{hardcore}} {{supporters are}} the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They {{are known for}} their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so. Florentino Pérez <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result. The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.|$|E

5|$|The end of {{the streak}} came in March 1906. Ottawa and the Montreal Wanderers tied for the ECAHA league lead in 1906, forcing a playoff series for the league {{championship}} and the Cup. Montreal won the first game in Montreal by a score of 9–1. In the return match, Ottawa replaced their goaltender Billy Hague and used goaltender Percy LeSueur, formerly of Smiths Falls. In the return match in Ottawa, Ottawa overcame the eight-goal deficit, getting a 9–1 lead to tie the series by the midway point of the second half. Harry Smith then scored to put Ottawa ahead, {{only to have the}} goal ruled offside. It was then that Lester Patrick of the Wanderers <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> himself, scoring two goals to win the series 12–10. This was Frank McGee's last game and he scored two goals.|$|E
5|$|After the Myst series' success, various {{proposals}} for films and television series {{based on the}} franchise were planned or rumored. The Sci Fi Channel announced in 2002 that a TV miniseries would be produced based on Myst, to be produced by Mandalay Television Pictures in association with Columbia TriStar Domestic Television and Cyan, but never materialized. According to Rand Miller, none of the various proposals met Cyan's approval, or were too formulaic or silly. Independent filmmakers Patrick McIntire and Adrian Vanderbosch, themselves Myst fans, <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> themselves to produce a motion picture based on the story revealed in the Myst novels. In 2006, the filmmakers sent a DVD proposal to Cyan. The developers gave the filmmakers permission to begin production. The film was set {{to be based on}} the novel Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, but no longer appears to be in production.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{arrived in}} Washington, D.C., {{on the evening}} of May 2. There, they completed additional training and performed picket duty throughout the district.

The more embarrassing and lawbreaking actions by the regiment included the burning of fences, which resulted in a letter of reprimand from Brigadier General Joseph K. Mansfield along with six enlisted men being removed and sent back to New York. On May 7, the 11th New York was officially sworn into Federal service by Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell on the East Front of the unfinished Capitol in the presence of Lincoln, his son Tad and personal secretary John Hay.|$|E

5|$|Eager to {{add another}} {{franchise}} player to their team, the Rockets heavily pursued free agent center Dwight Howard in the 2013 offseason. He officially signed with the Rockets on July 13, 2013. Led by the new inside-out combination of Howard and James Harden, and with a strong supporting cast including Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, and Ömer Aşık, the Rockets were expected to jump into title contention in the upcoming season. However, in the post-season, the Rockets were defeated {{in the first round}} by the Portland Trail Blazers, losing the series 4–2. Still, in the 2014–15 season, without Lin and Parsons but reinforced by Trevor Ariza, the Rockets started the season well, winning the first four games of the season {{for the first time since}} 1996–97, and winning each of their first six games by 10 points or more, the first team to accomplish this feat since the 1985–86 Denver Nuggets. While the Rockets had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James Harden <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> himself to keep the Rockets near the top of the conference, turning him into an MVP front-runner. He became the first Rocket to score 50 points in a game since Hakeem Olajuwon, as well as the only player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season. On April 15, 2015, the Rockets beat the Jazz to claim their first ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994, and by completing 56 wins finished with the third-best regular season record in franchise history. During the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Mavericks 4–1 in the first round, and overcame a 3–1 deficit against the Los Angeles Clippers to win the Western Semifinals and return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years. In the Conference Finals, the Rockets were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 4–1.|$|E
5|$|With double-digits wins {{against the}} Lakers, Utah, Boston and Philadelphia {{to start the}} 2014–15 NBA season, the Rockets {{recorded}} a 4-0 start {{for the first time}} since they won their first six games of the 1996–97 season. By recording double-digit wins against Miami and San Antonio in their next two games, the Rockets won each of their first six games by 10 points or more, and became the first team to accomplish the feat since the 1985–86 Denver Nuggets. In December, the Rockets acquired Corey Brewer and Josh Smith, two veterans who added depth to the roster. While the Rockets had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James Harden <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> himself to keep the Rockets near the top of the conference, which turned him into an MVP front-runner. On March 20, 2015, Harden scored a career-high 50 points in a 118–108 victory over the Nuggets. Harden became the first Rocket to score 50 points since Hakeem Olajuwon scored 51 against the Celtics in 1996. On April 1, Harden scored 51 points in a 115–111 win over the Sacramento Kings, becoming the first player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season. On April 15, 2015, the Rockets won their 56th game of the season and finished with the third-best regular season record in franchise history. On that same night, the Rockets claimed their first ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994. In the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Mavericks 4-1 in the first round. In the Conference Semifinals, the Los Angeles Clippers built a 3-1 lead over the Rockets, before the Rockets won the last three games in the series to return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years, this time against the Golden State Warriors. With their win over the Clippers, the Rockets became just the ninth team in NBA history to win a playoff series in which they faced a 3-1 deficit. In the Conference Finals, the Warriors won the first three games before Harden scored 45 points to win Game 4 at the Toyota Center. The Warriors then finished the series in Game 5, winning 4-1.|$|E
