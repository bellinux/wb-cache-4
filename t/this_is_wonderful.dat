2500|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} {{one day before}} it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium. After the screening, it received [...] "wild cheering" [...] from the audience. When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced Wild at Heart as the Palme d'Or winner at the awards ceremony, the boos almost drowned out the cheers, with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors. Barry Gifford remembers {{that there was a}} prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail. [...] "All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me say something like 'This is nothing like the book' or 'He ruined my book'. I think everybody from Time magazine to What's On In London was disappointed when I said 'This is fantastic. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>wonderful.</b> It's like a big, dark, musical comedy'".|$|E

It's wonderful. Why, I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that horse now--I wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd a sold her for fifteen before, and thought 'twas all she was worth." ...|$|E
60|$|All <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> to the girl. Could it be {{that she}} was capable of {{changing}} {{the life of a}} powerful man like this? It filled her with a sense of duty as well as exaltation, an emotion that made a woman of her. She seemed suddenly to have put the hotel and all its worriments far, far behind her.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the oldest}} Jewish {{cemetery}} in South America. Its origin {{goes back to the}} 19th century when the Sephardic Jewish colony of the Dutch island of Curaçao began migrating to the city in 1824. <b>This</b> cemetery <b>is</b> beginning to build in 1832 by Joseph Curiel, who buy land {{in the vicinity of the}} town to bury his baby daughter Hana. On <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>wonderful</b> mausoleums that reflect the spirit of ancient times.|$|R

Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wonderful!</b> It's {{a ray of}} light which will forever shine on the {{darkness}} of a path severed from thee, Diana.

[...] "Dirck, {{you are to}} say nothin' of this, {{or think}} nothin' of this--as it's all in confidence, you know. Now, jist put in a last word, {{about the end of}} life, Mother, and I'll be satisfied. What you have told me about my fortin and earnin's must be true, I think, for my whole heart is in them; but I should like to know, after enjoying so much wealth and {{happiness}} as you've foretold, what sort of an end I am to make of it?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>wonderful</b> enough, but {{far more}} fantastic is what has still to be told. The most marked {{property}} of this ectoplasm, very fully illustrated in the photographs, is that it sets or curdles into the shapes of human members--of fingers, of hands, of faces, which are at first quite sketchy and rudimentary, but rapidly coalesce and develop until they are undistinguishable from those of living beings. Is not this the very strangest and most inexplicable thing that has ever yet been observed by human eyes? These faces or limbs are usually the size of life, but they frequently are quite miniatures. Occasionally they begin by being miniatures, and grow into full size. On their first appearance in the ectoplasm the limb is only on one plane of matter, a mere flat appearance, which rapidly rounds itself off, until it has assumed all three planes and is complete. It may be a mere simulacrum, like a wax hand, {{or it may be}} endowed with full power of grasping another hand, with every articulation in perfect working order.|$|E

60|$|The {{effect of}} all <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>wonderful,</b> for I know of nothing capable of rousing honest but ignorant people to greater rage and enthusiasm than this anti-vaccination cry. They {{believe it to be}} true, or, at least, seeing one or two cases in which it is true, and having never seen a case of smallpox, they suppose that the whole race is being {{poisoned}} by wicked doctors for their own gain. Hence their fierce energy and heartfelt indignation.|$|R

6000|$|First, Would Jesus Christ {{have mercy}} {{offered in the}} first place to the biggest sinners? then this shews us how to make a right {{judgment}} of the heart of Christ to men. Indeed we have advantage to guess at the goodness of his heart, by many things; as by his taking our nature upon him, his dying for us, his sending his word and ministers to us, and all that we might be saved. But this of beginning to offer mercy to Jerusalem, is that which heightens all the rest; for this doth not only confirm to us, that love was the cause of his dying for us, but it shews us yet more the depth of that love. He might have died for us, and yet have extended the benefit of his death to a few, as one might call them, of the best conditioned sinners, to those who, though they were weak, and could not but sin, yet made not a trade of sinning; to those that sinned not lavishingly. There are in the world, as one may call them, the moderate sinners; the sinners that mix righteousness with their pollutions; the sinners that though they be sinners, do what on their part lies (some that are blind would think so) that they might be saved. I say, it had been love, great love, if he had died for none but such, and sent his love to such: but that he should send out conditions of peace to the biggest of sinners; yea, that they should be offered to them first of all; (for so he means when he says, [...] "Begin at Jerusalem;") <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wonderful!</b> this shews his heart to purpose, as also the heart of God his Father, who sent him to do thus.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is not handsome--I {{call him}} plain--with his {{projecting}} brow, large mouth, and untidy brown hair. But notwithstanding his stoop and his thin hands, he looks a fine man, and, when they light up, {{his eyes are}} beautiful. It was brave of him, too, very brave, although he thinks nothing of it, to come out alone to look for me like that. I wonder what brought him? I wonder if anything told his mind that I, a girl whom he had never seen, was really on the ship and in danger? Perhaps--at any rate, he came, and the odd thing is that from the moment I saw him, and especially from the moment I heard his voice, I felt as though I had known him all my life. Probably he would think me mad if I were to say so; indeed, I am by no means sure {{that he does not}} pay me that compliment already, with some excuse, perhaps, in view of the 'Song of the Overlord' and all my wild talk. Well, after such a night as I had spent anyone might be excused for talking foolishly. It is the reaction from never expecting to talk again at all. The chief advantage of a diary is that one may indulge in the luxury of telling the actual truth. So I will say that I feel as though I had known him always; always--and as though I understood him as one understands a person one has watched for years. What is more, I think that he understands me more than most people do; not that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wonderful,</b> seeing how few I know. At any rate, he guesses more or less what I am thinking about, and can see that there is something in the ideas which others consider foolish, as perhaps they are.|$|E

6000|$|For {{thus the}} elect considereth: though we all came alike into the world, {{and are the}} {{children}} of wrath by nature (Eph 2:1-3); yea, though we have alike so weakened ourselves by sin (Rom 3:9), that the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint (Isa 1:5), being altogether gone out of the way, and every one become altogether unprofitable, both to God and ourselves (Rom 3:12); yet that God should open mine eyes, convert my soul, give me faith, forgive my sins, raise me, when I fall; fetch me again, when I am gone astray; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wonderful!</b> (Psa 37:23). Yea, that he should prepare eternal mansions for me (Psa 23:6); and also keep me by his blessed and mighty power for that; and {{that in a way}} of believing, which without his assistance I am no way able to perform! (2 Cor 5:5). That he should do this notwithstanding my sins, though I had no righteousness! (Deut 9:5-7). Yea, that he should do it according to the riches of his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ our Lord! Even according to an everlasting covenant of grace, which yet the greatest part of the world are void of, and will for ever miss and fall short of! (Eze 16:60-63). Besides, that he should mollify my heart! break it, and then delight in it (Psa 51:17); put his fear in it, and then look to me (Isa 66:2; Psa 138:6), and keep me as the apple of his eye (Deut 32:10); yea, resolve to guide me with his counsel, and then receive me to glory! Further, that all this should be the effect of unthought of, undeserved, and undesired love! (Mal 1:2; Deut 7:7,8). That the Lord should think on this before he made the world (Jer 31:3), and sufficiently ordain the means before he had laid the foundation of the hills! For this he is worthy to be praised (1 Cor 2:9): yea, 'Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord; praise ye the Lord.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{tell you}} that this is to me quite the most amazing among the {{phenomena}} of humanity. I am surprised at no depths to which, when once warped from its honour, that humanity can be degraded. I do not wonder at the miser's death, with his hands, as they relax, dropping gold. I do not wonder at the sensualist's life, with the shroud wrapped about his feet. I do not wonder at the single-handed murder of a single victim, done by the assassin {{in the darkness of the}} railway, or reed shadow of the marsh. I do not even wonder at the myriad-handed murder of multitudes, done boastfully in the daylight, by the frenzy of nations, and the immeasurable, unimaginable guilt heaped up from hell to heaven, of their priests, and kings. But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wonderful</b> to me--oh, how wonderful!--to see the tender and delicate woman among you, with her child at her breast, and a power, if she would wield it, over it, and over its father, purer than the air of heaven, and stronger than the seas of earth--nay, a magnitude of blessing which her husband would not part with for all that earth itself, though it were made of one entire and perfect chrysolite:- to see her abdicate this majesty to play at precedence with her next-door neighbour! This is wonderful--oh, wonderful!--to see her, with every innocent feeling fresh within her, go out in the morning into her garden to play with the fringes of its guarded flowers, and lift their heads when they are drooping, with her happy smile upon her face, and no cloud upon her brow, because there is a little wall around her place of peace: and yet she knows, in her heart, if she would only look for its knowledge, that, outside of that little rose-covered wall, the wild grass, to the horizon, is torn up by the agony of men, and beat level by the drift of their life-blood.|$|E
