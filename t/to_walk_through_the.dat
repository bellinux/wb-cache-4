They did not think much of the palace after touring it, so they decided <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gardens to the Petit Trianon. On the way, they reached the Grand Trianon and found it was closed to the public.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge over}} Swinefleet Warping Drain {{was the subject}} of an unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked {{permission}} for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it to reach their place of work. To access it, they would need <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{contingent}} did {{not reach}} {{in time for the}} fighting, the city's capital was taken. Aside from some farm life, the town had been largely abandoned. The taking of the region marked a continuous swath of territory held by Armenians stretching from Karabakh to Armenia proper, a total of 3,000 square kilometers. In the retreat through the Omar Pass of the Murov mountain range, many Azeri refugees froze to death. With the last helicopters leaving on April 1, they were forced <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> heavy snow at freezing temperatures. Nearly 39,000 civilians were processed into the camps at Yevlakh and Dashkesen with as many as 15,000 unaccounted for. Four Azerbaijani MI-8 helicopters ferrying refugees and wounded out of the conflict zone crashed, the last of which was hit by Armenian forces. Human Rights Watch findings concluded that during the Kalbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war, including forcible exodus of civilian population, indiscriminate fire and hostage-taking.|$|E

25|$|MAG {{announced}} on 20 June 2013 {{as part of}} a visit to the airport by the Secretary of State for Transport that it would be launching an £80million terminal redevelopment programme. MAG has invested £40million and the remainder was invested by other commercial partners.The redevelopment included relocation of the security area, doubling the amount of seating and improving the information displays. The new Departure Lounge offers a food court, a number of new shops and an Escape Lounge, however the remodelling has drawn heavy criticism due to the length of time it takes <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> shopping areas to get to the departure gates.|$|E
25|$|Paintings and {{the cave}} artwork has become eroded due to decay and human interference. Therefore, {{many areas of}} the painted walls, ceilings, and pillars are fragmentary. The painted {{narratives}} of the Jataka tales are depicted only on the walls, which demanded the special attention of the devotee. They are didactic in nature, meant to inform the community about the Buddha's teachings and life through successive rebirths. Their placement on the walls required the devotee <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> aisles and 'read' the narratives depicted in various episodes. The narrative episodes are depicted one after another although not in a linear order. Their identification has been a core area of research since the site's discovery in 1819.|$|E
25|$|The cloister was {{a garden}} courtyard, {{surrounded}} by the domestic buildings of the abbey, mostly constructed in the late 12th century. The eastern buildings, adjoining the transept, are well-preserved, {{and it is possible}} <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> slype that gave access to the parlour, chapter house and possibly the infirmary. The south range is ruinous but the walls mainly survive. It contained the refectory, which was divided in the 14th century to provide a warming room. The range was much more complete in the early 19th century, when it still had most of its upper floor. This probably contained the abbot's lodging. There were many buildings further west and south, and the abbey's guest facilities must have been very large to accommodate visitors of very high status, with their enormous retinues.|$|E

25|$|On {{the seventh}} {{anniversary of his}} inauguration as Oregon's 29th governor, Hatfield {{announced}} his candidacy for the Republican nomination. In his announcement, Hatfield focused on the economic achievements in the state since his election, citing record-high employment {{and the creation of}} 138,000 jobs. Hatfield was considered vulnerable {{on the subject of the}} Vietnam War, which he opposed, in contrast with 75% of Oregonians, who favored the war. Hatfield's views on the war had been strongly affected by his own experiences: as a U.S. Navy ensign in World War II, he had been among the first <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> devastation caused by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima; in a later assignment in Vietnam, he saw first-hand how imperialism led to incredible disparity, with countless Vietnamese living in poverty next to opulent French mansions. The war issue gave Hatfield competition from several minor candidates on the right, but Hatfield nonetheless won by a wide margin, besting his nearest competitor, conservative evangelist Walter Huss, by a nearly 6–1 margin.|$|E
25|$|The Belt of Orion Award for Excellence {{was founded}} by Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame in 1988 to honour organizations, groups, {{societies}} or associations who have made outstanding contributions {{to the advancement of}} aviation in Canada. The Belt of Orion Award for Excellence was bestowed upon the Air Cadet League of Canada in 1989. Orion, the son of Neptune, according to Greek Mythology, was a handsome and energetic hunter who possessed the power <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sea and on its surface. Artemis, the Goddess of the hunt, fell in love with Orion, but her twin brother, Apollo, was jealous and sent a scorpion to kill him. In her sorrow and remorse for his death, Artemis placed him in the sky as a constellation. Orion, the Great Hunter, is a brilliant constellation, second to the Big Dipper on the roster of major constellations. It straddles the celestial equator, and is outlined by a quadrilateral of three brilliant stars—Betelgeuse, Bellatrix and Rigel, and one of lesser magnitude. Inside the quadrilateral are three second-magnitude stars forming the Belt of Orion. The three stars of the Belt point south-eastward to Sirius, the brightest star of the heavens.|$|E
25|$|From {{the western}} side of the ruins, the abbot's hall window remains the {{dominant}} structure, but walls of the kitchen and dining areas and of the main cloister are easily made out beyond it. It is possible <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entrance to the undercroft of the frater or refectory, below the great west refectory window, which would once have been an impressive structure when it was inserted in the 13th century. The refectory and its undercroft separated the little cloister to the south from the larger northern cloister. The undercroft was the main storage area for provisions, which were brought in through its western entrance from the abbey grounds. A sluice supplied by a stream is on the northern side of the undercroft. The undercroft linked via service steps to the frater above, and by a door to the kitchens, which lay along {{the western side}} of the little cloister. The large fireplaces in the west wall of the kitchen range are still very prominent. The frater, being on the upper floor, has gone, but the main cloister wall closest its entrance has two large, arched niches that contained the lavers for the canons' ceremonial ablution before meals. It is not clear how water was supplied to the lavers and all trace of the wash basins has disappeared.|$|E

However, {{there is}} safety glass, a 6meter [...] 1.5kilometer (6.5ft [...] 1mi) concrete and steel wall, {{and a system}} of underground tunnels which guards use <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> prison. Although there are surveillance cameras on the prison grounds, they are not present in the cells, the cell hallways, the common rooms, the classrooms, {{and most of the}} workshops. While there is little violence reported, almost exclusively in Unit A, officers try to prevent it. If two inmates have a dispute, they engage in a mediation session under staff supervision. If mediation fails, repeated misbehavior or rule violations are punished with cell confinement or prison transference.|$|E

However, with deadlines fast approaching, reporters wanted a press conference.

Kennedy finished speaking and started to exit when William Barry stopped him and said, [...] "No, it's been changed. We're going this way."
