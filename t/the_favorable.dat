5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>favorable</b> {{economic}} development, {{the military}} potential of 16th century Poland was modest {{in relation to}} the challenges and threats coming from several directions, which included the Ottoman Empire, the Teutonic state, the Habsburgs, and Muscovy. Given the declining military value and willingness of pospolite ruszenie, the bulk of the forces available consisted of professional and mercenary soldiers. Their number and provision depended on szlachta-approved funding (self-imposed taxation and other sources) and tended to be insufficient for any combination of adversaries. The quality of the forces and their command was good, as demonstrated by victories against a seemingly overwhelming enemy. The attainment of strategic objectives was supported by a well-developed service of knowledgeable diplomats and emissaries. Because of the limited resources at the state's disposal, the Jagiellonian Poland had to concentrate on the area most crucial for its security and economic interests, which was the strengthening of Poland's position along the Baltic coast.|$|E

5|$|Mei Lanfang, one of {{the most}} famous Dan {{performers}} of all time, was also {{one of the}} greatest popularizers of Peking opera abroad. During the 1920s, he performed Peking opera in Japan. This inspired an American tour in February 1930.

The performances had to be relocated from the 49th Street Theater to the larger National Theater, and the duration of the tour extended from two weeks to five. Mei traveled across the United States, receiving honorary degrees from the University of California and Pomona College. He followed this tour with a tour in the Soviet Union in 1935.|$|E
5|$|The Zerg are a {{collective}} consciousness {{of a variety}} of different races assimilated into the Zerg genome. The Zerg were originally commanded by the Zerg Overmind, a manifestation of this hive mind, and under the Overmind's control the Zerg strove for genetic perfection by assimilating <b>the</b> <b>favorable</b> traits of other species. After a species has been assimilated into the Swarm, it is mutated towards a different function within its hierarchy, from being a hive worker to a warrior strain. StarCrafts manual notes that some species bear little resemblance to their original forms after just a short time into assimilation (An example would be the formerly peaceful Slothien species, which was assimilated and mutated into the vicious Hydralisk strain and so on). The Overmind controls the Swarm through secondary agents called cerebrates. Cerebrates command an individual brood of Zerg, each with a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Cerebrates further delegate power through the use of overlords for battlefield direction and queens for hive watch.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} slowly {{organized for}} the next day, as it drifted to the northeast. On July 17, the rate of organization and development of deep convection increased considerably, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Danny later that day. From the night of July 17 through July 18, Danny quickly developed deep convection and banding features in <b>the</b> <b>favorable</b> environment of the Gulf of Mexico, and reached hurricane status later on July 18. Located between two high pressure systems, Danny continued its unusual July track to the northeast, and crossed over southeastern Louisiana near the Mississippi River Delta. A small storm, Danny continued to strengthen after reaching the coastal waters off Mississippi {{on the night of}} July 18, and attained a peak of 80mph (130km/h) early on July 19. The hurricane-force winds, however, were confined to the eyewall. After stalling near the mouth of Mobile Bay on July 19, Hurricane Danny turned to the east, and made its final landfall near Mullet Point, Alabama later that day.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved that}} the unknown {{radioactive}} source originated from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements, proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in a paper entitled Radioactive Element 93 in the Physical Review on May 27, 1940. They did not propose {{a name for the}} element in the paper, but they soon decided on the name neptunium since Neptune is the next planet beyond Uranus in our solar system. McMillan and Abelson's success compared to Nishina and Kimura's near miss can be attributed to <b>the</b> <b>favorable</b> half-life of 239Np for radiochemical analysis and quick decay of 239U, in contrast to the slower decay of 237U and extremely long half-life of 237Np.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Erika {{originated}} from a tropical wave accompanied by disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa, near the Cape Verde Islands, on August25. The following day, convection surrounding the wave began to show signs of organization as it tracked westward across the Atlantic. By August28, an area of low pressure developed from the wave. Environmental conditions ahead of the low were favorable for further development of the system. Despite <b>the</b> <b>favorable</b> conditions, the low became increasingly disorganized on August29, with little convection remaining around the center of circulation. The next day, the system quickly became organized, with shower and thunderstorms developing around the center and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that the low would likely become a tropical depression within 24hours. Although convection was well-organized, the system lacked a defined low-level circulation center, leading to the NHC not issuing advisories on the system at that time.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00UTC on October27, the IMD {{upgraded}} Nilofar to a {{very severe}} cyclonic storm. The storm was rapidly intensifying at the time, after the wind shear had decreased, and the eye contracted to a diameter of 19km (12mi). At 09:00UTC on October28, the IMD upgraded Nilofar further to an extremely severe cyclonic storm. Six hours later, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 215km/h (130mph); at the time, the agency anticipated further strengthening due to <b>the</b> <b>favorable</b> conditions and good organization. At 18:00UTC on October28, the IMD estimated peak 3-minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). At the time, it was the third-strongest storm on record in the Arabian Sea. On October29, Nilofar started weakening due to increased wind shear, and the convection diminished in intensity. At the same time, the storm turned northeastward while rounding the ridge to the east. Increasingly cooler and drier air, as well as cooler waters, caused the storm to degrade rapidly. The eye, previously small and well defined, dissipated by 06:00UTC on October29. Later that day, the center began decoupling from the convection, a sign of rapid weakening, and by 21:00UTC the IMD downgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm. Early on October30, the JTWC downgraded Nilofar to a tropical storm, and subsequently the circulation became exposed from the convection. At 18:00UTC that day, the JTWC posted their final advisory. Nilofar weakened further into a depression on October31, and soon after degenerated into a remnant low off coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|Early on October8, {{after turning}} west-southwestward {{away from the}} Greater Antilles, Iris began {{strengthening}} again, with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear. The NHC predicted peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) before the storm would hit Belize. It rapidly intensified with <b>the</b> <b>favorable</b> conditions, intensifying from 95mph (150km/h) to 140mph (225km/h) in a 12-hour period on October8, making Iris a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; in the same duration, the minimum central pressure dropped 38mbar (1.12inHg). While intensifying, the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls, with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7mi (11km). For comparison, the smallest known eye diameter on record for an Atlantic hurricane was about 3mi (5km), during Hurricane Wilma in 2005. With such a small eye, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde {{into the center of}} Iris, and shortly after the flight, the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the Honduras coastline just offshore. This resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle, but within a few hours Iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145mph (230km/h) just off Belize. At 02:00UTC on October9, it made landfall at peak intensity in Monkey River Town in the southern portion of Belize.|$|E
