500|$|Blitz {{described}} Hal as [...] "lost in {{the mystery}} of love" [...] and he [...] "loved {{the idea that a}} kid who is lost when he's confronted by love and sex would be saddled with the name Hal Hefner", an homage to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. Throughout the film, Hal is seen to be surrounded by sex and relationships—titlecards for the seasons of the year are placed over images of kissing students; Hal listens to his mother having intercourse with her new boyfriend; his friend Lewis shows Hal images from the Kama Sutra; while Lewis's parents attempt to mend their relationship through music therapy—but the adults in the film were written to be similarly confused and frustrated with love. [...] "In a world where all the children are <b>trying</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to be like adults", according to Stylus Yannick LeJacq, [...] "the adults are all sullenly try to reenact their childhood, taking every chance to ignore their children and savor the meaningless void of leisure time." ...|$|E
500|$|Following these tragic events, lead guitarist Dickey Betts {{gradually}} {{took over}} the role as group leader. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on the album. Twiggs Lyndon, {{a friend of the}} band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including [...] "Melissa," [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] and [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More." [...] Allman's death provided the band with motivation; [...] "We were all putting more into it, <b>trying</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn't there and we had to do something for him," [...] said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, [...] "We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over and sticking us in the ass with B12 shots every day. Little by little by little, we crawled back up {{to the point where we}} were standing erect".|$|E
500|$|For the collaboration, Fraser McAlpine from BBC Radio 1 {{reviewed}} the song negatively, writing: [...] "So anyway, this {{brings me to}} 'Video Phone' – and {{what exactly is the}} point of Gaga featuring in this song? I know Beyoncé fans won't like me saying this, but I can't help but think that in this instance it's a case of 'if you can't beat em, join em' [...] For someone as naturally brilliant as Beyoncé (and a better singer than Gaga and Rihanna put together), perhaps she should actually stop <b>trying</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and do what she does best - singing proper songs." [...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's. [...] greatest promises of unbridled exhibitionism can't quite make the genre feel fresh." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone." [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV, felt that [...] "Gaga got a bit lost in the mix" [...] of [...] "Video Phone". David Balls of the website Digital Spy gave a negative review for the remix version, grading it two out of five stars. He further commented, ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 28, 1995, Mark Anthony Cadavos {{approached}} Jordison {{while he}} was working, offering him a position in a new project called The Pale Ones. Intrigued and {{at a point where}} he was [...] "lost", Jordison attended rehearsals at Anders Colsefini's basement and immediately {{wanted to be part of}} this new band. Speaking of this moment he said, [...] "I remember <b>trying</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> not to smile, so I didn't look like I wanted to join, I remained poker-faced, but I thought they ruled." [...] A lot of Slipknot's early development was discussed by band members while Jordison worked night shifts at Sinclair's garage. Of the eventual nine members, Joey was the third to join the band. Slipknot would become pioneers to the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Jordison is accompanied by two custom percussionists, giving their music a feel that Rolling Stone touted as [...] "suffocating".|$|E
2500|$|Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times said, [...] "By <b>trying</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> for authenticity, this Doctor Zhivago drains {{the story}} of much of its lyricism.... Mr. Lean's grander, glossier version was a closer match to the romantic spirit of the novel's hero.... The Davies version is engrossing but more for the {{harrowing}} scenes set {{in the civil war}} after the revolution than for the novel's legendary love triangle. Black-and-white archival photographs - Moscow slums, newspaper shots of soldiers marching off to World War I - are interspersed throughout the film and slowly bleed into a scene of the television show. The visual trick gives the series a quasi-documentary feel and is quite effective. Yet Mr. Davies takes the same liberties with Pasternak's text as the original film did, focusing on the love story and discarding a lot of the politics, secondary plots and literary sidetracks.... This Doctor Zhivago can be watched as a useful history lesson and as a cautionary show business tale: it is a lot easier to adapt a Jane Austen novel than it is to remake a film by David Lean." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Gordon scored {{his record}} 5th {{win in the}} Brickyard 400 after passing Kasey Kahne on a restart with 17 laps to go. The race was {{dominated}} {{by a variety of}} pit strategies. Kasey Kahne lead the most laps in the race with 70 as Hendrick powered cars led 127 of the 160 laps. [...] "Those emotions take over. There's nothing better, especially in a big race, coming to Victory Lane with your family here," [...] said an emotional Gordon. [...] "I was <b>trying</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> with 10 to go not to focus on the crowd. I didn't {{want to think about it}} too much, but you can't help it." [...] "Looking back, I should have chosen the (outside lane)," [...] Kahne said. [...] "They pretty much let Jeff control that restart. I took off and never spun a tire and the inside had been more grip throughout the race and I started on the inside and I thought it was a great decision. But I didn't spin a tire and Jeff drove right by me before we were even got to the second (restart line)." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviews. Review normalizer Metacritic {{gave the}} album 50 out of 100 based on 9 critical reviews. Andy Kellman of AllMusic said [...] "Timbaland does not stock Shock Value II with quite as many guests, and performs {{a higher percentage}} of the vocals, and what results is less schizophrenic and more directly pop than its antecedent. The highs here are not as high, and the lows are as low, unless you consider the very presence of Chad Kroeger and Daughtry, or the unveiling of Brandy’s rapping alter ego Bran’ Nu, to be more odious than a sub-Coldplay ballad. [...] That said, it is a mildly entertaining album—as long as you block out most of the lyrics." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Timbaland dips into his usual bag of production tricks here and many of the supporting cast dutifully return, but never does this quite reach the same excitement levels as its predecessor. [...] it feels as though Tim's <b>trying</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to impress us with his pimped-up SUV that he's driven the thing off the road. The result? A disparate, disjointed collection of songs that feels like less {{than the sum of its}} parts. Where Shock Value was fresh and innovative, much of the sequel could pass for leftovers from its predecessor. [...] He now seems to be lagging behind rivals like David Guetta and will.iam when it comes to driving the urban pop genre forward" ...|$|E

It never entered her head that there could be any other reason for her being kindly disposed toward him. She was tenderly disposed toward him, but she did not know it.
