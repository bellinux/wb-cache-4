500|$|Hastert {{also ran}} an Explorers group of which Steve Reinboldt was a member, {{and led the}} group on a diving trip to the Bahamas. In the interview, Burdge stated that in 1979 (eight years after Reinboldt's high school {{graduation}} in 1971), her brother {{had told her that}} he had been sexually abused by Hastert throughout his four years of high school. Burdge said that she was [...] "stunned" [...] by this news and that her brother said that he had never told anyone before, because he did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> believed. A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt's 1970 high school yearbook. In the interview, Burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation. [...] Jolene said that Hastert [...] "damaged Steve I think more than any of us will ever know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{had stopped}} {{working on her}} latest novel when her son died. She said that afterward, [...] "I stopped writing until I began to <b>think,</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> really put out if he {{thought that he had}} caused me to stop. 'Please, Mom, I'm dead, could you keep going [...] [...] [...] ?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Cecil Marley, {{president}} of the West Indies Cricket Board, asked me who I would recommend as my successor," [...] wrote Sobers. [...] "I opted initially for David Holford but I didn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> accepted as my nomination because he was my relative. I offered Clive Lloyd as an alternative choice but Clive had not even been {{invited to join the}} squad, so my third choice would be Rohan Kanhai." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor old Bicky didn't {{want to go}} to that ranch," [...] I explained. [...] "He doesn't like {{cows and}} horses, but <b>he</b> rather <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> hot stuff among the hens. All he wants is a bit of capital. Don't you think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> rather a wheeze if you were to----" ...|$|R
50|$|He {{started writing}} seriously from 1993, but didn't <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> writing novels.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, a {{great deal}} depends upon how he may take this, and what becomes of Algernon Dusautoy; though I suppose there is no lack of other tempters. Your papa has even spoken of India again; <b>he</b> still <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more guarded there, but {{all depends on the}} spirit in which we find him. One thing I hope, that I shall leave it all to his father's judgment, and not say one word.' ...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the artists}} {{attending}} those meetings was painter John Opper, who {{said in an interview}} that Swinden was very quiet, shy, and inhibited. He also said that Swinden was one of the best painters in the group. [...] "His paintings were very powerful, very strong. You would <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> one of those robust persons like Gorky, for instance. But he was the opposite of Gorky. He was very withdrawn." [...] Around this time, Swinden may have painted abstracts exclusively. But later, according to Irving Sandler, [...] "it was sort of a mixture between figurative and geometric abstraction. It was a kind of hard-edge figure towards the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{right at}} all," [...] said Lady Baldock, with much energy. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wrong,--shamefully wrong. They {{say he is}} the son of an Irish doctor, and that he hasn't a {{shilling}} in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{indifferent}} to illustrations that is, I {{think he would}} not value illustrations above simple letterpress." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, I {{never knew}} for certain how [...] "Mr. David's conscience" [...] would decide, but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> {{with me on}} this occasion, and with the Rules of the Game.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he fancied another. And {{ever since}} that time he has been fancying others, instead of remembering me. Had he got you, Miss Rose, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> content {{for the rest of}} his days." ...|$|R
50|$|Cuddy {{tries to}} {{rationalize}} with the lawyer and his client with the reattached thumb. She proposes {{that if they}} drop the lawsuit, the hospital will resubmit the claim and pay half his deductible. The man says he cannot pay. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in better shape without his thumb and its medical bills. Cuddy explains that her doctors do good work and deserve to be paid. The lawyer threatens to go to court. Cuddy refuses to back down and retaliates by threatening that the hospital would counter-sue and get paid, {{even if it means}} taking the man's house.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> so very angry, that Tom, who, you know, is timid and meek, {{would be}} dreadfully frightened," [...] said Richard.|$|E
6000|$|... "We will go {{and talk}} to De Brensault," [...] she said. [...] "I should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> just {{in the frame of}} mind to consent to anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Long is comparative. I did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dead {{within six}} weeks, or I {{should not have}} been riding there. He was a burden to me, Mr. Finn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> I <b>am</b> a burthen to them now. They cannot feel my grief, nor comfort it, {{and they}} don't like {{the sight of}} it, though I am sure I trouble them with it as little as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor do I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been,</b> {{save for}} his wife, Maud Pratt of Hampton," [...] said Ambrose. [...] "Nay, truly also, he deemed {{that we were}} only within a day's journey of council from our uncle Richard at Hyde." ...|$|R
500|$|Jenner is a Christian, leans towards {{political}} conservatism {{and is a}} Republican. [...] "I {{have gotten}} more flak for being a conservative Republican than I have for being trans," [...] she has said. Although stopping short of an endorsement, Jenner said she liked Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, despite Cruz's negative views of trans people. On her reality show I Am Cait, Jenner said that although she does not support Donald Trump, she <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> good for women's issues; she then stated she would never support Hillary Clinton. She ended up voting for Trump in the 2016 presidential elections.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{very much}} excited?" [...] asked the girl, with the sarcastic humor which had risen {{up in her}} {{to be one of}} the reliefs of her earlier intensity.|$|E
6000|$|Her parish {{experience}} {{came into}} play. 'Does papa <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> like Joe Sparks? But then gentlemen don't beat their wives, nor {{go to the}} public-house, nor let their children go about in rags.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Phineas {{knew that}} in this {{emergency}} it was his especial duty to be honest. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> changed altogether if we could bring him here,--so that he should live among his friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{there is}} one thing wanting," [...] she whispered. [...] "What do you suppose, if he were here at this moment, Paul Fiske would say? Do you <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> content to listen to these brazen voices and accept their verdict?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will make}} some inquiries," [...] the {{governor}} said, [...] "and find out, if I can, {{where he is}} at present. Yes, I should <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to assist you, if he chose to interest himself in the matter." ...|$|R
50|$|Clarke Cooper (Azer Greco)Clarke is a {{very smart}} little 8-year-old. He {{is said to be}} smarter than both his father and brother, Brody, combined. Being famous doesn't bother him since <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> already <b>be</b> famous and rich someday. He has a crush on Julia.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps I {{should have}} begun {{by saying that}} Felix is all but {{prepared}} to take her off. She is quite ready to go. She is devoted to him. Do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wrong?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Some day {{she might}} tell Tom all about it, {{and she did}} not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> angry, for he knew what it was to have nowhere to go, and to want to try for one more chance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{if there}} is {{anything}} special, won't you tell me?" [...] There had been something very special, which Clarissa certainly would not tell. [...] "What has he said to you? I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> simply cross to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> I <b>am</b> {{sure that}} if my little Rose were to take it into her head, I should have hard work to get her father's consent, though no doubt the world will have progressed {{by the time she}} is old enough.' ...|$|R
60|$|Yet Harold {{was not a}} bad or unfeeling boy by nature; and if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{but have}} paused to <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> shocked to see how cruelly he was paining his widowed mother and dying brother, just when {{he should have been}} their {{strength}} and stay.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> I <b>am</b> not at {{all sure}} but what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wish to have the will found. If he did, we could begin and go through every book in the library. We would begin with the sermons, and soon know whether it be as I have suggested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not {{venture to}} interfere, madam," [...] {{returned}} Mark, humbly, [...] "I did but use one law to neutralise another. One of these slaves is my friend. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very useful in helping me to-night with my magic fires!" ...|$|E
6000|$|THE PARLOR MAID. Thats just it, sir. You see, he {{must take}} me for better for worse, til death do us part. Do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> so ready to do that, sir, if he {{thought it might be}} for several hundred years? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From what I {{have seen}} of him, I should think that Chalmers {{would make you}} an {{excellent}} husband," [...] Nigel declared, as he rang the bell. [...] "You need a firm hand, and I should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> quite capable of using it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> {{but there}} <b>is</b> no knowing. At {{the present moment}} I have only one doubt,--whether to act upon him or upon her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure I do not know," [...] {{she said}} in a tone of perplexity. [...] "I had thought of having him to hand round coffee when my friends call, and perhaps to work in the garden, but I did not <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{anything}} like this." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the novel, it is {{said that}} he got his {{nickname}} because he has a nose like a Turkish scimitar. He also has a Turkish wife and children, and does much of his business (growing poppy) in Turkey. Sollozzo in the film and novel is described as a powerful, ruthless drug trafficker. He has a meeting with Vito Corleone and offers to make the Mafia chieftain his partner in a heroin trafficking operation in return for money and protection. Vito refuses, reasoning that the politicians in his pocket would turn on him if he dealt in narcotics. Vito's son and heir apparent Sonny expresses interest in the deal, however, and Sollozzo <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> easier to control if Vito was eliminated.|$|R
