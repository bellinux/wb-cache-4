5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>well.</b> A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
5|$|The older houses relied {{mainly on}} heating from open coal fires, {{which led to}} {{problems}} with smog (in 1962, 24 deaths in Leeds were attributed to this), although this problem was partially relieved in the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} the Clean Air Act 1956. Although a slum clearance scheme was under way in the 1930s, it took until after the Second World War, for the scheme <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>well</b> under way. In the 1950s, the largest social housing project began with the building of the Seacroft Estate. Seacroft was planned at the time to be a 'Satellite town within the city limits'. The building of new council estates was most prevalent in the city's east end and because of this the city expanded much further East {{in the latter part of}} the 20th century then it did any other direction. The Langbar Gardens Estate (completed 1966) in Swarcliffe lay right on the eastern fringes of the city sprawl until it was demolished in the early 21st century, including the high-profile implosions of Langbar Towers, Langbar Grange and Ash Tree Grange. By the 1960s and 1970s land for social housing was becoming scarcer and the council started looking towards building 'high rise', with such estates as Cottingley sporting prominent tower blocks. By the 1970s less land was available for such developments and the particularly large estates were becoming unpopular, however faced with a need for a larger social housing stock, Leeds City Council built smaller estates such as Holt Park (in partnership with Norman Ashton), replaced the prefabricated 'war houses' in Cottingley with newer prefabs and redeveloped areas such as Beckhill in Meanwood.|$|E

Ben then starts to call Will [...] "Dewey" [...] (just as other students did at his old school), which stands for [...] "DWI" [...] ("Driving While Intoxicated"). Will detests this nickname because it reminds him of his father, whom he is ashamed of. What is more, Charlotte's father dies and she decides to quit the band. As she explains to Will, her father hated how she acted when she was with her ex-boyfriend, so after he got sick, she decided to change her image and be nicer to [...] "people like [...] ", meaning outcasts, hoping that this good behavior would cause her dad <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>well.</b> The band members are hurt by this discovery, as it means she did not genuinely like them, but they decide to go on nonetheless, with Sa5m taking over as lead singer.|$|E

2500|$|Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine {{said that}} the saddest thing about 20 Y.O. was Jackson's {{decision}} to make a terrible R instead of great dance music, which would likely pay off. He also referred to Jam and Lewis's production as [...] "ice-cold beats [...] have melted into a lugubrious, lukewarm pudding—at under an hour, it still feels almost {{twice as long as}} Janet. and The Velvet Rope." [...] With a C+ rating, Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine called it [...] "half-decent" [...] and went to say, [...] "there's precious little <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> <b>well,</b> excited about here. Janet commits the ultimate sin of making an album that’s thoroughly mediocre. Apart from the sticky ear-candy of [...] "So Excited," [...] there’s little I’d miss here if I went six months without it. This doesn’t sound like rejuvenation—it sounds like the beginning of the end." [...] The Village Voices music critic Miles Marshall Lewis commented that Jackson's last two albums also talked excessively about sex, and with the new release, it was getting tired. Evan Serpick from Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying [...] "If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison." [...] Angus Batey, writing for Yahoo! Music UK, remarked that in Jackson's producers desire to take Jackson back to her roots, they made not a great album for Jackson, but a facsimile of one; correct in all the details, but lacking substance and soul. Robert Christgau gave it a [...] "dud" [...] score (...) [...] Additionally, 20 Y.O. earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R Album in 2007.|$|E
