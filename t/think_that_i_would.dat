2500|$|Although {{the band}} members denied Cobain's {{involvement}} in the songwriting, they have openly stated that Cobain was briefly {{in the studio and}} performed uncredited backup vocals with Kristen Pfaff on two of the tracks: [...] "Asking for It", and [...] "Softer, Softest". The album's liner notes credit Hole as the sole writers of the album, except on two songs: [...] "I <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> Die", co-written by Kat Bjelland, as well as the band's cover of [...] "Credit in the Straight World". The liner notes read: [...] "all songs [...] written by Hole except [...] "I <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> Die", written by Hole and K. Bjelland [...] "Credit in the Straight World" [...] written by Stuart Moxham." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{aggressive}} opening track, [...] "Violet", {{was reportedly}} inspired by Love's relationship with Billy Corgan, while songs like [...] "Plump", [...] "Miss World", and [...] "I <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> Die" [...] contain the repeated themes of motherhood and post-partum depression. [...] "I <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> Die" [...] makes specific {{references to the}} custody battle which Love and husband Cobain had endured over their daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, in 1992, and featured co-writing by Love's friend and former bandmate Kat Bjelland; according to Love, the line [...] "She says, 'I am not a feminist'" [...] in the song was directly quoted from a Julia Roberts interview that she had read."Asking for It" [...] was inspired by an occurrence at a 1991 concert when Hole was touring with Mudhoney, in which Love was assaulted and had her clothes ripped off of her while crowdsurfing, leaving her entirely naked, and was written entirely during the album's recording sessions. [...] "Doll Parts", the album's most successful single, was written by Love in music executive Joyce Linehan's apartment in Boston, Massachusetts in 1992, and concerned Love's insecurity of Cobain's romantic interest in her.|$|E

2500|$|During 2004, rumors {{circulated}} that Häkkinen {{was making}} a possible return to Formula One {{to fill in the}} vacant Williams seat left by Juan Pablo Montoya. In May, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis dismissed the rumors, stating that Häkkinen was not prepared for a comeback. Häkkinen held talks with BAR and Williams and later decided against returning to Formula One saying in 2005: [...] "It's impossible to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> race a Formula One car again because as time passes my reactions become slower and my eyesight gets worse – that's life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Bjelland {{moved to}} Seattle {{and began a}} side project called Crunt with new husband Stuart Gray (aka Stu Spasm), {{formerly}} of Lubricated Goat. Bjelland played bass and Gray guitar, while Russell Simins of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion was the drummer. In February 1994, the band released a self-titled debut, along with its first single, [...] "Swine". During this time, Bjelland also co-wrote the track [...] "I <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> Die" [...] on Hole's breakthrough album Live Through This (1994) with Courtney Love and guitarist Eric Erlandson.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album is}} {{dedicated}} to the memory of Joe Cole, a roadie for Black Flag and the Rollins Band who was shot to death in December 1991 after attending a Hole show at the Whisky A Go Go in West Hollywood. According to BMI's website, most of the songs credited officially to Hole were written just by Courtney Love and Eric Erlandson. [...] "Doll Parts" [...] was officially written only by Love and [...] "I <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> Die" [...] was written by Erlandson, Love and Kat Bjelland.

2500|$|Baldwin {{developed}} {{his work on}} the screenplay into the 1972 book One Day, When I Was Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley's The Autobiography of Malcolm X. In 1976, Baldwin wrote of his experience, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather be horsewhipped, or incarcerated in the forthright bedlam of Bellevue, than repeat the adventure". Baldwin died in 1987. Several authors attempted drafts, including David Mamet, David Bradley, Charles Fuller and Calder Willingham. Once Spike Lee took over as director, he rewrote the Baldwin-Perl script. Due to the revisions, the Baldwin family asked the producer to take his name off the credits. Thus Malcolm X only credits Perl and Lee as the writers and Malcolm X and Alex Haley as the authors of The Autobiography of Malcolm X.|$|E
2500|$|After {{recording}} {{her third}} studio album, As I Am, Keys began to [...] "find {{the way to}} totally be myself and what that meant; figuring out what choices I wanted to make and not make in order to truly honor myself". She described The Element of Freedom as diverse, but noted {{that there is a}} [...] "balance". She explained that [...] "one side is strong and one side is vulnerable", which she pointed to as the theme of the album. The album has a [...] "strong, edgy feel", but is also [...] "intimate and vulnerable and delicate". While on BET's 106 & Park, she described the album: [...] "The way that the songs progress [...] are gonna take you on a natural high. I just want you to feel a sense of freedom, I want you to feel out-of-the-box, feel inspired, You're definitely going to be taken on a trip, I know you're going to be shocked, you're going to hear things that you probably didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sound like. It's a journey." [...] Keys revealed to The Times that in the period she was recording the album, she listened to artists such as Genesis, Tears for Fears, Fleetwood Mac and The Police.|$|E
2500|$|On November 8, 1992, {{the band}} {{recorded}} [...] "Beautiful Son," [...] "20 Years in the Dakota" [...] and [...] "Old Age" [...] during a recording session at Word of Mouth Recording in Seattle with producer Jack Endino. The three-song session was later released in April 1993 as Hole's fourth single on the City Slang label. On January 21, 1993, Love and Schemel recorded five demo songs at BMG Ariola Ltda. in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Produced by Craig Montgomery, the session was originally a demo session for Nirvana, who were recording material for their upcoming studio album, In Utero (1993). During breaks in Nirvana's session, Love and Schemel recorded {{a number of}} songs later featured on Live Through This, including [...] "Miss World," [...] "She Walks on Me," [...] "I <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> Die" [...] and [...] "Softer, Softest." [...] The band relocated back to Los Angeles where they recruited former Janitor Joe bassist Kristen Pfaff in early 1993; Pfaff was also an accomplished cellist and music student. Erlandson said of Pfaff's membership: [...] "That's when we took off, {{all of a sudden}} we became a real band." [...] After a brief tour of the United Kingdom in the summer of 1993, the band sent a series of demos to the record label. [...] "When we got the Live Through This demos, I realized very quickly that Hole had gotten a new rhythm section," [...] said producer Sean Slade. [...] "It was much more musical." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later in October, it was {{revealed}} that several other cast members had joined the project, including Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Graham McTavish as Dwalin, Aidan Turner as Kíli, Mark Hadlow as Dori, John Callen as Óin, Stephen Hunter as Bombur and Peter Hambleton as Glóin. On the casting of Armitage, Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "Richard {{is one of the most}} exciting and dynamic actors working on screen today and we know he is going to make an amazing Thorin Oakenshield. We cannot wait to start this adventure with him and feel very lucky that one of the most beloved characters in Middle Earth is in such good hands." [...] McTavish was quoted on his casting, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be very lucky indeed if ever again in my career, I was offered an opportunity that was going to be so iconic in its influence and scale with regards to The Hobbit. I can't think of anything comparable." [...] Following McTavish's casting, scheduling conflicts arose while he was working on , resulting in the game's storyline being modified so that McTavish could go to New Zealand to work on the film. On the casting of Turner, Jackson stated, [...] "Aidan is a wonderfully gifted young actor who hails from Ireland. I'm sure he will bring enormous heart and humor to the role of Kíli." [...] On the casting of Hadlow, Jackson said, [...] "I have worked with Mark Hadlow on many projects he is a fantastic actor. I am thrilled to be working with [...] on these movies." [...] Hadlow also plays Bert the Stone-troll. On his casting Callen stated, [...] "I did wonder about my casting and how they had made the choice—maybe the long hair and the beard sold it, I thought. But now that has all gone. [...] Given that Óin is almost 200years old I can presume only that it was the age." [...] On being cast in the role, Hunter said, [...] "Being cast in The Hobbit is really exciting and really an honour. I auditioned for the original Lord of the Rings way back when I signed with my agent in New Zealand. When I saw the films I thought, 'Man, I so want to do The Hobbit.'" ...|$|E
