5|$|A wait {{of three}} years {{occurred}} between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she denied. Rowling later said that writing the book was a chore, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been shorter, and that {{she ran out of}} time and energy as she tried to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> shaken public confidence on the fairness of the hearing.|$|E
5|$|Co-fusion steel process: Although British {{scientist}} and historian Joseph Needham speculates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> existed beforehand, the first clear written {{evidence of the}} fusion of wrought iron and cast iron to make steel comes from the 6th century AD {{in regards to the}} Daoist swordsmith Qiwu Huaiwen, who was put in charge of the arsenal of Northern Wei general Gao Huan from 543 to 550 AD. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) Newly Reorganized Pharmacopoeia of 659 also described this process of mixing and heating wrought iron and cast iron together, stating that the steel product was used to make sickles and Chinese sabers. In regards to the latter text, Su Song (1020–1101) made a similar description and noted the steel's use for making swords.|$|E

5|$|The Israeli embassy {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} on March 17, 1992. It was perceived {{as a consequence of}} Argentina's involvement in the Gulf War. Although Hezbollah claimed responsibility for it, the Supreme Court investigated several other hypotheses. The Court wrote a report in 1996 suggesting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been the explosion of an arms cache stored in the basement. Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast blame on Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for the attack in May 1999.|$|E
5|$|The legend {{strongly}} {{emphasizes that}} Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of Finland {{which became a}} conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed in Finland out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even mention his burial in Finland. The vita is so void of any concrete information about Finland <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been created anywhere.

5|$|Work on the {{new house}} began in 1685. The {{architect}} {{thought to have been}} responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.|$|E

5|$|Enrique {{steadily}} intensified and {{by early}} on July 16, the National Hurricane Center was anticipating {{for the system}} to reach hurricane intensity. Continuing to strengthen, it reached hurricane status On July 17. However, this was {{for a short period}} of time as it developed an eye. Due to uncertainty in the storm's intensity that day, it is possible <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a hurricane earlier than originally estimated. Wind shear associated with a trough and passage over cooler waters caused Enrique to begin weakening and the cyclone center soon became exposed. Enrique was downgraded to a depression on July 19 and the weakening cyclone crossed into the central Pacific on July 20. Enrique dissipated shortly thereafter. Enrique's remnants managed to maintain a very weak center as it passed well to the north of the Hawaiian Islands and then passed near Midway Island. As the storm approached the International Dateline, the system started to redevelop. Shortly after crossing the dateline, Enrique became a tropical storm again on August 1. It lasted for less than 24 hours before it lost its convection and thus the cyclone began to dissipate. No damages or casualties were caused by Enrique.|$|E
5|$|In November 1970, the Dovre Line was electrified, and {{the last}} steam {{locomotives}} were retired. A long-term plan to electrify half the lines was finished, and for two decades, NSB's operations were very stable with no major investments to infrastructure or closing of lines. NSB had slightly less diesel locomotives than they needed, but plans to order additional Di 3 was never fulfilled. In 1981, NSB took delivery of five Di 4 to supplement the older units. They were mainly used on the Nordland Line, and Di 3 units were predominantly used on the other lines, although they continued to operate som trains on the Nordland Line. On 1 April 1987, a Di 3 612 caught on fire; the damage was small enough <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been repaired, but NSB instead decided to put aside the unit. At the time NSB planned to order additional Di 4, but these plans were put on hold. In 1988, the Valdres Line was closed; {{this was the only}} time a line with Di 3 in regular service was closed.|$|E
5|$|Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi {{was born}} near Qasr Abu Hadi, {{a rural area}} outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of Tripolitania, western Libya. His family came from a small, {{relatively}} uninfluential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa, who were Arabized Berber in heritage. His mother was named Aisha (died 1978), and his father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985); the latter earned a meagre subsistence as a goat and camel herder. Nomadic Bedouins were illiterate and kept no birth records. As such, Gaddafi's date of birth is not known with certainty, and sources have set it in 1942 or {{in the spring of}} 1943, although his biographers David Blundy and Andrew Lycett noted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been pre-1940. His parents' only surviving son, he had three older sisters. Gaddafi's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes {{for the rest of his}} life; he preferred the desert over the city and would retreat there to meditate.|$|E

5|$|On September10, the Television Infrared Observation Satellite {{observed}} {{an area of}} convection, or thunderstorms, to {{the southwest}} of the Cape Verde islands, suggesting the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis. At 18:00UTC that day, a tropical depression formed and subsequently moved on a northwest trajectory. By the time the Hurricane Hunters reached the system on September12, winds of hurricane force were recorded, and as such, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau began issuing warnings on Hurricane Esther. It was later estimated that the system attained tropical storm status on September 11, although the National Hurricane Center later noted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> attained hurricane status by this date, thus potentially being one of four simultaneous hurricanes, along with hurricanes Betsy, Carla, and Debbie. The only other such occasions were in 1893 and 1998. This also made Esther the first hurricane to be discovered by satellite imagery, although {{not the first to}} be imaged by one.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, the Egyptian forces also changed the {{disposition}} of their forces, moving the 9th Battalion to the Ad Halom bridge, the 2nd to Isdud itself, and the 1st to Iraq Suwaydan and Faluja. Heavy machine gun and armored units were dispersed in between. Staff soldiers and those who manned Bren carriers took positions together with regular infantry soldiers. The Israeli side {{did not know of}} this development, but was aware that they had been detected in the previous night's preparations. The army was against attacking Isdud soon, but the order was given by the political echelon. The attack was expected to be a tactical failure; Avraham Ayalon writes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> succeeded if only the southern Egyptian force in Isdud itself was attacked, but attributes that lack of such a plan to the inexperience of the command and the heterogeneous nature of the Israeli force, which according to him could not have pulled off such an offensive.|$|E
5|$|The baronial revolt {{was crushed}} between 1266 and 1267, leaving de Clare free to advance north into Glamorgan from his main base in Cardiff. De Clare started to {{construct}} a castle at Caerphilly to control his new gains in 1268. The castle lay in a basin of the Rhymney Valley, alongside the Rhymney River and {{at the heart of}} network of paths and roads, adjacent to a former Roman fort. Work began at a huge pace, with ditches cut to form the basic shape of the castle, temporary wooden palisades erected and extensive water defences created by damming a local stream. The walls and internal buildings were built at speed, forming {{the main part of the}} castle. The architect of the castle and the precise cost of the construction are unknown, but modern estimates suggest <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> cost as much as castles such as Conwy or Caernarfon, perhaps as much as £19,000, a huge sum for the period.|$|E

5|$|The {{house is}} a timber frame house that was {{originally}} constructed {{on the west side}} of Pine Street, but its original form is not known for sure due the extent of its expansion and remodeling. The NRHP nomination states <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a -story gabled roof cottage with a cross-gable in the center, a style popular during the mid-century in Pawtucket. This original structure retains little of its form except for the Gothic hood moulds on the second floor end windows and the Gothic bargeboards. A two-story hipped roof addition was constructed in two phases, one completed before 1877 and the other between 1895 and 1902. Though the NRHP also states that the original house was enlarged in the late 1860s or 1870s without specification to the work done at the time. The additions include a bay window on the facade and openwork on the porch sides. The later alterations to the building worked to compliment the distinctive bargeboards of the cottage with the work on the eaves and window heads of the addition.|$|E
5|$|The prompt {{accomplishments of}} the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section and Mashbir's {{executive}} ability resulted in Mashbir being promoted to full colonel by General Douglas MacArthur after only one month. Mashbir then joined the forefront of MacArthur's intelligence activities and Japanese surrender negotiations, remaining the Commandant of ATIS until December 1945. He was made famous {{at the time in}} the motion picture and still photograph of the preliminary surrender negotiations at Manila, as the man who pushed the ink-well, indicating that General Richard K. Sutherland should correct the Japanese Instrument of Surrender; and also as the man who thumbed the Japanese Lieutenant General Torashirō Kawabe along as he attempted to shake hands. The second incident provoked some mixed feelings, including sentiment <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> damaged surrender talks. Mashbir also played a critical role retrieving and translating the Z Plan and in organizing the final surrender of Japan. In his autobiography, Mashbir explained that he was not permitted to shake hands, and {{that it would have been}} rude to point, which ultimately lead to the awkward thumbing motion that was photographed.|$|E
5|$|According to the Bannatyne {{manuscript}}, the Fairy Flag {{was also}} unfurled during the Battle of Glendale, which the manuscript states {{to have been}} fought in about 1490. At one point during this conflict, both the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, and the MacLeods of Lewis {{were on the verge}} of giving way to the invading MacDonalds. Just at this moment, the mother of Alasdair Crotach, chief of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, ordered the Fairy Flag to be unfurled. The result was that both MacLeod clans renewed the battle with redoubled fury and, despite immense losses, eventually won the battle. Among the MacLeod dead was the flag bearer, Paul Dubh, who carried the Fairy Flag throughout the conflict until his death. The Bannatyne manuscript relates that Paul Dubh was honourably buried in a deep stone coffin, with a metal grate — much like the account given in the c.1800 manuscript. The writer of the Bannatyne manuscript states that each successive flag bearer was buried within this tomb, and that the writer's own grandfather saw the old ceremony performed for the last time, in the 18th century. The Bannatyne manuscript states that the tomb is located in the north-east corner of the chancel at St Clements Church, in Rodel. R.C. MacLeod noted that there was no trace of such a coffin or tomb; although, he suggested <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been buried or possibly built within a wall.|$|E
