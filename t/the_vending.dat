5|$|The Treasury Department, in {{cooperation}} with the Federal Reserve, undertook a $655,000 marketing campaign to educate bank employees and members of the public about the new coin, and <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> industry engaged in a $100 million effort to retrofit machines to accept the coins.|$|E
5|$|Before Peter is {{preparing}} to leave for jury duty, the family is seen watching a television sitcom entitled How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother, a parody of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, which features Henry Kissinger, whose heavy accent makes his speech unintelligible. Once Peter is dressed for court, he explains that even <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> machines at the courthouse are out of order, with Brian then being shown dressed and laughing {{in a similar manner}} as the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Muttley.|$|E
5|$|The Mint began {{preparation}} for the reduced-diameter dollar coin in 1976. Although no legislation had yet been introduced, Treasury officials anticipated a positive reception from Congress, and the coin had near unanimous support from the Mint and <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> machine industry, an influential lobby {{in the area of}} coin design and creation. In 1977, Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal publicly endorsed a smaller dollar coin and suggested that an allegorical representation of Liberty would be a suitable subject for the coin.|$|E

50|$|The oldest {{settlement}} in Cēsis is the hill fort on Riekstu hill, a fortified wooden castle {{built by a}} tribe known as <b>the</b> <b>Vends.</b> <b>The</b> 18 m mound with its partly preserved fortification system can still {{be seen in the}} Castle Park. This settlement was located near major trade routes from west to east and dominated the regional countryside.|$|R
5|$|The Susan B. Anthony {{dollar is}} a United States dollar coin minted from 1979 to 1981, when {{the series was}} {{suspended}} due to poor public acceptance, and then again in 1999. Proposed as a smaller replacement for the cumbersome Eisenhower dollar, several shapes and compositions were tested, but all were opposed by <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> machine industry, a powerful lobby affecting coin legislation. Finally, a round planchet with an eleven-sided inner border was chosen for the smaller dollar.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is upset}} that his {{daughter}} Jada would rather spend Christmas with her mother than him. At the party, Jada begins to lose interest, but Pam and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) try to find fun activities for her; however, Andy ends up ruining most of them. Darryl then takes her to the break room, where she is impressed with the snacks in <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> machines. They take out the snacks and hand them to employees. When she hands one to Michael, he decides to dress up as Santa again so she can tell him what she wants for Christmas as Holly looks on with admiration.|$|E

Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details an idea he has about cookie placement in <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> machine, but Robert gets the impression that he is extremely clever and is speaking only in metaphors. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed the entire day with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas.|$|E
50|$|According to Livonian Chronicle of Henry {{prior to}} their arrival {{in the area of}} Wenden in the 12th century, <b>the</b> <b>Vends</b> were settled in Ventava county (Wynda) by the Venta River near the present city of Ventspils in western Latvia. Their {{proximity}} to more numerous Finnic and Baltic tribes inclined <b>the</b> <b>Vends</b> to ally with the German crusaders, who began building a stone castle near the older Vendian wooden fortress in 1207. The castle of Wenden later became the residence of the Master of the Livonian Order. The last known record of the Vends' existence as a distinct entity dates from the sixteenth century.|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> Coal <b>Vend</b> was <b>the</b> only cartel prosecuted {{under the}} Australian Industries Preservation Act. There was little {{interest}} or impact in promoting competitive markets {{until the late}} 1960s. [...] The members of <b>the</b> Coal <b>Vend</b> had successfully resisted each of the prosecutions against them. Its role in raising pries and restricting production was challenged by {{a drop in the}} demand for coal such that it collapsed as a cartel by 1912. <b>The</b> Coal <b>Vend</b> continued to exist through to at least 1929, with the Campbell Royal Commission in 1919 finding that that it had ceased to operate outside the law, and the Davidson Royal Commission in 1929 confirmed the continued existence of <b>the</b> Coal <b>Vend,</b> although again there was no suggestion of it operating illegally.|$|R
5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He {{said they did not}} have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E

25|$|A {{vending machine}} is an {{automated}} {{piece of equipment}} wherein customers can drop {{the money in the}} machine which dispenses the customer's selection. <b>The</b> <b>vending</b> machine is a pure self-service option.

25|$|Language {{barriers}} {{also play}} a role. For example, most of the flower vendors in the Market are H'mong; during the difficult negotiations in 1999 over replacing the Hildt Agreement, many were apparently under a misimpression that the proposed agreement would have halved <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> space they received for a day's rent; in fact, this was unchanged.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, the Royal Canadian Mint lent {{a series}} of the new plated 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ issues to <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> {{industry}} for testing purposes.

25|$|As of a {{few years}} ago, Reid–Hillview Airport had vending machines, a pilot's lounge and break room. Santa Clara County passed a new law stating the {{terminal}} would no longer allow unhealthy food or drinks to be sold inside.

25|$|In December 1903, a new Allendale Village Improvement Association was established.

However, all the beautification did not stop burglars from regularly robbing the depot; they often took money from <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> machines. In 1913, the post office moved from the station to a store in town. In 1916, the Allendale Christmas Tree Association was established and began regularly putting a Christmas tree in the Allendale station square. Toilets were installed in March1917.|$|E
25|$|On November 29, 2012, a House {{subcommittee}} met {{to consider}} replacing the dollar bill. This action took {{place after the}} seventh Government Accountability Office report on the subject.

Recent budgets passed by Congress have included provisions to prevent the Treasury Department from spending any of its funds to redesign the one dollar bill, largely because of potential cost impacts on <b>the</b> <b>vending</b> machine industry.|$|E

5000|$|Robin Gollan {{argues in}} The Coalminers of New South Wales that {{anti-competitive}} practices {{developed in the}} coal industry of Australia's Newcastle {{as a result of}} the business cycle. The monopoly was generated by formal meetings of the local management of coal companies agreeing to fix a minimum price for sale at dock. This collusion was known as [...] "The Vend". <b>The</b> <b>Vend</b> ended and was reformed repeatedly during the late 19th century, ending by recession in the business cycle. [...] "The Vend" [...] was able to maintain its monopoly due to trade union assistance, and material advantages (primarily coal geography). During the early 20th century, as a result of comparable monopolistic practices in the Australian coastal shipping business, <b>the</b> <b>Vend</b> developed as an informal and illegal collusion between the steamship owners and the coal industry, eventually resulting in the High Court case Adelaide Steamship Co.
