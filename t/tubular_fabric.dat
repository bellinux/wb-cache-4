50|$|The {{second major}} way of {{manufacturing}} fibre preforms is Braiding. Braiding is {{suited to the}} manufacture of narrow width flat or <b>tubular</b> <b>fabric</b> and is not as capable as weaving {{in the production of}} large volumes of wide fabrics. Braiding is done over top of mandrels that vary in cross-sectional shape or dimension along their length. Braiding is limited to objects about a brick in size. Unlike standard weaving, braiding can produce fabric that contains fibres at 45-degree angles to one another. Braiding three-dimensional fibres can be done using four step, two-step or Multilayer Interlock Braiding.Four step or row and column braiding utilizes a flat bed containing rows and columns of yarn carriers that form the shape of the desired preform. Additional carriers are added to the outside of the array, the precise location and quantity of which depends upon the exact preform shape and structure required. There are four separate sequences of row and column motion, which act to interlock the yarns and produce the braided preform. The yarns are mechanically forced into the structure between each step to consolidate the structure in a similar process to the use of a reed in weaving. Two-step braiding is unlike the four-step process because the two-step includes a large number of yarns fixed in the axial direction and a fewer number of braiding yarns. The process consists of two steps in which the braiding carriers move completely through the structure between the axial carriers. This relatively simple sequence of motions is capable of forming preforms of essentially any shape, including circular and hollow shapes. Unlike the four-step process, the two-step process does not require mechanical compaction the motions involved in the process allows the braid to be pulled tight by yarn tension alone. The last type of braiding is multi-layer interlocking braiding that consists of a number of standard circular braiders being joined together to form a cylindrical braiding frame. This frame has a number of parallel braiding tracks around the circumference of the cylinder but the mechanism allows the transfer of yarn carriers between adjacent tracks forming a multilayer braided fabric with yarns interlocking to adjacent layers. The multilayer interlock braid differs from both the four step and two-step braids in that the interlocking yarns are primarily in the plane of the structure and thus do not significantly reduce the in-plane properties of the preform. The four-step and two-step processes produce a greater degree of interlinking as the braiding yarns travel through the thickness of the preform, but therefore contribute less to the in-plane performance of the preform. A disadvantage of the multilayer interlock equipment is that due to the conventional sinusoidal movement of the yarn carriers to form the preform, the equipment is not able to have the density of yarn carriers that is possible with the two step and four step machines.|$|E

40|$|One form of {{composite}} material {{consists of an}} amorphous matrix (generally a polymer) {{with a set of}} fibres contained in fibre bundles or strands, embedded within it. Often the strands are arranged in an interwoven fabric. Two-dimensional (2 D) braiding provides one means of creating such a fabric.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{versatility}} of {{the textile}} weaving process {{has made it}} a popular method for producing structural composite preforms. Enhanced through-thickness strength by multi-layer weaving, good in-plane strength {{and the ability to}} produce 2. 5 D or 3 D shapes, are some of the advantages which have made weaving the most commonly used textile process for composite applications. It is also possible to incorporate local modifications to the weave patterns and fibre-densities within the woven structure; although this characteristic of weaving has not been completely exploited by the composites industry. It is easy to produce a tubular structure having good bi-directional mechanical properties. Moreover, the preform also can be molded into bent shapes, making the woven composites more versatile than ever before. Drape behavior of such <b>tubular</b> <b>fabrics</b> is complex and has not previously been investigated. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss the manufacturing aspects of such tubular preforms and to suggest ways to overcome the wrinkling problems using the mapping results. In terms of the mapping models, existing shear-based algorithms for mapping a flat fabric over open surfaces are first applied to a closed tubular section. Specific algorithms are developed to map a straight tubular preform over a bent tubular section. Wrinkles are prevalent in sections with severe bends and the paper also discusses methods to remove them...|$|R

40|$|Braided fabrics {{are often}} used to {{reinforce}} composite mate-rials. An advantage of braided fabrics is that the braiding angle can be changed. As the braiding angle affects the fab-ric’s mechanical properties, such as the bending elastic modulus and the maximum bending stress, the mechanical properties can be variously designed by controlling the braiding angle change. In a previous stationary simple model, a braiding angle was predicted by three parameters: the longitudinal veloc-ity of the mandrel, the angular rate of the spindle, and the radius of the cylindrical mandrel as shown in Figure 1. 1 However, when using this approach, a temporal change in braiding angle caused by the mandrel velocity change on a cylindrical <b>tubular</b> braided <b>fabric</b> cannot be predicted.

40|$|AbstractOur {{goal was}} to {{identify}} the most appropriate material for right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduits in growing animals. We used 100 lambs that were 3 to 4 weeks old (mean weight 11. 7 kg). Follow-up was up to 24 months. Group I received plain tubular conduits: (1) Dacron knitted fabric, (2) collagen-coated knitted fabric, (3) Milliknit and Microknit material, (4) woven Dacron fabric, (5) three-dimensional Dacron fabric (crossweave 500 and 800), or (6) polytetrafluoroethylene. Group II received either a (1) woven Dacron fabric conduit with a built-in tissue valve or (2) polytetrafluoroethylene graft with a built-in St. Jude Medical valve. We did angiograms and catheterizations every 3 to 6 months and killed the lambs at 6, 12, 18, or 24 months. <b>Tubular</b> Dacron <b>fabric</b> woven or knitted grafts, regardless of matrix, pore size, thickness, or coating, caused formation of a thick acellular pseudointima buildup, which led to progressive obstruction starting as early as 3 months. Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in groups I and II showed the formation of thin inner and outer capsules (0. 5 mm) and none developed obstruction despite wall calcification. Conduits of woven Dacron fabric with a built-in tissue valve degenerated rapidly, leading to calcification thrombosis and obstruction within 3 months; no lamb survived 12 months.

40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of {{disabling}} deficits is neurological affections. Many times, {{the evolution of the}} condition leads to a diminution of the patient’s life quality. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is part of the neurological rehabilitation process that comprises all the actions one can take in order to increase a patient’s integration and autonomy degree from a social and financial point of view. FES is a method based on substituting the commands that are usually transmitted by the nervous system with an electric impulse. The use of such a method on different body areas required the development of some adequate devices, starting with the stimulator itself and finishing with {{the way in which the}} stimulus is conveyed to the effectors. Textile materials that incorporate sensors and, mainly, the clothing products that have such components in their structure, have a high applicability potential; they can be used for preventing illnesses and for the rehabilitation of seniors, of people who are confined to bed, sportsmen, people who suffer from long-term illnesses, disabled people, thus diminishing the time one spends in the hospital. A possible solution for manufacturing incorporated textile electrodes consists in the insertion of some electro-conductive yarns onto textile surfaces by using a variety of technologies.

40|$|TEXTILE-based {{composite}} materials are the rapidly developing light-weight engineering materials. Fabrics constitute the reinforcement {{component of the}} composite material. The fabrics used in composites manufacture {{are referred to as}} preforms and are especially engineered as a single-fabric system to impart reliability and performance. Preforms constituting continuous-fibres are producible through fabric manufacturing methods of weaving, knitting, braiding and certain nonwoven techniques. A number of novel techniques have evolved, particularly in the last three decades, to engineer 3 D fabrics. However, these new indispensable 3 D fabric manufacturing methods, which have been primarily devised to organize and assemble essentially three orthogonal sets of yarn (in the fabric-length, -width and thickness directions), have not been a matter of examination from the point of textile technology. A consequence of this has been the misrepresentation of a unique nonwoven 3 D fabric-forming principle and process as 3 D-weaving. The lack of proper technical information, terms and definitions have led to the mistaken classification of the patents of the various nonwoven 3 D fabric manufacturing developments in the weaving category over the years. To represent the nonwoven 3 D fabric-forming processes as 3 D-weaving is technically not correct even if they bear certain similarities with the weaving process design. This is because in these new processes, the foremost operation of shedding, which is central to the weaving principle and without which the weaving process cannot technically progress, is totally dispensed with. Consequently the obtaining process ceases to comply with the principle of weaving and the resulting 3 D fabric is a non-interlaced construction. Clearly this non-interlacing process happens to be fundamentally different from the firmly established interlacing characteristics of the weaving process. The nonwoven 3 D fabric-forming process is now recognized by the term 'noobing' and it is designed essentially to assemble three orthogonal sets of yarn, without interlacing them, into a 3 D fabric. With this, the constituent yarns of the fabric are free of any crimp. In the absence of any interlacement, the fabric integrity has to be realized through a compulsory binding operation. Because the fabric integrity results from the outermost opposite `interconnected yarns', there is the risk of the fabric splitting up if cut at the surface or internally. The development of an experimental noobing device has upheld these integral characteristics. The noobing process can be classified into uniaxial and multiaxial types, of which the former is comprehensively analysed here as this process type has been mistaken for the 3 D-weaving process. The newly gained understanding shows this process could be utilized in the production of certain technical textiles other than preforms as it has a limited near-net shaping capability to produce few `simple' solid cross-sectional profiles. This process can also be employed to produce thick-walled <b>tubular</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The multiaxial noobing process, which has been regarded as multiaxial warp `knitting' process, does not figure in the main focus of the present study. To characterize the practically unknown 3 D-weaving process, the concept of 'dual-directional shedding' operation is introduced. The shedding operation of the conventional 2 D-weaving process is limited in its design to form a shed in only the fabric-width direction to enable interlacement of two orthogonal sets of yarn (a weft and either a single or a multiple layer warp). In the 3 D-weaving process, the dual-directional shedding operation forms multiple sheds in the fabric-width and also the fabric-thickness direction to effect interlacement of three orthogonal sets of yarn (two orthogonal sets of weft and a multilayer warp). Two distinct dual-directional shedding methods have been developed to demonstrate the practicability of the new concept. These methods have been specifically developed to provide `yarn-to-yarn interconnectivity' for producing a network-like 3 D woven 3 D fabric block. From such a block, preforms of any desired shape, not only cross-sectional profile, could be cut without the risk of its splitting. Such a course of preform manufacture, referred to as universal preforming, could be a new approach to produce preforms for certain composite material applications...|$|R
