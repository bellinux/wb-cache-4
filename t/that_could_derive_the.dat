40|$|Already in the 19 th century, d’Auria {{described}} a discharge measurement technique that applies floats {{to find the}} depth-integrated velocity (d’Auria, 1882). The basis of this technique was that the horizontal distance that the float travels {{on its way to}} the surface is the image of the integrated velocity profile over depth. Viol and Semenov (1964) improved this method by using air bubbles as floats, but still distances were measured manually until Sargent (1981) introduced a technique <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>derive</b> <b>the</b> distances from two photographs simultaneously taken from each side of the river bank. Recently, modern image processing techniques proved to further improve the applicability of the method (Hilgersom and Luxemburg, 2012). In the 2012 article, controlling and determining the rising velocity of an air bubble still appeared a major challenge for the application of this method. Ever since, laboratory experiments with different nozzle and tube sizes lead to advances in our self-made equipment enabling us to produce individual air bubbles with a more constant rising velocity. Also, we introduced an underwater camera to on-site determine the rising velocity, which is dependent on the water temperature and contamination, and therefore is site-specific. Camera measurements of the rising velocity proved successful in a laboratory and field setting, although some improvements to the setup are necessary to capture the air bubbles also at depths where little daylight penetrates.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{investigation}} of the response of Catharanthus roseus shoots to salinity (control, 100 and 150 mM) and drought (control, two-weeks-regime and three-weeks-regime) {{for a period of}} 4 months. Total proteins, amino acids, proline and vincristine alkaloid contents were estimated before and after stress. Both salinity and drought reduced the amount of shoot total proteins while increased the amount of total amino acids which has been attributed to enhanced protein degradation and/or de novo synthesis of amino acids. Accumulation of proline after both stresses supported the previously recorded correlation between cellular proline levels and the capacity to survive environmental stresses. Salinity and drought resulted in increased amounts of the amino acids serine, methionine and arginine, which are considered precursors for the synthesis of glycinebetaine, nicotinamide and putrescine that are commonly encountered osmolytes that accumulates in plants under salinity and drought stresses. Vincristine alkaloid content increased with two peaks at 150 mM salinity at the 2 nd month of treatment and at the 4 th month of the highest drought level. The increase in vincristine content was attributed to the raised levels of arginine subsequent to stress <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>derive</b> <b>the</b> biosynthesis of putrescine.

50|$|In 1905, it {{had been}} shown by Henri Poincaré and Albert Einstein that the Lorentz {{transformation}} must form a group to satisfy the principle of relativity (see History of Lorentz transformations).

Kennedy and Thorndike now argued <b>that</b> they <b>could</b> <b>derive</b> <b>the</b> complete Lorentz transformation solely from the experimental data of the Michelson-Morley experiment and the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment. But this is not strictly correct, since length contraction and time dilation having their exact relativistic values are sufficient but not necessary for the explanation of both experiments. This is because length contraction solely {{in the direction of}} motion is only one possibility to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment. In general, its null result requires that the ratio between transverse and longitudinal lengths corresponds to the Lorentz factor - which includes infinitely many combinations of length changes in the transverse and longitudinal direction. This also affects the role of time dilation in the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment, because its value depends on the value of length contraction used in the analysis of the experiment. Therefore, it's necessary to consider a third experiment, the Ives-Stilwell experiment, in order to <b>derive</b> <b>the</b> Lorentz transformation from experimental data alone.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: IL- 21, a {{new member}} of the type 1 {{cytokine}} superfamily, is produced by various subsets of CD 4 (+) T cells and binds to a composite receptor that consists of a specific receptor, termed IL- 21 receptor and the common γ-chain subunit. Initially {{considered to be a}} critical regulator of T and B cell function, IL- 21 is now known to regulate the activity of many other cell types, including both immune and non-immune cells. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss the biological features of IL- 21 and summarize recent advances in the pathogenic role of IL- 21 in chronic inflammatory diseases. Moreover, we discuss why IL- 21 blockers can have a place in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with immune-mediated diseases and the potential risks of such treatments. EXPERT OPINION: Data emerging from studies in human and experimental models of autoimmunity suggest that IL- 21 is critically involved in the initiation and/or progression of inflammatory reactions where self-reactive immune cells or antibodies cause damage in tissue. Thus, theoretically, targeting IL- 21 could help attenuate the activation of inflammatory pathways and facilitate the resolution of tissue damaging immune responses. However, one should also take into consideration some potential risks <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>derive</b> from <b>the</b> blockade of IL- 21...|$|R

In this study, relating turf grass area to fractional impervious surface area, it was estimated that potentially 163, 812 km 2 (± 35, 850 km 2) of land are cultivated with some form of lawn in the continental United States, an area three times larger than that of any irrigated crop.

40|$|Near {{the poles}} of the Moon, there are {{permanently}} shadowed craters whose surface temperatures never exceed 100 K. Craters within craters, {{commonly referred to}} as double-shaded craters, have areas where even colder regions exist with, in many cases, temperatures that should never exceed 50 K. The presence of water ice possibly existing in permanently shaded areas of the moon has been hypothesized, discussed, and studied since Watson et al. [1] predicted the possibility of ice on the moon. Ingersoll et al. [2] estimated that the maximum sublimation rate for ice is less than 1 cm per billion years for these types of environments. These potential ice stores have many uses for lunar exploration, potentially providing precious water and rocket fuel for any human exploration or future colonization.

Key concepts like “knowledge representation”, metadata, conceptual modeling, syntactic or semantic interoperability, ontologies, can prove difficult to understand (and even more difficult to apply) for researchers with a background in the humanities. This contribution, therefore, aims at clarifying the theoretical reference framework through the concrete analysis of archaeological materials. In fact, while it seems easier to borrow definitions and theoretical concepts or to artificially create even very complex conceptual models (e. g. the CIDOC CRM, which has recently been recognised as an ISO standard), it is a lot harder to implement such principles onto real world objects analysis. According to this assessment, and to the need of going from theoretical to practical aspects, the paper is structured in three parts: the first offers a theoretical base that makes available, even for non-experts, the tools for addressing more operational aspects; the second describes, through practical examples, both the knowledge representation model and the software tool used for analysing a class of materials, the Etruscan urns, as shown in the third part. The final objective is, therefore, to provide a point of reference for facilitating the approach towards KM (Knowledge Management) and help clarifying the key elements of a discipline that is obtaining a growing success but, so far, still showing a high level of entropy...|$|R
