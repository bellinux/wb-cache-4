30|$|The article {{points out}} the major {{importance}} of <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> hubs within freight transport and, thus, underpins {{the fact that they}} should also be considered sufficiently in freight demand models.

30|$|Regarding {{the models}} that {{integrate}} <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> hubs {{there are also}} differences {{in the types of}} <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> hubs that are considered. There are a) noticeable differences between the models and the considered hubs. Some <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> hubs occur more often in models (e.g., terminals for combined transport, sea ports or rail ports) but there are, however, also a lot of hub types that are not considered (e.g., transhipment hubs of freight forwarders) – even not by the models that can be considered as the most up-to-date ones. Furthermore, there is b) only one approach (SAMGODS/NEMO) that integrates all relevant types of hubs that are important in freight transport.|$|R
30|$|Goods {{transport}} {{is increasingly}} managed and handled by <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> hubs. In Germany, for instance, nearly two billion tons are handled in terminals and warehouses {{each year and}} related operations account for around 10  % of the logistics market turnover. Beside large <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> hubs like seaports or airports {{there is a big}} number of smaller but very important <b>logistics</b> <b>transport</b> hubs like these of freight forwarding networks, which handle around 200 million shipments each year [23]. These data underpin the importance of <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> hubs within the transport process. Their empirical significance, therefore, constitutes the relevance to integrate hub related transport processes in demand modelling because such integration ensures higher accuracy and more realistic sensitivity in order to assess policy measures related to logistics.|$|R
30|$|Secondly, the {{analysis}} of the models presented in this article revealed that integrating logistics aspects does not always include the integration of logistics hubs – regardless what type of hub. The conclusion that a model integrates logistics does not always hit the mark in this manner, because logistics comprise several aspects and components – such as the utilization of <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> hubs. A more detailed view is appropriate here, so that we had to expand the horizon on the integration of logistics in modelling by adding the specific focus of the integration of <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> hubs. This expansion is of major importance because <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> hubs are highly relevant in <b>transport</b> and <b>logistics</b> processes (see chapter 2) – so they are for adequate freight transport modelling in order to assess policy measures realistic.|$|R

30|$|Using {{new data}} {{containing}} the attributes mentioned above {{will help to}} derive key parameters in order to discover correlations and dependencies between certain hub characteristics and the specific role of hubs in the transport process.

40|$|Understanding <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> trends as a {{basis for}} {{sustainable}} transport policymaking is a growing research field. Within this field, a focus on <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> needs of innovative firms has received hardly any attention despite their greater importance to sustainable economic growth compared with non-innovative firms. This research addressed this gap by determining the evolution of <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> patterns and characteristics of innovative firms in the small-scale economy of Tasmania, Australia, for the period 2002 - 03 to 2005 - 06. The main implications of this evolution for public transport policymaking, although not representing a major focus of the research, were also identified. To achieve its aim, the research included a comparative assessment between innovative and non-innovative firms in terms of their freight transport intensity and contribution to Tasmanian economic growth. The objective of the research was to provide a missing link in the knowledge chain of transport policymaking that would assist transport policymakers in understanding current and future <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> needs of innovative firms. This, in turn, could enable the development of sustainable transport policies that meet such needs and support the competitiveness and growth of innovative firms, and hence the growth of the economy. The methodology of the research consisted of an industry-based and logistics-oriented quantitative analysis developed within the boundaries of a broader methodological framework in the research field of identifying logistics trends. The analysis was applied on two secondary datasets. The first dataset consisted of the land freight tasks in 2002 - 03 and 2005 - 06 provided by the Tasmanian Department of Infrastructure Energy and Resources. The second dataset was from the Tasmanian innovation census for the period 2004 to 2006 provided by the Australian Innovation Research Centre of the University of Tasmania. The research found that innovative Tasmanian firms were more export-oriented, contributed more to economic growth, and were more freight-intensive, than the general population of firms. It also found that innovative Tasmanian firms had distinctive <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> patterns and characteristics, and hence distinctive <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> requirements. In particular, they were more intensive users of road/rail intermodal transport, and their <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> characteristics in general are becoming increasingly more suitable for intermodal transport. Overall, the findings imply that the capacity of innovative firms to contribute to sustainable economic growth would be enhanced through long-term transport policymaking tailored to their distinctive needs. For Tasmania, this could be achieved by centring transport policymaking on the development of a small-scale intermodal transport system that could accommodate changes in the <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> needs created by the dynamics of supply chain management of innovative firms. A further issue is whether innovative firms have distinctive inherent characteristics from a <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> perspective and this too calls for further investigation...|$|R
40|$|With China’s {{emergence}} as a global manufacturing centre, reshaping the country’s logistics industry is assuming a global dimension too. The Chinese transport sector, despite its tremendous potential in facilitating the economic development of the country, is plagued with problems of insufficient infrastructure; overlapping regulatory authority; operational inefficiencies {{and a lack of}} logistics culture. The thesis shows that China urgently needs to restructure the architecture of its transport industry by incorporating logistics thinking and by embodying the strategic objectives of logistics development. Restructuring the architecture of <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> (ATL) aims to improve, the mechanism of integrated operations and planning, as well as the development of <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> infrastructure and facilities. Based on experiences from developed economies as a reference, and by integrating its own conditions and situation, the thesis argues that China needs to strengthen co-ordination and harmonization among the various components of its logistics system. The architecture of <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> (ATL) consists of an integrated and coordinated system. The main function of the system is to accelerate interaction and coordination among <b>transport</b> <b>logistics</b> enterprises, government agencies, and relevant institutions at national level.
