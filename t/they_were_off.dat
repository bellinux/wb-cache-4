5|$|By July Bellerophon {{was part}} of a {{squadron}} commanded by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS Implacable. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> Percola Point on 7 July when a flotilla of eight Russian gunboats was sighted. A boat party led by Lieutenant Hawkey of Implacable made an attempt to cut-out the vessels that evening. Hawkey was killed in the attempt, but Bellerophons Lieutenant Charles Allen took over command, and six of the gunboats were captured, and a seventh destroyed, with 12 craft containing stores for the Russian Army also being taken. Bellerophon made several cruises {{during the rest of the}} year, visiting the Åland Islands and Karlskrona, before returning to Britain with a convoy in November 1809.|$|E

All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick at Cambridge in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new Laboratory of Molecular Biology.

25|$|When the {{aircraft}} was on final, the pilots received several warnings from ATC {{that they were}} 1000–2000 meters {{to the left of}} the landing course, followed by another warning that they were too low. The pilots were confused about their location and were trying to figure it out based on reports from ATC, the flight computer and a portable GPS device. According to the final investigation report, they also ignored automatic altitude readouts that started at 60 m above ground level and continued every 10 m. Nine seconds before the impact, the pilot contacted ATC to ask if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> course, still concentrated on aligning {{the aircraft}} with the runway and not on its altitude. The pilots made no effort to stop the descent.|$|E

Carpenter with the ship reported for duty on the European Station at Smyrna (now Izmir) on the Aegean Sea on June 7, 1897. In July, Carpenter and the officers and men participated in a good-will tour of Moroccan ports. By August, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> Italy, {{then returned to the}} western Mediterranean. During this time period Carpenter learned military deportment and social skills. Through December, the ship operated off the Levant and {{toward the end of the}} month transited the Suez Canal en route to the Asiatic Station. On 18 February 1898, she reached Hong Kong where she joined Commodore James Dewey's Asiatic squadron.|$|E

25|$|When the two {{submarines}} arrived <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> Mendoza Island (now Shenggao Island) at {{the entrance}} of the bay. The two then split up, L4 went to patrol around the entrance of the bay and Halahan ordered L5 to patrol within. Bias Bay is surrounded by rocks and that night there was a fleet of fishing junks sheltering inside and constantly moving around the anchorage. Both the rocks and the junks made it difficult for the British to monitor the area without being detected though they succeeded in doing so and on the morning of 20 October they encountered the Irene steaming off Cake Island. She had been taken over by at least eighteen pirates armed with automatic pistols. It was still dark so the L4 was surface cruising with a crew at the 4-inch (102-mm) gun and another pair at the vessel's searchlight. Lieutenant Halahan knew that torpedoes were not helpful in recapturing a pirate held ship but he did have a 4-inch (102-mm) deck gun. Then the Irene was spotted so Halahan maneuvered his submarine into position for firing and when the order was given, the search light was turned on and the gun crew fired a blank warning shot at the steamer. When the shot was ignored a second live round was fired and it blew a hole straight through the ship and killed a pirate who was standing on deck.|$|E

500|$|The convoy {{encountered}} a strong storm on 4 October that got even stronger {{over the next}} several days; by the morning of 6 October it was assessed as a Force 11 storm on the Beaufort scale with mountainous seas. The storm forced the British destroyers that were to rendezvous with them back into port on 5 October and the last American escort departed at 06:00. The weather prevented accurate navigation and the convoy was forced to proceed by dead reckoning. The ship's officers were uncertain if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>off</b> the northern coast of Ireland or the western coast of Scotland. When dawn broke it revealed a rocky coastline [...] to their east, just ahead of the convoy. Most of the ships correctly thought this was the Scottish coast and turned south, but Otrantos officer of the deck thought that it was the Irish coast and turned north. , another liner turned troopship, was only about a half mile (0.80 km) to Otrantos north and the turns placed them on a collision course. Both ships attempted to avoid the collision, but their efforts cancelled out and Kashmir rammed Otranto on the port side amidships, a few miles off the rocky coast of Islay.|$|E
