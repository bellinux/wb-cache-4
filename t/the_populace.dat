50|$|The nationalists had {{committed}} a serious blunder before the campaign had even begun in {{that due to}} the political and psychological propaganda reasons, they had refused to evacuate the city, partially to avoid panic. <b>The</b> local <b>populace</b> was not allowed by the defenders {{to leave the city}} to surrender to the attacking enemy either and thus when the battle had begun, there were simply not enough transportation assets to evacuate everyone so <b>the</b> stranded <b>populace</b> felt helpless and abandoned.
