25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to have made her, {{for the first time in}} her young life, fully aware of the serious, even deadly, nature of her succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, she dressed in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy splendor of the other ladies present, as if she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> down the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Douglas {{was a major}} box-office star, playing {{opposite}} some of {{the leading}} actresses of that era.

The film, written by Dalton Trumbo, was respected by critics, but did not do well {{at the box office}} due to poor marketing and distribution.|$|E
25|$|The {{counterpart}} to the slave was the dandy, a common {{character in the}} afterpiece. He was a northern urban black man <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> above his station by mimicking white, upper-class speech and dress—usually to no good effect. Dandy characters often went by Zip Coon, after the song popularized by George Washington Dixon, although others had pretentious names like Count Julius Caesar Mars Napoleon Sinclair Brown. Their clothing was a ludicrous parody of upper-class dress: coats with tails and padded shoulders, white gloves, monocles, fake mustaches, and gaudy watch chains. They spent their time primping and preening, going to parties, dancing and strutting, and wooing women.|$|E

[...] After Emily fails to push Anya into the well, Anya drops the bone back in. [...] Emily then possesses her own skeleton, and climbs out to give further chase.

500|$|Another main {{theme is}} {{regarding}} the [...] "yōkais choice". As {{agents of the}} city, the two karas represent different paths {{for the good of}} the city. The yōkai have to make a choice to support one of them. By following Eko, the humans are enslaved, and the presence of the yōkai will be imposed on them. By standing behind Otoha, the yōkai accept their lot and continue <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with the humans. Using the yōkai-human relationship as an analogy for human-human interaction, the team suggested people should be open and make the move, instead of passively staying in the background hoping for results. Ibira applied this to decision making, saying when faced with difficult choices, one should make a decision instead of hoping for others to make it for them.|$|E

The team (which included approximately 18 core members during development of NOLF) was determined not to make the same mistakes again with their next game. Describing the pressure on Monolith, Hubbard said that they [...] "were still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> down the stigma" [...] of their 1998 game, , which had been prematurely released buggy and unpolished, and that the company [...] "had a lot to prove, both to ourselves and the gaming public." ...|$|E

500|$|Delsin's Native American {{heritage}} {{came from}} the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population. Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where {{four of the six}} team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: [...] "What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What would he do with it?". Harper considered Delsin [...] "full of reckless abandon", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin [...] "flawed in a way I think a lot of us can relate to", <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up to his successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a [...] "hero's journey".|$|E
500|$|... "The Only Exception" [...] was {{released}} {{as the third}} single from the band's 2009 studio album Brand New Eyes in February 2010.

Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "a subtle, Radiohead-esque ballad." [...] The song's lyrics pertain to the protagonist not believing that love exists and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> without it, mainly to avoid rejection, but eventually realizing that it does exist, describing the person as being their [...] "only exception". Many fans believe that the song was written as an ode to Chad Gilbert from New Found Glory. Incidentally, Williams has declined to comment directly on the issue, merely saying, [...] "Read a couple blogs, and you'll figure it out." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{three main}} playable {{characters}} of Final Fantasy X-2 are Yuna, Rikku and Paine, whose team is abbreviated in-game as [...] "YRP" [...] ("YuRiPa" [...] {{in the original}} Japanese version). Yuna and Rikku reprise their roles from Final Fantasy X, and, though their personalities are {{much the same as}} before, Square decided that their appearances would be heavily altered to give a greater impression of activity. Furthermore, it was decided that the pervading cultural changes occurring in Final Fantasy Xs world as they and others began <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> positively would be reflected in the new clothing of these two characters. The character of Paine is a new creation designed for inclusion in Final Fantasy X-2, to accommodate the game's intended action-adventure style revolving around a trio of female characters. Her personality is far more cynical and emotionally distant than that of her teammates, and she keeps her past a secret from them for much of the game.|$|E
