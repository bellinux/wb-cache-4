5|$|The {{bill had}} a more {{difficult}} time in the Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment <b>to</b> <b>emasculate</b> Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E

40|$|A {{previously}} unknown polyamine conjugate that accumulates in senescing ovaries of pea (Pisum sativum L.) was shown by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and chemical synthesis to be N 4 -hexanoylspermidine (hexanoyl-spd) This structure was indicated by {{analysis of the}} dansylated polyamine using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, following purification by high-performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, acid hydrolysis of the compound yielded spermidine and hexanoic acid. 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance suggested that spermidine was substituted at N 4 in the conjugate. Hexanoyl-spd was synthesized, and its didansyl derivative was shown to have an identical mass spectrum and high-performance liquid chromatography retention time as the derivatized natural compound. Further confirmation of its structure was obtained by comparison of the synthetic and natural polyamines as trifluoroacetyl derivatives using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This new polyamine conjugate is present in pea ovaries at low levels at anthesis and its concentration remains low in developing seeded fruit or in parthenocarpic fruit that have been induced by application of growth regulators <b>to</b> <b>emasculated</b> flowers or by topping the plant.

40|$|The {{effect of}} open, self and cross {{pollination}} {{within and between}} three cultivars of pomegranate, namely: Khob El-Jamil, Taiefe and Al-madina on fruit set, seed number, fruit quality and yield were studied for two consecutive years. Percent of male and perfect flowers varied considerably according to the cultivar. The proportions of male to perfect flowers were 0. 12, 0. 35 and 0. 37 for Khob El-Jamil, Taiefe and Al-madina cvs., respectively. Lowest pollen viability percentage was in Al-madina and the highest pollen viability was in Khob El-Jamil cultivar. Hand self pollination (HSP) in Khob El-Jamil cultivar increased fruit set percentage, followed by hand cross pollination with pollen grains from Taiefe or Al-madina cultivars (HCPT and HCPM). Results of fruit set percentages and seed number per fruit revealed that a partial self incompatibility was existing in Al-madina cultivar. A certain degree of cross incompatibility was found when Al-madina as seed parent was pollinated with Taiefe cultivar. Hand self pollination in Khob El-Jamil and Taiefe cvs. gave higher yield compared to other pollinizers. Application of pollen from Khob El-Jamil <b>to</b> <b>emasculated</b> flowers of Al-Madina cultivar significantly affected the weight, volume and size of fruits when compared with pollen of aiefe cultivar.

60|$|Even if this {{ultimatum}} {{had been}} accepted, there {{would still have}} remained {{the difficulty of the}} Land bill, of which Mr. Chamberlain had announced that he would move the rejection. In the face of ever-growing embarrassments and importunities, recourse was had to the usual device of a meeting of the party at the foreign office (May 27). The circular calling the meeting was addressed to those liberals who, while retaining full freedom on all particulars in the bill, were “in favour of the establishment of a legislative body in Dublin for the management of affairs specifically and exclusively Irish.” This was henceforth to be the test of party membership. A man who was for an Irish legislative body was expected to come to the party meeting, and a man who was against it was expected to stay (M122) away. Many thought this discrimination a mistake. Some two hundred and twenty members attended. The pith of the prime minister’s speech, which lasted for an hour, came to this: that the government would not consent <b>to</b> <b>emasculate</b> the principle of the bill, or turn it into a mockery, a delusion, and a snare; that members who did not wholly agree with the bill, might still in accordance with the strict spirit of parliamentary rules vote for the second reading with a view to its amendment in committee; that such a vote would not involve support of the Land bill; that he was ready to consider any plan for the retention of the Irish members, provided that it did not interfere with the liberty of the Irish legislative body, and would not introduce confusion into the imperial parliament. Finally, as to procedure—and here his anxious audience fell almost breathless—they could either after a second reading hang up the bill, and defer committee until the autumn; or they could wind up the session, prorogue, and introduce the bill afresh with the proper amendments in October. The cabinet, he told them, inclined to the later course.|$|E
60|$|During {{the night}} it rained, {{and the next}} day (17th) was very stormy, with much hail and snow. We rode across the island to the neck of land which joins the Rincon del Tor (the great {{peninsula}} at the south-west extremity) {{to the rest of the}} island. From the great number of cows which have been killed, there is a large proportion of bulls. These wander about single, or two and three together, and are very savage. I never saw such magnificent beasts; they equalled in the size of their huge heads and necks the Grecian marble sculptures. Captain Sulivan informs me that the hide of an average-sized bull weighs forty-seven pounds, whereas a hide of this weight, less thoroughly dried, is considered as a very heavy one at Monte Video. The young bulls generally run away for a short distance; but the old ones do not stir a step, except to rush at man and horse; and many horses have been thus killed. An old bull crossed a boggy stream, and took his stand on the opposite side to us; we in vain tried to drive him away, and failing, were obliged to make a large circuit. The Gauchos in revenge determined <b>to</b> <b>emasculate</b> him and render him for the future harmless. It was very interesting to see how art completely mastered force. One lazo was thrown over his horns as he rushed at the horse, and another round his hind legs: in a minute the monster was stretched powerless on the ground. After the lazo has once been drawn tightly round the horns of a furious animal, it does not at first appear an easy thing to disengage it again without killing the beast: nor, I apprehend, would it be so if the man was by himself. By the aid, however, of a second person throwing his lazo so as to catch both hind legs, it is quickly managed: for the animal, as long as its hind legs are kept outstretched, is quite helpless, and the first man can with his hands loosen his lazo from the horns, and then quietly mount his horse; but the moment the second man, by backing ever so little, relaxes the strain, the lazo slips off the legs of the struggling beast which then rises free, shakes himself, and vainly rushes at his antagonist.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Biology, 2009 The {{flowers of}} the California pitcher plant, Darlingtonia californica, are unusual {{and have been}} the subject of much speculation. Despite the efforts of several workers, the {{pollination}} ecology of this plant, including the identities of pollinators, remains enigmatic. Along with determining visitation frequency, this study sought to describe the relative contributions of two documented floral visitors, bees and spiders. Fruit and seed production by emasculated flowers were used to estimate levels of cross-pollination in natural populations of D. californica. Under the assumption that bees predominantly act as cross-pollinators and spiders as self-pollinators, this treatment was used to infer which organisms were responsible for pollen transfer. Levels of pollen-limitation were also assessed at five study sites in northwest California. In order to identify floral visitors, extensive pollinator surveys were conducted. A generalist solitary bee, Andrena nigrihirta, was found to visit D. californica flowers near Scott Mountain and Mt. Eddy, CA. Despite relatively low visitation rates, individual flowers at all study sites were expected to receive at least one visit by A. nigrihirta. Other regular floral visitors included thrips and several species of spiders. Fruit and seed production by emasculated flowers indicated the occurrence of cross-pollination. Unmanipulated flowers produced more fruits and seeds, on average, compared <b>to</b> <b>emasculated</b> blooms, suggesting that self-pollination contributes to D. californica reproductive success as well. While bees were likely responsible for the majority of cross-pollination, both bees and spiders contributed to autogamous pollen transfer. Following observations of floral visits by A. nigrihirta, it was possible to interpret the functional morphology of D. californica???s flowers. The shape of D. californica???s ovary and petals promote stigma contact both when pollinators enter and exit a flower, contrary to previous thought. This system provides an excellent example of the importance of identifying and observing pollinators in order to truly understand the functional significance of a plant???s floral morphology...|$|R
