She was talking to an older man who's, initially, very irritated by her being there, but eventually takes her very, very seriously. There's a touching moment where he acknowledges <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> face. It's very touching and sad, and I think that's what it's about.

Carter is the first female character to headline a standalone story {{as part of the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), ahead of popular comic characters such as Black Widow and Captain Marvel. Unlike other major Marvel heroes, Carter does not have any superpowers, instead the writers [...] "always said her superpower is the fact that other people underestimate her. And she often uses <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> advantage, because she doesn’t have superstrength." [...] Atwell said it was [...] "thrilling" [...] to explore [...] "the backdrop of this male-dominated world, where women are still in the workforce, unspoken for and struggling to find a place outside the home" [...] and how it affects Carter, who must deal with this along with the missions she receives. For Carter's costumes, though some vintage pieces were used, most of her outfits were custom made to accommodate the scripted action scenes. Costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton gave the outfits an [...] "hourglass style with strength in the tailoring and defined shoulders, but not overly exaggerated." [...] For the character's tactical gear, World War II underground military looks were referenced. Gabriella Graves portrays a young Carter.|$|E

2500|$|Curator Heather Campbell Coyle {{compared}} it to Michelangelo's The Dream (c.1533) and Francisco Goya's Capricho 43: The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters (1799). In Sparhawk-Jones' painting, the dreamer is a sleeping nude woman surrounded by images that seem to reflect her eerie nightmare. A skeleton lies against a stone in the foreground and above her nude women are carried by [...] "winged creatures" [...] into the darkness. Women are also carried away by men with wings, dressed in business suits. The painting has a composition similar to Michelangelo's painting, but Coyle states <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> the work is more similar to Goya's painting that also includes winged creatures above the sleeping subject of the painting.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Europe" [...] {{may be used}} in one {{of several}} {{different}} contexts by British and Irish people: either to refer to the whole of the European continent, to refer to only to Mainland Europe, sometimes called [...] "continental Europe" [...] or simply [...] "the Continent" [...] by some people in the archipelago. Europe may also be used in reference to the European Union (or, historically, to the European Economic Community). A comedic treatment of the different uses of this word appears in an episode of the BBC sitcom To the Manor Born. When tradesmen are taking measurements in metric, and Audrey fforbes-Hamilton objects {{on the grounds that the}} house was built [...] "in feet and inches", a tradesman says [...] "We're in Europe now", referring to the European Economic Community.

The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony [...] "had a very selective memory" [...] which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. [...] "That a mother would want to do something like <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> child just because she wanted to go out and party," [...] he said. [...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E
