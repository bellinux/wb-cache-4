The start of the 1990–91 season in the Third Division marked the first time Stoke had played at this level in 63 years. Ball kept his job for the start of this campaign but departed in February 1991 {{in the midst of an}} indifferent season that saw Stoke finish in <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> league position of 14th.|$|E

By 1983, overall economic growth was stronger, and inflation and mortgage rates had fallen to <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> levels in 13 years, although manufacturing employment as a share of total employment fell to just over 30%, with total unemployment remaining high, peaking at 3.3million in 1984.|$|E
5|$|By 2002, Machine Head {{had sold}} over 1.3 million albums worldwide, and overall Supercharger (mixed by Colin Richardson) {{would go on}} to sell 250,000 copies worldwide, which was <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> selling album to date. Once the tour for the album had been completed, Machine Head and Roadrunner Records {{mutually}} decided to sever ties with regards to distribution in North America and around the world, however to fill the ties, the band released Hellalive (also mixed by Colin Richardson) which was a recording of a Brixton Academy, London set.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{the waters}} of Beaver Lake once again receded to <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> level since 1984, just above 1,100feet (335m). This {{generated}} a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted {{to the edge of}} the lake to explore the remains.

On the B soprano clarinet, the concert pitch of the lowest note is D3, a whole tone lower than the written pitch.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no known}} {{effective}} control measures for invasive Caprellamutica populations as of 2012. It {{has been suggested}} that the seasonal population fluctuations may be taken advantage of. Eradication efforts done during the winter months when C.mutica populations are dormant and at <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> numbers, are potentially more effective in preventing their recovery during the summer months. Because of the great difficulty in detecting and removing them, however, control methods will likely focus on preserving native species populations rather than the eradication of established C. mutica.|$|E

Partway through the Canucks' second game of February, Kassian was {{replaced}} on the top line by Alexandre Burrows. Kassian was dropped to the third line. Despite Kassian surpassing his goal total from his rookie season, the Sedins started the year with <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> output in nearly ten years, combining for 14 {{points in the first}} 10 games. Coinciding with the line changes, Vancouver went on a six-game winning streak between the end of January and their February 12 game. After the last game of their winning streak, the Canucks were expecting Kesler to return to line-up.|$|E
5|$|For the 2006 season, the C Trophy was reorganised {{to include}} a {{round-robin}} stage instead of being entirely knock-out. Whereas Ireland had only one match guaranteed in the tournament before, they now had more fixtures against English county sides. Ireland recorded one win in their nine matches. Ireland participated in the competition until it was restructured again in 2009. In that time they played 25 matches and won two. The latter of those victories was against Worcestershire; in that match Ireland bowled Worcestershire out for 58, which was <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> ever one-day total. It {{was the first time}} that Ireland had bowled out a county for less than 100. Ireland were invited to participate in the reformatted competition from 2010 onwards, but chose not to do so, and instead focused their limited financial resources on international cricket.|$|E

However, the Colts' 2004 season ended in Foxborough {{for a second}} {{straight}} season with a 20–3 loss against New England, when Manning recorded a season-low passer rating of 69.3. It was Manning's seventh consecutive loss to the Patriots in Foxborough and the Colts' three points were <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> single game point total since their opening game of the 2003 season. Manning was named a Pro Bowl starter; in the Pro Bowl, he threw three touchdowns in a 38–27 victory and was named the game's MVP. Manning was also a unanimous first-team All-Pro selection.|$|E

A special train carried 375 Michigan students to the game on the Ann Arbor and Hocking Valley railroads. Ohio State held the Wolverines to <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> point total of the 1901 season. Prior to the game, the head coaches argued over the length of the game, Yost insisting on regulation halves of 30 minute and Ohio State's John B. Eckstorm insisting that the first half be limited to 25 minutes. When the umpire threatened Ohio State with a forfeiture, coach Eckstrom agreed to play regulation halves of 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Sweden, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union {{were the}} most heavily favoured teams. Another ten National Olympic Committees were able to send teams to Moscow: Angola, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, East Germany, France, Hungary, Netherlands, Spain, and Vietnam. Favorites Soviet Union boasted the silver medalists in the 100m finals hosted several days earlier in {{backstroke}} and breaststroke (Viktor Kuznetsov and Arsens Miskarovs respectively), while their butterflyer (Yevgeny Seredin) and freestyler (Sergey Kopliakov) had come fifth and fourth in their respective 100m events. The British team included the 100m breaststroke gold medallist (Duncan Goodhew), and fifth-place finisher in the 100m backstroke (Gary Abraham). Sweden's butterflyer (Pär Arvidsson) and backstroker (Bengt Baron) had won their respective 100m events, and their freestyle swimmer (Per Holmertz) had come second in the 100m, while <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> ranked swimmer, the breaststroker (Peter Berggren), had come ninth in the 100m event.|$|E

5|$|The general {{election}} {{resulted in a}} victory for Tony Blair's Labour Party, which adopted a pro-EU stance. Their victory was considered a landslide, thus making the Referendum Party's role in the election fairly irrelevant. The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a drop from the 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British party politics in 1832. Their representation in the House of Commons fell by over half, from 343 to 165; <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> representation in the House since 1906. The reasons for their electoral decline were many {{and the impact of}} the Referendum Party was not a major factor.|$|E

Of the seven major league affiliations in Nashville's history, the team experienced its best record from 1980 to 1984 as the Double-A farm club for the New York Yankees. The Sounds had a composite regular season record of 417–306 (.577). They reached the postseason in all five seasons, winning two Western Division titles and one Southern League Championship. Their postseason record was 14–14 (.500). Conversely, the team's lowest record was as the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A club from 1985 to 1986. The Sounds compiled a 139–144 (.491) record and failed to reach the postseason in either year.|$|E
5|$|West to east {{trending}} canyons provide {{easier access}} by foot {{into the heart}} of the range as no vehicular roads traverse the range except at Teton Pass, which is south of the park. Carved by a combination of glacier activity as well as by numerous streams, the canyons are at <b>their</b> <b>lowest</b> point along the eastern margin of the range at Jackson Hole. Flowing from higher to lower elevations, the glaciers created more than a dozen U-shaped valleys throughout the range. Cascade Canyon is sandwiched between Mount Owen and Teewinot Mountain to the south and Symmetry Spire to the north and is situated immediately west of Jenny Lake. North to south, Webb, Moran, Paintbrush, Cascade, Death and Granite Canyons slice through Teton Range.|$|E
