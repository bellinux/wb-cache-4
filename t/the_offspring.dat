5|$|Interspecific hybrids are <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> from interspecies mating; these {{sometimes}} {{result in}} hybrid speciation.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{that have}} focused on {{inheritance}} patterns rather than on specific genes have found that 80% of <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> of two obese parents were also obese, in contrast to less than 10% of <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> of two parents who were of normal weight. Different people exposed to the same environment have different risks of obesity due to their underlying genetics.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E

5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in <b>the</b> <b>offspring).</b> These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely}} to be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to <b>the</b> <b>offspring,</b> but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E

5|$|During the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated {{to develop}} and {{establish}} the modern Labrador breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. <b>The</b> <b>offspring</b> {{are considered to be}} the ancestors of modern Labradors.|$|E
5|$|Female {{birds have}} sperm storage {{mechanisms}} that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against {{the possibility of}} infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> that they raise.|$|E

5|$|If the {{variance}} in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the Wright–Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic drift ({{the variance}} effective population size), genetic drift is a less powerful force compared to selection. Even for the same variance, if higher moments of <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of genetic drift is substantially weakened.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, females become {{sexually mature}} at {{two months of}} age. The ovarian {{follicle}} forms about 16 days prior {{to the birth of}} <b>the</b> <b>offspring.</b> After mating, female hamsters typically have larger uteri, ovaries, and adrenal glands compared to females which live alone, with other females or those that have not mated. The females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner. Also, these females have a shorter gestation period, around four to five days.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, the {{gestation}} period for Campbell's dwarf hamster is between 18 and 20 days, and the shortest {{gestation period}} recorded for a captive female was 13 days.

5|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{occurs in}} the great tit (Parus major) when <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> produced {{as a result of}} a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. In natural populations of Parus major, inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Mendel's work, the {{dominant}} theory of heredity {{was one of}} blending inheritance, which suggested that each parent contributed fluids to the fertilisation process and that the traits of the parents blended and mixed to produce <b>the</b> <b>offspring.</b> Charles Darwin developed a theory of inheritance he termed pangenesis, from Greek pan ("all, whole") and genesis ("birth") / genos ("origin"). Darwin used the term gemmule to describe hypothetical particles that would mix during reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Silkies {{most likely}} {{made their way}} to the West via the Silk Route and {{maritime}} trade. The breed was recognized officially in North America with acceptance into the Standard of Perfection in 1874. Once Silkies became more common in the West, many myths were perpetuated about them. Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> of chickens and rabbits, while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur.|$|E
