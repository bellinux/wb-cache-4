Marriage combined with the preceding four unities creates a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety.

50|$|In many states, <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{entireties}} {{is recognized}} as a valid form of ownership for bank accounts and financial assets. One must be careful to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entireties designation is chosen as opposed {{to other forms of}} joint ownership such as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, so that <b>the</b> benefits of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entireties status is not lost. For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entireties and joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, if the account is opened as a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship account, <b>the</b> benefits of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> entireties will not attach.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{entirety}} (sometimes {{called a}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entireties) {{is a type}} of concurrent estate formerly available only to married couples, where ownership of property is treated as though the couple were a single legal person. (In the State of Hawaii, the option of Tenants <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Entirety ownership is also available to domestic partners in a registered [...] "Reciprocal Beneficiary Relationship"; Vermont's Civil Union statute qualifies parties to a civil union for <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety.)

5000|$|In some jurisdictions, {{to create}} a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{entirety}} the parties must specify in the deed that the property is being conveyed to the couple [...] "as tenants <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety," [...] while in others, a conveyance to a married couple is presumed {{to create a}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety unless the deed specifies otherwise. (see also Sociedad de gananciales) Also, besides sharing the four unities necessary to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship time, title, interest, and possession there must also be the fifth unity of marriage. However, unlike a JTWROS, neither party in a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety has a unilateral right to sever the tenancy. The termination of the tenancy or any dealing with {{any part of the}} property requires the consent of both spouses. A divorce breaks the unity of marriage, leaving the default tenancy, which may be a tenancy in common in equal shares. Many US jurisdictions no longer recognize <b>tenancies</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety. [...] Where it is recognized, benefits can include the ability to shield the property from creditors of only one spouse, as well as the ability to partially shield the property where only one spouse is filing a petition for bankruptcy relief. If a non-debtor spouse in a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety survives a debtor spouse, the lien can never be enforced against the property. On the other hand, if a debtor spouse survives a non-debtor spouse, the lien may be enforced against the whole property, not merely the debtor spouse's original half-interest.|$|R

40|$|The law {{fails to}} {{accommodate}} the inconvenient fact that an individual’s identifiable genetic information is involuntarily and immutably shared with her close genetic relatives. Legal institutions have established that individuals have a cognizable interest in controlling genetic information that is identifying to them. The Supreme Court recognized in Maryland v. King that the Fourth Amendment is implicated when arrestees’ DNA is analyzed, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act protects individuals from genetic discrimination in the employment and health-insurance markets. But genetic information is not like other forms of private or personal information because it is shared — immutably and involuntarily — {{in ways that are}} identifying of both the source and that person’s close genetic relatives. Standard approaches to addressing interests in genetic information have largely failed to recognize this characteristic, treating such information as individualistic. While many legal frames may be brought to bear on this problem, this Article focuses on the law of property. Specifically, looking to <b>the</b> law of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety, this Article proposes one possible framework for grappling with the overlapping interests implicated in genetic identification and analysis. <b>Tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety, like interests in shared identifiable genetic information, calls for the difficult task of conceptualizing two persons as one. <b>The</b> law of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety thus provides a useful analytical framework for considering how legal institutions might take interests in shared identifiable genetic information into account. This Article examines how this framework may shape policy approaches in three domains: forensic identification, genetic research, and personal genetic testing. In some of these domains, experts are already advocating for policies consistent with this framework...|$|R

After widespread litigation and media coverage surrounding the Terri Schiavo case, estate planning attorneys now often advise clients to also create a living will.

50|$|A {{concurrent}} estate or co-tenancy {{is a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize tenancies in common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize <b>tenancies</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a tenancy in common.|$|R

This requires another person to [...] "buy" [...] the property from the joint co-owner for some nominal consideration, followed immediately by a sale-back to the co-owner at the same price. In either case, the joint tenancy will revert to a tenancy in common as to that owner's interest in the property.|$|R
50|$|Provision {{was made}} for landlords and tenants of {{regulated}} tenancies for which no fair rent had been registered, to agree (using a special written agreement) rent increases {{without reference to the}} Rent Officer and without losing their rights to make some future application for a fair rent to be determined. But if the rent agreement was the first to take effect after the controlled tenancy had been converted into a regulated <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1972 Act, the agreement had to be lodged with the Rent Officer who would only allow the agreement to have effect if the agreed rent did not exceed a fair rent.|$|R
50|$|The {{phrase is}} used to {{describe}} legal consequences that occur <b>by</b> <b>the</b> act of the law itself.

For example, types of joint ownership (title) may include tenancy in common, joint tenancy with right of survivorship, or joint <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entireties.

5000|$|The Turner court noted many {{purposes}} of marriage, including: [...] expressions of emotional support and public commitment .... many religions recognize marriage as having spiritual significance; for some inmates and their spouses, therefore, {{the commitment of}} marriage may be an exercise of religious faith {{as well as an}} expression of personal dedication. Third, most inmates eventually will be released by parole or commutation, and therefore most inmate marriages are formed in the expectation that they ultimately will be fully consummated. Finally, marital status often is a precondition to the receipt of government benefits (e. g., Social Security benefits), property rights (e. g., <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety, inheritance rights), and other, less tangible benefits (e. g., legitimation of children born out of wedlock).

40|$|It’s been a perplexing {{problem for}} years {{but it seems}} to be {{increasing}} as more of the situations come to light – years ago, grandparents conveyed property owned in joint <b>tenancy</b> (or <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entirety) to an irrevocable inter vivos trust with retained life estates for each of the grandparents and with a remainder interest to the children.
