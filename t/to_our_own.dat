25|$|Zwicky also {{considered}} the possibility of rearranging the universe <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> liking. In a lecture in 1948 he spoke of changing planets, or relocating them within the solar system. In the 1960s he even considered how the whole solar system might be moved like a giant spaceship to travel to other stars. He considered this might be achieved by firing pellets into the Sun to produce asymmetrical fusion explosions, and by this means {{he thought that the}} star Alpha Centauri might be reached within 2500 years.|$|E
25|$|In astronomy, Galactocentrism is {{the theory}} that our sun is {{at or near the}} center of the galaxy. Observations by William Herschel in 1785 {{indicated}} that the Milky Way was a separate disk-shaped galaxy with the sun in a central position. Although proved incorrect by Harlow Shapley in 1918, the theory was a step in the development of cosmological models as the speculation of the existence of other galaxies, comparable in size and structure <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> placed the earth in its proper perspective with respect to the rest of the universe.|$|E
25|$|The dust {{is thought}} to be {{generated}} by collisions among comets and asteroids. Radiation pressure from the star will push the dust particles away into interstellar space over a relatively short timescale. Therefore, the detection of dust indicates continual replenishment by new collisions, and provides strong indirect evidence of the presence of small bodies like comets and asteroids that orbit the parent star. For example, the dust disk around the star tau Ceti indicates that that star has a population of objects analogous <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> Solar System's Kuiper Belt, but at least ten times thicker.|$|E

25|$|The {{opposing}} argument {{posits that}} terraforming {{would be an}} unethical interference in nature, and that given humanity's past treatment of Earth, other planets may {{be better off without}} human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as Christopher McKay, who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only once we have completely assured that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, we should not try to reshape it <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> use, but we should engineer its environment to artificially nurture the alien life and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans. Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference.|$|E
25|$|Lyra Belacqua, aged around eleven at the {{beginning}} of the trilogy, is the daughter of Lord Asriel and Marisa Coulter in a fictional Oxford, similar <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>own.</b> She was brought up at Jordan College, where the scholars, professors and servants treat her as an adopted daughter. She was raised believing that her parents had died in an airship crash, and that Lord Asriel was her uncle, and later learned the truth from John Faa, leader of the Gyptians. Lyra spends much of her time socialising with other children of the city, sometimes harmoniously, frequently mock-violently, and often in order to avoid schoolwork. Her closest friend among the other children is a Jordan kitchen boy named Roger Parslow, who disappears early in Northern Lights. The search to find Roger, and other children, is Lyra's motivation throughout much of Northern Lights.|$|E
25|$|The Draka {{take over}} Egypt and Ceylon from the French during the Napoleonic Wars, {{and over the}} course of the 19th century, the Draka {{gradually}} conquer and enslave the entire continent of Africa. The last areas to be conquered were the jungles of the Congo, due to the danger of tropical diseases. Technological development is faster than in our own history, as the Draka put the wealth derived from their vast gold and diamond deposits to effective use by offering large grants to scientists and inventors who settle in their territory and develop new inventions. These include Richard Trevithick, inventor of the steam locomotive, who settles in Virconium (equivalent <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> world's Durban) in 1796, R. J. Gatling, who settles in Diskarapur in 1850, and Louis Pasteur, who discovers malaria's mosquito vector in the 1860s while working for the Shahnapur Institute of Tropical Medicine.|$|E

25|$|A {{portion of}} his Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem was {{published}} in Bologna after his death. In this book Pico presents arguments against the practice of astrology that have had enormous resonance for centuries, up <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> time. Disputationes {{is influenced by the}} arguments against astrology espoused by one of his intellectual heroes, St. Augustine of Hippo, and also by the medieval philosophical tale Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan which promoted autodidacticism as a philosophical program. Pico's antagonism to astrology seems to derive mainly from the conflict of astrology with Christian notions of free will. But Pico's arguments moved beyond the objections of Ficino, who was himself an astrologer. The manuscript was edited for publication after Pico's death by his nephew Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola, an ardent follower of Savonarola, and may possibly have been amended to be more forcefully critical. This might possibly explain the fact that Ficino championed the manuscript and enthusiastically endorsed it before its publication.|$|E
25|$|BitTorrent peers use tit-for-tat {{strategy}} to optimize their download speed. More specifically, most BitTorrent peers use {{a variant of}} Tit for two Tats which is called regular unchoking in BitTorrent terminology. BitTorrent peers have {{a limited number of}} upload slots to allocate to other peers. Consequently, when a peer's upload bandwidth is saturated, it will use a tit-for-tat strategy. Cooperation is achieved when upload bandwidth is exchanged for download bandwidth. Therefore, when a peer is not uploading in return <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> peer uploading, the BitTorrent program will choke the connection with the uncooperative peer and allocate this upload slot to a hopefully more cooperating peer. Regular unchoking corresponds very strongly to always cooperating on the first move in prisoner’s dilemma. Periodically, a peer will allocate an upload slot to a randomly chosen uncooperative peer (unchoke). This is called optimistic unchoking. This behavior allows searching for more cooperating peers and gives a second chance to previously non-cooperating peers. The optimal threshold values of this strategy are still the subject of research.|$|E
25|$|Just as I {{was pushing}} {{one of our}} men back into the ranks I saw him fall at my feet from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E
