50|$|The {{station has}} two through {{platforms}} above street level with ticket areas and retail outlets at street level. The platform retaining walls, the stairwells and canopies were originally <b>timber</b> <b>planking</b> but upgraded to include escalators and fibreglass panels in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
50|$|She was of {{composite}} construction (iron frame and <b>timber</b> <b>planking),</b> 717 tons register, length 178.5 ft, breadth 30.6 ft x depth 18.8 ft Her sail plan was reduced from full-rigged to barque configuration sometime before 1877, presumably to enable her {{to operate with}} a smaller crew.|$|E

50|$|Lake Ditch Bridge is a {{historic}} plate girder bridge located in Monroe Township, Morgan County, Indiana. It was built in 1895 by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Co. It is 58 feet, 6 inches, long and 24 feet, 9 inches wide. It is supported by <b>timber</b> <b>planks</b> and concrete abutments.|$|R
50|$|There is brick quoining to {{the corners}} of the stone {{building}} at Fleurs and to window and door openings. To accommodate the original verandah floor joists, a brick-on-edge course set between two layers of <b>timber</b> <b>planking,</b> provided a level surface for the joist housing {{around the perimeter of the}} building. The existing verandah floor structure abuts the external walls.|$|E
50|$|Ariel {{was a full}} rigged ship of 853 tons net register, {{measuring}} 197.4 ft x 33.9 feet x 21 ft. She {{was designed}} by William Rennie, and built in 1865 by Robert Steele & Co., Greenock for Shaw, Lowther & Maxton of London. Like the majority of tea clippers launched after 1864, she was composite built, of <b>timber</b> <b>planking</b> over iron frames.|$|E
50|$|The {{hall and}} estate’s east {{entrance}} {{from the nearby}} village of Upper Sheringham passes by another entrance lodge simply known as Lodge cottage. It built over two storeys and is built from brick faced with pebble flint work with Norfolk red brick quoining. The south elevation has a projecting bay with a hip roof with the upper storey clad in dark shiplap <b>timber</b> <b>planking.</b> The house has a Norfolk pantile roof.|$|E
50|$|Use of dugout canoes has {{declined}} somewhat except in more remote locations, {{due to a}} relative shortage of good African Teak trees, and competition from <b>timber</b> <b>plank,</b> aluminium and glass-fibre boats. The use of outboard motors remains relatively low due to {{the high cost of}} fuel and lack of maintenance services.|$|R
50|$|The Boston concern dealt in ship <b>timbers</b> and <b>planking</b> {{during the}} {{years prior to the}} rise of iron- and then steel-hulled ships. After the Civil War, wooden {{shipbuilding}} waned and a new demand arose for factory timbers. The Huckins company adapted itself to the new field with a stock of suitable southern yellow pine <b>timber</b> and <b>plank.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{structures and}} elements on {{that part of}} the former Lytton Quarantine Station now incorporated within Fort Lytton National Park, include: Jetty - constructed of <b>timber</b> <b>planks</b> bolted together and supported by wooden piles reinforced with concrete. It is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.|$|R

50|$|The {{walls of}} the canal were lined with <b>timber</b> <b>planking</b> and locks were {{installed}} at each end. Modifications to the canal and lock continued until 1917 and the canal saw moderate to heavy use by small coastal steamships and barges, particularly during the First and Second World Wars when coal from the Sydney Coal Field was transported on this sheltered inland route to avoid U-boats. A marble quarry on the western shore of Bras d'Or Lake at Marble Mountain also generated some shipping traffic.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the [...] "Old bridge", the 2009 Schelde Bridge carries no rail-track. It does carry two {{additional}} road lanes, providing two lanes for southbound traffic, and enabling both vehicle lanes on the 1955 bridge {{to be used}} for northbound traffic. There is also a cycle path and a broad pedestrian path with a surface of heavy duty <b>timber</b> <b>planking.</b> The cost of what is now Belgium's longest bridge crossing over water was €23.5 Million. This compared with an estimate of €16.0 Million published in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The {{architrave}} of the Ionic Order {{is sometimes}} undecorated, {{but more often}} rises in three outwardly-stepped bands like overlapping <b>timber</b> <b>planks.</b> The frieze, which runs in a continuous band, is separated from the other members by rows of small projecting blocks. They {{are referred to as}} dentils, meaning [...] "teeth", but their origin is clearly in narrow wooden slats which supported the roof of a timber structure.|$|R
50|$|Two sets {{of heavy}} 3 by 12 in <b>timber</b> <b>planks</b> {{serve as the}} top and bottom chords, with a {{secondary}} lower chord at deck level. Twelve-inch (30 cm) diagonals, fastened at each intersection by two-inch (5 cm) treenails, radiate out from the middle to either end. They are supplemented by additional diagonals at the ends and four wooden buttresses along the exterior on either side.|$|R
50|$|An Ogoh-ogoh is {{normally}} {{standing on a}} pad built of <b>timber</b> <b>planks</b> and bamboos. The pad is designed to sustain the Ogoh-ogoh while it is being lifted and carried around the village or the town square. There are normally eight or more men carrying the Ogoh-ogoh on their shoulders. This procession is accompanied by orchestral music performed by the youth. The use of flares is also a {{main part of the}} parade.|$|R
50|$|It {{was a very}} scenic {{stretch of}} railway, {{beginning}} at Broomfield Junction, north of Montrose, and striding across the North Esk near Kinnaber {{by means of a}} high stone viaduct. After a cliff top section to St Cyrus, the line wandered inland for a while before descending to the rocky shore at Johnshaven. The track then curved round the back of Gourdon village and continued along the coast to a terminus close to Bervie Bay. Architecturally the stations were undistinguished: all seven of them having basic single-storey buildings with horizontal <b>timber</b> <b>planking</b> and brick chimneys.|$|E
50|$|When Diamond {{was built}} in 1823, {{shipbuilding}} was undergoing₰ rapid technological change. New materials and shipbuilding techniques were being used and ships of this period show many variations. Diamond has been claimed (but without evidence) {{to have been the}} oldest known example of a composite American hull, where iron frames reinforce a timber frame and plank construction. The hull was sheathed in copper, to protect the <b>timber</b> <b>planking</b> from attack by marine organisms and reduce drag. This has proved to be totally false and without foundation. She is in fact a standard built vessel of the age constructed from white oak and locust wood sheathed in normal copper sheets fastened with copper tacks.|$|E
50|$|After {{the death}} of his brother, William took over the {{ownership}} of the steam yacht Lancashire Witch and in 1891 was elected {{as a member of the}} Royal Yacht Squadron. He and Evelyn took several voyages, including one to the West Indies, where they became involved with the rescue of a shipwrecked crew of the barque Caribon. During an earlier cruise in 1888 William had also been involved with the rescue of the crews from three sealing vessels that had become icebound in the Kara Sea. In 1891 the yacht required extensive repair work at the yard of Day, Summers and Company in Southampton to replace <b>timber</b> <b>planking.</b> In 1893 William sold the yacht to the Admiralty for use as a survey ship on the Australian Station. She was renamed HMS Waterwitch and after several years of service sunk in Singapore harbour in 1912.|$|E
50|$|Pont Briwet {{stood on}} 21 piers; each pier {{comprised}} {{four or five}} timber piles that were braced with iron X-framed supports. These created a series of frames on which longitudinal beams carried the road and railway; beams under the rail tracks were substantially larger than those under the roadway. Although the bridge was decked with <b>timber</b> <b>planks,</b> the road carriageway was waterproofed with a metalled surface. Iron was used for bolts and bracing bars.|$|R
50|$|The rink {{was based}} on a {{concrete}} surface, with layers of earth, cow hair and <b>timber</b> <b>planks.</b> Atop these were laid oval copper pipes carrying a solution of glycerine with ether, nitrogen peroxide and water. The pipes were covered by water and the solution was pumped through, freezing the water into ice. Gamgee discovered the process while attempting to develop a method to freeze meat for import from Australia and New Zealand, and patented it as early as 1870.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the time}} of the Franco-Prussian War, the town was also noted for its large export trade of <b>timber,</b> wheels, <b>planks,</b> and charcoal.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 {{residence}} is {{the most}} easterly of the structures in the complex. It is set behind a semicircular pathway which defines the edge of its front garden. The house is a low set construction, rectangular in plan, raised three steps above ground level and clad with vertical <b>timber</b> <b>planking</b> with a natural finish. This is reminiscent in character of the first slab hut on the property. Ventilation is achieved using floor to ceiling door and window openings, some louvred. The roof is low pitched in a simple open gable form with the ridge running {{along the length of}} the rectangular plan. The semicircular pathway in front of the house edges a well maintained lawn area in which is located a raised concrete edged pond. The surface of the pond is covered with a variety of water plants and large ornamental rocks are arranged within the pond.|$|E
5000|$|The Thames skiff {{owes its}} origins to the viking boat {{building}} method of over-lapping <b>timber</b> <b>planking</b> known as clinker construction. Many {{of the terms}} used for parts of the skiff are of Scandinavian origin - “tholes”, “thwarts”, and “sax”. Planks {{on either side of}} a wooden keel are laid down following the outline of a sham (temporary pattern) placed across the keel. The planks are nailed in place and then a strengthening framework of ribs is added. Oars (or blades) are held in place by wooden thole pins {{at the side of the}} boat rather than rowlocks or outriggers. The thole pins are designed to give way if too much pressure is put on them, thus protecting the boat itself from damage. The thwart, or seat, is fixed rather than sliding as in modern boats. The sax runs round the top of the boat to strengthen and protect it. [...] Blades are made of wood with leather collars.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{bridge is}} a {{stiffened}} suspension structure of an uncommon type, inasmuch {{as the main}} cables, after leaving the towers, are carried upwards to an anchorage in the sandstone cliffs above the bridge, instead of downwards, as is usually the case. The main span is of 226 ft feet centres, carried by suspension rods from the cables, {{of which there are}} fourteen {{on either side of the}} bridge. The cables have socketed end connections secured to steel girders in anchorages cut out of the solid rock and accessible for inspection. The stiffening trusses are of steel, hinged at the towers and also at the centre, to allow for the rise and fall of the cables due to temperature changes. The roadway is of <b>timber</b> <b>planking,</b> 15 ft feet wide between kerbs, carried on timber stringers and cross girders. In addition to the main span there are seven timber approach spans, built on a curve to meet the roadway on either side of the river. The approaches include a considerable retaining wall on the Maldon side. The materials required have been supplied under various contracts. The cables were imported, the steel and ironwork in stiffening trusses etc. manufactured by Clyde Engineering Company, and the timber supplied by various firms. The erection of the structure has been carried out by day labour, under Inspector James McCall, of the Public Works Department. The total cost, including contracts mentioned above and road work in approaches, was £8000." ...|$|E
25|$|Traditionally shophouses {{were built}} with {{structural}} (i.e. load bearing) timber beams which carried {{the weight of}} the roof and floors. Floor were similarly made of <b>timber</b> <b>planks,</b> often with narrow gaps in between them to allow air to filter through and to help the building (and its inhabitants) to 'breathe' better. The use of timber beams and floor boards was very much in line with local building traditions. Modern shophouses, on the other hand, use reinforced concrete beams and slabs.|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} with a divided-lane through-truss design created {{specifically for the}} difficult river crossing and unique in Victoria. The trusses were originally intended for a deck truss design, but were adapted to allow their use as through trusses with stiffening arches connecting them above the roadway. Two separate roadways with an intervening stone pillar separating them have caused problems for modern traffic. The road deck is made with longitudinal <b>timber</b> <b>planks</b> on large <b>timber</b> cross girders that are supported on the lower chords of the trusses.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{combines a}} one-story warehouse and a two-story station. It has a yellow brick exterior on a wider red brick base. The hip roof {{is covered in}} red clay tile supported by a wood truss and <b>timber</b> <b>plank</b> system. The second story room of the depot served as the city hall for Greer until the 1930s and then served as a record storage room until the 1950s. The depot, which had been boarded up and unused, now has its interior space divided to create space for businesses.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{accommodates}} {{a real estate}} agent's office and a health food shop. The polished timber floor of the shop comprises dark <b>timber</b> <b>planks</b> alternated with light coloured timber. A set of timber box shelves extends {{the full length of}} the shop to the ceiling along the southern side. A recently installed counter runs along the opposite side. Commercial refrigerators are positioned along the rear of the shop. The ceiling is made up of fibrous cement sheeting with painted or stained timber battens laid out in a decorative pattern.|$|R
50|$|The swing span was {{supported}} by pony trusses. The trusses were 17 ft high, measured between centers of top and bottom truss chords. Also, the clear roadway width was 15 ft, measured between two guide rails. There were no shoulders or sidewalks on the bridge and the overall width of the structure was 18 ft. The bridge deck was constructed of <b>timber</b> <b>planks</b> with a 6 by 6 in timber curb along {{both sides of the}} deck. The vertical clearance above the bridge deck was unlimited and unrestricted. The posted load capacity on the bridge was 5 ST.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{professional}} wrestling is worked, {{there is}} a high chance of injury, and even death. Strikes are often stiff especially in Japan and in independent wrestling promotions such as Combat Zone Wrestling and Ring of Honor. The ring is often made out of 2 by 8 <b>timber</b> <b>planks.</b> There have been many brutal accidents, hits and injuries. Many of the injuries that occur in pro wrestling are shoulders, knee, back, neck, and rib injuries. Professional wrestler Davey Richards said in 2015 [...] "We train to take damage, we know {{we are going to take}} damage and we accept that." ...|$|R
