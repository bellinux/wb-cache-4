5|$|Corals are marine {{invertebrates}} {{in the class}} Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps. The group includes the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton.|$|E
5|$|Lightning Bolt {{are known}} for their guerrilla-style live performances, where <b>they</b> <b>typically</b> play on the ground rather than a stage, with the crowd {{gathered}} around them. The band's sound is typically loud and aggressive, though the group cites composers Philip Glass and Sun Ra as compositional influences.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals are {{a family}} of robust, {{seed-eating}} birds with strong bills. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> live in open woodland. The sexes usually have distinct plumages. Eleven species have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
50|$|Treants are sentient {{trees with}} human characteristics. <b>They</b> are <b>typically</b> portrayed as protectors {{of the forests}} and antagonists to {{industrialization}} and despoiling of nature. <b>They</b> are <b>typically</b> allies of druids and fey, opposing malicious races such as orcs.|$|R
5000|$|Owner: These {{people are}} pure investors. They do not consume {{the real estate}} that <b>they</b> purchase. <b>Typically</b> <b>they</b> rent out or lease the {{property}} to someone else.|$|R

5|$|The Whole Object Assumption is {{the belief}} that labels refer to whole objects instead of parts or {{properties}} of those objects. Children are believed to hold this assumption because <b>they</b> <b>typically</b> label whole objects first, and parts of properties of objects later in development.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} are {{a family}} of robust seed-eating passerines with strong bills. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> live in open woodland. The sexes usually have distinct plumage. Eleven species have been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|After {{integration}} into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and cleave it, thereby preventing it from {{being used as a}} translation template. Differently from siRNA, a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of destructive cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) regions of mRNAs where <b>they</b> <b>typically</b> bind with imperfect complementarity, thus blocking the access of ribosomes for translation.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>typically</b> {{asymptomatic}} {{and found}} incidentally.|$|R

5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, <b>they</b> <b>typically</b> appear as woolly or hairy {{areas on the}} stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{hypothyroidism}} {{are associated with}} mild elevations in creatine kinase and liver enzymes in the blood. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> return to normal when hypothyroidism has been fully treated. Levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein (a) can be elevated; the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less well-defined.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous carcinomas are a rare form of endometrial cancer, {{making up}} less than 1–2% of all {{diagnosed}} endometrial cancer. Mucinous endometrial carcinomas are most often stage I and grade I, giving them a good prognosis. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> have well-differentiated columnar cells organized into glands with the characteristic mucin in the cytoplasm. Mucinous carcinomas must be differentiated from cervical adenocarcinoma.|$|E

5|$|Pratincoles have short legs, {{very long}} pointed wings and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that <b>they</b> <b>typically</b> hunt their insect prey {{on the wing}} like swallows, {{although}} they can also feed on the ground. Their short bills are an adaptation to aerial feeding.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} are structurally {{simple and}} {{can be made from}} short RNA sequences; the smallest is just 44 nucleotides and is found in the mRNA of a heat-shock protein, hsp17, in Synechocystis species PCC 6803. Generally these RNA elements range in length from 60-110 nucleotides and <b>they</b> <b>typically</b> contain a hairpin with a small number of mismatched base pairs which reduce the stability of the structure, thereby allowing easier unfolding in response to a temperature increase.|$|E
5|$|Squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} {{accounts for}} about 30% of lung cancers. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated cell death are commonly found {{at the center of}} the tumor. About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>typically</b> more pleasantly {{tempered}} {{than other}} rat snake species.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>typically</b> {{much larger}} than other species of Kinosternidae, {{attaining}} sizes of up to 36 cm (14 in) carapace length, with males being significantly smaller than females. <b>They</b> are <b>typically</b> brown, black, or green in color, with yellow undersides. Their carapaces are distinguished by three distinct ridges, or keels, which run their length.|$|R

5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are trained}} to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is {{the formation of a}} rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.|$|E
5|$|Taoist temples may fly square or {{triangular}} flags. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> feature mystical {{writing or}} diagrams and {{are intended to}} fulfill various functions including providing guidance for {{the spirits of the}} dead, bringing good fortune, increasing life span, etc. Other flags and banners may be those of the gods or immortals themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Itchy & Scratchy Show {{is a show}} {{within a}} show that appears {{occasionally}} in episodes of The Simpsons. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> appear {{in the form of}} 12-60 second cartoons that are filled with gratuitous violence, usually initiated by Itchy the mouse against Scratchy the cat; Itchy is almost always the victor. Itchy & Scratchy airs as a segment on The Krusty the Clown Show, and also aired on its brief replacements, Sideshow Bob's Cavalcade of Whimsy and Gabbo.|$|E

Their carapaces are distinguished by three distinct ridges, or keels, which run their length.|$|R
5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests. Where they are introduced, <b>they</b> <b>typically</b> grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} {{composed}} of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several bee {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. <b>They</b> <b>typically</b> enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also. The Arctic bee species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.|$|E
