5|$|Although the Loons were afforded {{respect as}} {{principal}} peace chiefs, this status was not permanent. The Cranes, led in Buffalo's time by his sub-chief Tagwagane, maintained {{that they were}} the hereditary chiefs. They said the Loons' status as spokesmen hinged upon recognition by the Cranes.

5|$|During the war, Seward comes <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>and</b> {{collaborate}} with Lincoln. Chase, {{on the other}} hand, schemes against Lincoln from within the cabinet, hoping to replace him as the Republican nominee in the 1864 presidential election. Lincoln nonetheless keeps Chase in the cabinet until 1864 for his skill at financing the war effort, and his efforts to undermine the president are ultimately unsuccessful. Lincoln also recruits Chase ally Edwin M. Stanton to replace Pennsylvania political boss Simon Cameron as Secretary of War; like Seward, Stanton comes <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>and</b> support Lincoln. While managing the disparate personalities of his cabinet, Lincoln also struggles to manage a series of generals including George B. McClellan, Henry Halleck, and George Meade. The president finally finds success in 1864 by promoting Ulysses S. Grant to commander of the Union armies. Lincoln oversees {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolishes slavery, and sees the war to its successful conclusion. He also appoints Chase as the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, believing him the best man to secure the rights of newly freed black citizens.|$|E

25|$|Islam {{first arrived}} {{to the region}} when {{immigrants}} from Mecca, persecuted by the ruling Quraysh tribe were accepted into the Aksumite Empire by whom Arabic tradition has named Aṣḥama ibn Abjar, and he settled them in Negash, located in what is today the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. Muhammad himself instructed his followers who came to Aksum, <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>and</b> protect Aksum as well as live in peace with Aksumite Christians. Islam later spread in Eritrea under the Ottoman Empire when ethnic groups like the Tigre people in mainland Eritrea began converting to Islam. In the late 19th century, {{during the reign of}} Emperor Yohannes IV, who was a devoutly Christian Tigrayan, Muslim Tigrayans were forcibly expelled from their homes and found refuge in the nearby northern areas in what is now Eritrea, out of reach of royal Ethiopian authority.|$|E

25|$|Arriving in Santa Fe in October, General Kearny had {{dispatched}} Captain (now Lieutenant Colonel) Philip St. George Cooke, West Point {{class of}} 1827, to assume {{command of the}} battalion. His assignment was to march them to California and to build a wagon road along the way. In Santa Fe several sick men and {{all but a few}} of the women and children were sent to Pueblo, in present-day Colorado. Three separate detachments left the battalion and went to Pueblo to winter. For the next four months and 1,100 miles, Cooke led the battalion across some of the most arduous terrain in North America. Most of the Mormon soldiers soon learned <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>and</b> follow him. The group acquired another guide in New Mexico – adventurer and mountain man Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, who as an infant had traveled with his mother Sacagawea across the continent with the Lewis and Clark Expedition.|$|E
25|$|The Fascist {{government}} {{endorsed a}} stringent education policy in Italy aiming at eliminating illiteracy, {{which was a}} serious problem in Italy at the time, as well as improving the allegiance of Italians to the state. To reduce drop-outs, the government changed the minimum age of leaving school from twelve to fourteen and strictly enforced attendance. The Fascist government's first minister of education from 1922 to 1924 Giovanni Gentile recommended that education policy should focus on indoctrination of students into Fascism and to educate youth <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>and</b> be obedient to authority. In 1929, education policy took a major step towards being completely {{taken over by the}} agenda of indoctrination. In that year, the Fascist government took control of the authorization of all textbooks, all secondary school teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty to Fascism and children began to be taught that they owed the same loyalty to Fascism as they did to God. In 1933, all university teachers were required to be members of the National Fascist Party. From the 1930s to 1940s, Italy's education focused on the history of Italy displaying Italy as a force of civilization during the Roman era, displaying the rebirth of Italian nationalism and the struggle for Italian independence and unity during the Risorgimento. In the late 1930s, the Fascist government copied Nazi Germany's education system on the issue of physical fitness and began an agenda that demanded that Italians become physically healthy.|$|E

500|$|Al-Azhar {{continues}} to hold a status above other Sunni religious authorities throughout the world, and as Sunnis form {{a large majority of}} the total Muslim population al-Azhar exerts considerable influence on the Islamic world as a whole. In addition to being the default authority within Egypt, al-Azhar has been looked to outside of Egypt for religious judgments. Prior to the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd asked for a fatwa authorizing the stationing of foreign troops within the kingdom, and despite Islam's two holiest sites being located within Saudi Arabia, he asked the head sheikh of al-Azhar instead of the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia. In 2003, Nicolas Sarkozy, at the time French Minister of the Interior, requested a judgment from al-Azhar allowing Muslim girls to not wear the hijab in French public schools, despite the existence of the French Council of Islam. The sheikh of al-Azhar provided the ruling, saying that while wearing the hijab is an [...] "Islamic duty" [...] the Muslim women of France are obligated <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>and</b> follow French laws. The ruling drew much criticism within Egypt as compromising Islamic principles to convenience the French government, and in turn the Egyptian government.|$|E

Manson returns to the Griffin house with Peter and Lois, where he tells Chris and his bandmates that it is important <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> <b>and</b> obey their parents, and in addition to mending the tension between them, Manson ends the episode by giving Peter some more parental advice: Peter and Chris should start fishing.|$|E
