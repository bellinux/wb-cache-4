25|$|After unsuccessfully {{attempting}} to entice Schaefer into their van with alternate offers {{of marijuana and}} a lift home, Bittaker and Norris drove further ahead and parked alongside a driveway. Norris then exited the vehicle, opened the passenger-side sliding door, and leaned into the van, with his head and shoulders obscured from view behind the door. When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into the van and closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> full volume as Norris bound the victim's {{arms and legs and}} gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.|$|E
25|$|On lap 15, Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel {{came into}} the pits. Hamilton rejoined in sixth place but Vettel's fuel pump failed to work {{so he had to}} come in again. Kovalainen came in a lap later while Barrichello was pushing to try and build a gap. Button and Räikkönen pitted on lap 18, the Finn coming out in eighth while Button rejoined in 11th. Barrichello came in on lap 19, the Brazilian had made a lot of ground as he rejoined just behind Lewis after being around 10 seconds adrift. But most {{importantly}} for Brawn he had jumped the other McLaren of Kovalainen. On lap 24, a lot of smoke was pouring from the rear end of Vettel's car and he retired with a suspected engine failure. Hamilton was ordered over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> try to cool down his rear brakes as the temperature were getting out of control, but he was unable to shake off the challenge of Barrichello in second.|$|E

25|$|Turvey had energy {{management}} problems and was overtaken by both Audi Sport ABT cars of di Grassi and Abt on lap four. Prost closed up to Turvey and passed him for eighth place shortly afterwards. Heidfeld continued to gain positions, passing the Andretti cars of Félix da Costa and Frijns {{to move into}} twelfth place. Rosenqvist was lapping four seconds faster than his teammate Heidfeld and both drivers were instructed by their engineers over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> lift and coast for energy preservation. Heidfeld used much of his electrical energy to draw closer to d'Ambrosio. Engel set the race's fastest lap on lap seven, completing a circuit in one minute and 9.519 seconds, earning him one championship point. Shortly afterwards, Buemi, di Grassi and Abt were announced as {{the winners of the}} second FanBoost vote. Tyre rubber started to accumulate within the outer limits of the track's barriers, causing one driver to make contact with the wall. By the 13th lap, Heidfeld was closing up to Evans for the first points-scoring position of tenth. Upfront, Rosenqvist and Buemi had pulled away from López with the two leading drivers separated by one second. López was being challenged by teammate Bird for third position but the latter had difficulty in overtaking him.|$|E
25|$|Massa {{made his}} pit stop from third on lap 24, and emerged in fifth. Hamilton {{received}} instructions for an engine mode change and Rosberg entered the pit lane from {{the lead on}} the next lap and handed the lead to Hamilton. Bottas made his stop on the same lap and rejoined alongside Vettel on the start/finish straight but was forced wide, allowing Magnussen to pass him. Hamilton took his pit stop on the 26th lap and handed back first place to teammate Rosberg. Bottas also fell behind Pérez but re-passed the latter going into the Rettifilo chicane. Hamilton's race engineer Peter Bonnington told him over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> remain at least {{two and a half}} seconds behind teammate Rosberg to gain the slipstream advantage without losing downforce and conserve tyre life for an attack in the race's closing period. Hamilton was aware from previous experience earlier in the season that the method to pass a driver was to do so when tyre grip was optimal otherwise {{it would not have been}} possible to draw close enough to affect a passing manoeuvre. He recorded the fastest lap of the race at that point to move within seven-tenths of a second behind teammate Rosberg by the start of lap 28, causing debate among the Mercedes pit lane members.|$|E
500|$|Gabriel {{later said}} he wrote all his lyrical {{contributions}} to the album in two days. Having rehearsed and written enough material for an album, the group entered Island Studios in August 1973. As with Foxtrot, John Burns helped with production. Burns' technical skills resulted in a good recorded sound and environment, and this motivated the group to play better and tackle more complex arrangements. Banks recalled the sessions being difficult, adding [...] "it {{was hard to get}} things going".

After Mary's death, Jim bought Paul a nickel-plated trumpet as a birthday present. When skiffle music became popular, Paul swapped the trumpet for a £15 Framus Zenith (model 17) acoustic guitar.

500|$|Retrospective reviews regard The Downward Spiral {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} albums of the 1990s and Reznor's greatest work. The 2004 edition of The New Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album five out of five stars and called it [...] "a powerful statement, and one of the landmark albums of the Nineties." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Kyle Anderson remembered watching the music video of [...] "Closer" [...] on MTV as an adolescent and expressed that the album changed his perception of popular music from that of songs heard on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> albums with cover art. Stereogums Tom Breihan remains favorable toward the album since it is [...] "the one that most fully inhabits" [...] Nine Inch Nails' characteristics and influenced youth culture, with teenagers wearing ripped fish nets on their arms.

500|$|The Japanese ships {{continued}} to concentrate their fire on South Dakota and none detected Washington approaching to within [...] Washington was tracking a large target (Kirishima) {{for some time}} but refrained from firing since {{there was a chance}} it could be South Dakota.

When the Japanese illuminated and fired on South Dakota, all doubts were removed as to which ships were friend or foe. From this close range, Washington opened fire and quickly hit Kirishima with at least nine (and possibly up to 20) main battery shells and at least seventeen secondary ones, disabling all of Kirishimas main gun turrets, causing major flooding, and setting her aflame. Kirishima was hit below the waterline and suffered a jammed rudder, causing her to circle uncontrollably to port.|$|E

At the start of lap 40, Massa held a 1.2 second lead over Alonso, who in turn, was 5.2 seconds in front of Vettel. Hamilton in fourth place was 18.1 seconds behind the race, but was {{maintaining}} a steady gap to teammate Button in fifth. Webber was told by Red Bull over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> increase the gap to Button, because his car was suffering from an issue with its oil consumption, {{and was told that}} braking harder into the track's turns would possibly assist in moving some oil around the inside of his car. Petrov made an error which allowed Kobayashi to take advantage but Petrov held off the challenge. A radio transmission from Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley was intercepted on lap 48, with Smedley telling Massa, [...] "OK, so, Fernando (Alonso) is faster than you. Can you confirm you understood that message?" [...] Based on Smedley's tone, commentators surmised that it had been a coded message from engineer to driver telling Massa to move over and allow Alonso through.|$|E
500|$|Finally in space, Homer reveals he has smuggled {{potato chips}} on board. He opens the bag, but is unaware that, {{due to the}} effects of weightlessness, they will spread around and clog the instruments. His {{appetite}} seems to save the day as he floats after the chips, eating them, but he manages to fly into an experimental ant farm, letting the ants loose in the shuttle. James Taylor comes in over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> sing [...] "You've Got a Friend", but the disaster continues on board as the ants destroy the navigation system. James Taylor suggests that they blow the bugs out the front hatch, which the astronauts do, but Homer fails to put on his harness and is nearly blown out of the open hatch before grabbing its handle and clinging for life. Buzz pulls him inside, but due to the vacuum's sheer force, Homer bends the hatch handle, preventing the door from closing and potentially resulting in the shuttle's destruction on re-entry. When Race declares he will attack Homer in frustration, Homer pulls a rod out of the wall to defend himself, and he inadvertently uses it to seal the door shut. With the problems solved, the shuttle successfully returns to Earth, making a convenient crash-landing through the roof of a press reporters' convention.|$|E
500|$|The new Zimbabwean {{parliament}} {{opened on}} 15 May 1980, {{a month after}} formal independence from Britain, with Smith as the reconstituted country's first Leader of the Opposition. Continuing a long-standing tradition from the Rhodesian era, the government and opposition entered the House in pairs—Mugabe and Smith walked in {{side by side with}} their respective MPs following, [...] "aptly symbolis the mood of reconciliation", Martin Meredith comments. With around 1,000 whites leaving Zimbabwe each month, Smith took to <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> urge them to stay and give Mugabe's new order a chance, but over half of the country's whites left within three years. As Meredith records, the 100,000 or so who remained [...] "retreated into their own world of clubs, sporting activities, and comfortable living". Mugabe made great efforts when he first took power to endear himself to the white farming community, which accounted for at least 75% of Zimbabwe's agricultural output. Amid booming Zimbabwean commodity prices in the years immediately following 1980, many white commercial farmers came to support Mugabe. The new Prime Minister continued cordially meeting Smith until the RF leader took him to task in 1981 for openly calling for a one-party state; Smith said this was putting off foreign investors. Mugabe was not impressed and, according to Smith, refused to ever meet him again.|$|E

500|$|During the revolution, {{there was}} an orgy of {{violence}} committed against the South Asian and Arab communities with thousands of women being raped by the Okello's followers, much looting and massacres of Arabs all over the island. The American diplomat Don Petterson described the killings of Arabs by the African majority {{as an act of}} genocide. Petterson wrote [...] "Genocide was not a term that in the vogue then, as it came to be later, but {{it is fair to say}} that in parts of Zanzibar, the killing of Arabs was genocide, pure and simple". Okello, an eccentric, power-crazed man with a taste for cruelty frequently went on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>to</b> urge his followers in thunderous Old Testament language to kill as many Arabs as possible, with the maximum of brutality. As a Pan-African nationalist who made his followers sing [...] "God Bless Africa" [...] whenever he marched through the streets, Okello appealed to the black majority, but at same time, as a militant Christian who claimed to hear the voice of God in his head, Okello's appeal on an island whose population was 95% Muslim was limited. It was only discontent with the Arabs that gave Okello any sort of mass support, and once the government was overthrown, most of the Muslim Africans gave their loyalty to the mainstream black politicians, and shunned the bloodthirsty Okello who presented himself as a messianic figure ordered by the voices in his head (which Okello said were messages from God) to liberate Africa for Jesus Christ.
