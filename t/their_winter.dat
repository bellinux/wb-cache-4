5|$|The {{units of}} the field armies, {{including}} palatini, comitatenses, and sometimes pseudocomitatenses, were based in cities when not on campaign, and could be based in temporary camps when on campaign. But it seems that did not usually occupy purpose-built accommodation like the city-based limitanei. From the legal evidence, it seems they were normally compulsorily billeted in private houses (hospitalitas). This is because they often wintered in different provinces. The comitatus praesentales accompanied their respective emperors on campaign, while even the regional comitatus would change <b>their</b> <b>winter</b> quarters according to operational requirements. However, in the 5th century, emperors rarely campaigned in person, so the praesentales became more static in <b>their</b> <b>winter</b> bases. The Western comitatus praesentalis normally was based in and around Mediolanum (Milan) and the two Eastern comitatus {{in the vicinity of}} Constantinople.|$|E

George Washington ordered Sullivan's Expedition, Rangers, to enter Central New York and suppress the Iroquois threat.

We used satellite telemetry to determine the duration of wintering period, to examine the characteristics of wintering areas used by Ospreys, and to quantify space use and activity patterns of wintering Ospreys.

5|$|The 1952 Winter Olympics, officially {{known by}} the International Olympic Committee as the VI Olympic Winter Games, were a multi-sport event held in Oslo, Norway, from February 14–25, 1952. A total of 694 athletes {{representing}} 30 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated at the Games in 22 events across 8 disciplines.

5|$|Athletes from 24countries won {{at least}} one medal, leaving 53countries without a medal. Germany led in overall medals (36) for the second {{consecutive}} Winter Games. Immediately following the Games, Germany was also the gold medal leader with twelve. Two years later, Norway was awarded two extra gold medals, raising their total to thirteen and giving them the lead. In addition, Norway tied the former Soviet Union in 1976 for most gold medals at a Winter Olympics. This record would later be broken by Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Croatia and Estonia won the first medals and first Gold medals in <b>their</b> <b>Winter</b> Olympic history, while Australia and China won their first gold medals. With 36 total medals, Germany set a record for most total medals at a Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Birds need {{to alter}} their {{metabolism}} {{to meet the demands}} of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to <b>their</b> <b>winter</b> grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|Ghana first {{participated in}} a Summer Olympic Games as the Gold Coast at the 1952 Games in Helsinki, Finland. They participated on 12 {{occasions}} prior to 2010, winning four medals along the way; three in boxing and a bronze medal in 1992 for the football team. In 2010, the nation made <b>their</b> <b>Winter</b> Olympics debut in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

5|$|In late October and November 1860, Comanches led by Peta Nocona {{conducted}} numerous {{raids on}} various settlements, {{culminating in the}} brutal killing of a pregnant woman. On hearing of these incidents, Houston sent several 25-man companies to assist Ross. A citizen's posse had tracked the raiders to <b>their</b> <b>winter</b> village along the Pease River. As the village contained at least 500 warriors and many women and children, the posse returned to the settlements to recruit additional fighters. Ross requested help from the U.S. Army at Camp Cooper, which sent 21 troops.|$|E

5|$|Major General George B. McClellan, {{commanding}} the Army of the Potomac, determined {{to take the}} Confederate capital of Richmond via the Virginia Peninsula. This unexpected move would, in theory, allow McClellan's army to move quickly up the peninsula rather than fighting through Northern Virginia. During March 1862, the Army of the Potomac was gradually transferred by water to Fortress Monroe {{at the end of}} the Virginia Peninsula. On March 10, 1862, the 22nd left <b>their</b> <b>winter</b> camp and were shipped to Fortress Monroe. By April 4, the regiment began to advance, along with many other elements of the Army of the Potomac, up the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. <b>Their</b> <b>winter</b> camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them {{at the very top of}} the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholic {{and more}} {{traditional}} Protestant clergy wear green vestments at liturgical celebrations during Ordinary Time. In the Eastern Catholic Church, green {{is the color}} of Pentecost. Green is one of the Christmas colors as well, possibly dating back to pre-Christian times, when evergreens were worshiped for their ability to maintain their color through the winter season. Romans used green holly and evergreen as decorations for <b>their</b> <b>winter</b> solstice celebration called Saturnalia, which eventually evolved into a Christmas celebration. In Ireland and Scotland especially, green is used to represent Catholics, while orange is used to represent Protestantism. This is shown on the national flag of Ireland.|$|E
