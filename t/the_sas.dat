5|$|After {{the first}} sweep by the attack helicopters, two Chinooks carried <b>the</b> <b>SAS</b> to Gberi Bana. The troopers fast-roped {{into the village}} and {{immediately}} came under fire from the West Side Boys. Early on in the confrontation, the British operation sustained its first casualty—a round entered Trooper Bradley Tinnion's flank, leaving him seriously injured. He was dragged back to the helicopter and flown to the medical team aboard the RFA Sir Percivale, dying despite intensive resuscitation attempts on board. <b>The</b> <b>SAS</b> proceeded to clear the village, engaging those West Side Boys who offered resistance and capturing those who surrendered, including Foday Kallay.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief <b>the</b> <b>SAS</b> and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after <b>the</b> <b>SAS</b> had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E

5000|$|Commenting on <b>the</b> <b>SAS's</b> action, Social Services Secretary Norman Fowler agreed: [...] "Mrs Thatcher {{attracted}} {{public support}} because {{she seemed to}} be taking action which the public overwhelmingly thought was right but never thought any government would have the nerve to carry out".|$|R
5|$|The Special Air Service (formally 22 Special Air Service Regiment, or 22 SAS) is a {{regiment}} of the British Army {{and part}} of the United Kingdom's special forces. <b>The</b> <b>SAS</b> was sporadically assigned to operations in Northern Ireland {{in the early stages of}} the British Army's deployment in the province, during which they were confined to South Armagh. The first large-scale deployment of SAS soldiers in the Troubles was in 1976, when the regiment's D Squadron was committed. <b>The</b> <b>SAS</b> soon began to specialise in covert, intelligence-based operations against the IRA, using more aggressive tactics than regular army and police units operating in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The hostage-takers {{and their}} cause were largely {{forgotten}} after the Iran–Iraq War broke {{out later that}} year and the hostage crisis in Tehran continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought <b>the</b> <b>SAS</b> to the public eye {{for the first time}} and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. <b>The</b> <b>SAS</b> was quickly overwhelmed by the number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from a fire that broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.|$|E
5|$|The raid lasted {{seventeen}} {{minutes and}} involved 30–35 soldiers.

5|$|The two villages {{were to be}} {{assaulted}} simultaneously—Gberi Bana, {{where the}} Royal Irish were held, by <b>the</b> <b>SAS</b> and Magbeni by the paras.

5|$|With the {{progression}} of the plans, the enhanced A Company was tasked with planning for {{an assault on the}} village of Magbeni, to the south of Rokel Creek, while <b>the</b> <b>SAS</b> would aim to release the captive Royal Irish soldiers by assaulting Gberi Bana, on the north bank. The Magbeni assault had several purposes: to neutralise weapons in the village which could disrupt <b>the</b> <b>SAS</b> operation, to distract the West Side Boys in Magbeni and prevent them from crossing Rokel Creek to interfere with the operation in Gberi Bana, to defeat the West Side Boys and destroy their military capabilities, and to recover the Royal Irish patrol's vehicles.|$|E
