25|$|The {{assumption}} of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions {{of what is}} aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> agree {{in at least one}} point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but {{they do not have to}} do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human.|$|E
500|$|Bertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine {{and colleagues}} {{compared}} Jeanne Calment {{with a list}} of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. [...] "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end".|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{generally}} recognised prestige, {{the competition}} has been strongly criticised by some established Australian pianists. The pianist and composer Larry Sitsky said: [...] "The title Sydney International Piano Competition sounds grand and definitive. But behind the facade {{is a rather}} shabby private party in progress". The Liszt specialist and composer Leslie Howard said: [...] "I was asked {{to be on the}} international advisory panel for this years ago ... and since then have never heard from any of them. ... No-one, of course, will ever hear from any of the prize-winners. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have had rather too close connections with members of the jury, which in any case is composed mostly of lacklustre teachers ... who have never been professional concert pianists in their lives and wouldn't recognise good and original artistry if it jumped up and bit them". Michael Kieran Harvey has asked: [...] "What does the complete lack of success past SIPCA winners have had at making a career say about the cloth-eared selectors who travel around the world at great expense auditioning young hopefuls? Why, if SIPCA is such an internationally significant competition, are second-rate teachers no-one's ever heard of, to say nothing of completely unqualified non-musicians, sitting in judgment at this supposedly premier music event?" [...] Despite his criticism, Harvey agreed to become the commentator for the ABC's radio broadcast of the 2000 competition, [...] "in an attempt to provide some objective analysis".|$|E

2500|$|As {{former member}} and founder Bullington puts it [...] "we {{can play an}} old folks home in the {{afternoon}} and then play for a bunch of punk rockers, or whoever else might still be up and ready for a good time, or some music at midnight. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> enjoy it equally." [...] Fellow founder Sickmen claims [...] "the original intent of the band [...] [...] was to bring old-time Appalachian country punk rock." [...] Band member Jesse [...] "Baby J." [...] Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: [...] "We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is." [...] The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. [...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness." [...] "I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals. Then we have some old-time songs we play in our own way." ...|$|E

50|$|The team privately {{discussed}} Scaredycat's {{finding and}} pondered on their options. However, despite their anger for {{being treated as}} expendable pawns, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> brush it off, {{with the exception of}} Radian. More and more troubled, Radian again communicated with the Horde and made an agreement with them.|$|R

6000|$|Dan felt a balm in this; he too {{had noticed}} a superfluity of ideals in Alice, he had borne {{the burden of}} {{realising}} some of them; <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> relate in objectionable degree to his perfectionation. So he said gloomily, [...] "She was very good. And I was to blame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes there is. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be {{very fond}} of her, and yet to laugh about her, and never to be quite sure what she will do next." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, gentlemen,' {{said the}} coroner, rubbing his hands, 'we've only got three cases this morning, so I sha'n't {{have to keep}} you long. And <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be quite simple.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is not the}} worst, {{though she}} {{sometimes}} is hard to bear. I can't {{tell you what it}} is, but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> think so much of themselves. In the first place they never will say a word about papa." ...|$|E
60|$|If the Black Kendah saw him go, {{of which}} I am doubtful, for <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{be lost in}} {{consultation}} round their king and the dead general, Goru, they {{made no attempt to}} follow him. Another possibility is that they thought he was trying to lead them into some snare or ambush.|$|R
6000|$|To {{the eye of}} Bertram <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be lost in dreamy reverie, but Redhand observed, with {{a feeling}} of anxiety, that he who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be their chief sat in that {{peculiar}} attitude which indicates intense attention.

60|$|At {{this point}} Mabel {{rose from the}} table, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> become aware of her existence. She began putting the dishes together. The young doctor looked at her, but did not address her. He had not greeted her. She {{went out of the}} room with the tray, her face impassive and unchanged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Damme! <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be millionaires in America. Wish I {{knew how}} they managed it. Honestly, I hope. Mr. Peters is an honest man, but his {{digestion}} is bad. He used to bolt his food. You don't bolt your food, I hope, Adams?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{went away}} {{then in a}} {{thoughtful}} mood. I said, {{this is a good}} pleasure excursion. I like it. The passengers are not garrulous, but still they are sociable.

6000|$|... 'You see,' {{continued}} Lawford, in {{the same}} quiet, dispassionate undertone, 'I wouldn't mind {{if it was only}} myself. But {{there are so many of}} us, so many selves, I mean; and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have a voice in the matter. What is the reality to this infernal dream?' ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{before we}} reached the {{confines}} of the town, a pretty young girl, with some lovely lilies in her hand, ran forward and presented them <b>to</b> Good--somehow <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> like Good; I think his eye-glass and solitary whisker gave him a fictitious value--and then said that she had a boon to ask.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{immediately}} we {{must have}} come upon the Selenites. There were six of them, and they were marching in single file over a rocky place, making the most remarkable piping and whining sounds. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> become aware of us at once, all instantly became silent and motionless, like animals, with their faces turned towards us.|$|R
60|$|Lord Ballindine {{received}} them in {{the same}} costume, and very glad <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> see him again. When an Irish gentleman is popular in his neighbourhood, nothing can exceed the real devotion paid to him; and when that gentleman is a master of hounds, and does not require a subscription, he is more than ever so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not all of them, Gran'pa Jim, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} 'passed by the Board of Censors'--perhaps when {{their eyes were}} shut. I love the good pictures, and I know that you do, but some we have seen lately gave me the shivers. So, perhaps Miss Stearne is right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you'd better tell him, then, in {{your own}} popular way, which <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} so well," [...] responded the daughter. Mr. Wynn cast {{a quick glance at}} her, but there was no trace of irony in her face--nothing but a half-bored indifference as she walked toward the window.|$|E
60|$|Still {{all for the}} best; but I {{am having}} a heart-breaking time over DAVID. I have nearly all corrected.

6000|$|... "I hope not, sir," [...] Mr. Richards said; [...] "there {{are three}} or four in my house, and there are ten at Mr. Sargent's, and two at Carr's, who have gone on the sick list. I sent for the doctor, {{and he may have}} seen them by this time; <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have been knocked down and kicked." ...|$|R
60|$|He looked {{round on}} his friends {{with an air}} of {{combined}} solemnity and triumph. The solemnity without the triumph marked the faces of his friends as they returned the look in profound silence, for <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> feel that the prince {{was in a state of}} exaltation, and that something approaching to the nature of a prophecy had been uttered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard {{something}} {{of this as}} I came up the lakes," [...] rejoined Ben; [...] "and fell in with a trader, an old acquaintance, from Canada, and a good friend, too, though he is to be my enemy, according to law, who gave me {{to understand that the}} summer would not go over without blows.

60|$|Saturday, 22.--Still {{all for the}} best; but I {{am having}} a heartbreaking time over David. I have nearly all corrected.

60|$|To sit in {{the room}} of this young American woman, with its blue hangings, and talk and drink tea till midnght! Ah these naïve Americans--they are a good deal older and shrewder than we, once it nears the point. And <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> feel {{as if the world}} were coming to an end. And they are so truly generous of their hospitality, in this cold world.|$|E
60|$|It {{is curious}} {{how many of}} these modern financiers of chance and bluff have ended their careers by building. It was not merely my uncle. Sooner or later <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> bring their luck to the test of realisation, try to make their fluid opulence {{coagulate}} out as bricks and mortar, bring moonshine into relations with a weekly wages-sheet. Then the whole fabric of confidence and imagination totters--and down they come....|$|E
50|$|One of {{the things}} that made The Spice Trail so watchable was the enthusiasm - the effusiveness - of all involved. No one looked like they'd been kowtowed into it by some executive. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be {{genuinely}} engaged. And so it was that, not only did we meet the buyers and sellers of the spices in question, but we got to go into people's homes and hear about their families.|$|R
60|$|The {{girls were}} so ridiculously dressed, too, {{that they were}} in rags before supper. How could the boys help {{treading}} on their trains? And yet when their trains were trodden on, they often showed temper again, and looked as black, they did! However, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be pleased when Mrs. Alicumpaine said, 'Supper is ready, children!' And they went crowding and pushing in, as if they had had dry bread for dinner.|$|R
