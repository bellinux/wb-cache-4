5000|$|In {{descriptive}} statistics, the quartiles [...] of a ranked {{set of data}} {{values are}} the three points that divide the data set into four equal groups, each group comprising {{a quarter of the}} data. A quartile is a type of quantile. The first quartile (Q1) is defined as the middle number between the smallest number and the median of the data set. The second quartile (Q2) is the median of the data. The <b>third</b> <b>quartile</b> (Q3) is the middle value between the median and the highest value of the data set.|$|E

Splitting the observations either side of the median gives two groups of four observations. The median of the first group is the lower or first quartile, and is equal to (0 + 1)/2 = 0.5.

50|$|The term {{percentile}} and {{the related}} term percentile rank are often used in the reporting of scores from norm-referenced tests. For example, if a score is at the 86th percentile, where 86 is the percentile rank, it {{is equal to the}} value below which 86% of the observations may be found (carefully contrast with in the 86th percentile, which means the score is at or below the value of which 86% of the observations may be found - every score is in the 100th percentile). The 25th percentile is also known as the first quartile (Q1), the 50th percentile as the median or second quartile (Q2), and the 75th percentile as the <b>third</b> <b>quartile</b> (Q3). In general, percentiles and quartiles are specific types of quantiles.|$|E

In addition, when an inguinal pain questionnaire was administered to these individuals at a median followup of 9.4 years, physical ability was affected more in the open repair group. Predictors of chronic pain in the TEP group included Body Mass Index ≤ 3rd quartile (OR: 3.04), difference in preop and postop physical testing (OR: 2.14) and time to full recovery exceeding the median (OR: 2.09).

40|$|Patients after coarctation repair {{still have}} an {{increased}} risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. This has been explained by the persisting hypertension and alterations in the peripheral vessels. However, involvement of the central vessels such as the retinal arteries is virtually unknown. A total of 34 patients after coarctation repair (22 men and 12 women; 23 to 58 years old, age range 0 to 32 years at surgical repair) and 34 nonhypertensive controls underwent structural and functional retinal vessel analysis. Using structural analysis, the vessel diameters were measured. Using functional analysis, the endothelium-dependent vessel dilation in response to flicker light stimulation was assessed. In the patients after coarctation repair, the retinal arteriolar diameter was significantly reduced compared to that of the controls (median 182 mum, first to <b>third</b> <b>quartile</b> 171 to 197; vs 197 microm, first to <b>third</b> <b>quartile</b> 193 to 206; p > 0. 001). These findings were independent of the peripheral blood pressure and age at intervention. No differences were found for venules. The functional analysis findings were not different between the patients and controls (maximum dilation 3. 5 %, first to <b>third</b> <b>quartile</b> 2. 1 % to 4. 5 % vs 3. 6 %, first to <b>third</b> <b>quartile</b> 2. 2 % to 4. 3 %; p = 0. 81), indicating preserved autoregulative mechanisms. In conclusion, the retinal artery diameter is reduced in patients after coarctation repair, independent of their current blood pressure level and age at intervention. As a structural marker of chronic vessel damage associated with past, current, or future hypertension, retinal arteriolar narrowing has been linked to stroke incidence. These results indicate an involvement of cerebral microcirculation in aortic coarctation, despite timely repair, and might contribute to explain the increased rate of cerebrovascular events in such patients...|$|E

40|$|Background—Vascular {{responses}} to drug-eluting stents in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are unknown. In the prospective, multicenter Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial, patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction within 12 hours of symptom onset were randomized 3 : 1 to TAXUS EXPRESS paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) or EXPRESS bare metal stents (BMS). Methods and Results—A formal intravascular ultrasound substudy enrolled 464 patients {{with baseline and}} 13 -month follow-up imaging at 36 centers. Overall, 446 lesions in 402 patients were suitable for standard qualitative and quantitative analyses, which were performed at an independent blinded core laboratory. The primary prespecified end point was the in-stent percent net volume obstruction at follow-up. Median stent length measured 23. 4 mm (first and <b>third</b> <b>quartiles,</b> 18. 5 and 31. 9 mm). PES compared with BMS significantly reduced 13 -month percent net volume obstruction (6. 5 % [first and <b>third</b> <b>quartiles,</b> 2. 2 % and 10. 8 %] versus 15. 6 % [first and <b>third</b> <b>quartiles,</b> 7. 2 % and 28. 8 %]; P 0. 0001). PES compared with BMS also resulted in more late-acquired stent malapposition (29. 6 % versus 7. 9 %; P 0. 0005) resulting from positive vessel remodeling. Plaque and/or thrombus protrusion through stent struts was initially present in 70. 4 % of PES and 64. 8 % of BMS; all resolved during follow-up. New aneurysm formation, stent fracture, and subclinical thrombus were uncommon, although seen only in PES. Conclusions—PES compared with BMS significantly reduce neointimal hyperplasia in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction but also result in a high frequency of late-acquired stent malapposition {{as a result of}} positive vesse...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the preliminary Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) in terms of Kerma Area Product (KAP) and fluoroscopy time (Tf) during Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP) procedures. Additionally, an investigation was conducted to explore the statistical relation between KAP and Tf. Data from a set of 200 randomly selected patients treated in 4 large hospitals in Greece (50 patients per hospital) were analyzed in order to obtain preliminary DRLs for KAP and Tf during therapeutic ERCP procedures. Non-parametric statistic tests were performed in order to determine a statistically significant relation between KAP and Tf. The resulting <b>third</b> <b>quartiles</b> for KAP and Tf for hospitals (A, B, C and D) were found as followed: KAPA = 10. 7 Gy cm^ 2, TfA = 4. 9 min; KAPB = 7. 5 Gy cm^ 2, TfB = 5. 0 min; KAPC = 19. 0 Gy cm^ 2, TfC = 7. 3 min; KAPD = 52. 4 Gy cm^ 2, TfD = 15. 8 min. The <b>third</b> <b>quartiles,</b> calculated for the total 200 cases sample, are: KAP = 18. 8 Gy cm^ 2 and Tf = 8. 2 min. For 3 out of 4 hospitals and for the total sample, p-values of statistical indices (correlation of KAP and Tf) are less than 0. 001, while for the Hospital A p-values are ranging from 0. 07 to 0. 08. Using curve fitting, we finally determine that the relation of Tf and KAP is deriving from a power equation (KAP = Tf^ 1. 282) with R^ 2 = 0. 85. The suggested Preliminary DRLs (deriving from the <b>third</b> <b>quartiles</b> of the total sample) for Greece are: KAP = 19 Gy cm^ 2 and Tf = 8 min, while the relation between KAP and Tf is efficiently described by a power equatio...|$|R

With an aim to contribute toward {{the establishment of}} the Indonesian National Diagnostic Reference Levels (NDRLs), a nationwide survey of the entrance surface doses received by adult patients during the most typical X-ray examinations has been performed. A number of 44 hospitals in 21 cities located in Java, Bali, Sumatera, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi islands were selected randomly to participate in this survey. Eight most common adult X-ray examinations in 13 projections, as well as four children X-ray examinations in six projections, were included in the list of procedures under consideration. Hospitals of different sizes and levels using different X-ray machines were represented in the survey. Standard thermoluminescence dosemeters were applied to measure entrance surface dose (ESD). A total of 1493 patients, consisting of 1208 adults and 285 children, were included in this study.

Second, we systematically study the sample mean and standard deviation estimation problem under more general settings where the first and <b>third</b> <b>quartiles</b> are also available for the trials.
