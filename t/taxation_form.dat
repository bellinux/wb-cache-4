40|$|In the Polish {{tax system}} {{conditions}} wide possibilities of choosing {{the form of}} tax burdens have been reserved especially for natural persons running a business. A smooth switching over from one form into another is also possible, obviously not only in pursuance of tax provisions but also taking into consideration one’s own benefit from the change of <b>taxation</b> <b>form.</b> By choosing a <b>taxation</b> <b>form</b> the following elements should also be taken into account: organizational and legal form of tax payer’s business, place of running a business, kind, object, amount of taxation, abatements, exemptions and the way of documenting economic occurrences. The tax payer who is making a choice should analyse the dependence which may take place between the anticipated profitability in the economic business carried on and the particular <b>taxation</b> <b>form.</b> He should also analyse anticipated proceeds and eventual deductions, influence {{on the amount of}} allowable expenses and assess the degree of arduousness the tax payer must bear while keeping recording facilities, which are required with different forms used in the taxation. To summarize, tax lump sums can be a preferential <b>taxation</b> <b>form</b> in relation to general principles, but only for some groups of tax payers especially of minor businesses (often limited by the number of perons employed or by the amount quota of turnover) who show in their economic activity a tendency of gaining proportionally “large” income, revenues to “small” costs in the sphere of running a business. The circle of lax payers entitled {{to make use of the}} simplified taxation principles is broadly defined in view of the object categories of the kind of business run. In the last couple of years, however, a tendency of leaving this form of taxation and adopting general principles by tax payers has been observable. It is connected with the fact of disseminating exemptions from the income and value added taxes. The fact of establishing a due tax duty in advance and not after the tax year completed or the fact of relief taxation in a particular business is more and more of minor importance for tax payers. A steadily increasing number of institutions rendering a professional service as far as tax documentation of tax payer is concerned, can also constitute the encouragement to adjust general principles. Only in individual forms of running a typical craftsman business it can be of interest to tax payers, provided this way of running a business is competitive in relation to other economic subjects functioning on the market.

40|$|Firms employ land, capital, and labour {{to produce}} a {{homogeneous}} commodity which is used for consumption and investment. Government levies a tax at a flat rate and spends the proceeds on public consumption and public investment. Factor income and capital gains on land, diminished by <b>taxation,</b> <b>form</b> disposable income. Households save a fixed share of disposable income. Savings, in turn, serve to finance both private investment and capital gains on land. This {{gives rise to a}} portfolio made up of two assets: land and capital. Land income consists of land rents and capital gains, whereas capital income consists of interest payments. In equilibrium, land and capital yield the same rate of return after tax. Under the restrictive income tax (excluding capital gains), a tax increase generally raises the land price. Under the comprehensive income tax (including capital gains), a tax increase has no bearing on the land price. Under special land taxes, however, a tax increase lowers the land price. ...|$|E

25|$|Njegoš {{was born}} in the village of Njeguši, near Montenegro's then-capital Cetinje. He was educated at several Montenegrin monasteries, and became the country's spiritual and {{political}} leader following the death of his uncle Petar I. After eliminating all initial domestic opposition to his rule, he concentrated on uniting Montenegro's tribes and establishing a centralized state. He introduced regular <b>taxation,</b> <b>formed</b> a personal guard and implemented a series of new laws to replace those composed by his predecessor many years earlier. His taxation policies proved extremely unpopular with the Montenegrin tribes, and were the cause of several revolts during his lifetime. Njegoš's reign was also defined by constant political and military struggle with the Ottoman Empire, and by his attempts to expand Montenegro's territory while gaining unconditional recognition from the Sublime Porte. He was a proponent of uniting and liberating the Serb people, willing to concede his princely rights in exchange for a union with Serbia and his recognition as the religious leader of all Serbs (akin to a modern-day Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church). Although unification between the two states did not occur during his lifetime, Njegoš laid some of the foundations of Yugoslavism and introduced modern political concepts to Montenegro.|$|R
