5|$|Following on {{from the}} {{previous}} volume in the series, The Calculus Affair, The Red Sea Sharks was created {{with the aid of}} Hergé's team of artists at Studios Hergé. Influenced by Honoré de Balzac's The Human Comedy, Hergé used the story as a vehicle in which to reintroduce a wide range of characters who had first appeared in earlier installments of the series. The story dealt with the ongoing trade in enslaved Africans across the Arab world, however in the 1960s the story would generate controversy as Hergé was repeatedly accused of having portrayed <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> in a racist manner. He was upset by these claims, and made alterations to the depiction of <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> in later reprints. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in Tibet, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Red Sea Sharks was critically well-received, with various commentators describing it {{as one of the best}} Tintin adventures. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

Even though the Federation was semi-independent, the linking provoked opposition from African nationalists, and the NAC gained popular support. An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. Hastings Banda, a European-trained doctor working in Ghana who was persuaded to return to Nyasaland in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause. Banda {{was elected president of}} the NAC and worked to mobilise nationalist sentiment before being jailed by colonial authorities in 1959. He was released in 1960 and asked to help draft a new constitution for Nyasaland, with a clause granting Africans the majority in the colony's Legislative Council.|$|E

40|$|May 26, 2011, {{marked the}} ten-year {{anniversary of the}} {{establishment}} of <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union, and with {{the sudden death of}} Muammar al Gaddafi, who was instrumental in the creation of <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union, <b>the</b> time is ripe to fully re-assess the ability of <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union to ensure state compliance with the Constitutive Act of <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union (Constitutive Act) and <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (<b>African</b> Charter). <b>The</b> <b>African</b> continent {{has a long history of}} massive human rights abuses. Prior to 2001, <b>the</b> Organization of <b>African</b> Unity (OAU) was responsible for ensuring that African states complied with international law and respected the human rights of their citizens. Given the OAU’s many failures, including its inability to stop or prevent human rights violations, member states of the OAU elected to overhaul the OAU and establish <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union on May 26, 2001. Previous writings by legal scholars on <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union have generally concluded that <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union, like its predecessor the OAU, has been unable to protect human rights in Africa or ensure state compliance with the democratic and human rights principles set forth in <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Charter. This Article contributes to the body of scholarship on the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union by analyzing <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union’s response to the political and humanitarian crises in Madagascar, Guinea-Conakry, Zimbabwe, Libya, and Kenya from both a realist and institutionalist perspective on state compliance with international law. This Article argues that while <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union’s handling of the crises in Madagascar and Guinea-Conakry indicates that <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union is successfully providing incentives for its smaller and less powerful member states to comply with the Constitutive Act and <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Charter, <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union’s ultimate resolution of the crisis in Zimbabwe and its feeble responses to the political turmoil in Libya and Kenya signal that <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union continues to be plagued by a number of problems, including, but not limited to, the following: limited political will, failure to timely and uniformly impose sanctions, state reporting failures, and inadequately drafted governing instruments. This Article will propose a number of solutions to these problems, such as revising <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Charter to eliminate claw-back clauses, amending the Constitutive Act, revising the protocol establishing the Peace and Security Council to remove the principle of equitable regional representation and rotation, better utilizing <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Union Commission on International Law, and revising the protocols establishing <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights and <b>the</b> <b>African</b> Court of Justice and Human Rights...|$|R

5|$|The {{situation}} looked set {{to improve}} in spring {{when the new}} Caliph, Umar II (r. 717–720), sent two fleets to the besiegers' aid: 400 ships from Egypt under a commander named Sufyan and 360 ships from Africa under Izid, all laden with supplies and arms. At the same time, a fresh army began marching through Asia Minor {{to assist in the}} siege. When the new fleets arrived in the Sea of Marmara, they kept their distance from the Byzantines and anchored on the Asian shore. The Egyptians were in the Gulf of Nicomedia near modern Tuzla and <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> south of Chalcedon (at Satyros, Bryas and Kartalimen). Most of the Arab fleets' crews were composed of Christian Egyptians, however, and they began deserting to the Byzantines upon their arrival. Notified by the Egyptians of the advent and disposition of the Arab reinforcements, Leo launched his fleet in an attack against the new Arab fleets. Crippled by the defection of their crews, and helpless against Greek fire, the Arab ships were destroyed or captured along with the weapons and supplies they carried. Constantinople was now safe from a seaborne attack. On land too the Byzantines were victorious: their troops managed to ambush the advancing Arab army under a commander named Mardasan and destroy it in the hills around Sophon, south of Nicomedia.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{expected}} to be eventually reimbursed, Waters Smith {{had to pay for}} the care of <b>the</b> <b>Africans</b> from his own pocket.
