40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the sandwich problem, a generalization of the recognition problem introduced by Golumbic et al.

We prove that the sandwich problem corresponding <b>to</b> <b>excluding</b> a chordless cycle of fixed length k is NP-complete. We prove that the sandwich problem corresponding <b>to</b> <b>excluding</b> Kr∖e for fixed r is polynomial. We prove that the sandwich problem corresponding to 3 PC(⋅,⋅) -free graphs is NP-complete. These complexity results {{are related to the}} classification of a long-standing open problem: the sandwich problem corresponding to perfect graphs...|$|R
40|$|Non-farm rural {{enterprises}} (NFRE) {{are increasingly}} studied {{because of their}} role in poverty reduction. However, existing studies {{of the effects of}} infrastructure on NFRE may give incorrect inferences because they typically fail to account for spatial effects. Such effects could reflect either spatial errors due <b>to</b> <b>excluded</b> local effects or spatial lags due <b>to</b> <b>excluded</b> interactions, such as between households switching out of farm work. We use rural investment climate survey data from Indonesia that allow distances between each household to be measured so that spatial effects can be modeled to assess the bias from ignoring such effects.

5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials.

Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
