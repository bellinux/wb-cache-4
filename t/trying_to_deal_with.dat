Thus, South Vietnamese attempts to stage an effective counter-attack were quickly blunted by the combined Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces in Quảng Ngãi Province.

In addition, in some cases bodies were not buried for days, because no one came to collect them.

Meanwhile, other diseases like malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea were not being treated properly because the health system was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> Ebola patients.

25|$|In {{regards to}} the prophetic works, the {{character}} Oothoon represented America in Visions of the Daughters of Albion and she is raped by the character Bromion. The book represents her as trapped by a philosophical system created by John Locke, {{and no one is}} able to hear her pleas except for the daughters of Albion. The implications of the work are taken up again in America with the King of England trembling as he witnesses Orc and the rebelling colonies. Although there is a vision of rebellion, there is no actual freedom {{at the end of the}} poem just as in the Visions of the Daughters of Albion. Unlike the Visions of the Daughters of Albion, America, as well as Europe, describes nations that are trying to determine their own destiny instead of individuals <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> theirs. The Song of Los is connected to both America and Europe in that it describes Africa and Asia, which operate as a sort of frame to the other works. As such, the three works are united by the same historical and social themes.|$|E

40|$|Background: Nowadays, {{more and}} more mental health {{professionals}} manage patients who fail treatment for major psychiatric disorders. There is not a consensus on how <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> treatment-resistance patients, but usually psychiatrists result to polypharmacy. Method: In reviewing the evidence based clinical research we will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> answer some questions about treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. Treatment-resistant symptoms complicate the clinical course of all psychiatric disorders especially schizophrenia, causing the patients not to reach the therapeutical goal and enter remission. In consequence, polypharmacy is used <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the remaining symptoms, raising other issues. Summary: We will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> this problematic issue through clinical studies and major research done <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and answer the question posed...|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that when Zosimus records that the natives expelled the Roman civilian administration in 409 he might have been referring to the Bacaudic rebellion of the Breton inhabitants of Armorica since he describes how, {{in the aftermath of the}} revolt, all of Armorica and the rest of Gaul followed the example of the Brettaniai. A later appeal for help by the British communities was, according to Zosimus, rejected by the Emperor Honorius in 410 AD. In the text called the Rescript of Honorius of 411, the Western Emperor Honorius tells the British civitates to look to their own defence as his regime was still fighting usurpers in the south of Gaul and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the Visigoths who were in the very south of Italy. The first reference to this rescript is written by the sixth-century Byzantine scholar Zosimus and is located randomly in the middle of a discussion of southern Italy; no further mention of Britain is made, which has led some, though not all, modern academics to suggest that the rescript does not apply to Britain, but to Bruttium in Italy.|$|E
