5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies <b>to</b> <b>jump-start</b> agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E

From 1997 to 1998 an additional 300 Taurus were imported, and the number of E85 fueling grew to 40. Then in 1998 the city of Stockholm placed an order for 2,000 of FFVs for any car manufacturer willing to produce them. The objective was <b>to</b> <b>jump-start</b> the FFV industry in Sweden. The two domestic car makers Volvo Group and Saab AB refused to participate arguing there were not in place any ethanol filling stations. However, Ford Motor Company took the offer and began importing the flexifuel version of its Focus model, delivering the first cars in 2001, and selling more than 15,000 FFV Focus by 2005, then representing an 80% market share of the flexifuel market.|$|E

40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) {{has become a}} key part of national development strategies for many countries. They see such investments as strengthening domestic capital, productivity, and employment, all of which are crucial <b>to</b> <b>jump-starting</b> economic growth. While many highlight FDI’s positive effects, others blame FDI for "crowding out" domestic investment and lowering certain regulatory standards. While FDI’s impact depends on many conditions, well-developed and implemented policies can help maximize its gains. Transparency is another indispensable ingredient which warranties sustenance of high capital flows in an economy. Transparency, in order to be better scrutinized has to be analyzed from two perspectives. First aspect is analyzing set of government policies that increase the risk and uncertainty faced by foreign investors. Uncertainty stems from the presence of bribery and corruption, unstable economic policies, weak and poorly enforced property rights, and inefficient government institutions. High levels of non-transparency can greatly retard the amount of foreign investment that a country might otherwise expect. The second aspect of transparency that has been discussed is Transparency between sellers and buyers, that we call capital-market transparency; and transparency between managers and owners, that we call corporate-governance transparency...|$|R

40|$|For many years, {{territorial}} principles anchored {{an international}} system organized around nation-states. Recently, however, {{the human rights}} movement has sought to change the state-centric focus {{of international law and}} overcome the limitations of a system where the territorial state is the primary actor. The field of human rights has promoted a new legal orthodoxy that places the person {{at the center of the}} international legal system. Within this orthodoxy, non-state actors play a prominent role, unilateral domestic lawsuits are promoted, and territorial borders give way when necessary for humanitarian intervention. In contrast, territorial conceptions of international law are viewed as outdated and ill-equipped to deal with a globalized world. Prevailing wisdom in the human rights community, at least among academic scholars, now suggests that non-territorial models of governance are better in protecting and enforcing human rights. This article challenges that wisdom. Globalization and territorial governance can be consistent in the field of human rights. The article advances two principle arguments. First, concepts of territorial sovereignty and the multilateralism upon which international law operates achieves an underappreciated balance between state and individual rights that often serves as a foundational prerequisite for human rights to flourish. The rejection of territoriality may undermine the hard fought gains the human rights movement has achieved. Second, in the long run, strong territorial states will remain critical to a world system that promotes human dignity. A disaggregated state, where globalized, American-style interest group politics controls, is unlikely to be favorable to human rights over time. The article concludes that territorial approaches to global governance have greater promise than many assume <b>to</b> <b>jump-starting</b> greater respect for, and enforcement of, human rights. The human rights community would benefit from re-embracing traditional multilateral legal solutions as the primary way of achieving meaningful reform...|$|R
