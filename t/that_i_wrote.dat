500|$|Bob Mercer {{felt that}} Bush's {{relative}} lack of success in the United States compared {{to the rest of}} the world was due to her music being a poor fit for American radio formats, and that there were no outlets for the visual presentation central to Bush's appeal. EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with NME magazine in 1982 Bush criticised this marketing technique, stating: [...] "People weren't even generally aware <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body." [...] In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, Lionheart, to take advantage of the success of The Kick Inside. Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with Lionheart, feeling that she had needed more time to get it right. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. While it had spawned several hit singles, most notably [...] "Wow", it did not garner the same reception as her first album, reaching number six in the UK album charts.|$|E

Archer constantly tries to imitate Burt and always raves about Burt's movies and all-around awesomeness. So to have Burt recording voice-overs for the show was just amazing."
