40|$|The optical {{structure}} of general commercial interferometers, e. g., the Michelson interferometers, {{is based on}} a non-common <b>optical</b> <b>path.</b> Such interferometers suffer from environmental effects because of the different phase changes induced in different <b>optical</b> <b>paths</b> and consequently the measurement precision will be significantly influenced by tiny variations of the environmental conditions. Fabry-Perot interferometers, which feature common <b>optical</b> <b>paths,</b> are insensitive to environmental disturbances. That would be advantageous for precision displacement measurements under ordinary environmental conditions. To verify and analyze this influence, displacement measurements with the two types of interferometers, i. e., a self-fabricated Fabry-Perot interferometer and a commercial Michelson interferometer, have been performed and compared under various environmental disturbance scenarios. Under several test conditions, the self-fabricated Fabry-Perot interferometer was obviously less sensitive to environmental disturbances than a commercial Michelson interferometer. Experimental results have shown that induced errors from environmental disturbances in a Fabry-Perot interferometer are one fifth of those in a Michelson interferometer. This has proved that an interferometer with the common <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> structure will be much more independent of environmental disturbances than those with a non-common <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> structure.
