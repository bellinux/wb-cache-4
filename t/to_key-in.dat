Given a book, a user {{would like to}} quickly see the main details like Author, Title, no of chapters, start {{and end of the}} chapters in the book. However, the scanning process of a book results in a set of digital images and OCR-ed text (if OCR is available in that language). Extraction of details of structural meta-data from OCR-ed text is not that easy, and it is even more difficult to extract the information from the images. To overcome this issue, the structural meta-data is entered manually for each book, and a tool is required <b>to</b> <b>key-in</b> the structural meta-data. In this paper, we describe a tool developed <b>to</b> <b>key-in</b> the structural meta data for different language including Indian languages using QWERTY key-board...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the comparison of}} two Web-based systems with different methods of input and different methods of feedback. The Japanese writing CALL system, which {{was developed by the}} authors (called the T system), enables learners <b>to</b> <b>key-in</b> Japanese sentences freely, detects learners ’ errors and displays appropriate feedback messages to guide learners to correct their errors by themselves. Another system (called the M system) enables learners to input their answer from a multiple selection, and displays only the correct answer as feedback, regardless of the learner’s response. Twenty-two Japanese language learners were involved in a compari-son experiment to examine the usefulness of the T system. The results show that the T system is preferred to the M system in the input method and the feedback method. The results indicate that the ‘freely input ’ method and the ‘feedback corresponding to the learner’s typed sentence’ is better than the ‘multiple selection ’ method and ‘feedback that only displays the correct answer’, respectively...|$|E

Aside from these, they are now required to do intensive Outcome-Based Education (OBE) assessments, and Continual Quality Improvement (CQI) planning and implementation. An automated OBE assessment tool is therefore required to ease the burden among the lecturers and provide a standard method of assessment. To assist in this process, this paper presents a blueprint of a software-enabled quantitative measurement of the Learning Outcomes (LO) and the Programme Outcomes (PO) in the module level. The blueprint consists of macro-enabled worksheets that automatically calculate the students’ individual LO and PO attainments based on their respective module assessment marks whereby the lecturer only need <b>to</b> <b>key-in</b> the subject details of assessments-LO mapping, LO-PO mapping and the students’ assessment marks. Once the marks are in place, LO and PO attainments are calculated automatically to provide the corresponding bar charts based on the individual attainments of the students. A LO or a PO {{is said to be}} attained when the number of students achieved the Key Performance Index (KPI) set by the department. The results will then be used by the lecturer to prepare an annual module review and prepare a CQI plan for the next semester...|$|E
40|$|The core of {{this paper}} is {{reflecting}} actual language use as the "performance" of the language learners. The areas of investigation involves examining the structural linguistics patterns used by the language learners while preparing the essays, in terms of using the part-of-speech (POS) and the sentence level syntactical analysis of the most frequently used POS, which reflects the distributional patterns of the linguistic components used. The methodology applied is fundamental as it tends to investigate the linguistic components in the compiled genre-specific corpus. Computer-based syntactical studies are limited as it requires hard work and long hours in order <b>to</b> <b>key-in</b> the data {{and then there is the}} complex analytic method of describing the findings. This paper presents steps taken for corpus compilation and moves identification of the written Malaysian University English Test, in short MUET. It comprises a move analysis and a multidimensional analysis conducted using a compiled representative corpus of MUET essays. As a descriptive and a corpus-based study, it explored the written essays produced by ESL learners in three matriculation colleges in Malaysia. Language and language use are commonly analyzed for competence and performance. Competence is best described as the internalized linguistic knowledge as acquired by the learners while the notion of "performance" is best defined as the external evidence of language competence. This paper proposes structural linguistics investigations such as frequency analyses, sentence level syntactical analyses, distributional patterns of sentence level linguistic structural patterns and subject-verb agreement analyses reflecting the writers’ knowledge of applying their grammatical linguistics knowledge into their written output in various different contexts...|$|E
40|$|Maximising {{revenues}} {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges of regional airports especially after the introduction of deregulation and privatisation of airports with the increase of aggressive competition in the markets. The calculation of aeronautical revenues generation has always been considered as a straightforward method and airport managers generally overlooked on the importance of daily operational factors such as the different flight services offered at the airports, the type of aircraft airlines utilised, time of the day the flight arrives or departs, and the number of passengers the airlines ferry in and out of their airport, types of destination and how these factors influence the generation of aeronautical revenues for their airport. The first objective of this research is to measure the airside operation factors that influence the generation of aeronautical revenues deterministically. The influential variables were determined through literature reviews and case studies of regional airports in the Netherlands and Malaysia, and were validated with regression analysis. Preliminary model was developed based on the determinants and the model was analysed using Bayesian Network theory. Thus, the research is also geared towards developing a baseline matrix using stochastic approach to analyse the effect of airside operation factors on aeronautical revenues generation as the second objective. The next objective concerns with the formulation of mathematical optimisation algorithm known as Aeronautical Revenue Optimisation Model (AROM) to generate maximum aeronautical revenues for regional airport in line with the objectives of the airport. Finally, the research embarks on developing a graphical user interface (GUI) tool based on the model to estimate the possible potential aeronautical revenues that could be generated which will be useful for airport managers in their decision making. The GUI for AROM is a user friendly tool which allows airport managers <b>to</b> <b>key-in</b> the main input parameters such as mode of operations (arrival or departure), traffic types (Schedule, Business, Charter, etc.), flights details (day or night, weekday or weekend, number of passengers, international or domestic), fleet types (aircraft weight and engine type) and type of flights (domestic or international) in order to determine the composition offlight operations that produces optimum aeronautical revenues that could be achieved. Results obtained show that the maximum revenue achieved is based on flights composition, which is more focused towards certain types of traffic types with higher frequency for each of them in contrast to the current practise of offering small number of all sorts of traffic types. The model developed in this research is flexible; it allows decision makers to set the upper bound of flight constraints. The model can also be extended to include bigger sets of flight details, for example, to have day, evening and night flight instead of just day and night. Aside from that, the parameter can also be generalised such as to consider all international flights instead of domestic and international. The traffic types can also be adjusted to include shorter or longer list of traffic types to suit the airport's services...|$|E
