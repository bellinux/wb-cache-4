However, more investigation has led to the belief that the mechanism is more of a radical polymerization process, since radicals tend to be trapped in the films, and termination can be overcome by reinitiation of oligomers.

500|$|The year 1983 saw Streep play {{her first}} non-fictional character, the nuclear {{whistleblower}} and labor union activist Karen Silkwood {{who died in}} a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, in Mike Nichols's biographical film Silkwood. Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood, and in preparation she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality. She said, [...] "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside." [...] Jack Kroll of Newsweek considered Streep's characterization to have been [...] "brilliant", while Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite Karen's father Bill thinking that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down. Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast. Streep next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance Falling in Love (1984), which was poorly received, and portrayed a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II in the British drama Plenty (1985), adapted from the play by David Hare. For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed [...] "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms."

To understand Climacus's concept of the individual, it is important <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> he says regarding subjectivity. What is subjectivity? In very rough terms, subjectivity refers to what is personal to the individual—what makes the individual who he is in distinction from others. It is what is inside—what the individual can see, feel, think, imagine, dream, etc. It is often opposed to objectivity—that which is outside the individual, which the individual and others around can feel, see, measure, and think about. Another way to interpret subjectivity is the unique relationship between the subject and object.|$|E

Unlike traditional psychological perspectives, discursive psychology does not approach {{the question of what}} psychology comprises and explains from an analyst's perspective.

The step from assuming that talk reflects <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> talk does is paramount. Discursive psychologists analyze how direct and indirect appeals to mental states do things in the interaction, such as accusing, defending, building expertise, complaining, and complimenting. Rather than determining the truth value of what people report – by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> a person really wants, thinks, or feels, or what the world really looks like – discursive psychology focuses on the interactional business performed with these descriptions. Limited memories may, for instance, account for a forgotten action, while displays of anger may enhance the genuineness and spontaneity of an explanation. The action-oriented approach to language makes discursive psychology radically different from cognitivist traditions in psychology that treat mental states as the source or cause of what is being said...|$|R
