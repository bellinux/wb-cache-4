Subsequent {{catalogues}} of stellar spectra classified the stars {{based on the}} strengths of absorption lines at specific frequencies, or by comparing the strengths of different lines. Thus, in the MK Classification system, the spectral class B0 has the line at wavelength 438.7 nm being stronger than the line at 420.0 nm. The Balmer series of hydrogen lines grows stronger through the B class, then peak at type A2.

For MS stars and those with abundance index 1 or 2, the same TiO band strength criteria as for M stars can be applied. Ratios of different ZrO bands at 530.5 nm and 555.1 nm are useful with abundance indices 3 and 4, and the sudden appearance of LaO bands at cooler temperatures. The ratio of Ba and Sr lines is also useful at the same indices and for carbon-rich stars with abundance index 7 to 9. Where ZrO and TiO are weak or absent the ratio of the blended features at 645.6 nm and 645.0 nm can be used to assign the <b>temperature</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E

Suspended HRBCs {{were exposed to}} rotating electric fields {{in the range from}} 50 kHz to 250 MHz in a rectangular 4 -electrode microchip chamber. ER spectra was recorded at external conductivities ranging from 0. 02 – 3. 00 S/m. The electrode structures were fabricated on glass chips by laser ablation of a platinum layer. Different measuring temperatures were used. At low conductivities, the temperature of the microscopic stage was kept constant by a thermostat. At higher medium conductivities, the additional temperature increase in the measuring volume due to Joule heating was registered. Measured data in the range from 20 to 35 °C were then sorted according to different <b>temperature</b> <b>classes</b> of a width of 5 K.

50|$|The {{planet has}} the third lowest {{insolation}} {{of the known}} transiting planets (only Gliese 436 b and HD 17156 b have lower insolation). The temperature implies it falls into the pL class of hot Jupiters: planets which lack significant quantities of titanium(II) oxide and vanadium(II) oxide in their atmospheres {{and do not have}} temperature inversions. An alternative classification system for hot Jupiters is based on the equilibrium temperature and the planet's Safronov number. In this scheme, for a given <b>temperature,</b> <b>class</b> I planets have high Safronov numbers and tend to be in orbit around cooler host stars, while class II planets have lower Safronov numbers. In the case of WASP-11b/HAT-P-10b, the equilibrium temperature is 1030 K and the Safronov number is 0.047±0.003, which means it is located close to the dividing line between the class I and class II planets.|$|E

Stellar components earlier than type F 1 were detected in 22 cases. While 20 of the hot secondaries are seen weakly in optical spectra, two are UV discoveries: HD 58134 and HD 183864. The hot companions are classified accurately by <b>temperature</b> <b>class</b> from their far-UV spectra. The interstellar extinction of each system and the relative luminosities of the components are derived from the UV and optical fluxes, using a new grid of UV intrinsic colors for hot dwarfs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} slag addition on strength development and workability of fly ash/slag based geopolymer (FASLG) concrete cured at normal <b>temperature.</b> <b>Class</b> C fly ash with high ferrite (Fe) content {{was used as the}} primary material. The proportions of fly ash (FA) to slag (SL) are: 1 FA : 0 SL, 0. 9 FA : 0. 1 SL, 0. 7 FA : 0. 3 SL, and 0. 5 FA : 0. 5 SL. The workability and strength properties were determined by slump, vikat, and compressive strength tests. The result shows that the highest compressive strength was achieved by FASLG- 3 concrete with 30 % slag addition and exhibited a comparable strength to that normal concrete at 28 days. The 30 % slag addition also improve the workability and increase the setting time of FASLG concrete specimens. It can be concluded that the slag inclusion on fly ash will improve the performance of geopolymer concrete at normal temperature...|$|E

During this time we obtained 1139 spectra on 146 OB stars to measure mean systemic radial velocities and radial velocity variations. We spectroscopically identify 73 new OB stars for the first time, the majority of which {{are likely to be}} Association members.

40|$|Microtubules in {{eukaryotic}} cells {{participate in}} a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic structures, reflecting functional requirements and cell cycle position. We are studying the cellular regulation of microtubule assembly and organization in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We screened for genes that when overexpressed suppress the growth phenotype of conditional mutants in c-tubulin that arrest with excess microtubules at the non-permissive <b>temperature</b> (<b>Class</b> 2 mutations). Here we describe one such suppressing element, called ATS 1 (for Alpha Tubulin Suppressor). Overexpression of this gene rescues both the growth and microtubule phenotypes of all Class 2 mutations, but not the cold-sensitive mutations that arrest with no microtubules (Class 1). Deletion of ATS 1 confers a modest slow growth phenotype which is slightly enhanced in strains containing both a deletion of ATS 1 and a Class 2 tub] mutation. The predicted ATS 1 protein contains 333 amino acids, and has considerable structural homology to the products of both the mammalian mitotic control gene RCC 1 and to the S. cerevisiae gene SRMIIPRP 20. Overexpression of SRMIIPRP 20 also suppresses Class 2 mutants. The results suggest that this family of genes may participate in regulatory interactions between microtubules and the cell cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{synchrony}} {{of initiation}} of chromosomal replication in single cells was determined in ten different dnaA(Ts) mutants. After inhibiting {{the initiation of}} replication but allowing initiated rounds of replication to terminate, we measured the number of fully replicated chromosomes per individual cell by flow cytometry. Synchronous initiation at the several independent origins (oriC) in single rapidly growing cells would give 2 '' (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, [...] .) chromosomes per cell, whereas asynchronous initiation was indicated {{by the presence of}} a different number of chromosomes. Mutations mapping in {{the central part of the}} dnaA gene (dnaA 5, dnaA 46, dnaA 601, dnaA 602, and dnaA 604) lead to a high degree of asynchrony (class I mutants), whereas mutations mapping in either of the distal parts of the gene (dnaA 508, dnaA 167, dnaA 203, and dnaA 204) yielded a low degree of asynchrony at the permissive <b>temperature</b> (<b>class</b> 2 mutants). The dnaA 205 mutant exhibited an intermediate degree of asynchrony. Mutants dnaA 203 and dnaA 204 (promoter distal) differed from the other class 2 mutants (dnaA 167, dnaA 508; promoter proximal) in that asynchrony increased no more than twofold between 25 and 37 degrees C compared with the more-than-fourfold increase in the latter. The high degree of asynchrony in class 1 mutants was independent of temperature and was not due to insufficient functional DnaA protein, because overproduction of DnaA 46 protein did not decrease the asynchrony. The data demonstrate that the DnaA protein has functions in addition to acting positively in the initiation process and negatively as its own repressor, namely in coordinating initiations at all oriC sites within a single cell...|$|E

We adopted a consensus clustering technique that obtains climate regions for precipitation and temperature separately. Both average linkage hierarchical and k-means non-hierarchical clustering methods were used to create weather station clusters. Using the resulting precipitation and temperature clusters as training data, we performed a machine-learning decision tree classification of remotely-sensed data (i. e., MODIS and TRMM) to map five precipitation <b>classes</b> and seven <b>temperature</b> <b>classes</b> for the Carolinas. These data were intersected to produce 17 consensus clusters for the Carolinas, and 16 climate regions when summarized by counties. The resultant climate regions showed rational climate regionalization reflecting controls on Carolina climate including topography, latitude, storm tracks, and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The use of remotely-sensed data effectively helped the delineation between weather station clusters and even detected consensus clusters that were not identified by intersecting weather station clusters grouped using only in-situ data. We compared the regions with the 15 existing National Climatic Data Center climate divisions using within- and between-cluster standard deviations for both in-situ and remotely-sensed data. Climate regions could improve the existing climate divisions in delineating climatologically homogeneous regions and in separating heterogeneous regions. close 121...|$|R

Past studies of transport variability at this latitude have assumed transport estimates from each hydrographic section to represent annual average conditions. In this study the uncertainty in this assumption is assessed through use of Rapid-WATCH observations to quantify subseasonal and seasonal transport variability.
