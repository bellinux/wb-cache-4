These Glocks are identical to a standard Glock 17/22 except for their red frame; some models have an inert barrel (without a chamber, thus preventing the accidental chambering of a live cartridge) and no firing pin hole in the breech face (preventing someone from using a live barrel with the <b>training</b> <b>slide).</b> The difference between models is that to perform a 'reset' of the trigger, a cycling of the slide has to be performed on the 17P/22P, {{but not on the}} 17R.|$|E

40|$|This project {{presents}} pavement treatment practice {{guidelines and}} a distress identification manual {{for the purpose}} of improving the INDOT pavement preservation practices. The treatment guidelines consist of 10 treatment types for asphalt pavements and composite pavements and 8 treatment types for Portland cement concrete pavement (PCCP). The treatment guidelines include treatment descriptions, benefits, applicable pavement conditions, treatment materials, and treatment procedures. The guidelines are based on information obtained mainly from the INDOT Standard Specification, the INDOT Design Manual, and the INDOT Field Operations Handbook for Crew Leaders. The treatments are covered in the guidelines. The distress identification manual presents the different types of distresses found on the surfaces of asphalt pavement, composite pavement, and PCCP. Each distress type in this manual is presented along with descriptions, causes, measurements, and pictures of each type of distress. The manual is mainly based on the Distress Identification Manual for the Long Term Pavement Performance Program (LTPP) and the INDOT Design Manual. To implement the guidelines and the manuals, <b>training</b> <b>slides</b> were developed and are enclosed in this report. The <b>training</b> <b>slides</b> were developed to address all topics of the pavement preservation treatment area and combine to make one set of training materials suitable for Indiana. The <b>training</b> <b>slides</b> for pavement preservation implementation can help to enhance the overall construction quality of treatments by illustrating the appropriate use of such treatments in applications, thereby contributing to their improved performance. This improvement will help to ensure that the treatments are used to their maximum benefit and efficiency...|$|R

In this paper, {{we deal with the}} challenge of automating Glomerulus classification and detection from digitized kidney slide segments using a deep learning framework. The proposed method applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) between two classes: Glomerulus and Non-Glomerulus, to detect the image segments belonging to Glomerulus regions. We configure the CNN with the public pre-trained AlexNet model and adapt it to our system by learning from Glomerulus and Non-Glomerulus regions extracted from <b>training</b> <b>slides.</b> Once the model is trained, labeling is performed by applying the CNN classification to the image blocks under analysis. The results of the method indicate that this technique is suitable for correct Glomerulus detection in Whole Slide Images (WSI), showing robustness while reducing false positive and false negative detections...|$|R

5000|$|The ride {{starts with}} a left turn {{out of the station}} and on to the 125 ft (38.1 m) lift hill. At the base of the lift hill, the train reaches its maximum speed of 65 mph (104.607 km/h). Following the lift hill are two {{camelback}} hills, the first being 100 ft (30.5 m) tall, and the second being 95 ft (29 m) tall. In these hills, riders experience [...] "ejector air-time". The train then jumps a bunny hop and another camelback hill and a double-up hill, before turning around for the second half of its course. After the turnaround, the train hits another bunny hop and another double-up hill. After the double-up hill there is a series of six bunny hop hills. After the last hill there is an on-ride photo camera and the ride's finale, a 630 degree helix, in which riders experience lateral g-force. After the helix, the <b>train</b> <b>slides</b> on to the final brake-run and executes a U-turn back into the station.|$|R
