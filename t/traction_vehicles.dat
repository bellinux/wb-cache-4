50|$|The {{installation}} were to {{be performed}} in 20 stages over a period starting in 2010 until 2015. The first activation in daily routine had been scheduled for 11 October 2011 on the S1 line - reconstruction of all north-south lines (S1, S2, S6) was to commence in 2011. The investigation committee of the Senate of Berlin {{pointed out that the}} admission certificate of the most common <b>traction</b> <b>vehicles</b> will run out in 2017 - given the (non-fatal) train accidents in 2001 and 2002 due to exceeding speed (that allowed to overrun the overlap distance hitting another train that was still in the station) it was expected that the Eisenbahn-Bundesamt regulator will require a modern train stop system to be installed during the renovation as a prerequisite for a renewed admission. Prolonging the old admission was expected to be unlikely to be done {{for more than three years}} making the ZBS train control system a requirement for any movement authority in the S-Bahn rail network presumably by 2018 and no later than 2020.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe narrow-gauge {{locomotive}} ‘Hydrogen Pioneer’, {{which was}} developed and constructed at the University of Birmingham, was employed to establish {{the performance of a}} hydrogen-hybrid railway <b>traction</b> <b>vehicle.</b> To achieve this several empirical tests were conducted. The locomotive utilises hydrogen gas in a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell power-plant to supply electricity to the traction motors or charge the on-board lead-acid batteries. First, the resistance to motion of the vehicle was determined, then operating tests were conducted for the speeds 2  km h− 1, 6  km h− 1, 7  km h− 1, and 10  km h− 1 on a 30  m straight, level alignment resembling light running. The power-plant and vehicle efficiency as well as the performance of the hybrid system were recorded. The observed overall duty cycle efficiency of the power-plant was from 28 % to 40 % and peak-power demand, such as during acceleration, was provided by the battery-pack, while average power during the duty cycle was met by the fuel cell stack, as designed. The tests establish the proof-of-concept for a hydrogen-hybrid railway <b>traction</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the results indicate that the traction system can be applied to full-scale locomotives...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} serial {{communication}} bus for a <b>traction</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The first part summarises requirements on a serial bus for a distribution control system inside a <b>traction</b> <b>vehicle.</b> According to requirements a suitable bus controller was chosen. The main effort is concentrated on the definition of a new communication protocol. The protocol is called the Vehicle Local Bus (VLB). It is based on a Controller Area Network. The serial bus supports all necessary data types for a real time control as short period data, short sporadic data, critical-deadline sporadic data, message data. The serial bus can be implemented {{on a wide range of}} microcontrollers or microprocessors because a programming interface is defined in the C language. The results of the thesis are also presented on an actual application for a high speed intercity train. The design of the auxiliary drive control system utilizes three difference controller boards with the VLB interface. All controller boards are based on the INTEL 196 microcontrollers.

SBB Cargo uses dual-voltage locomotives for its Switzerland-Italy services: 21 Re 484 locomotives and 12 Re 474 locomotives. In total, 495 <b>traction</b> <b>vehicles</b> were in service during 2013. For its freight services in Switzerland and Germany, SBB Cargo uses 45 Am 843 diesel shunters with environment-friendly soot particle filters. These locomotives help improve the production efficiency of heavy shunting operations and are equipped with radio remote-control systems. The Biel works uses an additional 45 modernised Tm IV shunting tractors. After the refit, the shunting tractors will be classified as type Tm 232.In summer 2010, SBB Cargo ordered 30 new two-axle hybrid locomotives (type Eem 923 Hybrid) from Stadler Winterthur AG to replace the Bm 4/4 shunting locomotives and various three-axle shunting locomotives used for light freight duties for wagonload traffic, since the old locomotives no longer met current requirements in terms of age, cost-effectiveness and performance. The newly developed model {{is based on the}} Ee 922 shunting locomotive which SB already uses for shunting duties in its Passenger division. The hybrid version for SBB Cargo has an electric motor and an auxiliary diesel engine for use on non-electrified sidings. The Eem 923 hybrid has a maximum speed of 120 km/h.

40|$|The {{structures}} of modern <b>traction</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{are based on}} new generation devices. Technical progress {{within the field of}} power transmission concerns such elements as sources of power supply, electric devices and energy electronic solutions in power transmission systems. The prototypes of <b>traction</b> <b>vehicles</b> being currently drawn up are hybrid vehicles using different kinds of sources of power supply of power transmission systems, the most important of which are combustion engines, contact systems, supercapacitors (ultracapacitors), accumulators and fuel cells. Main engines are usually electric machines. In energy electronic starting systems it is permissible to use all kinds of main electric engines, for example, direct-current motors (inline engines, commutator motors with permanent magnets or non-commutator motors) or three-phase motors of alternating current (induction and synchronous). This means a complete change of rules in energy managing in a vehicle. Sources of energy can have the function of basic power supply (contact system, combustion engine or combustion cell) or the function of power supply support (supercapacitors, accumulators or fuel cell). New functions of drive operation will be available, namely, leveling of basic power supply load, recuperation of braking energy of the whole train set, driving at the temporary disconnection of basic power supply (short-term application of accumulator as basic power supply). Each of the above functions can contribute to the improvement of watt-hour efficiency of the system or to prolonging the range of driving. Therefore, i...|$|E
