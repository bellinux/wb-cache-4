However, his tenure was short-lived after PML (N) left the PPP led coalition government in May 2008 to lead the movement <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> Pervez Musharraf and to restore judiciary.|$|E

5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|E
5|$|By January 1967, Suharto felt {{confident}} that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was heard from him, and he died in June 1970. On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto {{for the first of}} his five-year terms as President.|$|E
5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought to have the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E

5|$|The adverse results {{momentarily}} {{put a stop}} to Republican calls <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed {{itself and}} passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|E
5|$|The liberal {{views of}} Wang Yangming were {{opposed by the}} Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of {{orthodox}} Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used any opportunity <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> members of the other faction from court.|$|E
5|$|After Sharif's {{return to}} Pakistan from exile in 2007, Abbasi joined him {{and ran for}} {{a seat in the}} National Assembly in the 18 February 2008 general {{election}} as a candidate of the PML (N), and was successfully re-elected for the fifth time with 99,987 votes from Constituency NA-50 (Rawalpindi). The election resulted in a hung parliament where PPP had secured the most seats in the National Assembly and PML (N) the second most. After the formation of a coalition government between PPP and PML (N) with Yousaf Raza Gillani as Prime Minister, Abbasi was inducted into the federal cabinet of Gillani with the status of a federal minister in March 2008 and was appointed as the Minister for Commerce. However, he resigned from the ministerial office after PML (N) left the PPP-led coalition government in May 2008 to lead the movement <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> Pervez Musharraf and to restore the judiciary.|$|E

While his impeachment was historic, the debate and final action on July 22 was anticlimactic. No on really doubted that Claiborne would be impeached or {{that it would be}} unanimous. On August 6, 1986 the U.S. House presented articles of impeachment to the U.S. Senate.|$|R

5|$|At first, {{there was}} only one {{political}} party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The party was, however, broken into three divisions that would later split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly over the issue of slavery, but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was dominant in the beginning. The Noble party was in favor of slavery, and the Hendricks party was generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's. After two months of debate in the House, and Jennings having destroyed the evidence of his role, the House of Representatives dropped the investigation and issued a resolution that confirmed Jennings in his position as governor.|$|E
5|$|Investigating {{appropriations}} led Randall {{to focus}} on financial impropriety in Congress and the Grant administration. The most famous of these was the Crédit Mobilier scandal. In this scheme, the Union Pacific Railroad bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company, the Crédit Mobilier of America. Crédit Mobilier was owned by the railroad's principal shareholders and, as the investigation discovered, several congressmen also owned shares {{that they had been}} allowed to purchase at discounted prices. Randall's role in the investigation was limited, but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> Vice President Schuyler Colfax, who had been implicated in the scandal. Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals, as well, including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors (known as the Sanborn incident) and fraud in the awarding of postal contracts (the star route scandal).|$|E
5|$|The Long Parliament proved just as {{difficult}} for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> the king's leading counsellors of high treason. Strafford {{was taken into}} custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; John Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the following day, and he consequently fled to the Hague with Charles's permission on 21 December. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the Triennial Act, which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so. The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted royal assent in February 1641.|$|E

5|$|The king's uncle Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, and Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, {{became known}} as the Lords Appellant when they sought <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> five of the king's favourites and {{restrain}} what was increasingly seen as tyrannical and capricious rule. Later they were joined by Henry Bolingbroke, the son and heir of John of Gaunt, and Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk. Initially, they were successful in establishing a commission to govern England for one year, but they were forced to rebel against Richard, defeating an army under Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, at the skirmish of Radcot Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius Gracchus {{was elected}} tribune in 133 BC. He {{attempted}} {{to enact a}} law which would have limited the amount of land that any individual could own. The aristocrats, who stood to lose {{an enormous amount of}} money, were bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the Plebeian Council, but the law was vetoed by a tribune named Marcus Octavius. Tiberius then used the Plebeian Council <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> Octavius. The theory, that a representative of the people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority. His law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered with 300 of his associates when he stood for reelection to the tribunate.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Rowan was {{appointed}} to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, serving until his resignation 1821. He was again elected to the state legislature in 1823. With the state reeling from the Panic of 1819, Rowan became the leader of a group of legislators dedicated to enacting laws favorable to the state's large debtor class. He believed {{the will of the people}} was sovereign and roundly denounced the Court of Appeals for striking down debt relief legislation as unconstitutional. He led the effort <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> the offending justices, and when that effort failed, spearheaded a movement to abolish the court entirely and replace it with a new one, touching off the Old Court – New Court controversy. New Court partisans in the legislature elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate in 1824. During his term, the nascent Whig Party ascended to power in the state legislature, and at the expiration of his term in 1831, the Whigs replaced him with party founder Henry Clay.|$|E

5|$|On 19 October 1920, the Oklahoma State militia was {{organized}} as the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard and organized with troops from Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The division {{was organized}} and federally {{recognized as a}} US Army unit on 3 August 1923 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Prior to World War II, the division was called on many times to maintain order in times of disaster and to keep peace during periods of political unrest. Oklahoma Governor John C. Walton used division troops to prevent the State Legislature from meeting when they were preparing <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> him in 1923. Governor William H. Murray called out the guard {{several times during the}} depression to close banks, distribute food and once to force the State of Texas to keep open a free bridge over the Red River which Texas intended to collect tolls for, even after federal courts ordered the bridge not be opened.|$|E
5|$|The 1845 {{legislature}} met {{three different}} times, under two different structures. First, from June 24 to July 5, 1845, the legislature met in Oregon City, {{first at the}} home of John E. Long and then the home of Theophilus R. Magruder, with Morton M. McCarver serving as the speaker of the group. After this, the Organic Laws were replaced with the Organic Act of 1845, which altered the legislature in several ways. First the number of representatives was increased to include a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 61. Second, the name was changed to the House of Representatives. All members of the body were to be elected by popular vote with vacancies filled using special elections. The body also received new powers <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> any civil official by a 3/4ths vote, apportion the legislators among the districts, create post offices, levy taxes, declare war, organize and call out the militia, create lower courts, pass laws concerning the general welfare of the region, regulate trade with the Native Americans, regulate liquor sale and manufacture, and regulate the police power of the government, among other powers. Meetings continued to be in June and December.|$|E
5|$|The Diet {{responsibilities}} {{includes the}} making of laws, {{the approval of the}} annual national budget, the approval of the conclusion of treaties and the selection of the Prime Minister. In addition, it has the power to initiate draft constitutional amendments, which, if approved, are to be presented to the people for ratification in a referendum before being promulgated by the Emperor, {{in the name of the}} people. The Constitution also enables both houses to conduct investigations in relation to government, demand the presence and testimony of witnesses, and the production of records, as well as allowing either house of the Diet to demand the presence of the Prime Minister or the other Minister of State, in order to give answers or explanations whenever so required. The Diet is also able <b>to</b> <b>impeach</b> Court judges convicted of criminal or irregular conduct. The Constitution, however, does not specify the voting methods, the number of members of each house, and all other matters pertaining to the method of election of the each members, and are thus, allowed to be determined for by law.|$|E

50|$|The {{removal of}} Johnston {{proved to be}} the Oklahoma Legislature's apex of {{dominance}} against the other two branches of state government. Over the first two decades of Oklahoma's state existence, the state legislature had brought impeachment charges against four governors and had removed two. Only Governors Charles N. Haskell and Robert L. Williams would wield great executive power during this time. With the state legislature's power diminished in reaction to its impeachment ambitions, the body would never again come close <b>to</b> <b>impeaching</b> and removing another Oklahoma governor from office.|$|R
