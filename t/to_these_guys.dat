500|$|According to Paul Mullie, having Froot Loops as O'Neill's breakfast was not scripted, {{and he is}} unsure if {{the loop}} {{reference}} was intentional. [...] This was contradicted by Script coordinator Cath-Anne Ambrose who said [...] "I had to get Froot Loops cleared , and so the guy calls me back and says, 'Well {{how do you feel}} about Eggo Waffles? Would you consider using Eggo Waffles instead of Froot Loops?' So I go <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> [...] and ask, 'How do you feel about waffles?' And they're like, 'No! It's Froot Loops! It's a time loop! No!' Waffle sales were down." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21.

After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys.</b> They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E
2500|$|Bennington {{reflected}} on joining Stone Temple Pilots, stating, [...] "Every band {{has its own}} kind of vibe. Stone Temple Pilots has this sexier, more classic rock feel to it. Linkin Park is a very modern, very tech-heavy type of band. I grew up listening <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys.</b> When this opportunity came up, {{it was just like}} a no-brainer." [...] Bennington stated in interviews that singing lead vocals in Stone Temple Pilots was his lifelong dream. He left the band on good terms due to his commitments with Linkin Park in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|I {{kept getting}} hurt. I think I had three MRIs {{in two months}} because I wasn't landing right. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> take several years {{to learn how to}} land and I think after I started getting hurt doing it, I started <b>to</b> realize <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> are really {{suffering}} and I kind of gained a respect for their sport.|$|R
5000|$|Rhodes {{states that}} it was because of these Bonds NYC shows that the public became more {{interested}} in hip-hop. [...] "I endeavoured <b>to</b> get <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> on like Grandmaster Flash; not that most of the audience liked them but that led to a helluvalot".|$|R
5000|$|Detective Michelle Vasey {{has stated}} that not all Juggalos are violent or criminals, and the music is not to blame: [...] "We can't {{necessarily}} say that music's to blame. But I think it definitely does have some influences. As an officer {{we have to decide}} when we're talking <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> who do we need to worry about and who don't we need to worry about." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Comic Book Resources, Grant Morrison explained that Batman's fate in the story is [...] "so much better than death. People have killed characters in the past, but to me, that kind of ends the story! I like to keep the story twisting and turning. So what I am doing is a fate worse than death. Things {{that no one would}} expect to happen <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> at all. This is the end of Bruce Wayne as Batman." ...|$|E

5000|$|RJ Frometa from Vents Magazine said; [...] "'Take Me Over' captivates {{listeners}} {{from the}} opening beat. Adam and Reuben have created a harmonious balance between indie and electronica, perfectly complimenting Woolner-Kirkham's blissful and highly-emotive vocals to create an uplifting and sophisticated soundscape that proves when it comes <b>to</b> production, <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> truly {{are at the top}} of their game." ...|$|R
5000|$|One of Jerry Lewis' sons, Gary, told The New York Times upon Petrillo's death that, [...] "When Sammy and {{the other}} guy played in that gorilla movie, I {{remember}} my dad and Dean Martin saying, 'We got <b>to</b> sue <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> — this is no good' ...

5000|$|When I {{personally}} write a song, it's such {{an honor}} and {{a pleasure to}} give that song <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> because I know that song {{is going to be}} interpreted the best way possible. Everyone's going to put their imprint on that song and make that song the best STP song it can be, whether it be the playing or the arranging or the writing of everyone doing their part.... What has really been the body of our records has been that contribution of all of us as four people.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2009, Matlack {{started the}} Good Men Book tour at Sing Sing prison. According to Matlack, [...] "My {{book is about}} manhood and redemption. I have in my mind the image of Johnny Cash going into Fulsom Prison. Like his music, my book is about manhood, raw and unvarnished. So I need to find guys who {{understand}} what that is about. It's also {{about the possibility of}} redemption, about making mistakes, and about picking yourself up. I have no idea what I am going to say <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> but I am going to try." ...|$|E

5000|$|The band's first EP {{of their}} own music, Settings, was {{released}} in March 2010 and was praised by Pitchfork as [...] "an enjoyable listen" [...] and [...] "a punchy introduction <b>to</b> what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> do well".

5000|$|Peter Travers, {{film critic}} for Rolling Stone, {{pointed out that}} when [...] "two Don Corleones team up", he {{expected}} [...] "the kind of movie that makes people say, 'I'd pay <b>to</b> see <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> just read from the phone book.'" [...] However, he concluded, [...] "There's nothing you can't see coming in this flick, including the surprise ending. Quick, somebody get a phone book." ...|$|R
5000|$|Matthew Sanders {{was born}} on 19 December 1972. He began {{learning}} to play the drums while at school in 1988. In 1989 he formed Damaged, a deathgrind band in Ballarat, with Jarrod Bongiorno, Jamie Ludbrook (on bass guitar and vocals) and Paul Meddick. The group's style was described as [...] "hatecore" [...] by SputnikMusic's reviewer, which {{is a combination of}} [...] "death metal, grindcore and hardcore elements". Their debut album, Do Not Spit (1993), was described by MetalBite webzine as [...] "based upon hatred and speed. Speed is everything <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> speedy guitars, speedy vocals and fucking uncontrollably hyper-based speed drumming. Matt is too fast".|$|E
5000|$|Sara {{is shown}} in the series as a {{compassionate}} yet introverted doctor who treated each one of them with the same cordiality and respect. Given this fact, she has little sense of humour and is incorruptible. In the episode [...] "The Rat", Saras father questions her motive for helping Lincoln Burrows, to which she replies, [...] "Its my job to advocate for patients." [...] Sarah Wayne Callies, who portrays Sara Tancredi, remarks that the character [...] "feels a certain level of responsibility <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys.</b> Partly because who her father is... shes {{the kind of person who}} would rather take a stand and sleep well at night than have a peaceful family." ...|$|E
5000|$|After seeing The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, Joel {{decided to}} pursue a career in music. In an {{interview}} he said of the group's impact, [...] "That one performance changed my life … Up to that moment I'd never considered playing rock as a career. And when I saw four guys who didn't look like they'd come out of the Hollywood star mill, who played their own songs and instruments, and especially because you could see this look in John Lennon's face - and {{he looked like he was}} always saying: 'F--- you!' - I said: 'I know these guys, I can relate <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> I am these guys.' This is what I'm going to do - play in a rock band'." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{two best}} words I {{can think of}} to {{describe}} Cry Wolf would be [...] "Dynamic" [...] & [...] "Explosive". I've had the opportunity <b>to</b> see <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> live {{a few times and}} was blown away every time. After one listen to the new album, I'm convinced they've got a winner with this one. The songs have hooks so big I just can't stop listening from start to finish." ...|$|R
5000|$|Joshua Redman {{said that}} [...] "one {{of the reasons}} I wanted <b>to</b> work with <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> — aside from the obvious fact that they're masters — is because they're master storytellers."

5000|$|Discussing {{the series}} {{connection}} to the X-Men films, Nix said that the X-Men team would be missing during the show, which is [...] "not just because they’re too expensive for television" [...] and something that the show would explore. He soon called {{this one of the}} central mysteries of the series, saying, [...] "We're going to be exploring it. It's a huge deal <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys.</b> It's a huge deal in the world." [...] Nix also revealed, in August 2017, that he was particularly influenced by the comic District X which is [...] "just about a district in New York. It's where the mutants are ... the show is not a procedural the comic at all, but it was seeing mutants in society, dealing with crime, drugs, their relationships to each other. We didn’t take any characters from it. It was one of my favorites." ...|$|E
5000|$|Because {{most of the}} {{participants}} that were involved with Project 112 and SHAD were unaware of any tests being done, no effort was made to ensure the informed consent of the military personnel. The US Department of Defense (DoD) conducted testing of agents in other countries that were considered too unethical to perform within the continental United States. Until 1998, the Department of Defense stated officially that Project SHAD did not exist. Because the DoD refused to acknowledge the program, surviving test subjects have been unable to obtain disability payments for health issues related to the project. US Representative Mike Thompson said of the program and the DoD's effort to conceal it, [...] "They told me - they said, but don’t worry about it, we only used simulants. And my first thought was, well, you’ve lied <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> for 40 years, you’ve lied to me for a couple of years. It would be a real leap of faith for me to believe that now you’re telling me the truth." ...|$|E
5000|$|Christian Music Zines Joshua Andre said [...] "with singles View From the Top and About to Fall gaining {{momentum}} and traction {{for both of}} the ingenious music videos and relevant everyday messages; {{it is clear that}} itll be {{a matter of time before}} a major record label deal is given <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys.</b> With an unashamed faith as the backbone for all members, even one listen from this remarkable album is more than enough to hear that this smart and slick musical production coupled with heartfelt and honest lyrics and a passion and hunger for God; is a breath of fresh air in the CCM and mainstream music industry! I would gladly repeat So Much For Love over and over- it speaks volumes about God and this road called life!" [...] In addition, Andre wrote [...] "So Much For Love is one of my favourite pop albums this year, and on a day where Tenth Avenue North, Chris August and Owl City all release new albums, The Wrecking have created an album that could rival any one of the aforementioned artists! Full of double meanings that could create a spike in the sales in the mainstream charts; this album is a memorable entry in 2012! Well done guys, hope you have more exposure in the Christian and the mainstream market! Hats off to producer Dustin Burnett as well!" [...] The favourite tracks according to the reviewer are the following: Electricity, Tidal Wave, Gravity, Glorious, View From the Top, Fighting For Something, Symphony of the Broken Hearted.|$|E
5000|$|Mamet {{published}} Three War Stories, {{a collection}} of novellas, on November 11, 2013. In an interview with Newsmax TV, Mamet {{said he wanted to}} write about war, despite never having served. Moreover, the book allowed Mamet to free characters that had occupied his mind for years. On the subject of characters as a reason for writing, Mamet told the host, “You want <b>to</b> get <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> out of your head. You just want them to stop talking to you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Araya's {{interest}} in serial killers serves as inspiration {{for many of}} his lyrics, including the songs titled [...] "213" [...] about Jeffrey Dahmer and [...] "Dead Skin Mask" [...] about Ed Gein.

2500|$|... "After that NC State game, Eddie Gard befriends me. We {{sat down}} and started talking. He brought in Bigos and Fuertado. He gave me the same old story: 'We control the game.

We can control the game and nobody will get hurt except the gamblers. Now I'm one of the guys. Peer pressure." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Plan was simple. Amos {{knew what}} was going on over at Bert's. When the {{construction}} jobs dried up at the compound, Bert had told Amos that he could come to him if he ever needed anything. It was when he repeated himself and said emphatically, [...] "Anything", that Amos understood. Amos always turned down Bert's offer for [...] "legal" [...] work. But one night in a drunken conversation with the doctor at a local bar, Amos finds out about a chemical that the doctor is working with at the University. The research indicates that the chemical kills anything that it comes into contact with, but that it leaves virtually no trace of itself. The research project on the chemical, which the University had named Veritin-22, was originally funded to see if there could be possible uses for it as a pesticide, but the research indicates that there is no control over what it kills. It kills basically everything that it comes into contact with, and the doctor speculates in passing that even a small amount could kill a large population of buffalo, or elephants, or monkeys, or even people. And as a product of the chemical decomposition, it would not leave a trace of itself. The perfect chemical weapon. They decide to have a meeting with Albert Lai to see if any of his friends could use such a powerful stealth weapon. Both of these guys need a big score. They do some simple math and realize they could potentially put hundreds of thousands of dollars in their pockets, if their consciouses could take it. And hell, <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> that's like millions.|$|E
5000|$|The Orioles cited Thome's veteran {{experience}} on a playoff-bound {{team as a}} primary factor in acquiring him. Orioles catcher Matt Wieters said of Thome, [...] "I think you {{look at him and}} say: This is a guy who loves the game more than anyone. He's the first guy to the park, the first guy to the weight room, the first guy hitting." [...] On July 20, Thome hit his first home run with the Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field.

5000|$|Speaking of the trio's {{experience}} {{playing the}} music of Lead Belly, Blind Lemon Jefferson and other black blues musicians, Koerner later related, [...] "I don’t understand the psychology of it, but somehow we decided <b>to</b> imitate <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> down <b>to</b> the note. And {{we decided to go}} out and drink and party, and chase women just like they did in the songs and all kind of shit. And when I look at it now, it seems weird to tell you the truth." ...|$|R
5000|$|Melbourne {{journalist}} and {{former editor of}} Zebra (dance music insert) in Inpress magazine, Andrez Bergen (aka Little Nobody), described the venue: [...] "Global Village {{was one of the}} most important semi-institutions in Melbourne in the mid '90s especially. The crew behind Global Village, namely M.U.D., were very supportive of the more cutting edge live acts, for example Voiteck, Zen Paradox, Soulenoid, Guyver III, Sense and TR-Storm - who were then known as Void - and it gave <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> the opportunity <b>to</b> play before large and often more-into-it or dare I say 'enlightened' audiences. It also gave audiences the opportunity <b>to</b> see <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> because at more mainstream parties or clubs more mainstream music was played." ...|$|R
5000|$|With Berra now {{standing}} over him and, Linz believed, about to strike him, Linz {{stood up and}} shouted at him. [...] "What are you getting on me for?" [...] he said.
