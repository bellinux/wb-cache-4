5|$|After 1886 Purvis {{became a}} {{resident}} of Hanamaulu, {{on the island of}} Kauai. He was appointed Animal Inspector for Kauai on November14, 1887. In May 1888 he left the Hawaiian Islands for the United States for his health. Settling in Colorado Springs, Colorado, he initially wrote home stating that he was improving, but his condition worsened. His brother Theodore <b>traveled</b> <b>all</b> the way from Hawaii to see him for the last time before he died on August16, 1888. He was 31 {{years old at the time}} of his death. His brother-in-law Edmund William Holdsworth was chosen as administrator of his estate; Purvis' will, written on April22, left everything to his brother Theodore Purvis. His remains were interred in the Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs.|$|E

Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost {{anywhere}} from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005.

5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} event {{of his tenure}} in Salisbury occurred very late in his life when Major Robert Pike, a layman and very prominent member of his church, collided with him {{during the winter of}} 1675 to 1676. There may have been multiple reasons for the severe friction between the men, one of them being that Wheelwright was against the Quaker insurgence into New England, whereas Pike was much more tolerant of their evangelism. Another reason may have been that during the election of 1637, Pike <b>traveled</b> <b>all</b> the way from Newbury to Newtown to vote Governor Vane out of office. A more recent and local cause of dissension was likely over the division of Salisbury when the town of Amesbury was created from it several years earlier. Pike had made certain claims of Wheelwright, to which Wheelwright wrote a petition to the court, and on 10 March 1676 the court sided with Wheelwright. Not easily rebuked, Pike enlisted support from other members of the church and town, following which Wheelwright called for intervention by civil authorities.|$|E
5|$|Udell {{recorded}} that in {{the late}} afternoon of August 27, 1858, the Rose–Baley Party reached the Black Mountains. They made their crossing at Sitgreaves Pass, elevation 3,652 feet and named after Lieutenant Lorenzo Sitgreaves, who led an expedition party to the region in 1851. From the crest they could see the Colorado River in the distance. Having <b>traveled</b> <b>all</b> night and worked continuously during the morning and afternoon, the Rose–Baley Party stopped to prepare their first meal of the day. Soon afterward, a small group of Mohave warriors approached and asked, in a combination of broken English and Spanish, how many people their wagon train included and whether they intended to permanently settle near the Colorado River. The Mohave, who appeared friendly and had brought with them corn and melons, which they sold to the emigrants, were promised that the wagon train planned to travel through the region en route to their intended destination in Southern California. This seemed to appease the Natives, many of whom helped the party during their descent down the western slope of the Black Mountains to the Colorado River below. The emigrants were now entering Mohave country, near present-day Needles, California.|$|E

But a meeting with Frederick the Great bore no fruit and in the surrounding German lands, the same result.

25|$|The {{activity}} of the Shang dynasty in the middle Yangtze area came to a sudden end with the dynasty's destruction by the Zhou people in c. 1046 BC, who in turn established their own dynasty on the Central Plains. To {{the people of the}} Yangtze, however, the Zhou were not unknown. Indeed, the Records of the Grand Historian record that before the conquest of Shang, the ruler of Chu, Yuxiong, had <b>traveled</b> <b>all</b> the way to the Zhou court at Feng in Shaanxi to submit to King Wen of Zhou. Perhaps, speculates Ralph D. Sawyer, Yu Xiong had recognized that the Shang dynasty was crumbling or he simply wanted to ensure good relations with all powerful neighbors. Either way, he recognized the Zhou as promising upstarts and established a friendly relationship with them. Consequently, when the Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty, Chu supported the former by supplying bows and arrows.|$|E
25|$|As the Crimea War broke out, Tolstoy's first {{intention}} was to gather a partisan fighting unit and lead it to the Baltic Sea, should the English decide to land there. Along with Count Aleksey Bobrinsky (future Minister of transport) he started to finance and equip two partisan squads, forty fighters each. He bought some ammunition from Tula and <b>traveled</b> <b>all</b> along the Baltic coastline, examining {{what was supposed to}} be his future theater of war, the Crown Prince being totally unaware of his plans. On 2 September the allies landed at Yevpatoria and Tolstoy headed South, to join the Imperial infantry regiment (under the command of Lev Perovsky, another of his uncles) as an army major, in March 1855. The regiment went only as far as Odessa where a thousand men were lost from typhoid. In February 1856 Tolstoy became one of the casualties. In Odessa he was nursed back to health by Sophia Miller. Alexander II was telegraphed daily on the subject of his old friend's condition, at his personal request. In May 1855 Tolstoy was back on his feet, but the war was over for him; he instead embarked upon a Crimean journey with Sophia.|$|E

500|$|The next eruptive period, the Castle Creek period, began about 400 BCE, and is {{characterized}} by a change in composition of St. Helens' lava, with the addition of olivine and basalt. The pre-1980 summit cone started to form during the Castle Creek period. Significant lava flows in addition to the previously much more common fragmented and pulverized lavas and rocks (tephra) distinguished this period. Large lava flows of andesite and basalt covered parts of the mountain, including one around the year 100 BCE that <b>traveled</b> <b>all</b> the way into the Lewis and Kalama river valleys.

500|$|Lorraine Calvert {{joined the}} series as costume {{designer}} for the season. On adapting Elektra's costume for the season, {{which in the}} comics usually consists of impractically [...] "strappy" [...] red cloth, Calvert decided to make it utilitarian and appealing, while still being faithful to the comics. Originally starting out opposite of the eventual sleek design for both her fighting and daytime attire, Calvert said, [...] "Ideas were tossed around about how she was possibly bohemian, [...] she was a free spirit who <b>traveled</b> <b>all</b> over the world with {{as much money as}} she possibly could." [...] This eventually led to the final, sleeker design, because Elektra [...] "really needs a very simple, elegant line because too much cloth is overwhelming." [...] The costume consisted of [...] "black moto pants, a one-piece zippered body suit, a sleeveless vest, and red cloth to provide the highlights and the hood covering Elektra’s face." [...] The shade of the red used for Elektra throughout the season was chosen so it would not clash with the red in Daredevil's costume, as well as to match the darker tone of the series.|$|E
