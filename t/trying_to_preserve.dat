5|$|The {{station has}} been perennially popular for {{passengers}} and goods, particularly milk and parcels. Major upgrades {{took place in}} the 1870s, the 1910s and the 1960s, each trying to add additional platforms and space while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> the existing services and architecture as much as possible. Paddington was first served by London Underground trains in 1863, as the original western terminus of the Metropolitan Railway, the world's first underground railway. In the 20th century, suburban and commuter services appeared at Paddington as the urban sprawl of London moved westwards. Despite the numerous upgrades and rebuilding, plus damage sustained in particular during World War II, Brunel's original design is still recognisable.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Nunn's wife Beula {{filed for}} divorce from a {{hospital}} bed where she lay dying of cancer. She claimed she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> some of her estate for her children. A Metcalfe County judge granted the divorce, but Nunn challenged the ruling, and it was later set aside. Some property issues were still pending {{at the time of}} Beula's death in 1995. During the divorce proceedings, Nunn's son Steve sided with his mother, causing a rift between him and his father. A 1994 letter from the elder Nunn alleged that Steve Nunn physically and verbally abused Louie Nunn and other members of his family. The letter was discovered in 2009 when Steve Nunn was charged with the murder of his former fiancée, Amanda Ross.|$|E

Several generations became cut off from their own culture and language, with harsh effects on their families and societies.|$|E

[...] This meant that, though Cotto was stripped of his title, Alvarez still had the opportunity to win the championship. Cotto then stated publicly that the reason the WBC stripped him of his title was because he refused to pay their sanctioning fees, which he believed to be excessive.|$|E
500|$|One More Day was panned by {{fans and}} critics. IGN {{reviewer}} Jesse Schedeen described Amazing Spider-Man #545 as [...] "undoubtedly the worst comic Marvel published in 2007" [...] and a [...] "deus ex machina {{of the highest}} order." [...] He did admit that writer Straczynski [...] "had a great handle on the Peter/Mary Jane dynamic," [...] making their potentially final moments mean something, and that Quesada's artistic style made sense given the dark tone. However, he also dismissed the story as [...] "infuriating and downright disrespectful {{to anyone who has}} come to love Spider-Man comics over the years." [...] IGN published two [...] "Additional Take" [...] reviews for Amazing Spider-Man #545. Bryan Joel said that he'd been a [...] "vocal supporter" [...] of [...] "Brand New Day", but summarized the OMD story as [...] "flip, weightless, and painfully brief." [...] Richard George stated that [...] "One More Day" [...] "could prove to be the best example of editorial influence gone horribly, horribly wrong" [...] and [...] "in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> the appeal of Peter Parker, Joe Quesada has actually managed to fundamentally undermine the character." [...] Both Joel and George agreed with their colleague in complimenting Quesada's artwork. Tim Marchman of The Wall Street Journal stated that having Spider-Man make a deal with the devil-like Mephisto is [...] "the rough equivalent of having Z-movie director Uwe Boll film a studio-funded prequel to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver." ...|$|E

500|$|Hideaki Sorachi's {{main focus}} in Gin Tama {{is the use}} of gags; during the manga's second year of {{serialization}} he started to add more drama to the story while still keeping the comedy. Various jokes from the manga are comments regarding clichés from other shōnen series. For example, in the first chapter after Gintoki fights a group of aliens to protect Shinpachi and Tae, Shinpachi complains that he only fought for [...] "one page" [...] and Gintoki replies, [...] "Shut up! One page is a long time for a manga artist!" [...] Gintoki's exaggerated desire to read the Weekly Shōnen Jump (which causes him to fight other readers in order to get it) also makes fun of shōnen, since during those parts characters [...] quote them. Other types of comic situations are more general, so that the reader must know about Japanese culture [...] to understand them. The humour is described by publications as being [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "weird". It is also described as being divided between two categories: [...] "sci-fi comedy" [...] and a [...] "samurai comedy" [...] with the former referring to the aliens. It [...] tends to point out [...] "an irritating foible about modern society" [...] including celebrations days or famous mythical figures. Additionally, there are references to several historical figures with a few characters from the story being based on them. Besides the series' comedy, the aliens' invasion in Japan bring several social issues between them and the humans with the most recurring one being the lack of social equality. As a result, one of the main themes involves society <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> their own way of living rather than fulfilling a dream like in other shōnen series.|$|E
500|$|Brian Riordan, {{one of the}} {{engineers}} who worked on mastering the audio for the DVD described in a video interview with Rolling Stone how the mix was achieved. He recalled getting a call {{from one of the}} show's producers who were looking for specialized sound arrangements to acquire an authentic live concert feeling for the release. Riordan remembered that the main difficulty was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> the [...] "craziness" [...] of the audience and Gaga's fans, and their screaming during the concert, nevertheless make the music of the show primary. His team used Lossy which did not use compression, instead one-to-one audio mixing giving the whole sound system [...] "much more of an impactful experience". Riordan decided to engineer the concert sound as [...] "center-channeled" [...] since Gaga did not use backing audio, resulting in the listener getting the whole impact of her vocals, when listened with a headphone. Other difficulty faced by team included converting the heavy production of Gaga's songs to a live format and utilizing the singer's bands. [...] "You also have the crowd, the house [...] going nuts and all the reverberations at Madison Square Garden, so it was really difficult for me to figure out globally how real, how dry, how punchy can we get this thing to sound", he added. Initially Riordan had featured more of the live instrumentation and mixed the songs a number of times, however felt that they needed a dry reverb hence he pondered on the mix along with co-producer coming to a consensus regarding the sound. According to Riordan, the mixing process was approved by Gaga who watched the cuts while travelling on the tour however, she did not ask Riordan to change anything, unlike previous projects the engineer had undertaken. The 5.1 mix was further orchestrated by using the sound recordings from the microphones placed around the audience members in Madison Square Garden, giving a new dimension to the surround sound in the Blu-ray.|$|E
