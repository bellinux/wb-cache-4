500|$|Even {{though she}} coldly tyrannizes {{virtually}} everyone around her, she is sometimes hurt and confused over being disliked. [...] She admits, [...] "It's lonely on the bench. I thought I'd like {{a place where}} people can't get to you but once in a while..." [...] A colleague completes her thought: [...] "you need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> who can get to you." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{found both}} {{her and her}} crew {{to be easy to}} work with and low-key. I think we would have {{expected}} a lot of drama, and the truth is, she is probably the most down-to-earth person. It was endearing. She was friendly and kind. ... I think, for us, we're so excited to have someone of her talent, and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> like that shoot here is a sheer honor. What her music does for music is so much more than entertainment. It's connecting to the arts on a much deeper level, and that's what I hope we can do here." ...|$|E
50|$|Stockbridge {{police chief}} William Obanhein ("Officer Obie") plays {{himself in the}} film, {{explaining}} to Newsweek magazine that making himself look like a fool was preferable <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>somebody</b> else make {{him look like a}} fool. Judge James E. Hannon, who presided over the littering trial, also appears as himself in the film.|$|R
50|$|Disagreements with Guthrie aside, Obanhein {{nevertheless}} played {{himself in}} the 1969 movie of the same name, telling Newsweek magazine (September 29, 1969, where his photo appears) that making himself look like a fool was preferable <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>somebody</b> else make {{him look like a}} fool. Working on the film caused Obanhein to develop greater respect for Guthrie, and the two became friends for the rest of Obanhein's life.|$|R

500|$|During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts {{noted that}} the case was a [...] "very {{familiar}} situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and a student," [...] {{and that the only}} way that one could draw a line between the two [...] "is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> say: This {{is going to be the}} line." [...] He was of the opinion that if anyone should draw the line, the Internal Revenue Service should be the one. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, on the other hand, felt that residents were employees, as evidenced by her statement [...] "You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone?" [...] According to The Wall Street Journal, Associate Justice Samuel Alito appeared to be more favorable to the medical schools, asking the Justice Department's lawyer at one point [...] "in general, why do medical students become residents? Are they enrolled in the program to make money...or do they want additional education?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "S" [...] {{was written}} by Ester Dean in {{collaboration}} with the song's producers, Stargate and Sandy Vee. Dean explained its conception and the sexually suggestive lyrics to Gail Mitchell of Billboard: [...] "The first thing that came to me was 'Come on, come on.' I'm thinking, 'I don't know what in the hell this is about to be.' And I remembered I'd seen something that said, 'Sticks and stones may break my bones.' Then came 'But chains and whips excite me.' When people have a great track that speaks to me, it feels like it already has a story in it". Rihanna told Rolling Stone about her interest in bondage and other sadomasochism activities, themes central to [...] "S": [...] "I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive... being submissive in the bedroom is really fun. You get to be a little lady, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> be macho and in charge." ...|$|E
500|$|Staff writer Tracy Tormé was {{not pleased}} with the [...] "1940s tribal Africa" [...] theme of the aliens, and because the combat scene {{towards the end of}} the episode resembled the Kirk versus Spock fight in [...] episode [...] "Amok Time". Fellow Star Trek writer Maurice Hurley said that it was [...] "a good idea, but the {{execution}} just fell apart. Again, if you take that script and if the actors had been told to give it a different twist, that show would have been different. But it became too baroque and fell apart. But the concept of having a guy say 'I have <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> kill my wife and this is the person' is a good idea." [...] Some of the cast, including Jonathan Frakes, sought to prevent the episode from being re-aired. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2012, Patrick Stewart agreed with fans that considered the season 2 episode [...] "" [...] to be [...] "the first truly great episode of the series", stating that the first season [...] "had several quite weak episodes"; referring to [...] "Code of Honor" [...] in particular he said, [...] "I can think of one very early on that involved a race of black aliens that we all felt quite embarrassed about." ...|$|E

60|$|Now a new wind {{is getting}} up. We call it Labour versus Capitalism. We {{say it is}} a mere {{material}} struggle, a money-grabbing affair. But this is only one aspect of it. In so far as men are merely mechanical, the struggle is one which, though it may bring disaster and death to millions, is no more than accident, an accidental collision of forces. But in so far as men are men, the situation is tragic. It is not really the bone we are fighting for. We are fighting <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody's</b> head off. The conflict is in pure, passional antagonism, turning upon the poles of belief. Majesty was only hors d'oevres to this tragic repast.|$|R
500|$|Citizen Kane was {{edited by}} Robert Wise and {{assistant}} editor Mark Robson. Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the [...] "camera tests" [...] and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles [...] "had an older editor assigned {{to him for}} those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits." [...] Wise and Robson began editing the film {{while it was still}} shooting and said that they [...] "could tell certainly that we were getting something very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out." [...] Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing. The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow dissolves. The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film [...] "in camera" [...] by leaving few options of how it could be put together. Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct [...] "timing" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] for the whip pans and over-lapping dialogue. The News on the March sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity. They used stock footage from Pathé News and the General Film Library.|$|E
500|$|Sullivan Stapleton plays Damien Scott, {{a former}} United States Delta Force {{operator}} who {{is familiar with}} the antagonists of the second series, and an acquaintance of John Porter. He is recruited by Section 20 to help Sergeant Michael Stonebridge find and rescue the kidnapped Porter. Stapleton describes Scott as cocky, rebellious and arrogant, and that it was good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> like him in Section 20 because [...] "he is the one that usually goes in first and takes the bullets, whereas Stonebridge arrives at the last minute and saves the day." [...] The actor opined that Scott is chosen for the dangerous role because he is daring and does not have any immediate family members who rely on him. Of Scott and Stonebridge's working relationship, Stapleton said [...] "they have a professional respect for each other" [...] but start to annoy each other. When the actor first read the script for Project Dawn, he saw himself for the role as Scott. Because Stapleton is an Australian actor, he had to speak with an American accent throughout the series. He was wary whether he did it right because he barely worked with Americans on the show, but believed he did okay when HBO, the network that operated Cinemax, was satisfied with it. Stapleton has signed up for another Strike Back series should it be commissioned.|$|E
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E

2500|$|To replace Jenna, Nation created Dayna Mellanby, {{a skilled}} combat expert partly {{based on the}} {{character}} of Miranda from Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Nation [...] "...thought {{it would be interesting to}} have a girl who was aggressive, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> who would kill first and ask questions later, and it was nice to give what are generally masculine attitudes to a woman". Josette Simon was chosen to play Dayna; Simon had recently graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and did not have an Equity card.|$|E
2500|$|The protest {{ended on}} the 30th day on January 10, 2009, with Pelloni {{saying that he}} was {{suffering}} from a [...] "wicked headache". Pelloni described Nintendo as a [...] "heartless corporation, only interested in the biggest profits". He ransacked his room in frustration and posted a lengthy comment on his website, declaring his defeat. In light of the statement and the lack of any visible movement on the webcam, a concerned user from the /v/ board on 4chan was able to retrieve Pelloni's telephone number from his Whois information. The user contacted his sister in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody</b> check on him. Then, on January 11, the police broke into his room to check on him, finding him well.|$|E
2500|$|From Peterhoff, Maria Pavlovna went to Grand Duchess Elisabeth’s rural estate, Ilinskoe, near Moscow, where Wilhelm {{joined them}} for a month before he left on a cruise to America. The young couple {{maintained}} their intimacy through letters. Maria imagined herself in love: “It’s lovely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>somebody,</b> even far away, who love you more than anything and whom you love more than everybody on earth“, she wrote to him. In October, Wilhelm returned to Russia joining Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri who introduced the Swedish prince to their father, Grand Duke Paul, who was permitted {{to come back to}} Russia for his daughter's wedding set to take place after she turned eighteen the next April. At Wilhelm's departure, Maria wrote to him: [...] " [...] I love you, so much with every day, every hour more and more. I wish it were April now, how lovely it would be". [...] In her book of memoirs, written more than 20 years later, the grand duchess made different claims: [...] " [...] I was using Wilhelm, in a sense, only to obtain my freedom". [...] As the wedding day approached, she began to have doubts and wished to break off the engagement, but Princess Irene of Hesse who was visiting her sister, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, persuaded her otherwise. Soon Maria Pavlovna was once again looking forward with enthusiasm to a new life. The wedding took place at Tsarskoye Selo on [...]|$|E
5000|$|From 1949 to 1950, Grey was the {{president}} of the Louisiana Baptist Convention, the headquarters of which are based in Alexandria. He was a trustee of Baptist-affiliated Louisiana College in Pineville, which in 1952 awarded him an honorary doctorate. In 1951, Grey became the first pastor ever to lead a prayer at the Sugar Bowl pregame in New Orleans, which that year matched Bear Bryant's Kentucky Wildcats and Bud Wilkinson's Oklahoma Sooners. When Kentucky won, his fellow clergyman and close friend Herschel H. Hobbs, an Oklahoma native, jokingly suggested that the Wildcats prevailed because Grey was a Kentucky native and had led the prayer. [...] "They ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>somebody</b> from Oklahoma pray," [...] said Hobbs. Grey told Hobbs that the Lord should not be bothered with the outcome of the game since Kentucky [...] "had Babe Parilli on its team".|$|R
