25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Franks</b> {{eventually}} {{were divided}} into two groups: <b>the</b> Ripuarian <b>Franks</b> (Latin: Ripuari), who were <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> that lived along the middle-Rhine River during the Roman Era, and <b>the</b> Salian <b>Franks,</b> who were <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> that originated {{in the area of the}} Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|The name of <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> {{itself is}} said {{to come from the}} Proto-Germanic word *frankon which means [...] "javelin, lance". Another {{proposed}} etymology is that Frank means [...] "the free men", {{based on the fact that}} <b>the</b> word <b>frank</b> meant [...] "free" [...] in the ancient Germanic languages. However, rather than the ethnic name of <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> coming from <b>the</b> word <b>frank</b> ("free"), it is more probable that <b>the</b> word <b>frank</b> ("free") comes from the ethnic name of <b>the</b> <b>Franks,</b> <b>the</b> connection being that only <b>the</b> <b>Franks,</b> as <b>the</b> conquering class, had the status of freemen.|$|R
5000|$|In {{most of the}} Germanic languages, France {{is known}} as the {{historical}} [...] "Land of the Franks", for example Frankreich (Reich of <b>the</b> <b>Franks)</b> in German, Frankrijk (Rijk of <b>the</b> <b>Franks)</b> in Dutch, Frankrike (Rike of <b>the</b> <b>Franks)</b> in Swedish and Norwegian, Frankrig in Danish.|$|R

5|$|Bennett and Crow founded Exploring the Arts, a {{charitable}} {{organization dedicated to}} creating, promoting, and supporting arts education. At {{the same time they}} founded (and named after Bennett's friend) <b>the</b> <b>Frank</b> Sinatra School of the Arts in Queens, a public high school dedicated to teaching the performing arts, which opened in 2001 and would have a very high graduation rate.

25|$|It {{appears that}} the Umayyads {{were not aware of}} the true {{strength}} of <b>the</b> <b>Franks.</b> <b>The</b> Umayyad forces were not particularly concerned about any of the Germanic tribes, including <b>the</b> <b>Franks,</b> and <b>the</b> Arab chronicles of that age show that awareness of <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> as a growing military power only came after the Battle of Tours.|$|R
50|$|The {{battle is}} briefly {{described}} by Gregory of Tours in his History of <b>the</b> <b>Franks.</b> According to his account, <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> ambushed <b>the</b> Hasdingi Vandals {{as they were}} crossing the Rhine and killed their king, Godigisel. The Vandals were rescued by the Alans under Respendial, who drove back <b>the</b> <b>Franks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bloeme was {{deported}} to Auschwitz {{on the last}} train leaving Westerbork on 3 September 1944. On the same train were <b>the</b> <b>Frank</b> family who had been discovered in hiding on 4 August. Bloeme saw Anne, Margot and their mother regularly in Auschwitz, although {{she was part of}} a separate group of eight women who stayed together, encouraging and helping one another. In October 1944, Bloeme and her group were selected for transfer to the Liebau labor camp in Upper Silesia. For the filming of the 1995 BBC documentary Anne Frank Remembered, Bloeme recalled that Anne, Margot, and their mother, Edith, also planned to join the transport, but Anne was prohibited from joining because she had developed scabies. Her mother and sister opted to stay with her, and Bloeme went on without them. Bloeme was also interviewed for her remembrances of <b>the</b> <b>Frank</b> women in Auschwitz in the 1988 television documentary The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank by Dutch filmmaker Willy Lindwer.|$|E
5|$|Clovis <b>the</b> <b>Frank,</b> {{the first}} {{king of the}} Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508. A gradual {{immigration}} by the Franks also occurred in Paris {{in the beginning of}} the Frankish domination of Gaul which created the Parisian Francien dialects.|$|E

25|$|The {{author of}} the Chronicle of Fredegar claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> came {{originally}} from Troy and quoted the works of Vergil and Hieronymous, and <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> are mentioned in those works, by Hieronymous. The chronicle describes Priam as a Frankish king whose people migrated to Macedonia {{after the fall of}} Troy. In Macedonia, <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> then divided. <b>The</b> European <b>Franks</b> reached Francia under King Francio, just as Romulus went to Rome. Another branch, under King Turchot, became the Turks. Fredegar stated that Theudemer, named king of <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> by Gregory, was descended from Priam, Friga and Francio.|$|R

50|$|The Frisians {{commanded}} by King Poppo used boats to land their army and surprise <b>the</b> <b>Franks.</b> However, <b>the</b> Frisian army was beaten and Poppo killed. <b>The</b> <b>Franks</b> {{gained control of}} the Frisian lands west of the Lauwers estuary and the Frisians became vassals of <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> apart from <b>the</b> tribes living in East Frisia in present-day Germany.|$|R

However, the defeat of <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> was only temporary and the kingdom was lost to the Merovingians within a decade.|$|R
50|$|A {{dividend}} received {{by a company}} shareholder is income of the receiving company, but the dividend income is not grossed-up for <b>the</b> <b>franking</b> credit nor is the receiving company entitled to claim <b>the</b> <b>franking</b> credit as a tax credit.

25|$|Because of {{the threat}} this move was for the new king of <b>the</b> <b>Franks,</b> an {{agreement}} between Pepin and Stephen II settled, {{in exchange for the}} formal royal anointing, the descent of <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> in Italy. In 754 the Lombard army, deployed in defence of the Locks in Val di Susa, was defeated by <b>the</b> <b>Franks.</b> Aistulf, perched in Pavia, had to accept a treaty that required the delivery of hostages and territorial concessions, but two years later resumed the war against the pope, who in turn called on <b>the</b> <b>Franks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Visigoths now {{came into}} {{conflict}} with <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> under their King Clovis I, who had conquered northern Gaul. Following a brief war with <b>the</b> <b>Franks,</b> Alaric was forced to put down a rebellion in Tarraconensis, probably caused by recent Visigoth immigration to Hispania due to pressure from <b>the</b> <b>Franks.</b> In 507, <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> attacked again, this time allied with the Burgundians. Alaric II was killed {{at the battle of}} Campus Vogladensis (Vouillé) near Poitiers, and Toulouse was sacked. By 508, the Visigoths had lost most of their Gallic holdings save Septimania in the south.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Franks</b> {{were broken}} down into east and west regions. <b>The</b> Eastern <b>Franks</b> were known as the Ripuarians and those west of the Rhine were known as <b>the</b> Salian <b>Franks.</b> It was King Clovis who united <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> under one law after {{defeating}} his rivals in 509 CE. [...] It is during this time of unification that King Clovis developed the Salic Law.|$|R
5|$|Stafford {{appeared}} in films from the 1930s onwards, including Alexander's Ragtime Band. Her final on-screen appearance was in <b>the</b> <b>Frank</b> Sinatra tribute Sinatra 75: The Best Is Yet to Come in 1990. She declined several offers of television work {{because she was}} forced to memorize scripts (as she was unable to read the cue cards without her glasses), and the bright studio lights caused her discomfort.|$|E
5|$|TPI {{provides}} tours from May 1 through October 31. In April and November, {{the association}} provides only an exterior shuttle and walking tour.

50|$|On that basis, <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> filled <b>the</b> {{lacunae of}} their legendary origins with Trojan and pseudo-Trojan names: in Fredegar's 7th-century chronicle of Frankish history, Priam appears {{as the first}} king of <b>the</b> <b>Franks.</b> <b>The</b> Trojan origin of France was such an {{established}} article of faith that in 1714, the learned Nicolas Fréret was Bastilled for showing through historical criticism that <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> had been Germanic, a sore point counter to Valois and Bourbon propaganda.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} {{changed when}} <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> invaded <b>the</b> Italian Peninsula. The new threat convinced Aligern to surrender {{the city in}} late 553 or early 554. He visited Narses, the Byzantine commander in Italy, to deliver {{the keys to the}} city. Narses immediately send Aligern to Caesena, for a first encounter with <b>the</b> <b>Franks.</b> His attempt to discourage <b>the</b> <b>Franks</b> from marching against Cumae failed.|$|R
