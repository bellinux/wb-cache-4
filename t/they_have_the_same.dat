5|$|In {{identical}} twins, if one {{is affected}} there is a 50–60% chance that the other will also be affected. In non-identical twins the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both twins are affected, {{most of the time}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> epileptic syndrome (70–90%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population. Between 1 and 10% of those with Down syndrome and 90% of those with Angelman syndrome have epilepsy.|$|E

5|$|The {{sizes of}} both moons are {{calculated}} {{with the assumption}} that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> infrared albedo as Haumea, which is reasonable as their spectra show them to have the same surface composition. Haumea's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from ground-based telescopes, the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common albedo, the inner moon, Namaka, which is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka, would be about 170km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The {{two most}} useful {{properties}} of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%). Although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of valence electrons and {{are in the same}} group in the periodic table, titanium and zirconium differ in many chemical and physical properties.|$|E

The beggar would curse the pregnant noblewoman, and come the birth of the child it would be a girl, healthy and perfectly formed in every respect other than having the face of a pig.|$|E

5|$|The Blackdown Hills have, since 1991, been {{designated}} as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). As <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> landscape quality, AONBs may {{be compared to}} the national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks: the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. However, National Parks, unlike AONBs, have their own authorities and have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development. By contrast, there are very limited statutory duties imposed on local authorities within an AONB. Further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E

5|$|The Kathiawari {{is closely}} related to the Marwari breed from the Marwar region of Rajasthan, which borders with {{northern}} Gujarat. Genetic diversity analysis groups the two breeds, while the other four Indian horse breeds – the Bhutia, the Manipuri, the Spiti and the Zaniskari – form a distinct and separate group. The Kathiawari and the Marwari are also phenotypically similar; in particular, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> unusual in-curved ears. The Kathiawari is not as tall as the Marwari, and has a smaller thoracic circumference; it is most commonly chestnut, while the Marwari is usually black. Kathiawaris tend to have slight facial differences from the Marwari. The Kathiawari also resembles the Arab horse, which contributed significantly during the development of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Tetra Master is a card-based minigame {{that can}} be {{initiated}} with various non-playable characters in the field. Players assemble a deck of five cards, which can be obtained via chests, given as a reward, or earned from fighting monsters. Each card has various arrows which point to the four sides and {{four corners of the}} card, and various stats that vary between cards, with rarer cards being more powerful. Players take it in turns to strategically place cards on a 4x4 playing grid based on the available directions. Battles can occur when players place a card next to another card, depending on where the player places it. If the defending card has no arrows whilst the attacking card has an arrow pointing towards it, that card is placed under the player's control. When two arrows meet with each other, the cards do battle based on their point values, with the losing card coming under the winning player's control, sometimes triggering combos that put multiple cards in the winner's control. After all cards are played, the winner is the player who has the most cards under their control, with a draw occurring if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number of cards. The winning player may choose a card from their opponent's deck out of the ones they put under their control. If the winning player scores a perfect win however, in which all ten cards are put under their control, they will win all five cards from the opponent's deck.|$|E
