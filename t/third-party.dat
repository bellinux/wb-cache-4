40|$|Victims retaliating against aggressors tend to {{gain the}} benefit of a {{deterrent}} effect against future exploitation through second-party punishment. However, research has not adequately explained the benefits behind vigilantism where unaffiliated <b>third-parties</b> risk personal costs to administer punishment for an act that had no impact on their economic well-being. Differences in costs and benefits of second-party punishment (2 PP) and third party punishment (3 PP) suggest that the two punitive behaviors may originate from dissimilar contextual cues, and serve different adaptive functions. However, differences between 2 PP and 3 PP are often blurred in the literature, with researchers taking the findings on 2 PP to draw conclusions about 3 PP, and vice versa. This dissertation outlines the functionally distinct roles second- and <b>third-parties</b> assume in conflict (Chapter 1), and empirically tests predictions of the proposed model (Chapter 2 – 3). In Chapter 1, I evaluate experimental paradigms eliciting different types of punitive responses, and examine both animal and human behavioral data on inputs and outputs characteristic of 2 PP and 3 PP. I propose that 2 PP functions to deter, while 3 PP serves as a coordination and conflict resolution device. I predict that second-parties are more sensitive to inputs relevant to achieving the goal of discouraging future violations than <b>third-parties.</b> In Study 1 and 2 (Chapter 2), I use fictional crime scenarios to test the effect of probability of crime detection on punitive judgment. I find that second-parties are more likely to take probabilities into account than <b>third-parties</b> when assigning punishment. In Study 1 through 4 (Chapter 3), I use behavioral economic games to explore conditions under which second- and <b>third-parties</b> seek out—or avoid—information about norm violations. I find that in case of more serious violations, second-parties show interest in details of Dictator 2 ̆ 7 s decision, but only when provided with an option to punish. In contrast, presence or absence of an opportunity to punish has no effect on <b>third-parties.</b> Taken together, these findings demonstrate that second- and <b>third-parties</b> respond differently to relevant contextual cues, further supporting the claim that punishment administered by avengers and vigilantes follow different behavioral rules. ...|$|R

5|$|During the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super NES (SNES) eras, Nintendo and Capcom {{enjoyed a}} close relationship, with Mega Man {{as one of}} the NES' most {{prominent}} franchises. This closeness was partially due to Nintendo's monopoly of the video game console market, which allowed the company to compel <b>third-party</b> developers to release exclusive content according to Nintendo's schedule. Sega's rival Genesis system forced Nintendo to relax some of its restrictions on third parties with respect to the SNES. However, relations with <b>third-party</b> developers reached a turning point when Nintendo decided to retain a proprietary cartridge-based format for the Nintendo 64, in the face of Sony's disc-based PlayStation. Due to increased manufacturing costs and severely limited cartridge memory capacity, many third parties—Capcom included—moved to the PlayStation to start new franchises, such as Resident Evil. On this new platform, developers could create bigger games while avoiding the restriction of ordering the manufacture of expensive proprietary cartridges through Nintendo, which could lead to under- or over-stocking inventory which might eat into revenue. This <b>third-party</b> abandonment allowed the PlayStation to outsell the Nintendo 64 during that console generation.|$|E

5|$|The Steam store also enables {{users to}} redeem store product keys to add {{software}} from their library.

A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other <b>third-party</b> sites at a higher price, generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these <b>third-party</b> sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the <b>third-party</b> they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the grey market.|$|E
