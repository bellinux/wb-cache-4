25|$|Passenger rail {{service in}} Markham is {{provided}} by the GO Transit Stouffville line, which is a commuter rail line stretching from Lincolnville to downtown Toronto. The line operates only at rush hour and uses tracks owned by Metrolinx, the provincial transit agency. Five stations on the Stouffville line serve Markham, of which 4 are within the municipal borders. Metrolinx announced in 2015 that the Stouffville Line would get an expansion in service, bringing all day both directional trains from Union Station to Unionville GO Station. Markham's section of this GO line also came under the spotlight in 2015 as City of Toronto Mayor John Tory's announced SMART <b>Track</b> <b>plan</b> for rapid transit expansion in Toronto includes the rail spur between Union Station and the Unionville GO.|$|E
2500|$|Later that year, in December 2016, then Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon {{issued an}} apology for the UN's [...] "role" [...] in the cholera {{outbreak}} and stressed the organizations [...] "moral responsibility" [...] to fight the disease. Though the apology stopped short of admitting the UN was at fault for introducing the disease to Haiti, it {{was seen as a}} major milestone by many advocates for Haitian cholera victims. Secretary General Ban also launched [...] "a new approach" [...] to cholera by the UN, {{in the form of a}} two <b>track</b> <b>plan.</b> The UN would raise $400 million in voluntary contributions from member states, with $200 million dedicated to providing material assistance to communities most affected by cholera, and another $200 million going to fight the disease.|$|E

The Chinese military boarded the EP-3 and thoroughly stripped and examined the aircraft's equipment. The crew was only partially successful in their destruction of classified material, {{and some of the}} material they failed to destroy included cryptographic keys, signals intelligence manuals, and the names of National Security Agency employees. Some of the captured computers contained detailed information for processing PROFORMA communications from North Korea, Russia, Vietnam, China and other countries. The plane also carried information on the emitter parameters for U.S.-allied radar systems worldwide. The fact that the United States could <b>track</b> <b>PLAN</b> submarines via signal transmission was also revealed to China.|$|E

The system then uses a knowledge base of antenna operations procedures to produce a plan of activities that will provide the requested services using the allocated equipment. DPLAN produces this plan using an integration of artiflcial intelligence (AI) techniques, speciflcally, hierarchical task network (HTN) and operator-based planning.
