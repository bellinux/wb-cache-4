50|$|Legislation on {{a global}} scale is {{believed}} by some to be needed for this issue because mercury pollution is estimated to be so far-reaching. Pollution from one country does not stay localized to that country. Despite the need by some, international regulation has been slow to take off. The first forms of international legislation appeared in the 1970s, beginning as agreements about shared bodies of water. The next step was the Stockholm Declaration, which urged countries to avoid polluting the oceans by dumping. The 1972 <b>Oslo</b> <b>Convention</b> and the 1974 Paris Convention were adopted by parts of Europe. Both lessened polluting the ocean with mercury, the former by banning the dumping of ships and aircraft into the ocean and the latter by obligating participants to reduce land-based pollution on coastlines. The first real global legislation regarding mercury pollution was the Basel Convention of 1989. This convention attempts to reduce the movement of mercury across borders and primarily regulates the import and export of toxic chemicals, including mercury. In 1998 the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution was adopted by most of the European Union, the United States, and Canada. Its primary objective is to cut emissions of heavy metals. The convention is the largest international agreement on mercury established to date. In the early 21st century, the focus of mercury regulation has been on voluntary programs. The next phase in legislation is a global effort, and this appears to be what the Minamata Convention hopes to accomplish. The Minamata Convention, named after the Japanese city that suffered horribly from mercury pollution, has taken four years of negotiation but was finally adopted by delegates from over 140 countries. The convention will come into power after 50 countries have signed it. The Minamata Convention will require all participants to eliminate, where possible, the release of mercury from small-scale gold mining. It will also require a sharp reduction in emission from coal burning.|$|R
30|$|The <b>Oslo</b> Paris <b>Convention</b> (OSPAR) was {{the first}} European {{convention}} dealing with persistent substances in the environment [40, 41]. A half-life of 50  days in marine waters {{was defined as the}} only persistence criterion without further specification of the test methods and conditions, e.g. temperature. Around the year 2000, several papers and statements dealt with the temperature relevant for European climate conditions. The Swedish Committee on New Guidelines on Chemicals Policy [9] proposed that “a substance is regarded as unacceptably persistent if its half-life is longer than 8  weeks in a simulation test at 20  °C”. This half-life corresponds to a half-life of 1  year in the northern European climate (average annual temperature of 5  °C) and takes into account unfavourable degradation conditions. Sinkkonnen and Paassivirta [45] suggested degradation half-times for POPs as input parameters to the Baltic Sea model assuming an annual average temperature of 7  °C. Beyer et al. [5] could demonstrate that the LRT potential can monotonically increase or decrease with increasing temperature, or it can have a maximum in the temperature range between 5 and 30  °C.|$|R
40|$|Fish {{landed at}} the major Irish ports and {{molluscs}} from the main growing areas were sampled during 1992 and analysed for total mercury content.

The mercury levels recorded in all fish sampled were within the standards for human health applied by the contracting parties to the <b>Oslo</b> and Paris <b>Convention</b> (OSPARCOM). The mean mercury concentrations in only two samples, redfish and crawfish from the west coast, showed levels close to the limit. These species are generally offshore and levels are associated with naturally-occurring mercury rather than with human activity.

40|$|Following {{validation}} {{activities and}} corresponding improvements in processing algorithms {{over the first}} few years of the MERIS mission, the algal 1 and algal 2 products are now considered as sufficiently mature for use in applications in Belgian waters. The utility of this product has been enhanced by the development of a number of multitemporal products including single point time series, multitemporal composites (monthly/ 3 - monthly means) and annual products such as the mean and 90 percentile concentrations and the timing of the spring bloom. Marine management applications include: support for the assessment of eutrophication status in the context of the <b>Oslo</b> and Paris <b>Convention</b> for the Prevention of Marine Pollution (OSPAR), optimisation of seaborne monitoring, detection of harmful algal blooms and support for aquaculture. More generally, the MERIS data is used in support of marine science including the validation of ecosystem models and may be used in the future for the estimation of air-sea carbon fluxes. The current status of these applications is described together with an assessment of the remaining scientific challenges as well as the future possibilities. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The United Kingdom {{has a long}} {{maritime}} {{history with}} its ports and harbours being places of safety, trade and recreation. Historically ports were limited to areas deep enough to allow for ship access, however as trade grew the need for larger ports to accommodate increased numbers and deeper berths did too. The numerous social and economic benefits of dredging and dumping however do not come without environmental costs. Dumping at sea is governed by the London Dumping <b>Convention</b> globally and <b>Oslo</b> Paris <b>Convention</b> in Europe. The increase in the stringency in dumping legislature and the decrease {{in the amount of}} dredge dumped at sea as well as its extensive monitoring enforced by law has resulted in an improvement in the effects of dumping on the marine environment. Thus it appears that the legislature governing marine dumping is successful. Dumping in the UK is governed by Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), with its executive agency the Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) undertaking the relevant monitoring. Rame Head (PL 031) is a historical dump site situated off the south coast of Cornwall near the busy port of Plymouth. The results of the CEFAS report (2005) found that the effects of the dump site on the surrounding environment were within acceptable levels. Literature and data was collated from numerous alternative sources in order to assess whether the findings by CEFAS were correct. It was found that overall the effects on the environment appeared minimal and there {{did not appear to be}} a significant reason to move the dumpsite to another location. It was however noted that the data available was limited and that it is suggested the continual monitoring continue. The correlation between the findings of this paper with the CEFAS report (2005) appears to display the successfulness of the legislature governing marine dumping both nationally and internationallyFaculty of Science & Technology...|$|R
40|$|Marine litter is a {{recognized}} environmental problem, {{which has been}} subject to many research studies, monitoring and international legislations with the goal to improve {{the state of the}} marine ecosystem. The aim of my thesis was to study if debris on the Swedish west coast has changed {{during the past five years}} (2011 - 2015), and to make an overview of how the marine ecosystem and the organisms in general are affected by marine litter. I hypothesized that the amount of coastal litter would have decreased as a response to the taken measures. I investigated debris on three beaches on the Swedish west coast during February 2015; Grönevik, Gröderhamn and Edshultshall. At each beach seven randomly selected one meter squares were searched for litter. Estimates for the entire beaches were compared to the investigations performed by the OSPAR (<b>Oslo</b> and Paris <b>conventions)</b> organization during 2011 - 2014. In difference to my expectations none of the observed litter objects showed any decrease during the study period.   Statistical analyzes instead indicated that two litter objects originating from the sea have increased, i. e. fish nets and plastic ropes, while the other seven objects observed did not show any significant up- or downward trends over time.   My literature survey showed that litter is a large problem for the marine environment and that many animals suffer severely and often dies when plastic litter is consumed and mistaken as food items.

40|$|The Arctic is {{estimated}} to contain at least 25 % of the worlds undiscovered petroleum resources (Ahlbrandt, 2002, AMAP, 2007). By 2010, annual volumes of 150 million tonnes of oil may be shipped by sea {{as a result of}} the development of oil production and transportation infrastructure in the Barents region alone (Frantzen and Bambulyak, 2003). For example, Shtockman gas deposit are estimated at 3. 2 billion cubic metres of gas and 31 million tonnes of condensate. As energy consumption and air pollution are directly linked, any increase in oil and gas related activities is likely to result in increased pollutant emissions. Oil spills, whether from blowouts, pipeline leaks or shipping accidents, pose a tremendous risk to arctic ecosystems. These ecosystems are characterised by a short productive season, low temperatures, and limited sunlight. As a result, it can take many decades for them to recover from habitat disruption, sediment disturbance and not least oil spills. The problem is particularly acute in ice-infested waters. There are two major gaps of knowledge and available technologies to limit potential risks of population-wide impacts by oil spills and gas leakages: 1. Monitoring tools to detect detrimental effects of oil spills from various sources on health of marine arctic organisms. 2. Effective method for containing and cleaning up an oil spill in ice conditions. In this talk we will focus on monitoring strategies for oil pollution accidents as well as chronic long term exposure scenarios. These strategies are already implemented in the frame of the <b>Oslo</b> Paris <b>Convention</b> (OSPAR) for the North Sea and North East Atlantic and Mediterranean regions (UNEP, Barcelona Convention) and need to be transferred to Arctic organisms. What is needed to fill critical gaps of knowledge for the protection of the Arctic before gas and oil exploration and exploitation starts? With respect to selection of indicator organisms, test organisms should encompass key ecologically important species in food webs. Ideally contaminant body residues should be determined so that they can be linked to effects of biomagnification in the foodweb and related health effects. As acute effects biomarkers indicating contact of organisms to oil related chemicals, induction of detoxifying enzymes such as EROD activity, induction CP 4501, GST activity, antioxidant enzymes: SOD, CAT, GPX and GR DT-diaphorase are suitable tools. As long term effects biomarkers, lipid peroxidation/oxidative stress, micronuclei formation as indication for genotoxic effects and histopathology including cancer diagnosis are recommended by the ICES Working Group of Biological Effects of Contaminants (OSPAR). Parallel to acute and long term biomarkers, the measurement of lysosomal membrane stability is advised as biomarker integrating effects on cell (mal) function by various classes of oil components sensitively reflecting the onset and progression of toxicant induced tissue pathologies. For the successful implementation of an Arctic monitoring programme, acquisition of data on seasonal biomarker/ bioresponse/detoxification patterns of pressure- and cold-adapted indicator species are essential as a baseline. Status quo determination of biomarkers response, biodiversity, body burden of PAHs and other chemicals as well as water and sediment contamination before oil and gas exploitation activity start is a prerequisite for correct scientific interpretation of pollution effects and legal claims against producers...|$|R
40|$|This study {{details the}} steps {{involved}} in fabrication, deployment and retrieval of mainly polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) passive sampling devices deployed {{in a number}} of locations in and around Ireland in an attempt to derive dissolved water concentrations of contaminants in-situ. PDMS samplers were initially deployed in the Burrishoole catchment, Co. Mayo in conjunction with the collection of biological tissues and sediment to investigate the source of elevated dioxins in the catchment. Passive samplers were used to generate dissolved water concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and also to successfully screen for the presence of dioxins in the water column. The dioxin profile present was also found in sediment and biological tissue and through statistical profiling potential sources were identified as being possibly related to the use of technical pentachlorophenol in the catchment though no direct evidence was found. Passive samplers (PDMS and SPMD) were then deployed at various depths on the M 6 weather buoy, 400 miles off the West Coast of Ireland, in conjunction with temperature and salinity monitors to test how the technology would fare over a long period deployment (585 days) in a harsh, dynamic environment. The PDMS samplers were almost completly lost where the SPMDs last better (80 % recovered). Dissolved water concentrations estimated using both sampler types were found to be very low (<ppb) with polyaromatic hydrocarbons found in higher levels than polychlorinated biphenlys, and organochlorine compounds. The use of statistical analysis suggests that passive samplers {{can also be used to}} differentiate different water masses by investigating contaminant loadings at each depth sampled. Finally passive samplers were deployed in various inshore and inland waters across Ireland with the results indicating that the remote West of Ireland had the lowest levels of dissolved water concentrations estimated. Many estuaries and inland water bodies had levels of contaminants higher than the west of Ireland with the heavily industrialised Cork and Dublin sites having the highest levels estimated. The separation of sites based on concentrations found indicated that assessment criteria could be generated in an Irish context (IRef) which could be used to classify a site in relation to ‘background’ levels found in the West of Ireland and at M 6. The results generated during this study were then assessed based on various legislative requirements and assessment criteria such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the <b>Oslo</b> Paris <b>convention</b> (OSPAR). Results from the WFD assessment indicate that concentrations found at all sites were below the EQS values set down. However this EQS value is based on total water concentration hence the EQS was modified to a dissolved water concentration basis. This reduced the total water EQS values by up to 80 % for some analytes however in most locations the dissolved water concentrations found were at or below this dissolved water EQS value indicating that the levels of contaminants from across Ireland are below the EQS values generated as part of the WFD. Assessments were also made on the concentrations found across Ireland using background assessment criteria (BAC) suggested by OSPAR. The results indicate that the levels across Ireland are above the BAC for most compounds with the M 6 weather buoy faring better. Concentrations from “pristine” Irish sites were then chosen to generate reference criteria on an Irish basis (IRef) which were found to be below the concentration levels suggested as part of the BAC assessment criteria in the majority of locations.
