5|$|Groups {{are also}} applied {{in many other}} {{mathematical}} areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying {{the properties of the}} corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. <b>The</b> <b>fundamental</b> group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> group detects the hole.|$|E
5|$|The Directive Principles {{have been}} used to uphold the Constitutional {{validity}} of legislations in case of a conflict with <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights. Article 31C, added by the 25th Amendment in 1971, provided that any law made to give effect to the Directive Principles in Article 39(b)–(c) would not be invalid {{on the grounds that they}} derogated from <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 31. The application of this article was sought to be extended to all the Directive Principles by the 42nd Amendment in 1970, but the Supreme Court struck down the extension as void on the ground that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution. <b>The</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights and Directive Principles have also been used together in forming the basis of legislation for social welfare. The Supreme Court, after the judgement in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has adopted the view of <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights and Directive Principles being complementary to each other, each supplementing the other's role in aiming at the same goal of establishing a welfare state by means of social revolution. Similarly, the Supreme Court has used <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Duties to uphold the Constitutional validity of statutes which seeks to promote the objects laid out in <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Duties. These Duties have also been held to be obligatory for all citizens, subject to the State enforcing the same by means of a valid law. The Supreme Court has also issued directions to the State in this regard, with a view towards making the provisions effective and enabling a citizens to properly perform their duties.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights are not {{absolute}} and {{are subject to}} reasonable restrictions as necessary {{for the protection of}} public interest. In the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case in 1973, the Supreme Court, overruling a previous decision of 1967, held that <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights could be amended, subject to judicial review in case such an amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution. <b>The</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights can be enhanced, removed or otherwise altered through a constitutional amendment, passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of Parliament. The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension any of <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights, excluding Articles 20 and 21, by order of the President. The President may, by order, suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well, thereby barring citizens from approaching the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights, except Articles 20 and 21, during the period of the emergency. Parliament may also restrict the application of <b>the</b> <b>Fundamental</b> Rights to members of the Indian Armed Forces and the police, in order to ensure proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline, by a law made under Article 33.|$|E

Emphasis will be placed on spectroscopic methods that can be interfaced with microscopy such as micro-FTIR, microspectrophotometry and x-ray microanalysis. Additionally, digital imaging and photomicrography will be discussed. Course Objectives: 1. To ensure that students understand <b>the</b> <b>fundamentals</b> of microscopic methods typically used in forensic science. 2. To ensure that the students understand <b>the</b> <b>fundamentals</b> of spectroscopic methods of microanalysis. 3. To ensure that students understand <b>the</b> <b>fundamentals</b> of photomicrography and digital imaging. 4. To ensure that students understand the utility of microscopy {{in the analysis of}} all types of trace evidence. Course Outcomes: 1. Students will understand <b>the</b> <b>fundamentals</b> of microscopic methods typically used in forensic science. 2. Students will understand <b>the</b> <b>fundamentals</b> of spectroscopic methods of microanalysis. 3. Students will understand <b>the</b> <b>fundamentals</b> of photomicrography and digital imaging. 4.

The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, that represent <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> modes of vibration in direct analogy with the integers that represent <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> modes of vibration of the violin string.|$|E
