5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where <b>they</b> <b>function</b> as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E
5|$|Mantises can be loosely {{categorized}} as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has {{two sets of}} wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and leathery. <b>They</b> <b>function</b> as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are {{involved}} in a wide array of physiological functions, and so mutations in genes encoding them can cause a range of diseases. Mutations that change the activity, specificity or aggregation properties of serpins all affect how <b>they</b> <b>function.</b> The majority of serpin-related diseases are the result of serpin polymerisation into aggregates, though several other types of disease-linked mutations also occur. The disorder α-Antitrypsin deficiency {{is one of the most}} common hereditary diseases.|$|E
50|$|Settlement schools {{typically}} {{had large}} campuses, including dormitories for boarding students. <b>They</b> <b>functioned</b> {{not only as}} schools, but also as community centers.|$|R
50|$|British {{post offices}} were {{established}} by the military administration in the area under British control. <b>They</b> <b>functioned</b> in the period from 25 November 1898 {{to the end of}} 1899.|$|R
50|$|As {{the organs}} of the God's Destruction God Goodomu, <b>they</b> <b>functioned</b> as power {{sources for the}} Goodomu Civilization. Indestructible, Gajya {{intended}} to absorb them to undergo a metamorphsis into Goodomu itself.|$|R
5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. In vitro studies {{on some of}} these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that <b>they</b> <b>function</b> as inhibitors in vivo. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It is suggested that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but <b>they</b> <b>function</b> asymmetrically. For example, the {{counterpart}} of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E
5|$|The primary rooms {{include the}} Lair, Hatchery, Training Room, Library, and the Treasury. These {{have the same}} purpose as the first game: <b>they</b> <b>function</b> as a resting place, feeding place, {{training}} area, research area, and gold storage area respectively. The only major {{difference is that the}} Training Room can only train creatures up to experience level four. Further experience can only be gained through real combat, such as fighting in the new Combat Pit, where creatures fight to the death. The higher a creature's experience level, the stronger and more powerful they become. The highest experience level is level ten, and creatures cannot achieve levels nine or ten via the Training Room or Combat Pit.|$|E
5000|$|They first performed, to an {{audience}} of 2,000, at a women's festival in Berlin in 1974. <b>They</b> <b>functioned</b> as a co-operative, and for copyright purposes worked under the joint pseudonym of [...] "Emily Pankhurst".|$|R
25|$|Above all units, {{there existed}} an elite force called Kheshig. <b>They</b> <b>functioned</b> as {{imperial}} guard of the Mongol Empire {{as well as}} a training ground for potential young officers, the great Subutai having started his career there.|$|R
50|$|Forty stone {{inscriptions}} {{made some}} mention of Buddhism throughout the Licchavi period. Most of the references {{are concerned with}} monasticism. However, almost nothing {{is known about the}} day-to-day life in the Vihara monasteries or how <b>they</b> <b>functioned</b> administratively.|$|R
5|$|Tympanal organs {{or hearing}} organs {{consist of a}} {{membrane}} (tympanum) stretched across a frame backed by an air sac and associated sensory neurons, are found in two families. Several species of the genus Cicindela (Carabidae) have hearing organs on the dorsal surfaces of their first abdominal segments beneath the wings; two tribes in the Dynastinae (within the Scarabaeidae) have hearing organs just beneath their pronotal shields or neck membranes. Both families are sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence indicating <b>they</b> <b>function</b> to detect the presence of bats by their ultrasonic echolocation.|$|E
25|$|Antarctic sponges {{are long}} lived, and {{sensitive}} to environmental changes {{due to the}} specificity of the symbiotic microbial communities within them. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>function</b> as indicators of environmental health.|$|E
25|$|Although androgens are {{commonly}} thought of only as male sex hormones, females also have them, but at lower levels: <b>they</b> <b>function</b> in libido and sexual arousal. Also, androgens are the precursors to estrogens in {{both men and}} women.|$|E
50|$|Federal {{and state}} sales {{taxes in the}} United States {{remained}} selective, rather than general, through the 19th century. However, excise taxes were applied to so many specific commodities during the Civil War that <b>they</b> <b>functioned</b> collectively as a general sales tax.|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{studying}} neural coding {{have speculated}} that populations of neurons would more effectively represent the stimulus if the neurons "cooperated:" by interacting through lateral connections, the neurons would process and represent information better than if <b>they</b> <b>functioned</b> independently.

50|$|The three {{high schools}} {{remained}} and {{had their own}} administration until the spring of 2011. <b>They</b> <b>functioned</b> separately, though located on the same campus, and used the same library. They also had common sports teams under the Fremont High School banner.|$|R
25|$|Inside {{the church}} {{to either side of}} the {{entrance}} are the two halves of an enormous shell (Tridacna gigas) given to King Francis I by the Venetian Republic. <b>They</b> <b>function</b> as holy water fonts and rest on rock-like bases sculpted by Jean-Baptiste Pigalle.|$|E
25|$|Vegetative {{barriers}} are narrower buffer strips of hardy, native, perennial grasses or shrubs planted in parallel rows to crops. They are {{very effective in}} reducing wind and water erosion which results in sediment trapping and water infiltration. <b>They</b> <b>function</b> in similar fashion to a contour buffer strip, just much narrower.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{they may}} {{work with the}} {{managers}} of the human resources, production, finance, accounting, and marketing departments to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>function</b> properly and are working inline with the company's goals and objectives. Additionally, they might interact with people outside the company, such as business partners and vendors.|$|E
50|$|The Petites écoles de Port-Royal was {{the name}} given to a {{teaching}} system set up in 1637 by the intellectuals who gathered at Port-Royal-des-Champs {{in the middle of}} the 17th century at the height of the Jansenist controversy. <b>They</b> <b>functioned</b> until 1660.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} hill-slope enclosure is obscure but {{it is thought that}} they were not primarily defensive structures. Surveys and excavations have revealed low densities of postholes and storage pits suggesting <b>they</b> <b>functioned</b> as defensible farmsteads and permanent livestock enclosures.|$|R
50|$|Regional courts (one in each {{administrative}} kraj) {{are located}} in the capitals of each of Czechoslovakia's ten kraje and in Prague. <b>They</b> <b>functioned</b> as appellate courts and also had jurisdiction over trials in serious criminal cases where imprisonment exceeding five years may be imposed.|$|R
25|$|Place {{cells are}} thought, collectively, {{to act as}} a {{cognitive}} representation of a specific location in space, known as a cognitive map. Place cells work with other types of neurons in the hippocampus and surrounding regions to perform this kind of spatial processing, but the ways in which <b>they</b> <b>function</b> within the hippocampus are still being researched.|$|E
25|$|Corsets {{were used}} in women’s gowns for {{emphasizing}} the small waist of the female body. <b>They</b> <b>function</b> as an undergarment which can be adjusted to bound tightly around the waist, hold and train a person’s waistline, so to slim and conform it to a fashionable silhouette. It also helped stop the bodice from horizontal creasing. With the corset, a very small tight fitting waist would be shown.|$|E
25|$|Bass traps are {{acoustic}} energy absorbers which {{are designed to}} damp low frequency sound energy {{with the goal of}} attaining a flatter low frequency (LF) room response by reducing LF resonances in rooms. They are commonly used in recording studios, mastering rooms, home theatres and other rooms built to provide a critical listening environment. Like all acoustically absorptive devices, <b>they</b> <b>function</b> by turning sound energy into heat through friction.|$|E
5000|$|The Científicos (Spanish: [...] "scientists" [...] or [...] "those scientifically oriented") were {{a circle}} of technocratic advisors to President of Mexico Porfirio Díaz.Steeped in the positivist [...] "scientific politics", <b>they</b> <b>functioned</b> {{as part of his}} program of {{modernization}} {{at the start of the}} 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Technically all {{standard}} attributes {{must be accepted}} by all elements, though <b>they</b> will not <b>function</b> with some elements. The table below lists some common {{standard attributes}}, and some tags <b>they</b> can <b>function</b> with.|$|R
50|$|The Celtic peoples {{living in}} the region between the Tyne and the Forth were known to the Romans as the Votadini. When not under direct Roman rule, <b>they</b> <b>functioned</b> as a {{friendly}} client kingdom, a somewhat porous buffer against the more warlike Picts to the north.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, Poe {{published}} A History of Communications: Media and Society {{from the}} Evolution of Speech to the Internet, a 337-page book that analyzes how media networks originate, how <b>they</b> <b>function</b> {{and how they}} shape social practices and values. Poe explains in the book's introduction that he is seeking to expand and refine the communications theories of the late Canadian scholar Harold Innis. In his 1950 book Empire and Communications, Innis conducted a sweeping historical survey of how various media influenced {{the rise and fall}} of empires from ancient to modern times.|$|E
25|$|The {{stickiness}} of spiders' webs is {{courtesy of}} droplets of glue suspended on the silk threads. This glue is multifunctional– that is, its behavior {{depends on how}} quickly something touching it attempts to withdraw. At high velocities, <b>they</b> <b>function</b> as an elastic solid, resembling rubber; at lower velocities, they simply act as a sticky glue. This allows them to retain a grip on attached food particles. The web is also electrically conductive which causes the silk threads to spring out to trap their quarry, as flying insects tend to gain a static charge which attracts the silk.|$|E
25|$|As {{neurotoxins}} are compounds which {{adversely affect}} the nervous system, {{a number of}} mechanisms through which <b>they</b> <b>function</b> are through the inhibition of neuron cellular processes. These inhibited processes can range from membrane depolarization mechanisms to inter-neuron communication. By inhibiting the ability for neurons to perform their expected intracellular functions, or pass a signal to a neighboring cell, neurotoxins can induce systemic nervous system arrest {{as in the case}} of botulinum toxin, or even nervous tissue death. The time required for the onset of symptoms upon neurotoxin exposure can vary between different toxins, being on the order of hours for botulinum toxin and years for lead.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} non-inflecting verbs {{function}} only as predicates in clauses. Thus <b>they</b> cannot <b>function</b> as heads of noun phrases and <b>they</b> cannot <b>function</b> as restrictive modifiers of nouns {{unless they are}} relativised or nominalised. Syntactically, they resemble inflected verbs. They are only distinguished from other verbs morphologically.|$|R
5000|$|The SB.1 glider was {{designed}} to be an inexpensive, simple machine, constructed primarily of spruce with reinforced sections using light alloy steel. The all-important wing controls had [...] "elevons" [...] pivoted on long, tapered light-alloy tubes extending from {{the leading edge of the}} tip, just inside the fixed part of the wing (illustrated by photographs in the Short SB.4 Sherpa article). The pivoting mechanism had a double-ball bearing unit on the inboard end with main loads transferred to a needle roller bearing at the outboard end of the fixed wing. Anti-balance tabs were fitted along trailing edges along with small pneumatically actuated flaps under the inboard sections. When the elevons were rotated in the same direction <b>they</b> <b>functioned</b> as elevators; when rotated in opposite directions <b>they</b> <b>functioned</b> as ailerons.|$|R
50|$|For many centuries, the Nivkh were {{tributary}} to the Manchus. After the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689, <b>they</b> <b>functioned</b> as intermediaries {{between the}} Russians, Manchu and Japanese, the latter via their vassal, the Ainu. Early {{contact with the}} southern Sakhalin Ainu was generally hostile, although trade between the two was apparent.|$|R
