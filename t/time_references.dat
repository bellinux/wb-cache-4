25|$|With the {{widespread}} publication of Norse myths and legends at this <b>time,</b> <b>references</b> to the Norse gods and heroes spread into European literary culture, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, and Britain. In the later 20th century, references to Norse mythology became common in science fiction and fantasy literature, role-playing games, and eventually other cultural {{products such as}} Japanese animation.

The unknown author of the Hudud al-'Alam states that rugs were woven in Fārs. 100 years later, Al-Muqaddasi refers to carpets in the Qaināt. Yaqut al-Hamawi tells us that carpets were woven in Azerbaijān in the thirteenth century. The great Arabian {{traveller}} Ibn Battuta mentions that a green rug was spread before him when he visited the winter quarter of the Bakhthiari atabeg in Idhej. These references indicate that carpet weaving in Persia under the Caliphate was a tribal or rural industry.|$|E
40|$|Reference to {{the past}} through verb {{morphology}} {{has been found to}} be particularly difficult for individuals with non-fluent agrammatic aphasia. Bastiaanse, Bamyaci, Hsu, Lee, Yarbay Duman and Thompson (2011) formulated the PADILIH, to account for this specific past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> problem. The PADILIH predicts a specific past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> deficit, as past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> is discourse linked, while non-past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> is processed through narrow syntax. Discourse linking needs more processing resources and it has been shown that discourse linking is more difficult for agrammatic individuals (Bastiaanse, Dragoy, Avrutin, Iskra & Bos, 2013). In the present study, the Test for Assessing <b>Reference</b> of <b>Time</b> (TART; Bastiaanse, Jonkers & Thompson, 2008) was adapted for Italian. The aim of the present study was to investigate <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> through verb morphology, using the Italian version of the TART. A total of 11 non-fluent agrammatic speakers and 10 non-brain-damaged individuals were tested using the Italian adaptation of the TART, which consists of a sentence completion task with photographs and a picture-matching task. Spontaneous speech samples were also collected, through a semi-structured interview and a picture description task. All responses on the TART tasks were tallied and analyzed, both quantitavely and qualitatively. While the non-brain-damaged subjects performed at ceiling, the agrammatic individuals results showed a selective past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> deficit in both production and comprehension. Simple past was found to be more impaired than present perfect. However, future <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> was found to be more severely impaired than present <b>time</b> <b>reference.</b> An error analysis revealed that the simple past was substituted significantly more often with non-past tense forms than with other past tense forms. The findings in the present study, show a selective past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> deficit in Italian agrammatic speakers, irrespective of the tense of the verb. However, a past/non-past comparison is inadequate, as future <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> was found to be significantly more impaired than present <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> as well. Following the findings from the present study, it is plausible to suggest that future and present <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> are processed through different underlying mechanisms. Present tense is processed through narrow syntax, which is based on local binding relations. It is suggested, that some type of discourse linking is involved in future <b>time</b> <b>reference,</b> as (irrealis) extra-sentential information needs to be linked to the linguistic information within the sentence. Simple past appeared to be more difficult than present perfect. The imperfective simple past tense was substituted significantly more often with non-past tense forms than with other past tense forms. This indicated a prototypical categorization of perfective and imperfective categories in Italian language. An interaction between <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> and aspect is suggested for Italian, in line with the findings of Dragoy and Bastiaanse (2013) for Russian. ...|$|R

30|$|An {{inherent}} {{problem of}} any distributed synchronization procedure is that nodes {{agree on a}} relative <b>time</b> <b>reference,</b> that is, valid only among the considered nodes and has no external tie. Such a relative reference is opposed to a global <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> such as the Coordinated Universal Time, which is provided by GPS for example. Furthermore, as {{the size of the}} network increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to synchronize the entire network in a completely decentralized manner. To avoid this difficulty, in [25] a scenario was considered where only a few nodes have access to a global <b>time</b> <b>reference.</b> The PCO model was extended such that these master nodes impose a global <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> to the entire network, even though the number of master nodes was {{only a small fraction of}} the total number of nodes in the network. Furthermore, the behavior of normal nodes that do not have access to a global <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> is not modified at all.|$|R

Guitar technicians (often called guitar techs) tune all of the instruments (electric guitars, electric basses, acoustic guitars, mandolins, etc.) before the show, after they are played, and before they are used onstage. Guitar techs also retune instruments throughout the show. Whereas amateur musicians typically use a relatively inexpensive quartz tuner, guitar technicians typically use expensive, high-end tuners such as strobe tuners. Most strobe tuners, counter-intuitively, also use quartz crystal oscillators as <b>time</b> <b>references,</b> although the responses are processed differently by the different units.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{information}} {{given in the}} novel two <b>time</b> <b>references</b> for the two blocks of action that constitute the narrative can be pinpointed: May 1460 and January 1461. The important time indicator is the Battle of Wakefield, 30 December 1460, which Stevenson describes in {{the first chapter of}} Book 3: [...] It is because Richard Crookback (later Richard III of England) is presented as an adult active in the Wars of the Roses in January 1461 that Stevenson provides the footnote: [...] "At the date of this story, Richard Crookback could not have been created Duke of Gloucester; but for clearness, with the reader's leave, he shall so be called." [...] Richard was born in 1452, so he would have been merely 8 {{years old at the time}} of this story. A later footnote emphasises this again: [...] "Richard Crookback would have been really far younger at this date [...]" [...] Stevenson follows William Shakespeare in retrojecting Richard of Gloucester into an earlier period of the Wars of the Roses and portraying him as a dour hunchback—Stevenson: [...] "the formidable hunchback." [...] (See Henry VI, part 2; Henry VI, part 3; and Richard III.) This characterisation closely follows the Tudor myth, a tradition that overly vilified Richard of Gloucester and cast the entire English Fifteenth century as a bloody, barbaric chaos in contrast to the Tudor era of law and order.|$|E
2500|$|The {{subsequent}} {{waves of}} rebuilding which {{have resulted in}} the total eradication of the earlier medieval structures are easily explained by the parallel phases of development seen elsewhere in the county. In particular the [...] "Age of Improvement", roughly from 1750 to 1850 saw rapid gains in agricultural and industrial efficiency. [...] Milburn would have benefited significantly from enhanced crop yields and from the opening of the mines which also occurred at this <b>time</b> (<b>references</b> to the rich Silverband mine on Dun Fell, behind the village, appear from 1709). The scale of the improvement in rural fortunes is demonstrated by the stylish ambition guiding the design of the replacement buildings. Doors are adorned with classical features such as architraves and pediments, and windows are surrounded by elaborate mouldings. [...] It seems likely that medieval structures first began to disappear at this time, the process being consolidated as the improvement in the wealth of the village continued during the 19th century. [...] The flimsy nature of the earlier structures has ensured that nothing from the medieval phase survives, though it is notable that many of the replacement buildings contain timbers which have clearly had an earlier history. [...] It is very common, for example, to find exposed oak beams which now support floors but which contain joints which show they used {{to be part of a}} roof. Similarly many beams are drilled to show they once formed part of wattle and daub partitions.|$|E

The End of <b>Time</b> <b>references</b> the Tenth Doctor marrying Queen Elizabeth I and implies that the two had sexual intercourse, the Doctor stating: [...] "her nickname [...] is no longer...". The joke is continued in [...] "The Beast Below", featuring future British monarch Queen Elizabeth X or Liz Ten, and the marriage is finally shown in [...] "The Day of the Doctor" [...] during an adventure with Zygons. In the 2010 Christmas special, [...] "A Christmas Carol", the Eleventh Doctor accidentally married Marilyn Monroe but later questioned the authenticity of the chapel in which they were married. Steven Moffat did not consider the marriages to Elizabeth I and Marilyn Monroe to count when questioned on how many wives the Doctor had had, remarking that he was married to Susan's grandmother and River Song.|$|E

[...] "Leave It" [...] developed from a bass line from Squire and a melody from Rabin. When it came to recording the song, the band were {{not satisfied with the}} drum sound they were getting in the studio, so they recorded the vocals first. However, one of the engineers had removed the song's click track <b>time</b> <b>references,</b> causing various synchronisation problems.

40|$|Anti-jamming {{capability}} and protection against undesired interception are key priorities in ad hoc networks for secure applications. These features {{are supported by}} spread spectrum (SS) techniques such as frequency hopping (FH). In a frequency hopping ad hoc network, the phase of the hopping sequence is typically derived from the local <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> (clock reading) of each node. Therefore, network-wide time synchronization is {{needed in order to}} get the nodes to simultaneously switch to the same frequency channel, i. e., hop synchronously. Due to the characteristics of ad hoc networks there is no centralized control, e. g., no unambiguous entity, to define a common <b>time</b> <b>reference.</b> Thus, a distributed decision has to be made between the nodes as to whose local <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> is chosen as the common <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> for other nodes to synchronize to. For that purpose, there has to be a predefined procedure for frequency hopping nodes to exchange synchronization information out-of-phase, e. g., through a control channel...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reference</b> to a <b>time</b> {{frame in}} which an event takes place {{can be done by}} verb inflection. lithe time frame (past, present, future) is set by a {{temporal}} adverb, the verb inflection should correspond (yesterday he walked; today he walks). Temporal violations by simple verbs (single, lexical verbs inflected with tense) in the present tense and with present <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> elicit a P 600 effect (Baggio, 2008; Dragoy, Stowe, Bos, & Bastiaanse, 2012). However tense does not always coincide with time reference: in languages such as Dutch and English, reference to the past can be established by using the present tense in the present perfect (e. g. 'he has eaten the cake'). The current study investigates whether the P 600 effects described by Dragoy et al. and Baggio are caused by tense or <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> violations of the verb. In the context of a past adverb, ERP responses to auxiliaries in present tense with either congruent past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> or incongruent non-past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> were compared. The findings show that the P 600 effect for violations of the temporal context is caused by the <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> of the complete verb form, rather than by the tense.

40|$|Cross-linguistic {{data suggest}} that the {{grammatical}} categories of tense and aspect are not generally impaired in individuals with aphasia (see Bastiaanse et al., 2011 for a review). Rather, and more specifically, verb forms expressing reference to the past or conveying perfective semantics are more impaired than verb forms expressing reference to the non-past (present or future) or conveying imperfective semantics, both in comprehension and production. The present study used some structural properties of Russian to systematically test the interaction of <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> and aspect in non-fluent and fluent aphasia. The Test for Assessment of <b>Reference</b> of <b>Time</b> (TART; Bastiaanse, Jonkers, & Thompson, 2008; Russian version Dragoy & Bastiaanse, 2010) was used to elicit production of four verb forms in sentence context: past perfective, non-past perfective, past imperfective and non-past imperfective. The results showed that non-past <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> had a general advantage over past <b>time</b> <b>reference,</b> all aspectual forms being collapsed. However, an interaction between <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> and aspect was found: imperfective verbs were better produced in the non-past, whereas production of perfective verbs was better preserved in the past time frame. Non-fluent and fluent aphasic speakers showed largely overlapping performance. These results demonstrated that the advantage of a particular <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> depends on aspectual characteristics of the verb. The performance of both non-fluent and fluent aphasic speakers can be explained in terms of prototypical and non-prototypical matches of <b>time</b> <b>reference</b> and aspectual semantics: perfectives primarily refer to completed, past events while imperfectives prototypically describe ongoing, non-past events.
