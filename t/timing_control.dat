50|$|The {{choice in}} HEI system type is vitally {{important}} based on the engine {{it will be used}} with. Each GM division had its own engine design. Thus, a Chevrolet ignition may not be identical to an Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick, or Cadillac engine. Typically, the ignition system compatibility followed the engine size. Most GM engines (of the same size) between 1974 and 1988 used a similar distributor ignition system. The module type is important as well. For non-computer controlled carburetor engines, the 4-pin unit is used since it uses mechanical <b>timing</b> <b>controls</b> (vacuum and centrifugal advance). The 5-pin module is like the 4-pin, with an added knock/detonation sensor input to the module so the ignition could be deliberately retarded and the power output dropped to the spark plug to aid disruption of the knock condition. The 7-pin module is designed for computer <b>timing</b> <b>controls.</b> It incorporates 2 magnetic signals from the pickup sensor, and 3 signals shared with the ECM engine control module), while the remaining 2 pins provide signal and power to the coil. Normally the 7 pin is not used on non-computerized engines since it does not contain mechanical <b>timing</b> <b>controls,</b> but some early designs used a seven-pin distributor module in conjunction with mechanical and vacuum advance in the distributor body, so the seven-pin module would be backward compatible.|$|R

The KiTS uses a hardware abstraction layer and a configurable software model implemented within the Front-End Software Architecture (FESA) framework.

50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of HEI control modules, the four-pin, five-pin, and seven-pin modules. The four-pin module was used on {{conventional}} carbureted engines and uses conventional mechanical timing controls (vacuum and centrifugal advance mechanisms). The five-pin module {{was introduced in}} 1978 and was an early attempt at electronic <b>timing</b> <b>control.</b> The five-pin module contains a provision for connecting a knock sensor. The seven-pin module is used on early computer-controlled engines. The seven-pin module contains no mechanical <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms as the computer controls ignition timing. Late 1980's GM cars and trucks used a slim distributor cap HEI with a separate ignition coil on throttle body injection equipped engines. These distributors were not stand-alone units {{because they did not}} contain mechanical timing controls.|$|E

The {{original}} bat calls are digitised and the zero crossing points used to produce a data stream which is recorded on a Compact Flash card. There are sophisticated <b>timing</b> <b>controls</b> and the device can be set to respond to bat calls, so that many hours of recording are available in unmanned situations.

Historically, to achieve long recording times, such information reduction has been necessary due to memory capacity limitations and memory cost.|$|R
