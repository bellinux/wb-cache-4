5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the attempt to relocate the Timberwolves, the New Orleans Regional Basketball Alliance sought to lure an existing franchise to the city. After completion of the New Orleans Arena, the Alliance led efforts to relocate the Vancouver Grizzlies to the city. The New Orleans bid ultimately lost out to Memphis, and by early 2002 the city looked to the Charlotte Hornets to potentially relocate to the city. The Hornets became attractive to relocate following a failed referendum for a new arena in Charlotte. On May 10, 2002, the NBA {{voted in favor of}} <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> the Hornets to New Orleans marking the return of the NBA to the city since <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> the New Orleans Jazz to Salt Lake City in 1979.

5|$|A {{large area}} of the grounds between the asylum main {{buildings}} and Princess Street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under asylum management and was no longer for asylum inmate use. Widening and straightening of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew. Construction of Yarra Boulevard during the 1930s led to {{a section of the}} asylum's river frontage being acquired by the roads department.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' {{residents}} {{worked in}} Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% {{of the economy}} in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, {{one of the reasons for}} the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> many businesses.|$|E

5|$|In 1905, {{with the}} Royal Commission's report {{about to be}} published, the GNP {{returned}} to Parliament with two bills for consideration. The first bill revived the 1903 proposal for a branch from Piccadilly Circus to the City of London, passing and interchanging with Strand station. The second proposed an extension and relocation of Strand station to the junction of Strand and Surrey Street. From there the line was to continue as a single tunnel under the River Thames to Waterloo. The first bill was again delayed and withdrawn. Of the second, only <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> Strand station was permitted.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, a new US223 bypass {{was built}} around Adrian, {{resulting}} in <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> M-34 to end at BUS US223/M-52. Finally, in 1966, {{when a new}} alignment of M-99 highway was opened, the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to end at the new highway near Osseo. In 2003, the short connector between M-34 and US223 was abandoned and obliterated. Industrial Drive, which is known internally at MDOT as Connector 34, is a new connector between the two highways that was assumed into the state trunkline system at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, a new {{interchange}} {{was built}} between NY134 and the Taconic State Parkway {{as part of}} the construction of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. During the excavation process for the junction, a bone from a woolly mammoth (colloquially known as Jefferson's mammoth) was found buried in the earth below. The bones were moved to the New York State Museum in Albany. The construction also required <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> the Kitchawan Tavern from the site of the exit to the junction of Kitchawan and Chadeanye roads a half-mile (0.8km) to the east.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, 22.7% of the {{population}} in the Salford USD (Urban Subdivision) were non-white British compared with 15.6% for the surrounding borough. The USD had a slightly larger percentage of Asian and black people. Salford has become a lot more ethnically diverse since the previous census, probably due to <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> many BBC establishments from London between 2011 and 2012. This has created lots of jobs and encouraged migration to the area, which was previously very deprived since the loss of many traditional industries in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In May, {{costs for}} {{construction}} of the station were again increased to $4.1 million. The increased costs were primarily associated with <b>the</b> <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> fiber optic lines during {{the construction of the}} pedestrian tunnel. To reduce overall costs, village officials asked for architects to remove the tunnel and replace it with an elevated walkway over the tracks. In October 2004, the village board gave final approval to the revised station plan with a pedestrian bridge. The $3.2 million estimated cost of the station was to be financed through a pair of federal transportation grants in addition to the village borrowing against its tax incremental financing district from the adjacent industrial park.|$|E
