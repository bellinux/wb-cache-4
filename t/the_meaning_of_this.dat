25|$|The Akkadian Empire {{reached its}} {{political}} peak between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, following the conquests by its founder Sargon of Akkad. Under Sargon and his successors, the Akkadian language was briefly imposed on neighboring conquered {{states such as}} Elam and Gutium.

25|$|Many {{elements}} of the gut develop in a three-fold pattern (for example, dances repeated three times). Threefoldedness has important meaning in Sinism, for it signifies completion or fulfilment of the beginning; a three-time repetition of an action means to complete the initial intention. <b>The</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> aspect {{is grounded in the}} theological concept of the trinity of being—Hwanin, Hwanung, Dangun—, the three stages of manifestation of Haneullim.|$|E
25|$|The Klein paradox, {{discovered}} by Oskar Klein in 1928, presented further quantum mechanical {{objections to the}} notion of an electron confined within a nucleus. Derived from the Dirac equation, this clear and precise paradox showed that a high-energy electron approaching a potential barrier has a high probability of passing through the barrier, or escaping, by transforming to a particle of negative mass. Apparently, an electron could not be confined within a nucleus by any potential well. <b>The</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> paradox was intensely debated at the time.|$|E

The Tigers were picked by some in the preseason to win the Big 12 North. Coming into the game, the Sooners were 16–1 against Missouri since 1984 including a 26–10 win the past season. The crew of ESPN's College GameDay made a visit to Norman, adding to <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Homecoming bout.

25|$|Sonnet 125 {{carries a}} great deal of {{symbolic}} language, but the purpose and structure of a sonnet do not allow nor require detailed explanation of <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> language. Due to the ambiguous nature of Shakespeare's words, this sonnet can be understood in a variety of ways. A number of scholars have examined Sonnet 125 and come away with different conclusions about its message. The number of characters identified by scholars ranges between two and four depending on how the language throughout this particular sonnet and the entire sonnet cycle is interpreted. As the number of characters fluctuates, the meanings assigned to each action within the sonnet take on new meaning.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, Jimmy is going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sudden hurricane is.|$|E

25|$|Robert Neighbors {{recorded}} one of {{the best}} known meetings with Old Owl. While he was a Texas Indian Agent for the Republic in 1845, Major Neighbors was at a Tonkawa camp. Old Owl arrived with 40 warriors, and in a manner the Major called “most insolent,” demanded that the Tonkawa feed the war party and their horses, and provide for them entertainment. The Tonkawas, in fear of their lives, provided 40 women, food and shelter, and cared for the horses at once. Neighbors, who had just been appointed Indian Agent for all Texas Indians including the Comanche, took this opportunity to meet some of his new charges, and told them he was hopeful of civilizing them. Old Owl, introduced to Neighbors, complimented him on his fine blue coat. Neighbors, understanding <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> compliment, presented the Chief with the coat immediately. Other warriors admired his pants, boots, and other clothing, and soon Neighbors was standing only in a nightshirt.|$|E
25|$|The Highlander {{developed}} “as {{a necessary}} {{preparation for the}} management of the broad-sword… used in certain dances to exhibit their dexterity”; this included dancing over two naked swords which are laid across each other on the floor, some while a dancer moves nimbly around them. Dextrously placing the feet by a peculiar step in the intervals between crossed blades, as in the Ghillie Callum, has long been linked with dances before a decisive battle or as a victory dance. Legend has it that on the eve of battle the highland chief would call out the clan’s best dancers, who would dance the sword dance. If the dancers successfully avoided touching either blade, then it was considered an omen that the next day's battle would be in the clan’s favour. A more practical explanation behind <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> dance {{can be found in the}} training halls of older styles of fencing, where students of the sword developed their footwork by following geometric patterns of crosses, squares and triangles marked out on the floor.|$|E
25|$|The first {{mention of}} a Capitoline triad refers to the Capitolium Vetus. The only ancient source who refers to the {{presence}} of this divine triad in Greece is Pausanias X 5, 1-2, who mentions its existence in describing the Φωκικόν in Phocis. The Capitoline triad poses difficult interpretative problems. It looks peculiarly Roman, since there is no sure document of its existence elsewhere either in Latium or Etruria. A direct Greek influence is possible but it would be also plausible to consider it a local creation. Dumézil advanced the hypothesis it could be an ideological construction of the Tarquins to oppose new Latin nationalism, as it included the three gods that in the Iliad are enemies of Troy. It is probable Latins had already accepted the legend of Aeneas as their ancestor. Among ancient sources indeed Servius states that according to the Etrusca Disciplina towns should have the three temples of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva at the end of three roads leading to three gates. Vitruvius writes that the temples of these three gods should be located on the most elevated site, isolated from the other. To his Etruscan founders <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> triad might have been related to peculiarly Etruscan ideas on the association of the three gods with the birth of Herakles and the siege of Troy, in which Minerva plays a decisive role as a goddess of destiny along with the sovereign couple Uni Tinia.|$|E

25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern looked almost the same. They were of shallow draught so that when fully loaded they drew only {{four and a half}} feet. The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the {{standard}} load of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or approximately 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels were supposed to be measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a load mark to show when they were full. The keels had a single mast with a square sail attached to a yardarm and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the gunwale to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by a skipper, two crewmen and a boy, known as a ‘pee dee’. <b>The</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> title is unknown.|$|E
