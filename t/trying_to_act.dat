5|$|Shelby Corcoran is a {{recurring}} fictional character from the Fox musical comedy-drama series Glee. Portrayed by actress Idina Menzel, Shelby {{was introduced in}} the fourteenth episode of the show as the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, a rival show choir to New Directions, the show's primary musical group. Fans had lobbied for Menzel to be cast as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) biological mother, due to the strong physical resemblance between Menzel and Michele. After it is revealed that Shelby is, in fact, Rachel's biological mother, Shelby discloses that she had signed a contract that stated that she could not seek out her daughter until she was eighteen. She tells Rachel that instead of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> like mother and daughter, they should just be grateful that they have met, and maintain their distance.|$|E
25|$|Non-black {{stereotypes}} {{played a}} significant role in minstrelsy, and although still performed in blackface, were distinguished by their lack of black dialect. American Indians before the Civil War were usually depicted as innocent symbols of the pre-industrial world or as pitiable victims whose peaceful existence had been shattered by the encroachment of the white man. However, as the United States turned its attentions West, American Indians became savage, pagan obstacles to progress. These characters were formidable scalpers to be feared, not ridiculed; any humor in such scenarios usually derived from a black character <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> like one of the frightful savages. One sketch began with white men and American Indians enjoying a communal meal in a frontier setting. As the American Indians became intoxicated, they grew more and more antagonistic, and the army ultimately had to intervene to prevent the massacre of the whites. Even favorably presented American Indian characters usually died tragically.|$|E

500|$|In {{the five}} weeks after murdering his brother Brian, the [...] "Ice Truck Killer", Dexter has been {{followed}} by suspicious Sgt. Doakes and thus cannot satisfy his urge to kill. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> [...] "relentlessly normal", Dexter goes bowling almost nightly with his co-workers. He is finally left alone when Doakes gives up and takes a night off; Dexter pursues a blind voodoo priest, Jimmy (Glenn Plummer), but finds himself uneasy and ultimately unable to kill the man, and lets him go. At a homicide scene, the victim's mother (Anna Maganini) pleads with Dexter to kill her son's murderer, gang lord [...] "Little Chino" [...] (Matthew Willig). He sees the woman's young daughter, Marissa (Jillian Bruno), and is reminded {{of himself as a}} boy, having witnessed his mother's brutal death. He leads Doakes to believe that he is bowling for the night but instead brings Chino to Jimmy's killing room. Chino wakes {{up in the middle of}} Dexter's procedure and manages to break out of the duct tape and escape.|$|E

500|$|In early 2007, a video hosted on YouTube led {{to reports}} that the song [...] "Do It", and the Timbaland-produced ringtone [...] "Block Party" [...] that {{inspired}} it, used—without authorization—the melody from Finnish demoscene musician Janne [...] "Tempest" [...] Suni's song [...] "Acidjazzed Evening", winner of the Assembly 2000 oldskool music competition. Timbaland used the record of C64 adaptation of the song written by Glenn Rune Gallefoss (GRG). Timbaland admitted sampling the song, but {{said that he had}} no time to research its intellectual owner. Hannu Sormunen, a Finnish representative of Universal which represents Nelly Furtado in Finland, commented the controversy as follows in the 15 January 2007 issue of Iltalehti; [...] "In case that the artist decides to pursue the matter further, it's on him to go to America and confront them with the local use of law. It will require a considerable amount of faith and, of course, money." [...] On 9 February 2007, Timbaland commented on the issue in an MTV interview: [...] "It makes me laugh.

2500|$|Rose {{received}} {{criticism for}} arguing with federal officials at Parkland. For {{his role in}} the immediate aftermath of the assassination, he was disparaged by William Manchester in his 1967 book The Death of a President. Describing Manchester's portrayal of Rose, Peter Knight wrote: [...] "If Dallas and Oswald are the overt culprits of the crime, then Earl Rose is the cameo villain of the book." [...] According to a 2003 AP report, Rose's son, Forrest, believed that the book [...] "depicted [...] as an unreasonable, petty state bureaucrat with a gripe." [...] BMJ wrote that he was [...] "portrayed almost comically as a small time official <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> important; a portrayal most now see as unjustified." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the {{locomotive}} accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures {{will start to}} generate a counter-electromotive force (back EMF, meaning the motors are also <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as generators), which will oppose {{the output of the}} main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power, but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, {{the locomotive}} will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as [...] "transition," [...] a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.|$|E

Video game reviewers thought the voice acting was okay.,. She voiced Blood Leopard in Accel World, who was similar to Kyoko in showing little emotion. In Sword Art Online she voiced Sasha, whom she describes as being like a teacher/nun lady {{who is in charge}} of the kids who are lost in the game. In the second series, she voiced another character named Siune; both series were broadcast on the Toonami block on Adult Swim. She also began attending anime conventions as a guest panelist. In voicing [...] in the [...] series, Harlacher found her character to be not your average princess, and that she was fun because she was unpredictable. Her biggest role that year was Ami Kawashima in the romantic comedy Toradora!, a classmate who harbors a mean and bratty personality behind a cheerful perfect-looking facade of a model. As it was one of NIS America's first dub productions, Harlacher said took a long time to call back from the audition, and that it also took more time than other studios in producing the show. She describes Ami's character as <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> like she knows what she's doing but does not really have it together, and also she cannot cook.
