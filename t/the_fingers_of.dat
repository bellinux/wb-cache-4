5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} {{among the}} Christians of Neapolis decreased, {{tensions between the}} Christian community and the Samaritans grew dramatically. In 484, the city became {{the site of a}} deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of Aaron's sons and grandsons Eleazar, Ithamar and Phinehas. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to Constantinople, requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor Zeno erected a church dedicated to Mary on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.|$|E

5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> his right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a white herden (flax and hemp) apron for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E

25|$|When {{using this}} convention, in {{contrast}} to the other convention, the defined handedness of the wave matches the handedness of the screw type nature of the field in space. Specifically, if one freezes a right-handed wave in time, when one curls <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> one’s right hand around the helix, the thumb will point in the direction which the helix progresses given that sense of rotation. Note that it is the nature of all screws and helices that it does not matter in which direction you point your thumb when determining its handedness.|$|E

25|$|A force {{applied at}} {{a right angle}} to a lever multiplied by its {{distance}} from the lever's fulcrum (the length of the lever arm) is its torque. A force of three newtons applied two metres from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum. The direction of the torque can be determined by using the right hand grip rule: if <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> the right hand are curled {{from the direction of}} the lever arm to the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the torque.|$|E
25|$|As a {{specific}} example, {{refer to the}} circularly polarized wave in the first animation. Using this convention that wave is defined as right-handed because when one points one's right thumb {{in the same direction}} of the wave’s propagation, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> that hand curl in the same direction of the field’s temporal rotation. It is considered clockwise circularly polarized because {{from the point of view}} of the source, looking in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, the field rotates in the clockwise direction. The second animation is that of left-handed or anti-clockwise light using this same convention.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn many {{multiphase}} systems, material interfaces can be destabilized by shocks. Small disturbances {{at these}} interfaces can grow {{in size to}} form large-scale fingers. We consider a shock propagating through a system that consists of two types of particles, of different mass, that are initially separated by an interface, but are free to mix. In the classical case <b>of</b> immiscible fluids, <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> heavy fluid propagating into the light fluid grows faster and becomes much thinner than <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> light fluid propagating into the heavy fluid. We show that collisions between particles of different types lead to shock focusing that causes a secondary flow that is initially similar to the fluid case. However, the particle system can exhibit completely different qualitative behavior in the nonlinear-growth phase and can give rise to the situation where <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> heavy material is actually wider than <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light material. We show that this qualitative change {{is due to a}} strong decompression that occurs in the heavy material. We also show that microscopic mixing can have an important impact on finger growth...|$|R
