40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this c-level essay shall try to {{illustrate}} how a good leader is formed. We have investigated what influences leadership style, personal characteristics or individual competence have when recruiting a new manager. This study {{has been carried out}} with comparative applications because we wanted to study the similarities and differences between the Unemployment Office, the Social Insurance Office and the Social Welfare Administration. We have used a qualitative method in interviews both with employers as well as the from the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>representative’s</b> perspective. Part of our results indicates that the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>representatives</b> and the employers are not always unanimous and do not request equivalent characteristics and knowledge at recruitment. We have also found certain differences in the recruitment process between the organisations {{despite the fact that they}} are all politically governed and have many organisational similarities. We do not claim any empirical generalisations about our results as we have studied only one municipality. Our conclusions establish how certain key factors relate to recruitment of mangers just in this municipality and in these organisations. The results, however, indicates the prominence of some key factors that might be of general importance. One of the most important result that we found in this study was that the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>representatives</b> had more similar opinions with each other than those they had with their respective organisations. Furthermore it became obvious from the study that great significance was given to inter-personal relationships when recruiting a new middle manager. The most significant resemblance between the three organisations was that they requested a management style that inclined towards democratic values...|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>representatives</b> on the Supreme Labour Council, the organisation of local labour councils, and instructions to factory inspectors {{to put themselves}} in communication with the councils of the <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> were valuable concessions to labour. He further secured the rigorous application of earlier laws devised {{for the protection of}} the working class.

40|$|Inflation {{expectation}} {{is believed to}} be critical in the formation of prices and wages; hence the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) reacts to any first-round effect of inflation by tightening the monetary policy {{in order to avoid the}} second-round effect. But how important are the inflation expectations of the <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> in leading the inflation rate? Using quarterly data and Toda-Yamamoto causality technique, this study investigates whether inflation rate is led by inflation expectations and/or vice versa, using three different measures of inflation expectations of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>representatives.</b> The study also investigates the importance of the exchange rate in leading or lagging inflation rate. The inflation expectations of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>representatives</b> were chosen because of the way in which this sector, through the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> federation COSATU (Congress of South African <b>Trade</b> <b>Unions),</b> has antagonised the inflation-targeting framework adopted by SARB. The results obtained showed that inflation and the exchange rate have bi-directional causality, while uni-directional causality exists from inflation rate to inflation expectations. The study therefore concluded that a possible second-round effect of inflation cannot be experienced from the changes in inflation expectations of the <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> while providing possible policy recommendations. While many studies have observed inflation expectations in different ways, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted with regard to the cause and effect of inflation expectations of <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> in particular, on inflation rate using Toda-Yamamoto causality technique for South Africa.
