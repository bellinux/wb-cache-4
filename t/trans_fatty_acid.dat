They varied the pressure under which the chemical reaction was conducted— applying 1400kPa (200psi) of pressure to soybean oil in a 2-liter vessel while heating it to between 140°C and 170°C. The standard 140kPa (20psi) process of hydrogenation produces a product of about 40% <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> by weight, compared to about 17% using the high-pressure method. Blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil, the high-pressure-processed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6% trans fat.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Trans isomers {{are formed}} during the partial {{hydrogenation}} process of cis unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The {{major source of}} <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in the normal person's diet is from margarines and shortenings made from these partially hydrogenated plant and marine oils. In addition to influencing lipid risk factors for cardiovascular disease, <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> have also been implicated in breast cancer, and in poor fetal development and reduced early infant growth. In reality, <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> have been consumed for centuries, since they occur naturally in beef, mutton, butter, milk and other dairy products. Though {{it has been shown}} that these naturally occurring <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> have different effects on the health of humans. With the implementation of the new labelling law in South Africa, the <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> content of food items must be displayed on the food label. Therefore, it becomes necessary to optimise the analytical methodology for the determination of <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in foods. Many publications have reported on the quantification of the total concentration of <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in food samples, while less work has been done on the identification and quantification of the different cis and <b>trans</b> unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> isomers found in foods made from partially hydrogenated oils. The objective of this study was to standardise and optimise an analytical technique to identify and quantify the different cis and <b>trans</b> mono-unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> isomers in local margarines and bread spreads. Seeing that <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are the group of lipids most commonly analysed by GLC and the availability of highly polar capillary columns bonded with cyanoalkyl polysiloxan phases, it was decided to use GLC for the identification and quantification of the different cis and trans isomers in a selected group of margarines.

40|$|At {{the start}} of the work {{described}} in this thesis, most reviewers on <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> agreed that these isomeric <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> did not induce undesirable effects, provided sufficient linoleic acid was present in the diet (Beare-Rogers, 1983; Emken, 1983; Gottenbos, 1983; Gurr, 1983).

40|$|<b>Trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are {{unsaturated}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> with {{at least}} one double bond in the <b>trans</b> configuration.

The metabolic effect of trans isomers are today a matter of controversy generating diverse extreme positions in light of biochemical, nutritional, and epidemiological studies. <b>Trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> also have been implicated in the etiology of various metabolic and functional disorders, but the main concern about its health effects arose because the structural similarity of these isomers to saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> the lack of specific metabolic functions, and its competition with essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The ingestion of <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> increases low density lipoprotein (LDL) to a degree similar to that of saturated fats, but it also reduces high density lipoproteins (HDL), therefore trans isomers are considered more atherogenic than saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> <b>Trans</b> isomers increase lipoprotein(a), a non-dietary-related risk of atherogenesis, to levels higher than the corresponding chain-length saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> There is little evidence that <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are related to cancer risk at any of the major cancer sites.

The fatty acid molecule is broken down and categorized {{based on the number of}} carbon atoms in its molecular structure.

50|$|Fats such as {{soybean oil}} consist mainly of various {{triglycerides}} {{which are made}} up of a glycerol backbone esterified to three fatty acid molecules. The triglycerides contain a mixture of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Interesterification is carried out by blending the desired oils and then rearranging the fatty acids over the glycerol backbone with, for instance, the help of catalysts or lipase enzymes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) decrease the melting point of fats significantly. A triglyceride containing three saturated fatty acids is generally solid at room temperature and not very desirable for many applications. Rearranging these triglycerides with oils containing unsaturated fatty acids lowers the melting point and creates fats with properties better suited for target food products. In addition, blending interesterified oils with liquid oils allows the reduction in saturated fatty acids in many <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> free food products. The interesterified fats can be separated through controlled crystallization, also called fractionation.|$|E
