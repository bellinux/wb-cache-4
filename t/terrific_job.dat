25|$|On 21 May 2009, Dragan Marić, {{a former}} {{businessman}} who was revolted over the court decision in his {{dispute with the}} national air carrier Jat Airways, entered the Presidency office carrying two hand grenades and seeking an out-of-court settlement signed by President or Government. Members of the Battalion of Military Police Cobras, providing security to the President of Serbia, managed {{to take one of}} the grenades immediately and isolate the attacker, however the perpetrator removed the pin from the second grenade and threatened to detonate it by releasing the lever. The negotiations were handled by the special team of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs, supported by the officials of the Ministry of Justice, and lasted for several hours until the man was disarmed and arrested. After the incident, Tadić, who was present in the secured area of the building, congratulated the police and army special units, the security and negotiation team for doing a <b>terrific</b> <b>job,</b> peacefully and with no casualties and also said that problems, no matter what kind, cannot be resolved by force and by jeopardising citizens' lives.|$|E
500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray gave Justice League #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray {{stated that}} [...] "Johns does a <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> of pulling {{together}} {{what has been}} essentially four or five separate stories, incorporating not only the three main titles that this will span over the coming months, but introducing several new players into the mix as well." [...] He also praised that the story advanced and showed similar promise that the reboot to the New 52 did in 2011. Joshua Yehl of IGN gave {{the first chapter of}} the Trinity War a 7.8 out of 10. He felt the issue {{set the stage for the}} event and praised the character work. However, he though that the conflict was not presented clearly yet and criticized the lack of the Justice League Dark in the first issue. Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Johns manages to balance personality expositions with story breaks, giving readers a sense of who the opposing sides are, if nothing else. Johns brings lots of big moments to the pages, but the emotions he wrings from those moments really help sell this book." [...] Zawisza was surprised by the amount of time that was spent on Madame Xanadu, feeling as though it was only there for reason to include the Justice League Dark, and was wary that the characters are in danger of being absorbed by the plot. All three praised the art in the issue, especially Ivan Reis' pencils.|$|E
2500|$|Lennertz, who {{returned}} to score the One-Shot, and D'Esposito, the director, wanted a more traditional, orchestral score for Agent Carter, with D'Esposito wanting to balance the period setting and modern Marvel superhero feel. D'Esposito referenced Johnny Rivers' [...] "Secret Agent Man", [...] "even though {{it was in the}} 60's" [...] as inspiration. Lennertz felt D'Esposito [...] "did a <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> getting that [...] and reaching that" [...] while having [...] "a James Bond secret agent sentiment to it too." [...] To create the score, Lennertz [...] "put together a big band, combined it with an orchestra, and added modern electronic and dub-step elements", to represent the 40s setting, the Marvel feeling, and the advanced technology, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|An {{official}} remake, titled , {{was developed}} by Firaxis Games, led by MicroProse's co-founder Sid Meier. The game's prototype was actually a modernization of the original, with all the classic gameplay features, but then gradually evolved into a completely [...] "reimagined" [...] version. The game was released by 2K Games for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in October 2012, winning multiple Game of the Year awards. In a retrospective article in Eurogamer, Alec Meer compared both games with [...] "a sort of objectivity from me that hasn't been remotely possible {{over the last two}} decades of worshipping at its VGA shrine," [...] stating: [...] "I can see a game that can and will co-exist with rather than be supplanted by its remake. X-COM and XCOM are completely different games, both ingenious and both flawed in their own ways. I'd kill for a hybrid of the two, but having two rather than one sure is nothing to sniff at." [...] In a positive review of the remake, Dan Stapleton of GameSpy added: [...] "I leave the title of Best Game Ever with the original." [...] Julian Gollop himself commented that [...] "Firaxis did a <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> with the new XCOM," [...] although he [...] "would have done things differently for sure. (...) I tried many times for many years to get a remake underway, but Firaxis finally did it. Also, there is a promising and more faithful remake called Xenonauts." ...|$|E
60|$|The most <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> {{of all was}} to furl the main-sail, which, at the {{commencement}} of the squalls, had been clewed up, coaxed and quieted {{as much as possible}} with the bunt-lines and slab-lines. Mad Jack waited some time for a lull, ere he gave an order so perilous to be executed. For to furl this enormous sail, in such a gale, required at least fifty men on the yard; whose weight, superadded to that of the ponderous stick itself, still further jeopardised their lives. But there was no prospect of a cessation of the gale, and the order was at last given.|$|E

5000|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} [...] "The Woman Who Lived", Smedley {{discussed}} Williams' portrayal of Ashildr as [...] "a <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> {{of making the}} character feel like she’s lived lifetimes since we last saw her. Several hundred years of loss in just one week. It’s an even better, and inevitably more mature, performance than last Saturday." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yan Geling said [...] "Zhao did a <b>terrific</b> <b>job.</b> I {{was moved}} to tears {{watching}} the episode in which Sufei was divorcing her husband, she acted really marvelous and beautiful.

5000|$|Michael Thornhill {{later said}} that [...] "I don't have strong {{opinions}} about it film. There {{are quite a}} few cheats in it, but at least what it did do - I'm not emotionally close to it - was put the audience in the view of I, the Jury. It has an enormous following in northern Europe. I think Judy did a <b>terrific</b> <b>job.</b> I think it was interesting but, again, it's not a personal project." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 30 January 2014 the BBC {{commissioned}} a full six-part-series of Still Open All Hours to be transmitted {{later in the}} year.

Musically the band adopted a hard psychedelic direction, with chiming 12-string guitar and overdriven solos alternating with folky acoustic passages and harmony vocals sometimes reminiscent of The Moody Blues.|$|E

5000|$|As part of Cleveland's {{offensive}} line, Gaudio helped protect quarterback Otto Graham {{and open}} up running room for fullback Marion Motley. He was used primarily {{in his first season}} as a defensive lineman, but played increasingly on offense the following year after assistant coach Blanton Collier praised his technique in an annual review of film from the previous season. He played more snaps in 1948 than veteran guard Lin Houston. [...] "Lin hasn't lost his touch, he's just as good as ever," [...] Browns guard coach Fritz Heisler said at the time.

5000|$|... "I think Firaxis did a <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> {{with the}} new XCOM. They have made a very console {{friendly}} and accessible game, but it still {{has a lot of}} strategic and tactical depth. The character progression is done very well, and the tactical combat system is great. I would have done things differently for sure. I was a bit disappointed that the Geoscape is basically irrelevant, with no strategy involved about positioning of bases, detection ranges, base attacks and so on. It is also a shame that there is no random map generation. The development of the alien menace seems to be driven by specific events, such as the first alien base assault, rather than the aliens own development agenda as in the original X-Com." ...|$|E

Peter David said this in an interview later: [...] "I’m appreciative of Marvel Comics allowing me so much latitude in X-Factor, particularly Joe Quesada's unequivocal public support when Rictor and Shatterstar first liplocked. I note that the award only names me, and I think that’s shortsighted, because there’s been a host of artists and editors along the way who have done a <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> to bring the stories to the public. And ultimately I {{look forward to the}} day when this award is utterly unnecessary because the positive portrayal of LGBTs is simply so commonplace that it’s no longer newsworthy. It’s just the normal state of things." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{an early}} 1992 article {{published}} in various daily newspapers across America, the author Jerry Buck noted that Ringwald had described the role as [...] "nerve-wracking", however her portrayal of the real life AIDS patient Alison Gertz fulfilled a personal need to combat the disease. Ringwald had stated [...] "I'd been wanting {{to do something to}} help in the fight against AIDS, but I didn't know what to do. I didn't think I would be very good at raising funds, since Madonna and Elizabeth Taylor are doing a <b>terrific</b> <b>job.</b> I wanted to do something to increase public awareness. When the script came along I knew this was it. It shows that AIDS is not just a gay problem and is spreading rapidly among heterosexuals. Young people are very vulnerable because they're experimenting sexually, yet often feel it can't affect them." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film has}} an 82% {{freshness}} rating on Rotten Tomatoes, out of 11 reviews. Roger Ebert praised the film for taking chances by exploring {{the idea of}} a hard-nosed cop learning to respect a woman. He cites the film as [...] "a lot more ambitious than the Dirty Harry movies." [...] Ebert's colleague Gene Siskel also praised the film during their on-air review of the film on At the Movies, crediting the performance of the villain, the relationship between Eastwood and Geneviève Bujold, and Eastwood doing [...] "a <b>terrific</b> <b>job</b> risking his star charisma playing a louse" [...] and also [...] "taking us inside to see what it's really like to abuse women". Janet Maslin concluded that the film [...] "isn't quite top-level Eastwood, but it's close." [...] David Denby compared Eastwood's directing style with that of [...] "Don Siegel's tawdry, urban-anxiety mode, slowed by episodes of rapt erotic stillness", and stated that as actor he [...] "also gave his most complex and forceful performance to date." ...|$|E
