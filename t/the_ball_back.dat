5|$|Buffalo got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> {{at their}} own 21-yard line and were only able to advance it to their 34-yard line before punting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Connecticut. UConn cornerback Jasper Howard {{returned}} the ball 26yards to the Bulls' 41-yard line. The Huskies handed the ball to Donald Brown for five straight running plays, advancing {{the ball to the}} Buffalo 19-yard line as the first quarter clock expired. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, UConn held a 7–3 lead and looked to be in position to score more when the second quarter began.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's post-touchown kickoff, NC State {{began its}} second {{possession}} of the game at its 24-yard line after a short kick return. The NC State's second drive of the game was more successful than its first, but as before, the Wolfpack offense {{ground to a halt}} before penetrating too deeply into Tech territory, and State was forced to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Virginia Tech. The Hokie offense began work at its eight-yard line but went three and out and prepared to punt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to NC State. Tech punter Tony Romero, kicking from the Tech goal line, had his kick blocked by State defender Derrick Taylor. The ball rolled into the Virginia Tech end zone and was recovered by an NC State's Brian Bulluck for a touchdown. The play and extra point tied the game at 77.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball off the kickoff {{on their own}} 28-yard line. Losing eightyards on their threeplays, Buffalo once again punted the ball to Connecticut. UConn drove to the Buffalo 25-yard line and attempted a 42-yard field goal; the kick by Dave Teggart was blocked. Buffalo got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> {{with less than a}} minute left in the quarter and completed twopasses, moving the ball 13yards down the field before the quarter expired. The score remained in Connecticut's favor, 24–20.|$|E

5|$|In the 33rd minute Tommy Smith {{directed}} a high free kick from the centre circle into the penalty area. From Berti Vogts's defensive header, Emlyn Hughes headed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> into the Borussia penalty area. Vogts this time could only direct his header sideways towards Toshack. Toshack headed a knockdown to Keegan who volleyed {{in for a}} 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Louisville {{received}} the post-field goal kickoff, but again went three and out, punting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Virginia Tech. Louisville did {{not pick up}} a first down in the third quarter, and Tech began yet another drive as time ran out in the quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, Tech narrowed the Louisville lead to 17–13.|$|E
5|$|Navy hit paydirt but {{the referee}} found {{something}} illegal and called <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back,</b> {{much to the}} consternation of the Cadet rooters. But on the next play George Hayward kicked a field goal, making the score 14 to 11. Just before the game ended a double pass, Bill Cloke to captain Clarence Stone, carried to ball over the Hopkins goal for the 4 points that won the game.|$|E

50|$|Against Princeton in 1925, Ty once punted <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{from his}} end zone into a gale of wind which blew <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> right <b>back</b> into his arms. The Tigers then threw {{him for a}} safety.|$|R
5|$|Ohio State {{was unable}} to score and gave <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Texas with 13:24 left in the game. Texas was forced to punt. On the Buckeyes' next {{possession}} they drove from their own 30 to the Texas 33 before settling for a sixth field goal attempt by Huston, this one from 50yards out. Huston missed wide left to leave Ohio State still ahead by sixpoints. Texas took over at their own 33with 5:07 left in the game.|$|E
5|$|Warner's {{next two}} years were less fruitful. The 1900 {{football}} team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback Jimmy Johnson would make a lateral pass to the halfback running towards the sideline, bringing the defense {{with him as he}} tossed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to the fast-running Johnson.|$|E
5|$|England {{then started}} their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. Seeing that Lindwall was able to bowl through the pain, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller for the second over to see if Miller could bowl. However, Miller threw <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back,</b> indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E

5|$|Navy {{received}} {{the ball from}} Washington and began to throw it erratically. After gaining several yards, Ira McKee threw an interception near midfield. On the next play, Fred Abel threw a long pass to George Wilson, who was tackled on the Navy 20-yard line after gaining 30yards. Washington brought out their placekicker, Leonard Ziel, to kick a 32-yard field goal, which would have won them the game. Ziel kicked the ball about a yard short of the right upright, giving <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Navy with the game still tied. A few plays later the game ended in a 1414 tie.|$|E
5|$|Norwich {{got back}} into the game against Chelsea with a goal from Anthony Pilkington but conceded two late goals to finish 1–3 to the visitors. This was {{followed}} up with a 4–1 away defeat by Arsenal. The home fixture against Cardiff City finished in controversy during when Leroy Fer put the ball {{in the back of the}} net when passing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to goalkeeper David Marshall. This resulted in a melee in which both Norwich and Cardiff were fined £20,000 by the FA for failing to control their players. The game was also notable with Norwich having 31 shots at goal despite the game finishing as a draw.|$|E
5|$|On Monday Night Football {{against the}} {{defending}} champion Buccaneers, Manning and the Colts trailed 35–14 in the final five minutes. After one short touchdown drive, the Colts recovered the onside kick. Manning threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison on 4th & 6 to make it 35–28. With 1:41 remaining, Manning got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> and drove the offense 85 yards for the game-tying touchdown. He set up the winning 29-yard field goal in overtime for a stunning 38–35 win. It {{was the only time}} in NFL history a team won a game after trailing by 21 points in the final 4 minutes of regulation. Manning passed for 386 yards in the game.|$|E

He also wrote about practising with Small: [...] "International cricketers are not as ordinary men. There might be only two boys fielding, but if you bowled Joe a half-volley outside the off stump, he hit with all his force, though {{he would have to}} wait until <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> came <b>back</b> from 150 yards. Then he would bowl at me for ten minutes." ...|$|R

5|$|On {{the opening}} kickoff {{of the second}} half, Onterio McCalebb scored a {{touchdown}} on an 83-yard return to cut the Alabama lead to 24–14. Alabama responded on their next possession with a 28-yard Shelley field goal for a 27–14 lead entering the fourth quarter. On the third play of the fourth quarter, Auburn's Clint Moseley threw an interception to DeMarcus Milliner that was returned 35-yards for a touchdown and after a successful two-point conversion, Alabama led 35–14. After getting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> on downs late in the quarter, Jalston Fowler scored on a 15-yard touchdown run, to cap a drive that included a 57-yard Richardson run, and made the final score 42–14.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} play from scrimmage, Zack Bowman intercepted Manning's pass {{intended}} for Rueben Randle at New York's 36-yard line {{and reached the}} 12-yard line, but Jay Cutler threw an incomplete pass to Brandon Marshall on fourth-and-two, giving <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to the Giants. On the eventual drive for the Giants, Tim Jennings intercepted Manning and scored the first touchdown of the night on a 48-yard interception return. The Giants eventually scored on Brandon Jacobs' 4-yard run after an 80-yard drive. On the Bears' next possession, Marshall scored on a 10-yard touchdown catch, which New York answered with Randle's 37-yard touchdown reception. Afterwards, Marshall caught a 3-yard pass to increase the score to 21–14, which was extended by Robbie Gould's 40-yard field goal with two seconds remaining in the half. On the first possession of the second half, Gould scored on a 52-yarder, his twelfth-consecutive 50+-yard field goal, tying Viking Blair Walsh's record. New York later engineered a 91-yard drive, which ended in Jacobs scoring on a 1-yard run. Jacobs ended the night with 106 rushing yards, his first 100-yard rushing game since week fourteen of 2011. After getting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back,</b> the Giants reached the Bears' 35-yard line, but with 1:35 to go, Manning's pass to Brandon Myers was overthrown, and was tipped off his fingers towards Jennings for Manning's third interception of the night. The Bears ran out the clock to claim the victory, snap their two-game losing streak and gave the Giants their first 0–6 start since 1976.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974. In the game, two players each control paddles {{on either side}} of a volleyball net, with a ball dropped {{from the top of the}} screen. The players bounce <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> and forth across the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half of the screen, with the trajectory of the ball dependent on where it strikes the paddle. The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points, depending on the game settings.|$|E

5|$|Tech's {{first drive}} began inauspiciously for the Hokies. Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} {{pass on the}} first Tech play, then was sacked for a four-yard loss. Facing third down, Druckenmiller evaded another sack and connected with Oxendine on a 41-yard pass that picked up a first down and pushed Tech into the Nebraska side of the field. Despite the gain, the Hokies were unable to gain another first down as Oxendine ran for one yard before Druckenmiller threw two successive incomplete passes. Virginia Tech punter Jimmy Kibble kicked <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Nebraska, which returned it to its 15-yard line, and the Nebraska offense returned to the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 1931–32, Arsenal {{reached the}} FA Cup final again, losing controversially to Newcastle United. Arsenal had led 1–0 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's equaliser {{came after a}} long ball had gone over the goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> into play and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies; Allen scored again {{in the second half}} to win the match 2–1. Arsenal's pain was {{compounded by the fact that}} Everton had pipped them to the League title; a poor start to the 1931–32 campaign meant Arsenal played catch-up for most of the season, finishing two points adrift.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of play began with Virginia Tech {{receiving}} the ball, going three and out, and punting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Louisville. The Cardinals reciprocated by also going three and out and punting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Virginia Tech. The Hokies began their second drive of the quarter at their one-yard line. Despite beginning deep in their own end of the field, Virginia Tech mounted a successful drive. Tailback Branden Ore and quarterback Marcus Vick alternated rushes, picking up 18yards and a first down. After Vick was sacked by the Louisville defense, he recovered by throwing a 29-yard pass for another first down. Following the pass, Vick and Ore rushed for six consecutive plays, alternating carries at various intervals. Inside the Louisville red zone, however, the Cardinals' defense stiffened and the Tech offense began to falter. After Tech successfully gained a first down on fourth and one, the Hokies were unable to gain another. Tech kicker Brandon Pace was forced to make his second field goal of the game, this one a 28-yarder, to make the game 17–13 with 2:52 remaining in the quarter. The Tech drive began with 11:17 remaining in the quarter and took eight minutes and 25seconds off the clock.|$|E
