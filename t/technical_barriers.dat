5|$|According to Julien Merceron, the Worldwide Technology Director for Square Enix in {{the early}} 2010s, the concept for the new engine was born in 2011 {{while he was in}} the final stages of working on Final Fantasy XIII-2. This was a {{difficult}} period for Square Enix: the project then known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII was hitting <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> as it transitioned to open world environments its original Crystal Tools engine could not handle, and Final Fantasy XIV had met with a disastrous launch due to development and technical problems. Faced with these issues, Square Enix decided to bring in former developers from Sega to create new engines for their products, including Luminous Studio. Talking about sharing the engine, Merceron said that he advised the company to avoid sharing between companies or internally between games until the engine had been finalized with the released game: this resulted in Luminous Studio being restricted to what would become Final Fantasy XV during development, while other major next-generation titles would use other outsourced engines.|$|E

2500|$|The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures—also {{known as}} the SPS Agreement—was {{negotiated}} during the Uruguay Round of GATT, and entered into force {{with the establishment of}} the WTO at the beginning of 1995. Under the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on members' policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides, inspection and labelling) as well as animal and plant health (imported pests and diseases). The Agreement on <b>Technical</b> <b>Barriers</b> to Trade is an international treaty of the World Trade Organization. It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the end of 1994. The object ensures that technical negotiations and standards, as well as testing and certification procedures, do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade".

Chiefly, it adopts the [...] "transaction value" [...] approach.|$|E
2500|$|While the [...] "social market economy" [...] {{concept was}} only put into EU law in 2007, free {{movement}} and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957. The standard theory of comparative advantage says two countries can both benefit from trade {{even if one}} of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, EU law breaks down barriers to trade, by creating rights to free movement of goods, services, labour and capital. This is meant to reduce consumer prices and raise living standards. Early theorists argued a free trade area would give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. But in Europe those stages were mixed, and it is unclear whether the [...] "endgame" [...] should be the same as a state. Free trade, without rights to ensure fair trade, can benefit some groups within countries (particularly big business) more than others, and disadvantages people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. For this reason, the European has become [...] "not merely an economic union", but creates binding social rights for people to [...] "ensure social progress and seek the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their peoples". The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These [...] "four freedoms" [...] were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), <b>technical</b> <b>barriers</b> (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). Free movement and trade is not meant to be a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. Increasingly, the Treaties and the Court of Justice aim to ensure free trade serves higher values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement.|$|E

40|$|We derive {{a method}} to econometrically {{estimate}} the tariff equivalent and foregone trade effects of a prohibitive <b>technical</b> <b>barrier</b> to trade (TBT) based on Wales and Woodland's Kuhn-Tucker approach to corner solutions in consumer choice. The method overcomes the lack of observed data on bilateral trade flows and accounts for differentiated goods by place of origin. We apply the derived random utility model to international trade in apples to identify the tariff equivalent of prohibitive nontariff trade barriers imposed by Australia on potential imports of New Zealand apples. We estimate the forgone apple trade between the two countries, the implied trade injury imposed by Australia on New Zealand, and the welfare loss to Australia. The removal of the TBTs would induce net welfare gains around US$ 50 million annually for Australia.

30|$|A {{commonly}} concerned {{issue is}} whether mandatory COOL of the main ingredient would be a <b>technical</b> <b>barrier</b> to trade for developing countries. Since developing countries usually produce primary materials but do not manufacture foods with ingredients imported from other countries, mandatory origin indication of the main ingredient on the label of a finished product should not directly influence the customs procedures for the export of primary materials from a developing country if main ingredient traceability is not mandatory. Otherwise, mandatory traceability would become a <b>technical</b> <b>barrier</b> to trade for the developing country. To avoid the possible protectionism, traceability systems should not be mandatory when the originating place of the main ingredient indicated on the label of a finished product is a developing country. Proposing such a policy would also take into consideration that the statement of origin from a developing country {{is less likely to}} involve fraudulent practice.|$|R
