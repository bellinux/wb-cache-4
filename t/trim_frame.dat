5000|$|Meigs County paid $5,215 {{to build}} the {{courthouse}} — $15 to buy the blueprints for the Scioto County Courthouse, and $5,200 for construction of a building virtually {{identical to the one}} in Scioto County. [...] The three-story courthouse is a Greek Revival structure featuring elements such as a pedimented entrance with Doric columns, decorative pilasters, a bracketed cornice, and a circular central tower with a dome and windowed cupola. [...] It is primarily built of brick, although carven stone <b>trim</b> <b>frames</b> the arched windows. [...] Because downtown Pomeroy lies on a narrow strip of land between the Ohio River and steep cliffs, the courthouse was built against the cliffs. By 1877, insufficient interior space forced the construction of wings along the hillside to house additional offices, along with spiral staircases, the columns, and the Italianate-influenced cornice on the tower. In order to permit fuller use of the existing portions of the building, workers excavated the street to the same level as the basement. [...] Existing hilly land around the wings permitted the construction of at-grade entrances to all three floors of the courthouse.|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} is a 132 by 326 ft complex of three buildings located at Pratt Street and Pier 4 at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. The structures are brick with terra cotta <b>trim</b> and steel <b>frame</b> construction. It was built between 1900 and 1909 {{and is a}} massive industrial structure with Neo-Classical detailing designed by the noted architectural firm of Baldwin & Pennington.

5000|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} a bungalow/craftsman, Gothic Revival style with the finished dimensions approximately 37 feet by 67 feet. With the 1907 fire still fresh in their minds, the congregation chose the slightly higher cost of a brick structure as opposed to wood. The building is somewhat asymmetrical in nature and sits atop a raised basement. [...] When designing the interior, Irwin Dunbar chose some features that reflected not only a blend of Craftsman and Gothic Revival styles, but his own background as an engineer. Most notable of those are the open beam ceiling in the nave, constructed of black walnut. These trusses provided support for the heavy English tile roof, yet kept the worship area free of cumbersome columns. Black walnut was used extensively throughout the interior for <b>trim,</b> window <b>frames,</b> and other ancillary features.|$|R

An even rarer feature were the vertical, narrow black lines, which separated knob groups in the control panel. This cosmetic detail (later referred to as [...] "blackline") was quickly abandoned. All of the Silverface amps generally had blue labels on the face plate, but in some rare exceptions (such as the Bronco) the colour was red instead.

5000|$|In July 1983 Maserati {{launched}} the sporting Biturbo S, for the Italian market only. Power was up 25 PS to [...] at 6500 rpm, thanks to increased turbo boost and twin intercoolers fed fresh air by two NACA ducts in the bonnet. The chassis was updated too with lowered suspension and new, wider 6½Jx14" [...] magnesium alloy wheels, painted gunmetal grey with silver center and lip. The S was recognizable by its black mesh grille and the external <b>trim</b> (grille <b>frame,</b> headlight housings, window surround and Maserati badges on the C-pillar) finished {{in a dark}} bronze shade instead of chrome.The customer could only choose between two paint schemes: silver or red, both paired to {{the lower half of}} the body in contrasting metallic gunmetal grey. That same year the 2.5-litre Biturbo 2500 or Biturbo E (for Export) was also introduced, and was joined some twelve months later by the Biturbo ES with , respectively in European- or catalysed US-specification. In 1985 all models received updates and were renamed Biturbo II, Biturbo S II and Biturbo E II. The cylinders were now Nikasil-coated, a more capacious fuel tank was fitted and a Sensitork limited slip differential replaced the earlier Salisbury clutch-type one. The second series Biturbo was recognizable by its new 6"Jx14" [...] wheels similar in design to the Biturbo S's; the S II wheels had fully painted faces, without the silver center.|$|R

For 1970, it added a silver rear trim panel and a 'by Chrysler' boot lid badge to the Hunter saloon and introduced the estate although this had a lower specification than the saloon - an iron head 1725 cc engine, no automatic option, simpler dashboard trim (no locking glovebox), interior door pull handles instead of armrests (sedans had them on the three passenger doors), painted rather than bright metal door window <b>frame</b> <b>trim</b> and fixed rather than opening front quarter-lights.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} silverface Twin Reverbs, {{along with}} all other silverface models, had an aluminum <b>frame</b> (<b>trim)</b> surrounding the sparkling blue grillcloth from late 1967 to 1969. Early silverface amplifiers made between 1967 and 1968 had black lines on the brushed aluminum faceplate, still retaining the '60s [...] "tailed" [...] design on the amp logo, installed on the upper {{left side of the}} grillcloth. This feature was offered on models produced prior to the [...] "tailless" [...] period in 1973. Some later models came with an unusual silver grillcloth with sparkling orange threads ("orange sparkle"); a black grillcloth was even fitted on some production runs. During the silverface period, the Twin Reverb's chassis and AA769 circuit was shared by the Dual Showman Reverb, effectively producing the Twin Reverb in a head form, although the matching speaker cabinet for the Dual Showman Reverb sported a pair of 15-inch JBL speakers rather than 12-inch.|$|R
5000|$|The sales {{approach}} for the Opel {{line in the}} U.S. market was equally unusual. The Manta A {{was one of only}} a few Opel models sold in the U.S. Opels were imported by GM and sold through Buick dealerships and not their own dealership network, so they were limited in what makes and models they could sell there. Other Opel models sold in the U.S. were the 1956-1961 the Rekord P1 and Rekord P2, the Kadett A (1964-1966), Kadett B (1967-1971), GT (1969-1973), and the Manta / Ascona A (1971-1975). The Ascona A was the saloon version on the Manta A chassis and was sold in the U.S. under the [...] "1900" [...] name as a two-door and four-door saloon, and as a two-door [...] "sport wagon". The only difference between the Ascona and Manta was exterior sheet metal, glass and <b>trim.</b> The <b>frame,</b> all the mechanicals, dash, front seats, and many other parts were shared between the cars. The Manta was even sold as the [...] "1900 sport coupé" [...] in 1971 and 1972, rather than as the [...] "Manta". In 1973, the Manta nameplate was added to the U.S.-spec Mantas, but the Asconas kept the 1900 badge throughout their model life. The last year GM imported European-made Opels into the United States, under their marque, was 1975. In that year the only Opels imported were the Manta and Ascona A.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has a central atrium, from which develops for each wing a corridor arranged in the longitudinal direction that articulates with compartments oriented {{to the northern}} and southern facades, generally with ceilings differently decorated with stuccoes.

The partially buried floor, is defined by thick walls (corresponding to the foundations and the primitive zone of the construction), deserves attention since it includes an edge vault with a well.

40|$|Please {{read the}} {{instructions}} completely, and acquaint yourself {{with all the}} drawings. Inventory the parts. Besides the shells, chassis, motor, frame, and power truck, locate the following: side and rear glazing sheets, truck frames, decal sheet, photo-etched sheet, front and rear lenses, and one bag each of wheels, screws, metal parts, plastic parts, and electrical connectors. If you find any part unsatisfactory, or if you damage any part during assembly, please return it directly to FINE N-SCALE. We will repair or replace it at no charge. If you are doing a later version, we have mars light castings and unshrouded truck frames available. Simply write and ask for the mars lights, and return the shrouded trucks to us. We will send the unshrouded replacements at no charge. We suggest using Pacer's PLASTI-ZAP for assembly. Use sparingly, applying it with a sharpened piece of styrene or toothpick. Trial fit parts before assembly, and above all, BE PATIENT! No extraordinary skills are necessary to build this kit, but patience will be your best helper. Motor Assembly. Clip the coupler pocket off the power truck assembly and <b>trim</b> the side <b>frames</b> per the diagram. (Do not trim the sideframes if you are building an unshrouded, 1954 or later version) Trim out the rear mounting holes on the metal side frames. Press the large styrene spacer on the geared end of the motor. Complete the motor assembly per the diagram, making sure the white dot on the motor is up, the traction tire is on the front axle, and the spacers between the frames don't interfere with the gear or motor shaft.
