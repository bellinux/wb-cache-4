5|$|The September 2008 attacks had {{political}} significance, {{given that}} the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Karnataka state government, led by B. S. Yeddyurappa, were also accused of involvement and backing the anti-Christian campaigns and that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> reported to have had knowledge of the imminent attacks but failed to prevent them. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> criticised for their reaction to the protests and a report by a committee of human rights activists {{set up in the}} aftermath to examine the causes of the attacks claimed that they had used the event as a pretext to assault the community, rather than defend it. Justice B. K. Somasekhara of Karnataka, however, concluded that the police and government helped maintain order and were not responsible for the attacks. In response to the alleged forcible conversions of involvement, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) gave a three-month deadline for New Life Fellowship Trust (NLFT) to stop all conversion activities in Mangalore. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Mangalore declared that it would distance itself from the New Life Fellowship Trust.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} based on an {{analysis}} of approximately 400 pieces of news from Swedish media, in which <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>are</b> narrated, constructed and assessed. A number of obvious patterns <b>were</b> found: <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>are</b> highly news worthy and <b>police</b> reporting <b>is</b> routine in all news media. The news pieces are chiefly so called “straight” news, value neutral descriptions of the everyday work of <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> About seven out of ten stories are neutral descriptions, a fifth (18 per cent) are negative news, while explicitly positive values are found in thirteen per cent of the material. The negative stories deals mainly either with individual police officers who have engaged in criminal activity, with insufficient resources or the allegedly defunct organization. Critically scrutinizing news is hardly found at all. The typical news media image of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>is</b> that of <b>the</b> <b>police,</b> or <b>the</b> <b>police</b> officer, simply doing their job. One of the most important conclusions in the study <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> – together with reporters – decide the news agenda. As news source <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>are</b> hardly ever regarded as questionable, nor is the world view of <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>are</b> allowed to define situations, problems as well as solutions – <b>police</b> discernments <b>are</b> self-evident and authoritative. In the news it <b>is</b> obvious that <b>the</b> <b>police</b> itself <b>are</b> “the expert on the police”. Hereby, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> itself do part of the news work...|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} {{was no longer}} regarded as being adequate {{to function as a}} courthouse by 1840, during the Government of Sir Henry Bouverie, and that year the Civil Courts were moved to Auberge d'Auvergne.

Court archives and documents of registrations of the Castellania were relocated for safekeeping in the auberge.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operation}} {{involving the}} 6th Airlanding Brigade followed two attacks by the Palmach on coastguard stations over {{the night of}} 24/25November. Palestine Police Force dogs tracked the attackers to the settlements of Rishpon and Sidna Ali. In the following cordon and search operation, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> stoned by the inhabitants, and the soldiers on the cordon had to prevent reinforcements from other settlements reaching the villages. The next day, 26November, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> involved in hand-to-hand fighting with the villagers and eventually withdrew, calling on the brigade to enter the settlements and enforce law and order. Leaving some men behind on the cordon {{to hold back the}} estimated 3,000 crowd, the remainder of the brigade entered the settlements. Here they carried out several baton charges {{and for the first time}} used tear gas to disperse the crowds. In the cleanup operation, 900 persons were later arrested.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> {{satisfied}} with the new story, and both The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Georgian gave the story front-page coverage. Three officials of the pencil company were not convinced and said so to the Journal. They contended that Conley had followed another employee into the building, intending to rob her, but found Phagan was an easier target. The police placed little credence in the officials' theory, but had no explanation for the failure to locate Phagan's purse that other witnesses had testified she carried that day. They were also concerned that Conley did not mention that he was aware a crime had been committed when he wrote the notes, suggesting Frank had simply dictated the notes to Conley arbitrarily. To resolve their doubts, the police attempted on May 28 to arrange a confrontation between Frank and Conley. Frank exercised his right not to meet without his attorney, who was out of town. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> quoted in The Atlanta Constitution saying that this refusal was an indication of Frank's guilt, and the meeting never took place.|$|E

5|$|In February 1857 the Chelmsford Chronicle {{reported}} that £10 in silver {{had been stolen}} from Golding Spearman, keeper of the Tilbury Fort canteen. When <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> unable to identify the culprit, Spearman turned to Murrell, who asserted that he would place a spell on the thief which {{would result in the}} return of the money. Shortly after, a soldier discovered the stolen money and returned it to Spearman, who attributed its retrieval to Murrell.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, a Lebanese man was {{detained}} by Cyprus police on possible charges relating to terrorism laws for planning attacks against Israeli tourists. According to security officials, {{the man was}} planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> alerted about the man due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying {{back and forth from}} Cyprus, and planned to blow up a plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Many popular novels were {{published}} about the mounted police from 1885 onwards, {{and in the}} 20th century over 250 films were made, along with radio and television portrayals. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> depicted as courageous, disciplined and chivalrous, displaying a sense of fair-play as they brought their suspects to justice. Historians, working from initially limited public records and chronicles, wrote similarly eulogistic accounts of the mounted police, but as new archives became available in the 1970s, more critical and analytic accounts of the force were produced. The force heavily influenced public perceptions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which used the North-West Mounted Police's image and history {{to help make the}} modern police a popular Canadian national symbol.|$|E

Various English towns and villages were renamed, with Puddlecombe becoming Littlegate, and Eastbury becoming Eastdown, while Scottish pub Ye Dolphin was renamed The Kiltoch Arms. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> no longer depicted as carrying guns, as was accurate, while the journalists Christopher Willoughby-Drupe and Marco Rizotto, who had first appeared in The Castafiore Emerald (1963), were retroactively added into the background of one scene.|$|E

5|$|The deposed Sultan made an {{unsuccessful}} appeal to Kenya and Tanganyika for military assistance, although Tanganyika sent 100 paramilitary {{police officers to}} Zanzibar to contain rioting. Other than the Tanganyika Rifles (formerly the colonial King's African Rifles), <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> the only armed force in Tanganyika, and on 20 January the police absence led the entire Rifles regiment to mutiny. Dissatisfied with their low pay rates and with the slow progress of the replacement of their British officers with Africans, the soldiers' mutiny sparked similar uprisings in both Uganda and Kenya. However, order on the African mainland was rapidly restored without serious incident by the British Army and Royal Marines.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on “a couple of incidents” that the writers had heard about in which {{troublesome}} children, through alternative sentencing, were tethered to their parents. The scene in which Homer and Marge get spanked by Springfield's citizens {{as part of their}} punishment was also based on an alternative sentencing, in which the sentenced had to wear certain shirts or signs that indicated whether they, for example, had not paid taxes. The scene in which Bart accidentally drives away with Chief Wiggum's police car {{was based on}} one of Scully's friends in high school, who stole a still running police car parked at a Dunkin' Donuts while <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> in the store.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the day started early in the morning when skirmishes broke out in a bar, which led to an Arsenal fan being stabbed.

The Galatasaray fans were later attacked from behind by members of British hooligan firms seeking revenge for the Istanbul stabbings. Despite deploying 2,000 officers to the area and having prior warning of potential trouble, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>were</b> unable to control the riot until they fired tear gas at the rioters. This led to 19 injuries, including 4 stabbings, and 60 arrests with similar events occurring in England and Turkey {{in the aftermath of the}} riots.|$|E
