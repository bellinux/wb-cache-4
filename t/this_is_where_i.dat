5|$|By December 2008, {{the writers}} had written three drafts of the {{screenplay}} and Warner {{was preparing for}} pre-production. However, Berlanti was forced to vacate the director's position when Warner Bros. attached him to <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> Leave You, and in February 2009, Martin Campbell entered negotiations to direct. The release date was set as December 2010, before being moved to June 17, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Fey starred {{alongside}} Paul Rudd in {{the romantic}} comedy-drama film Admission, {{based on the}} Jean Hanff Korelitz novel by the same name. The film was directed by Paul Weitz. Fey later starred in the 2014 comedy-drama <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> Leave You, helmed by Date Night director Shawn Levy. As {{was the case with}} Baby Mama, although both of these films received generally mixed reviews, Fey's performances were well received by film critics.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Fonda {{had a small}} role in The Butler, portraying First Lady Nancy Reagan.

60|$|This sounded all right. Goodness knows I am no snob, and can rough it when required, but I do like comfort when {{it comes}} my way, {{and it seemed to}} me that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> got it. And I liked the boy. He was the right sort.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{more recent}} titles such as Still Waters and <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> Came In {{were among the}} first batch of re-releases. The band's three Warner Bros. releases, E. S. P., One and High Civilisation were also made {{available}} on iTunes {{for the first time since}} the albums went out of print in North America in the mid-90s. According to Robin Gibb's website, three more reissues were planned for the 2008 holiday season: Best of Bee Gees, Best of Bee Gees, Volume 2 and Love Songs. The double album Odessa was released on 13 January 2009 in a special 3-disc deluxe edition complete with the original red velvet cover with remastered stereo and mono versions of the album as well as alternate versions and unreleased tracks.|$|E
500|$|Zakuani was {{eligible}} {{to play for}} both Congo and England. He considers London his hometown but still sees himself as Congolese. Of his five siblings, , his older brother Gabriel Zakuani plays for English club Northampton Town {{and is a member}} of the Congolese national team. He might have been able to play for the United States if granted citizenship. He expressed interest in representing the Congolese national team early in his professional career, but considered his chances of playing for England [...] "a long shot". Later in his career, he expressed interest in playing for the United States, saying, [...] "of the three, I prefer the States as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> made my name as a player".|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] {{translates}} to [...] "The Beautiful Island" [...] in English. The song has four lines sung in Spanish, a theme which Madonna later incorporated in her 1987 single [...] "Who's That Girl". The lyrics begin by describing Madonna {{as a tourist}} who prays [...] "that the days would last, they went so fast" [...] simultaneously isolating the other Latin people as them ("you can watch them go by"). In her book Women and popular music, author Sheila Whiteley said that the chorus of the song places its emphasis on the incantatory present participle ("Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> long to be"). The song draws connotations from the supplicant before its explicit focus on the chorus.|$|E
60|$|And then {{suddenly}} I had the great idea.

5000|$|A {{letter to}} the faculty reads, [...] "Perhaps because my family lived here...I knew <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> would <b>be.</b> I always saw the faculty and staff as a gestalt. it was our {{personal}} responsibility to make each one not only look good, but be good as artists and teachers. It was important to make the Theatre {{live up to its}} potential with the university and the students. To me, this meant being a part of the university as a whole and to serve it." ...|$|R
6000|$|And <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> did {{the fatal}} thing. It {{happened}} that, just before I took up [...] "Braid on the Push-Shot," [...] I had been dipping {{into the current}} number of a magazine, {{and one of the}} advertisements, I chanced to remember, might have been framed with a special eye to George's unfortunate case. It was that one, which I have no doubt you have seen, which treats of [...] "How to Become a Convincing Talker". I picked up this magazine now and handed it to George.|$|R
500|$|In 1982, she {{released}} her first exercise video, Jane Fonda's Workout, {{which became the}} highest-selling video of the time. It {{would be the first}} of 22 workout videos released by her over the next 13 years which would collectively sell over 17 million copies. Divorced from second husband Tom Hayden, she married billionaire media mogul Ted Turner in 1991 and retired from acting. Fonda was divorced from Turner in 2001. She returned to acting with her first film in 15 years, the 2005 comedy Monster in Law. Subsequent films have included Georgia Rule (2007), The Butler (2013), <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> Leave You (2014) and Youth (2015). [...] In 2009, she returned to Broadway after a 45-year absence, in the play 33 Variations, which earned her a Tony Award nomination, while her recurring role in the HBO drama series The Newsroom (2012–2014), has earned her two Emmy Award nominations. She also released another five exercise videos between 2010 and 2012. She stars with Lily Tomlin, Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen in the Netflix original series Grace and Frankie, which premiered in 2015.|$|E
500|$|This {{storm of}} {{publicity}} caused {{a flurry of}} activity as readers around France scrambled to obtain the novel. Balzac's friend and La Caricature editor Charles Philipon wrote to the author one week after publication: [...] "there is no getting hold of La Peau de chagrin. Grandville had to stop everything to read it, because the librarian sent round every half-hour {{to ask if he}} had finished." [...] Friends near and far wrote to Balzac indicating their similar difficulties in locating copies. The second edition was released one month later, and it was followed by parodies and derivative works from other writers. Balzac's friend Théophile Gautier included a comical homage in his 1833 story collection Les Jeunes-France when, during a recreation of the feast from Balzac's novel, a character says: [...] "This is the point at which I'm supposed to pour wine down my waistcoat... It says so in black and white on page 171 of La Peau de chagrin... And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> have to toss a 100-sou coin in the air {{to see whether or not}} there's a God." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2010, it was {{announced}} that three new characters; Doug Harris (Mahesh Jadu), Michael Williams (Sandy Winton) and Natasha Williams were to join Neighbours in the following months. Novakovic, a performing arts college graduate, was cast in the role of Natasha. The actress had been studying architecture at university, before she chose to move into acting. Shortly after her casting {{was announced}}, Novakovic revealed that the role of Natasha was her first acting job and that while she would always be interested in architecture, she really wanted to enjoy the experience on Neighbours. Novakovic moved from Sydney to Melbourne, where Neighbours is filmed, for the role. She is three years older than the character she portrays. In 2011, Novakovic revealed she is still happy with the career choice she made, stating [...] "I enjoy what I'm doing now a lot more than studying, because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> want to be. [...] The best thing for me is that I enjoy going to work every day and have some great friends there, including the crew. It's awesome to do something you love every single day." ...|$|E

500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{industrial}} metal band Head of David {{had played}} live with Napalm Death before. Their drummer left and Broadrick {{was invited to}} take his place. [...] "I was in Head of David literally six weeks, and we did a John Peel session for Radio One. That was the first highlight of my life", Justin says. He had been writing more brutal songs for the band, but due to artistic differences, he was kicked out in 1988. [...] "When I first got exposed in '89 to the early acid house movement, I was an instant convert.

[...] Minver's brother glanced round at us and gathered the harvest of our approving smiles. [...] "I said to her, 'I've been having a wedding present.' 'Well,' she said, 'you've come as near having no use for a wedding present as anybody I know. Was having a wedding present what made you so gloomy at supper? Who gave it to you, anyway?' 'Old Blakey.' 'A painting?' 'Yes--a sketch.' 'What of?' <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> qualified. I said: 'Oh, just one of those Sorrento things of his.' You see, if I told her that it <b>was</b> the villa <b>where</b> we first met, and then said I had left it in the horse-car, she would take it as proof positive that I did not really care anything about her or I never could have forgotten it." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2001, {{the group}} {{released}} {{what turned out}} to be their final album of new material as a group, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> Came In. The album was another success, reaching the Top 10 in the UK (being certified Gold), and the Top 20 in the US. The title track was also a UK Top 20 hit single. The album gave each member of the group a chance to write in his own way, as well as composing songs together.

2500|$|Due to Halo being a first-person shooter, {{significant}} {{emphasis was}} put into the design of human weaponry. The chief designer for human weapons was Robt McLees, {{who at the time}} of Combat Evolveds development was the only staff member at Bungie with knowledge of firearms; McLees {{wanted to make sure that}} the weapons looked [...] "cool", but were also grounded by real-world physics and considerations. The game designers also [...] wanted items that would be recognizable to players, yet futuristic-looking enough to plausibly exist in Halos 2552. In an interview, McLees noted that after human weapons had been vetted and the rough design worked out, [...] "I went ahead and built the highest-res LOD (level of detail) – and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> get [...] "bogged down" [...] with all of the stuff that [...] "nobody cares about" [...] like correct barrel diameter, placement of safeties, sights, magazine release buttons, and making sure that the magazines are actually large enough to hold all the bullets they're supposed to, that they would feed correctly and that the casings eject out of the correct side of the gun." [...] Occasionally, technical restraints forced design changes; the submachine gun introduced in Halo 2 originally featured a transparent magazine which allowed players to see the caseless ammo feed into the gun, but it proved too ambitious given the time and hardware available.|$|E
