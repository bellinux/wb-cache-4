50|$|In the {{development}} of the vertebrate nervous system, specific cues are instrumental in guiding the growing axons. The axons of motor neurons and sensory neurons develop from the neural tube region and through each of successive somite’s anterior. The 180 degree antero-posterior rotation of the neural <b>tube</b> <b>segment</b> about the somites shows that segmentation is not an intrinsic phenomenon in the neural tube. This was done by experiments involving the rotation of neural tube relative to the somitic mesoderm to position it opposite to the anterior and posterior half of the somite. These studies showed the confinement of the growth of axons to the anterior portion of the somite proving the lack of intrinsic segmentation. A 180 degree antero-posterior rotation of the somitic mesoderm, keeping the neural tube unperturbed, showed the confinement of axonal growth to the original anterior half of the somites thus showing how neural segmentation results from somites. As a matter of fact, it has been experimentally proven that as the embryonic axis is unable to regulate positional distortions, it is vital to have antero-posterior distinction clearly determined prior to or during the process of somite segmentation. The confinement of axonal growth to the anterior half derives itself from the special properties of the somites as only anterior cells allow the growth of axons and posterior cells inhibit it. Even though the later axons are seen to emerge opposite to the posterior half-sclerotomes initially and turn towards the anterior half-sclerotome later during development, the first axons from the neural tube emerge opposite to the anterior half-sclerotome only.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Current space launch is {{expensive}} and low-efficient because the invalid load [...] rocket and fuel in it occupies over 80 % {{of the total}} launch weight. A solution to reduce the space launch cost and increase the launch efficiency is to construct the evacuated tube, pump air out from the tube and have the maglev vehicle loaded with the spacecraft run in it; the spacecraft fly out the tube when the maglev is accelerated to ultra-speed, e. g. 5 km/s even 8 km/s in the tube. By this way, the first class of the rocket could be saved, so that the launch cost would be low and lead the large scale space exploitation to become reality in the soon future. As for the tube construction, the route layout should be concerned on at first. Because of the engineering restriction, the height at the tube end wouldn’t be very high, and the embedding depth wouldn’t be very deep, practically about 8 km. However, the tube length will be 700 km at least, a completely straight tube or a completely curve tube (on a single circle) would lead a too small launch angle. Thus {{both of them are}} not feasible. Reasonable tube routes in vertical section will include two or more than two segments, for example, a straight <b>tube</b> <b>segment</b> and a curve <b>tube</b> <b>segment,</b> or two or more than two curve segments in different radius or different curve direction. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{model the}} {{evolution}} of buoyant magnetic flux tubes in the Sun's convection zone. A flux tube is assumed to lie initially {{near the top of}} the stably stratified radiative core below the convection zone, but a segment of it is perturbed into the convection zone by gradual heating and convective overshoot motions. The ends ("footpoints") of the segment remain anchored at the base of the convection zone, and if the segment is sufficiently long, it may be buoyantly unstable, rising through the convection zone in a short time. The length of the flux tube determines the ratio of buoyancy to magnetic tension: short loops of flux are arrested before reaching the top of the convection zone, while longer loops emerge to erupt through the photosphere. Using Spruit's convection zone model, we compute the minimum footpoint separation $L_c$ required for erupting flux tubes. We explore the dependence of $L_c$ on the initial thermal state of the perturbed flux <b>tube</b> <b>segment</b> and on its initial magnetic field strength. Following an investigation of thermal diffusion time scales and the dynamic rise times of unstable flux tube segments, we conclude that the most likely origin for magnetic flux which erupts to the surface is from short length scale perturbations ($L < L_c$) which are initially stable, but which are subsequently destabilized either by diffusion of heat into the tube or by stretching of the anchor points until $L$ just exceeds $L_c$. In either case, the separation of the anchor points of the emergent tube should lie between the critical distance for a tube in mechanical equilibrium and one in thermal equilibrium. Finally, after comparing the dispersion of dynamic rise times with the much shorter observed active region formation time scales, we conclude that active regions form from the emergence of a single flux <b>tube</b> <b>segment.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aspect ratio}} of {{submerged}} floating tunnel (SFT), i. e. the ratio of length to diameter, is usually as large as 102 to 103, which means the behavior of SFT would like a slender cylinder restrained by tethers. Although SFT is usually placed under the water surface at a certain depth, surface wave has important influence on its dynamic response due to the slenderness. This paper performs analyses on the fluid-structure interaction of SFT in wave field. Potential fluid theory is adopted to describe the wave field. Boundary element method is used to solve the interaction between SFT and surface wave. Wave potential {{is divided into three}} parts, including incident wave potential, diffraction wave potential and radiation wave potential.

40|$|In {{partitioned}} {{simulations of}} fluid-structure interaction (FSI), the flow equations and the structural equations are solved with separate solvers. If {{the interaction between}} the flow and the flexible structure is strong, coupling iterations between both solvers have to be performed in each time step. In previous work, a Fourier stability analysis of Gauss-Seidel coupling iterations was presented for the unsteady, incompressible flow in a straight flexible tube. The error on the displacement of the fluid-structure interface during the coupling iterations was decomposed as a sum of Fourier modes. Subsequently, the amplification of each Fourier error mode was determined analytically as a function of a dimensionless time step tau and a dimensionless stiffness kappa. However, the structural model in this analysis was an independent-rings model without inertia. Recently, this Fourier stability analysis has been extended with a more complex structural model. The structural inertia and {{the interaction between the}} <b>tube</b> <b>segments</b> are now taken into account. It has been observed that the interaction between the <b>tube</b> <b>segments</b> reduces the amplification factor of the Fourier error modes compared to the independent-rings model. Moreover, the number of unstable modes is only influenced by tau for a range of tau if the structural inertia is substantial while it increases indefinitely as tau decreases if the structural inertia is negligible. These tendencies are confirmed by numerical experiments with the quasi-Newton IQN-ILS algorithm. As expected, numerical experiments with Gauss-Seidel iterations for the entire range of tau are impossible due to the presence of unstable modes. In conclusion, the stability analysis of coupling iterations in partitioned FSI simulations is strongly influenced by the structural model...|$|R
