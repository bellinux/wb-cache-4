25|$|Originally Edwin {{planned to}} launch five stores in key cities like London, but {{although}} they signed an initial deal on 4 June 1990 that was ratified that October, Edwin did not {{gain control of}} the Fiorucci assets until May 1992. In fact they would later lose the rights to the Fiorucci name in Canada on the grounds of disuse. However, one of Edwin's first acts was a deal with Coles Myer that would see 68 Fiorucci concessions in stores across Australia. They opened a new store in Piazza San Babila, Milan in early 1993, that included a variety of branded boutiques. It took them longer <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> going in North America, after a 1993 deal with Mary Ann Wheaton of Wheaton International fell through. In 1995 they licensed the rights for eyewear in the US to Swan International Optical, and then opened a US office in September 1997. However, the strategy of their licensee, Stephen Budd, to sell the brand into US department stores didn't work out so in 1999 they announced a plan to open a New York store once again. The initial plan was to open in time for Christmas 1999, but the store on lower Broadway finally opened its doors in June 2001. Commentators such as Kim Hastreiter were sceptical that it could recapture the buzz of times past, given the increased competition in mass-market clubbing gear from the likes of H and The Limited.|$|E

500|$|Gabriel {{later said}} he wrote all his lyrical {{contributions}} to the album in two days. Having rehearsed and written enough material for an album, the group entered Island Studios in August 1973. As with Foxtrot, John Burns helped with production. Burns' technical skills resulted in a good recorded sound and environment, and this motivated the group to play better and tackle more complex arrangements. Banks recalled the sessions being difficult, adding [...] "it was hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> going". Charisma released a live album, Genesis Live, compiled from concerts taped for the radio, {{to fill the gap}} between studio releases.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph said, [...] "It feels entirely made by committee—the {{definition}} of house style, without a personal stamp in sight." [...] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Although director Alan Taylor manages <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> going properly {{for the final}} battle in London, the long stretches before that on Asgard and the other branches of Yggdrasil are a drag, like filler episodes of Game of Thrones but without the narrative complexity, mythical heft or all-pervading sexiness." [...] Michael Phillips of the Los Angeles Times described Thor: The Dark World as having the [...] "same old threats of galaxy annihilation spiced with fairly entertaining fish-out-of-water jokes". Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said, [...] "the battle scenes are as lacking in heat and coherence as the central love story".|$|E
500|$|Divine's mother, Frances Milstead, {{remarked that}} while Divine [...] "was blessed with many talents and abilities, {{he could be}} very moody and demanding." [...] She noted {{that while he was}} [...] "incredibly kind and generous", he always wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> done the way that he wanted, and would [...] "tune you out if you displeased him." [...] She noted that in most interviews, he came across as [...] "a very shy and private person". Divine's Dutch friends gave him two bulldogs in the early 1980s, on which he doted, naming them Beatrix and Claus after Queen Beatrix and her husband Prince Claus of the Netherlands. On {{numerous}} occasions he would have his photograph taken with them and sometimes use these images for record covers and posters. Divine suffered from problems with obesity from childhood, caused by his love of food, and in later life his hunger was increased by his daily use of marijuana, an addiction that he publicly admitted to. According to Bernard Jay, in Divine's final years, when his disco career {{was coming to an end}} and he was struggling to find acting jobs, he felt suicidal and threatened to kill himself on several occasions.|$|E

500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves."

500|$|Davis {{appreciated}} Hammond's {{closeness to}} the SG-1 team and {{his willingness to}} compromise. At {{the beginning of the}} series, Hammond does not accept the alien warrior Teal'c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing Teal'c's devotion to the Stargate Program. Despite his admiration for Dr. Daniel Jackson's enthusiasm in the beginning, Hammond has a hard time understanding Daniel's unorthodox and non-military approach to problems until Hammond comes to realize the importance of a civilian viewpoint to SG-1's mission. When the alien Jonas Quinn joins SG-1 in season 6, Davis compared Hammond's response to Jonas to his reaction to Teal'c in season 1. Although Hammond does not blame Jonas for Daniel's death in [...] "Meridian", [...] "the situation does make it difficult for [...] to totally take the young man under his wing and embrace him like family as he has the rest of SG-1". Davis named the NID as Hammond's only source of frustration, since they regularly outflank Hammond and SG-1. Hammond's only option is to call the President for support, but most cases end with SG-1 or Hammond breaking the rules to assure the survival of humanity, so [...] "Hammond will do whatever he must <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> done".|$|E
500|$|On August 5, 2011, Guillermo del Toro {{stated that}} the remake would reflect his {{original}} vision for the film, {{and that it had}} been planned even when the first version was in production. [...] "Even when we produced the Spanish movie, I had intended to remake it because we had a very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try. So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." [...] Del Toro also praised the new film's director. [...] "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his The Mothman Prophecies and his video work – and we are out to actors, so we're hoping <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> going soon." [...] On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress Amy Adams was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film. It was also {{stated that the}} current incarnation of the remake screenplay had been written by Larry Fessenden and Sergio G. Sánchez, the sole writer of the original film.|$|E

500|$|For the {{destruction}} of the Bus, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s plane that serves as a mobile command center, series lead visual effects provider FuseFX were able to storyboard and plot out the sequence earlier than usual, before creating a completely computer generated sequence in which the plane is hit by a missile while flying in the arctic. As the plane is brought down, [...] "pieces of wreckage catch fire and burn as they fall to earth. There is also a smaller plane that flies through the airborne debris. It’s a very complex sequence, combining CG, effects simulations and pyrotechnics." [...] Series visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack elaborated that [...] "Doing fire realistically on television is a tall order. You don’t get the representation of what a real fire element looks like using software, but the guys at FuseFX, those FX animators are amazing. It takes a long time and a lot of set up <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> right. And it wasn’t just the fire, it was the smoke and the debris, and then it was the cloaking device, and May [...] in the cockpit and it was May on bluescreen. Between Houdini and the particles we had to create for that one shot—a big giant virtual shot where we had a QuinJet come down and all the debris is falling all around and there’s fire and smoke, that sequence was what that episode was about. It was a big scene to pull off." ...|$|E
500|$|Sestak and Specter {{held their}} {{first and only}} {{televised}} debate on May 1 at Philadelphia's Fox affiliate, during which the two candidates bitterly attacked each other's character and honesty. The two began arguing even before the hour-long debate formally began, when Sestak objected to Specter's use of notes {{and said that the}} rules did not allow them. The debate organizer ruled the notes were allowed. Specter criticized Sestak for campaign advertisements that accused the Senator of lying about Sestak's record. Specter said, [...] "Nobody has ever called me a liar," [...] and demanded an apology, to which Sestak did not respond. Specter also repeatedly asked Sestak to publicly release his military records, to which Sestak again refused to respond. Sestak accused Specter of using Republican-style tactics in the vein of Karl Rove, former adviser to George W. Bush, and said Specter's attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting Bush's failed economic policies. Specter insisted the questions raised about Sestak's naval record were legitimate because much of Sestak's campaign was based on his military background, adding, [...] "It goes to his ability <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>things</b> done, to get along with people. He's all peaches and cream on television." [...] Specter criticized Sestak for supporting the troop build-up in Afghanistan, while Sestak noted that Specter voted against a ban on assault weapons in the 1990s. The Philadelphia Inquirer noted the debate was [...] "every bit as contentious as their Democratic Senate primary struggle has become in its closing days".|$|E
