5000|$|A 2009 study {{based on}} {{electrophysiological}} recordings of large ensembles of isolated {{cells in the}} prefrontal cortex of rats revealed that cell assemblies that formed upon learning were more preferentially active during subsequent sleep episodes. More specifically, those replay events were more prominent during slow wave sleep and were concomittant with hippocampal reactivation events. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> that neuronal patterns in large brain networks are tagged during learning {{so that they are}} replayed, and supposedly consolidated, during subsequent sleep. There have been other studies that have shown similar reactivation of learning pattern during motor skill and neuroprosthetic learning. Notably, new evidence is showing that reactivation and rescaling may be co-occurring during sleep [...]|$|E

(2003) {{suggests}} {{concludes that}} [...] "Dravidian tribals were possibly widespread throughout India {{before the arrival}} of the Indo-European-speaking nomads" [...] and that [...] "formation of populations by fission that resulted in founder and drift effects have left their imprints on the genetic structures of contemporary populations". The geneticist PP Majumder (2010) has recently argued that the findings of Reich et al. (2009) are in remarkable concordance with previous research using mtDNA and Y-DNA: Central Asian populations are supposed to have been major contributors to the Indian gene pool, particularly to the northern Indian gene pool, and the migrants had supposedly moved into India through what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan. Using mitochondrial DNA variation data collated from various studies, we have shown that populations of Central Asia and Pakistan show the lowest coefficient of genetic differentiation with the north Indian populations, a higher differentiation with the south Indian populations, and the highest with the northeast Indian populations. Northern Indian populations are genetically closer to Central Asians than populations of other geographical regions of India... Consistent with the above findings, a recent study using over 500,000 biallelic autosomal markers has found a north to south gradient of genetic proximity of Indian populations to western Eurasians. This feature is likely related to the proportions of ancestry derived from the western Eurasian gene pool, which, as <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>shown,</b> is greater in populations inhabiting northern India than those inhabiting southern India.|$|E

30|$|We have {{designed}} an inventory model for seasonal products in which deterioration {{can be controlled}} by item preservation technology investment. Demand for the product is considered price sensitive and decreases linearly. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> that the profit is a concave function of optimal selling price, replenishment time and preservation cost parameter. We simultaneously determined the optimal selling price of the product, the replenishment cycle {{and the cost of}} item preservation technology.

Finally, the model is illustrated by numerical examples and sensitive analysis of the optimal solution with respect to major parameters.|$|E
