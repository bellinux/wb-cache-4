500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Milton Guasti under the pseudonym DoctorM64 {{over the course of}} about ten years, although with several periods of no work done on the game. Guasti created the game with the intention of recreating the fast pace of Metroid: Zero Mission gameplay, and the [...] "atmosphere and solitude" [...] of Super Metroid. After having finished Metroid II for the first time, he imagined it to be [...] "cool" [...] to play the game with modern gameplay, an in-game minimap rather than with a physical map on one's lap, and the Omega Metroids being as tall as the screen. As Guasti was not yet a programmer at the time, he used a <b>trial-and-error</b> <b>method</b> to modify a platforming game engine by Martin Piecyk within the game creation system , with learning being his main motivation for working on the game. At first the remake followed the original Metroid II map layout and already existing sprites from Metroid: Zero Mission and Super Metroid. As Guasti kept working on the game engine and polished each ability, he felt that AM2R started to seem more and more authentic. After the game had been made public, several artists contacted Guasti and volunteered to create original art for the game: the Metroid evolutions were redesigned, and new enemies and areas unrelated to other Metroid games were added. He remade the music himself while waiting for customers in his recording studio.|$|E

[...] Through the utilization of pharmacogenomics, it is hoped that pharmaceutical drug treatments can deviate from what is dubbed as the [...] "one-dose-fits-all" [...] approach. Pharmacogenomics also attempts to eliminate the <b>trial-and-error</b> <b>method</b> of prescribing, allowing physicians to take into consideration their patient's genes, the functionality of these genes, and how this may affect the efficacy of the patient's current or future treatments (and where applicable, provide an explanation for the failure of past treatments). Such approaches promise the advent of precision medicine and even personalized medicine, in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for narrow subsets of patients or even for each individual's unique genetic makeup. Whether used to explain a patient's response or lack thereof to a treatment, or act as a predictive tool, it hopes to achieve better treatment outcomes, greater efficacy, minimization of the occurrence of drug toxicities and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). For patients who have lack of therapeutic response to a treatment, alternative therapies can be prescribed that would best suit their requirements. In order to provide pharmacogenomic recommendations for a given drug, two possible types of input can be used: genotyping or exome or whole genome sequencing. Sequencing provides many more data points, including detection of mutations that prematurely terminate the synthesized protein (early stop codon).|$|E

5000|$|The {{economic}} models {{developed in}} the 1920s and 1930s by American economists Fred M. Taylor and Abba Lerner, and by Polish economist Oskar Lange, involved a form of planning based on marginal cost pricing. In Lange's model, a central planning board would set prices for producer goods through a <b>trial-and-error</b> <b>method,</b> adjusting until the price matched the marginal cost, {{with the aim of}} achieving Pareto-efficient outcomes.

This method of pattern welding first appeared around 700 BC, and was primarily used for making weapons such as swords, with the most widely known examples being from Damascus, Japanese, and Merovingian swords.
