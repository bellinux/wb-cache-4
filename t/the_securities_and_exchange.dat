5|$|On February 16, {{the company}} {{announced}} it had filed its registration for the IPO with <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> <b>and</b> <b>Exchange</b> Commission. Burger King began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BKC on May 18, 2006.

The proceeds from the sale were used by the company help pay back a loan taken out taken by the company in February used to pay dividends to the investment firms. According to one analyst at Renaissance Capital, Wall Street investors were not alarmed by the large payout due to the increased financial stability of the company resulting from changes made by the investor groups during the interim between the purchase in 2002 and the stock offering. Incoming CEO John W. Chidsey backed the payouts, stating that the financial firms spent considerable time and capital turning the company around.|$|E
