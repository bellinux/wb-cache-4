Previous studies based on this concept suggest a slightly oblate halo (axis ratio 0. 8) for our Galaxy.

We find that a simple <b>isothermal</b> infinite <b>halo</b> of any shape- oblate or prolate, is not able to account for the observed flaring.

40|$|With the aim to {{determine}} the spatial distribution of the dark matter halo, we investigate two polar ring galaxies NGC 4262 and SPRC- 7. For both galaxies the stellar kinematics data for the central galaxy were obtained from optical spectroscopy at the 6 -m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The information about polar gaseous components {{was taken from the}} optical 3 D-spectroscopic observations of ionized gas (for SPRC- 7) and H i radio observations (for NGC 4262). SPRC- 7 is the system with a relative angle δ= 73 ^∘ towards the central galaxy and a quite massive stellar-gaseous polar component. Meanwhile NGC 4262 is the classic polar case with δ= 88 ^∘ where the polar ring mainly consists of neutral gas with a negligible stellar contribution to the mass. We are hence dealing with two different systems and the results are quite diverse too. The observed properties of both galaxies were compared with the results of self consistent simulations of velocity fields of the polar component along with the rotation curve of the central lenticular galaxy. For SPRC- 7 we have found a slightly flattened halo towards the polar plane with the axis ratio c/a ≃ 1. 7 ± 0. 2 for the <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo</b> model and c/a ≃ 1. 5 ± 0. 2 for the NFW model. The case of NGC 4262 is more unusual, the shape of the dark matter distribution varies strongly with radius.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a putative X-ray emitting halo surrounding the Local Group of galaxies, and specifically the possible temperature anisotropies induced in the COBE-DMR four-year sky maps by an associated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. By fitting the <b>isothermal</b> spherical <b>halo</b> model proposed by Suto et. al. (1996) to the coadded four-year COBE-DMR 53 and 90 GHz sky maps in Galactic coordinates, we find no significant evidence of a contribution. We therefore reject the claim that such a halo can affect the estimation of the primordial spectral index and amplitude of density perturbations as inferred from the DMR data. We find that correlation with the DMR data imposes constraints on the plausible contribution of such an X-ray emitting halo to a distortion in the CMB spectrum (as specified by the Compton-y parameter), up to a value for R [...] the ratio of the core radius of the <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo</b> gas distribution to the distance to the Local Group centroid [...] of 0. 68. For larger values of R, the recent cosmological upper limit derived by COBE-FIRAS provides stronger constraints on the model parameters. Over the entire parameter space for R, we find an upper limit to the inferred sky-RMS anisotropy signal of 14 microKelvin (95 % c. l.), a negligible amount relative to the 35 microKelvin signal observed in the COBE-DMR data.

We demonstrate that substructure is destroyed in present simulations {{as a result of}} large force softening combined with the heating sources of tides and encounters with dissolving substructure. In the limit of infinite numerical resolution, whether or not individual halos or substructure can survive depends sensitively on their inner density profiles.

40|$|Summary. We 1 {{examine the}} {{cosmology}} and the astrophysical signals produced by neutralino dark {{matter in the}} frame of an effective MSSM model without gauginomass unification at a grand unification scale. As a consequence of the recent data on precision cosmology, we can set an absolute lower bound of 6 GeV on the neutralino mass. This limit changes to 25 GeV if the pseudoscalar higgs is heavier than 180 GeV. The light neutralinos allowed in this class of supersymmetric models provide quite sizeable direct detection rates. We show how they compare to the direct detection esperimental sensitivites: the predicted rates are largely compatible with the annual-modulation data of the DAMA Collaboration; the comparison with the upper bounds of the CDMS and EDELWEISS Collaborations shows that limits for neutralino masses below 25 – 30 GeV can be set for a standard <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo.</b> As for the annihilation signals, we find that only low–energy antiprotons and antideuterons are potentially able to set constraints on very low–mass neutralinos, below 20 – 25 GeV.

Previous work showed how galaxy catalogs {{could be used to}} attribute relative degrees of isolation to low-redshift Lyα clouds found in HST/GHRS spectra. This enabled the separation of clouds into two distinct populations corresponding to two distinct environments, variously characterized as void/unshocked and non-void/shocked. Void clouds have a steep equivalent width distribution (i. e., many smaller absorbers) while non-void clouds have a flat distribution. I show that N-body/hydro simulations of Lyα clouds are inconsistent with observations of the clouds as a function of their environments. Simulations fail to predict the existence of significant numbers of detectable void clouds, and incorrectly predict the characteristics of non-void clouds. Implicated in this failure is the so-called fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation, FGPA, which envisions that Lyα absorbers are formed in the large-scale structures of coalescing matter. A recent paper (Manning) has modeled the void cloud population as sub-galactic perturbations that have expanded in response to reionization.

40|$|Abridged version) : The {{optical depth}} {{is widely used}} in Galactic microlensing studies {{as a means to}} {{determine}} the density of MACHOs, since in theory it depends only upon their spatial distribution and is therefore less model-dependent than other microlensing observables. However, since the measured optical depth is restricted to that of events with measurable timescales, inferences of total MACHO density are dependent on the assumed timescale distribution. Using the 2 -year LMC results of the MACHO collaboration, we illustrate this point by showing how, for an assumed <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo,</b> the inferred MACHO halo fraction as determined from optical depth estimates depends upon MACHO mass. The analysis highlights the following conclusions: (1) The MACHO density inferred from optical depth measurements depends on the assumed MACHO mass function for a given Galactic distribution function; (2) without extra information on the MACHO mass function, such as can be obtained from the rate-timescale distribution, optical depth measurements can provide a lower limit but not an upper limit on the MACHO density for a given Galactic distribution function; (3) a comparison between the inferred total optical depth of different Galactic models, or of different components in a multi-component Galactic model, requires knowledge of the underlying timescale distribution for each model or component.

To explore how morphological and kinematic asymmetry are affected by companion galaxies, we analyze neutral hydrogen observations of the interacting Magellanic spirals NGC 4618 and 4625. The analysis of the H I distribution revealed that about 10 % of the total H I mass of NGC 4618 resides in a looping tidal structure that appears to wrap {{all the way around}} the galaxy. Through calculations based on derived H I profiles, we show that NGC 4618 and 4625 are no more asymmetric than non-interacting Magellanic spirals analyzed by Wilcots & Prescott (2004). We also derive rotation curves for the approaching and receding sides of each galaxy. By fitting the mean curves with an <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo</b> model, we calculate dynamical masses of 4. 7 times 10 ^{ 9 } M_sun and 9. 8 times 10 ^{ 9 } M_sun out to 6. 7 kpc, for NGC 4618 and 4625 respectively. While the rotation curves had systematically higher velocities on the receding side of each galaxy, the effect was no more pronounced than in studies of non-interacting spirals (Swaters et. al. 1999).

However, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) measurements of the proper motions of the LMC and SMC have challenged the plausibility of bound orbits, causing the origin of the MS to re-emerge as a contested issue. We present a new tidal model in which structures resembling the bifurcated MS and elongated LA are able to form in a bound orbit consistent with the HST proper motions. The LMC and SMC have remained bound to each other only recently in our model despite being separately bound to the Milky Way for more than 5 Gyr. We find that the MS and LA are able to form as a consequence of LMC-dominated tidal stripping during the recent dynamical coupling of the LMC and SMC.

These distributions depend strongly on the velocity anisotropy, but only slightly on the shape of the potential. We also present high resolution N-body simulations of the orbital decay of satellite systems on eccentric orbits in an <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo.</b> The dynamical friction timescales are found to decrease with increasing orbital eccentricity, but the dependence is weaker than previously suggested. The orbital eccentricity stays remarkably constant throughout the decay; although the eccentricity decreases near pericenter, it increases again near apocenter, such that there is no net circularization.

We find that the distribution of orbital eccentricities of the globular clusters in the Milky Way is consistent with a close to isotropic velocity distribution.

Our dataset consists of 186 member stars, 159 of which have good quality velocities, extending to a magnitude V= 19. 5 with a mean velocity precision of 2 km/s. We find statistically strong evidence of a rising velocity dispersion consistent with a dark matter halo with gently rising rotation curve. There is a < 2 sigma signature of rotation about the long axis, inconsistent with tidal disruption being {{the source of the}} rising dispersion. By comparing our dataset with earlier velocities, we find that Draco probably has a binary distribution and fraction comparable to those in the solar neighbourhood. We apply a novel maximum likelihood algorithm and fit the velocity data to a two parameter spherical model with an adjustable dark matter content and velocity anisotropy. Draco is best fit by a weakly tangentially anisotropic distribution of stellar orbits in a dark matter halo with a very slowly rising rotation law. We are able to rule out both a mass-follows-light distribution and an extended halo with a harmonic core at the 2. 5 to 3 sigma significance level, depending on the details of our assumptions about Draco's stellar binary population.

We model clusters with initially N= 8 k and N= 16 k single stars of the same mass, orbiting around a point-mass galaxy. For each orbital eccentricity that we consider, we find the apogalactic radius at which the cluster has the same lifetime as the cluster with the same N on a circular orbit. We show that then, {{the evolution of}} bound particle number and half-mass radius is approximately independent of eccentricity. Secondly, when we scale our results to orbits with the same semi-major axis, {{we find that the}} lifetimes are, to first order, independent of eccentricity. When the results of Baumgardt and Makino for a singular <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo</b> are scaled in the same way, the lifetime is again independent of eccentricity to first order, suggesting that this result is independent of the Galactic mass profile. From both sets of simulations we empirically derive the higher order dependence of the lifetime on eccentricity. Our results serve as benchmark for theoretical studies of the escape rate from clusters on eccentric orbits. Finally, our results can be useful for generative models for cold streams and cluster evolution models that are confined to spherical symmetry and/or time-independent tides, such as Fokker-Planck models, Monte Carlo models, and (fast) semi-analytic models.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{previous}} study it was proposed that the Galactic dark matter being detected by gravitational microlensing experiments such as MACHO may reside in a population of dim halo globular clusters comprising mostly or entirely low-mass stars just above the hydrogen-burning limit. It was shown that, for {{the case of a}} standard <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo,</b> the scenario is consistent not only with MACHO observations but also with cluster dynamical constraints and number-count limits imposed by 20 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) fields. The present work extends the original study by considering the dependency of the results on halo model, and by increasing the sample of HST fields to 51 (including the Hubble Deep Field and Groth Strip fields). The model dependency of the results is tested using the same reference power-law halo models employed by the MACHO team. For the unclustered scenario HST counts imply a modeldependent halo fraction of at most 0. 5 − 1. 1 % (95 % confidence), well below the inferred MACHO fraction. For the cluster scenario all the halo models permit a range of cluster masses and radii to satisfy HST, MACHO and dynamical constraints. Whilst the strong HST limits on the unclustered scenario imply that at least 95 % of halo stars must reside in clusters at present, this limit is weakened if the stars which have escaped from clusters retain a degree of clumpiness in their distribution. Key words: stars: low-mass, brown dwarfs – globular clusters: general – Galaxy: halo – dark matter 1...|$|R
40|$|I {{continue}} {{my study}} of the low-z Lyman alpha cloud population. Previously I showed how galaxy catalogs are used to attribute relative degrees of isolation to those clouds found in HST/GHRS spectra. I find that there exist two distinct populations corresponding to two distinct environments, variously characterized as void (unshocked) and non-void (shocked). Void clouds have a steep equivalent width distribution (i. e., many smaller absorbers) while non-void clouds have a flat distribution. These environment-specific observations of LyA clouds show that the predictions from N-body/hydro simulations are incorrect. Simulations fail to predict the existence of significant numbers of detectable void clouds. They incorrectly predict the characteristics of non-void clouds. Implicated in this failure is the so-called fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation (FGPA) which envisions that LyA absorbers are formed in the large-scale structures of coalescing matter. I recently modeled the void cloud population as sub-galactic perturbations that have expanded in response to reionization. However, the success in this modeling was contingent upon using the more massive <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo</b> {{in place of the}} standard Navarro, Frenk & White. Here, I extend my modeling to non-void LyA clouds using the same basic cloud model. Nonvoid clouds were once unshocked, but when entering nonvoid space, they are shock stripped. By analytically stripping model void clouds, a good fit of the model CDS to observations is found if cloud velocities are ~ 100 km/s. Nonvoid clouds show strong concentration around galaxies, suggesting that the compact HVC population are members of this population. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, ApJ 595 n 1, in pres...|$|R
40|$|El resumen será traducido al español por los editores. Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{generally}} associated with extended X-ray and radio halos, giving a clear hint of an outflow {{of gas and}} relativistic particles from the disk into the halo. The driving agents are, not surprisingly, active star forming regions, injecting hot gas and cosmic rays generated by supernova remnant and superbubble shock waves. The dynamics of the outflow and the thermal evolution of the plasma are strongly coupled, and therefore a self-consistent model is necessary for a satisfactory description. Since the plasma temperature is between one and a few million Kelvin, the halo is most conspicuous in soft X-rays. It will be shown that X-ray data obtained recently with XMM-Newton EPIC pn bear clear spectral signatures that are in strong disagreement with an <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo</b> in collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE). Instead a temperature structure in X-ray halos is observed. It will be demonstrated that a galactic wind outflow model in which the non-equilibrium ionization structure is calculated self-consistently can give a satisfactory and physical explanation for the X-ray spectral characteristics, e. g. in case of the local starburst galaxy NGC 3079. In particular, high subsolar abundances, that have been reported from X-ray observations in some cases, are shown to be artefacts of CIE spectral fit models. It is found that spectral models are strongly constrained {{by the presence of}} diagnostic lines such as O VII and O VIII as well as Fe-L line complexes. Thus a detailed spectral X-ray model will help to provide important galactic wind parameters...|$|R
40|$|In Kang (2015) we {{calculated}} {{the acceleration of}} cosmic-ray electrons and the ensuing radio synchrotron emission at weak spherical shocks {{that are expected to}} form in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. There we demonstrated that, at decelerating spherical shocks, the volume integrated spectra of both electrons and radiation deviate significantly from the test-particle power-laws predicted for constant planar shocks, because the shock compression ratio and the flux of injected electrons decrease in time. In this study, we consider spherical blast waves propagating into a constant density core surrounded by an <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo</b> with a decreasing density profile in order to explore how the deceleration rate of the shock speed affects the radio emission from accelerated electrons. The surface brightness profile and the volume-integrated radio spectrum of the model shocks are calculated by assuming a ribbon-like shock surface on a spherical shell and the associated downstream region of relativistic electrons. If the postshock magnetic field strength is about 7 microgauss, at the shock age of ~ 50 Myr, the volume-integrated radio spectrum steepens gradually with the spectral index from alpha_{inj} to alpha_{inj}+ 0. 5 over 0. 1 - 10 GHz, where alpha_{inj} is the injection index at the shock positionexpected from the diffusive shock acceleration theory. Such gradual steepening could explain the curved radio spectrum of the radio relic in cluster A 2266, which was interpreted as a broken power-law by Trasatti et al. (2014), if the relic shock is young enough so that the break frequency falls in around 1 GHz. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Journal of Korean Astronomical Societ...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{formalism}} applying to Newtonian self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates. This formalism may find application {{in the context}} of dark matter halos. We introduce a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation including a source of dissipation (damping) and an arbitrary nonlinearity. Using the Madelung transformation, we derive the hydrodynamic representation of this generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation and obtain a damped quantum Euler equation involving a friction force proportional and opposite to the velocity and a pressure force associated with an equation of state determined by the nonlinearity present in the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In the strong friction limit, we obtain a quantum Smoluchowski equation. These equations satisfy an H-theorem for a free energy functional constructed with a generalized entropy. We specifically consider the Boltzmann and Tsallis entropies associated with isothermal and polytropic equations of state. We also consider the entropy associated with the logotropic equation of state. We derive the virial theorem corresponding to the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation, damped quantum Euler equation, and quantum Smoluchowski equation. Using a Gaussian ansatz, we obtain a simple equation governing the dynamical evolution {{of the size of the}} condensate. We highlight a specific model of dark matter halos corresponding to a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity and a cubic nonlinearity. It leads to dark matter halos with an equation of state P=ρ k_B T_ eff/m+ 2 π a_sħ^ 2 ρ^ 2 /m^ 3 presenting a condensed core (BEC/soliton) and an <b>isothermal</b> <b>halo</b> with an effective temperature T_ eff.

40|$|A {{claim for}} {{evidence}} of dark matter interactions in the DAMA experiment has been recently reinforced.
