Clinton said that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., {{to the point where he}} intervened multiple times with the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> to protect them.|$|E
5|$|At {{around the}} time Batch's {{squadron}} was working up for the summer cruise, Henry Abbott, the German consul in Salonika, then in the Ottoman Empire, was murdered. Further attacks on German citizens living in the area were feared, and so Batsch was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean Sea to stage a naval demonstration in June 1876. After arriving with the four ironclads, he was reinforced by three unarmored vessels. After the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> subsided in August, Batsch departed with Kaiser and Deutschland; the other two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean {{for the rest of}} the summer.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Belarusian Armed Forces, the President has {{the duty}} to protect the Belarusian {{territory}} from internal and external forces. The president can call for {{a state of emergency}} in the following cases: natural disasters, a catastrophe, or unrest involving violence or the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> Regardless if the declaration affects the entire country or sections of it, the Council of the Republic must be notified by the President and must seek their approval within three days of notification. The same rules applies if the President issues a state of martial law {{in the event of a}} possible military action against Belarus. The President has to form and head the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus, and can appoint and dismiss the State Secretary of the Security Council and the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of preventing undue influence on a jury, jury tampering (like witness tampering) is a serious crime, whether attempted through bribery, <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> or other means.

25|$|Though {{for women}} {{prostitution}} {{was often the}} highest paying opportunity, few prostitutes were ever able to raise themselves out of poverty, and they were always faced with the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and disease.

50|$|After the Civil War, {{violence}} against LGBT individuals continued.

25|$|Many of the Mexicans {{who were}} native {{to what would}} become a state within the United States were {{experienced}} miners, and they had great success mining gold in California. Their success aroused animosity by white prospectors, who intimidated Mexican miners with the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> and committed violence against some. Between 1848 and 1860, white Americans lynched at least 163 Mexicans in California alone. On July 5, 1851, a mob in Downieville, California, lynched a Mexican woman named Josefa Segovia. She was accused of killing a white man who had attempted to assault her after breaking into her home.|$|E
25|$|In 1887, Kalākaua {{was forced}} to sign the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Drafted by white {{businessmen}} and lawyers, the document stripped the king of much of his authority. It established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised most Hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier, white elite. Resident whites were allowed to vote but resident Asians were not. As the 1887 Constitution was signed under <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> it {{is known as the}} Bayonet Constitution. King Kalākaua, reduced to a figurehead, reigned until his death in 1891. His sister, Queen Liliuokalani, succeeded him; she was the last monarch of Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|Ristovski also {{intended}} {{the film to}} portray social conditions in post-independence Macedonia, depicting it as a society plagued by anomie, violence and corruption. He saw these conditions {{as part of a}} larger regional unease whose history included civil conflict in former Yugoslav territories. Critics have similarly interpreted the film as an allegory of these social and regional concerns. In this context, Marko's transition from victimhood to criminality embodies the cycle of violence endemic in such conditions, while his failed hopes serve as a cautionary warning against the dangers of empty idealism in such situations. One critic saw Paris' bullet in Marko's chess set (see figure on the right) as a metaphor for the <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> ever-present in their world.|$|E

25|$|The {{spring of}} 1870 saw Fort Edmonton {{come under the}} <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> due to a war between the Blackfoot and Cree, {{resulting}} from the slaying of Cree Chief Maskipiton. The Blackfoot were unable to ford the North Saskatchewan due to the high spring waters, but they encamped across from Fort Edmonton and harassed it with their muskets nonetheless. Some wagons full of goods had to be abandoned by traders {{in a hurry to}} reach safety inside of the fort, and their contents were spoiled by the Blackfoot. Though the fort itself was not invaded, the men within were armed and ready to fight. Chief Factor William J. Christie chose to withstand the Blackfoot and not attack them, fearing that to do so would only invite further violence against the Hudson's Bay Company.|$|E
25|$|Tabari's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} {{conflict}} with the Hanbalite followers of Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Barbahari, {{a student of the}} students of Ibn Hanbal. Tabari was known for his view that Hanbalism was not a legitimate school of thought, as Ibn Hanbal was a compiler of traditions and not a proper jurist. The Hanbalites of Baghdad would often stone Tabari's house, escalating the persecution to the point where Abbasid authorities had to subdue them by force. The Baghdad chief of police tried to organize a debate between Tabari and the Hanbalites to settle their differences. While Tabari accepted, the Hanbalites did not show up but instead came later to pelt his house with stones again. The constant <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> from the Hanbalites hung over Tabari's head {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|Tensions climbed among Europeans in Taranaki. Although it {{had been}} more than 12 years since the last {{military}} action against Māori in Taranaki, and despite the lack of any <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> by the inhabitants of Parihaka, Major Charles Stapp, commander of the Taranaki Volunteers, declared that every man in the province between 17 and 55 years was now on active service in the militia.
