EPS synthesized by methanotrophs attract much attention not only due to their traditional industrial use but also due to the pro-spective application of these biopolymers to binding dust and decreasing the level of methane in coal mines [6, 7].

40|$|Cotton (Gossypium. Spp.) is an agroeconomically {{significant}} crop worldwide {{involved in}} <b>textile,</b> <b>oil,</b> and feedstock production. Identifying genetic targets involved with disease resistance in cotton remains a critical objective {{for the scientific}} community. There remains much to be elucidated about how plant cells communicate and recognize biotic and abiotic environmental cues. Cell-surface-associated pattern recognition receptors (PRR) {{play a critical role}} in pathogen recognition. In plants, PRRs are receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and receptor-like proteins (RLPs). In particular, leucine-rich repeat containing RLPs (LRR-RLPs) have been indicated to play an important role in disease resistance against Fusarium infection in Arabidopsis. My thesis research is to genome-wide identify cotton RLPs with a bioinformatics approach and characterize their potential involvement in cotton disease resistance using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach. The 57 Arabidopsis RLPs were used to identify the cotton RLPs via sequence homology. Analysis of the cotton genome has identified 86 LRR-RLPs in G arboreum, 107 LRR-RLPs in G raimondii, and 151 LRR-RLPs in G. hirsutum. Phylogenic tree analysis with other plant LRR-RLPs suggested that cotton LRR-RLPs are likely evolved independently and clustered together. LRR-RLPs appear to be evolved rapidly as the homology between cotton and Arabidopsis LRR-RLPs is often below 40 %. The number of LRRs varies among different LRR-RLP members. Using the VIGS approach, we silenced a set of cotton RLPs. My preliminary assays suggested that GhRLPGSO 1 -like, GhRLP 44, GhRLP 6, and GhRLP 34 might be required for defense against Fusarium oxysporum. Additional infection assays and evaluation of silencing efficiency will further evaluate their involvement in disease resistance...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011. Nanofluid, {{which was}} first {{discovered}} by the Argonne laboratory, is a nanotechnology- based heat transfer fluid. This fluid consists of particles which are suspended inside conventional heat transfer liquid or base fluid. The purpose of this suspension is for enhancing thermal conductivity and convective heat transfer performance of this base fluid. The name nanofluid came about {{as a result of}} the nanometer- sized particles of typical length scales 1 - 100 nm which are stably suspended inside of the base fluids. These nanoparticles are of both physical and chemical classes and are also produced by either the physical process or the chemical process. Nanofluid has been discovered to be the best option towards accomplishing the enhancement of heat transfer through fluids in different unlimited conditions as well as reduction in the thermal resistance by heat transfer liquids. Various manufacturing industries and engineering processes such as transportation, electronics, food, medical, <b>textile,</b> <b>oil</b> and gas, chemical, drinks e. t. c, now aim at the use of this heat transfer enhancement fluid. Advantages such organisations can obtain from this fluid includes, reduced capital cost, reduction in size of heat transfer system and improvement of energy efficiencies. This research has been able to solve numerically, using Maple 12 which uses a fourth- fifth order Runge -kutta- Fehlberg algorithm alongside shooting method, a set of nonlinear coupled differential equations together with their boundary conditions, thereby modelling the heat and mass transfer characteristics of the boundary layer flow of the nanofluids. Important properties of these nanofluids which were considered are viscosity, thermal conductivity, density, specific heat and heat transfer coefficients and microstructures (particle shape, volume concentration, particle size, distribution of particle, component properties and matrixparticle interface). Basic fluid dynamics equations such as the continuity equation, linear momentum equation, energy equation and chemical species concentration equations have also been employed...|$|E
