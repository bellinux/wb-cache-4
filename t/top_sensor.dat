30|$|In {{the above}} example, a {{temperature}} sensor is modeled as {{a variant of}} the <b>top</b> <b>sensor</b> capability by extending and specifying some attributes. The observation attribute value of a sensor is, and always will be, a dynamic value. A service endpoint is specified for performing the datafetching task and a lifting schema is used for data transformation. The accuracy of the measurement is defined as a conditional value. The accuracy has a required parameter, which is the air temperature measured by the sensor. Note that multiple conditions can be used to assign different values to a condition attribute value, but these conditions must be disjoint. When the discovery engine encounters a query on the accuracy, it will recognize the accuracy as a conditional value and check if there’s any required attributes for evaluating the condition. If the condition relies on a dynamic value, the engine will perform the datafetching task to retrieve the concrete value and formulate a query for the conditional value. Multiple queries will be created and evaluated for multiple conditions. There will be at most 1 positive result since all conditions are disjoint. A sample query for the accuracy is shown below.|$|E
40|$|A recent concern arose {{over the}} {{treatment}} of uncertainty associated with the K-Reactor axial power monitors (APMs). There are nine axial power monitor rods located at various positions in the K-Reactor core. By comparing the output of one sensor {{near the top of}} the rod to the output of another sensor near the bottom of the rod, the relative ratio of the neutron flux from the top to the bottom of the core can be determined. This ratio is called the roof-top-ratio (RTR) and is the output of a <b>top</b> <b>sensor</b> (Sensor 2) divided by the output of a bottom sensor (Sensor 6). The RTR is important to the safety analyses because when the RTR is maintained within certain ranges, the severity of reactivity transients is limited. There are uncertainties associated with the equipment`s ability to measure the true roof top ratio. It was determined recently that sufficient uncertainty was not accounted for either in reactor operation or in the safety analyses. The concern about uncertainty was addressed for three separate issues. One issue dear with the linear response of the sensors for power ranges planned for K-Reactor operation. The second issue dear with overall uncertainty in the RTR channel. The third issue dear with apparent large ranges in confidence bands for the RTR at low reactor powers as represented by original vendor data. Plots of sparse vendor data indicated unacceptably large uncertainties in RTR would have to be accounted for at the power ranges planned for K-Reactor operation. These concerns were brought to management`s attention through the existing procedures for notification, irrespective of their potential impact on the restart schedule. Analyses have been completed to resolve the APM issues described above, and work is progressing to take the needed steps to change operational procedures...|$|E
40|$|In this PhD thesis the {{development}} of laser-based processes for sensing applications is investigated. The manufacture of optical fibre sensors {{is of particular interest}} because fibre optics offers advantages in space constraint environments or in environments where electronic sensors fail. Laser micromilling of the transparent and mechanically challenging to machine materials sapphire and fused silica is investigated. An industrial picosecond laser providing 6 ps pulses with the ability to emit at 1030 nm (IR), 515 nm (green) and 343 nm (UV) is used for processing of these materials; providing a maximum laser pulse energy of 25 μJ at UV, 75 μJ at green and 125 μJ in IR. The UV wavelength is identified as the most reliable machining wavelength for these materials with the least amount of cracking and achieving a surface roughness Rq of just 300 nm compared to 1220 nm (green) and 1500 nm (IR) in fused silica. In sapphire the surface roughness is 420 nm using UV, with green it is 500 nm and using IR it is 800 nm. The material removal rates using this laser milling process are larger than with other micromachining techniques, hence it was applied to manufacture cantilever sensors on the end of an optical fibre. The monolithic fibre <b>top</b> <b>sensor</b> is carved out of conventional telecommunications optical fibre. The cantilever is a structure of less than 10 μm thickness, 20 μm width and 125 μm length. Using the Fabry-Perot interferometer method the sensor detects small movements with a resolution better than 15 nm. A technique is developed to correct for laser machining angles and hence generate parallel interferometer faces. An electric arc cleaning process of the laser manufactured cantilever sensors is investigated that reduces the surface roughness to 30 nm. The manufacturing process reduces manufacturing times by a factor of 100. A working sensor is demonstrated in a deflection experiment. Such short pulses are not always required to manufacture the highest resolution sensors. The manufacture of high precision optical encoder scales (pitch 8 μm, depth 200 nm) with two processes (i) ablative removal of a polyimide layer and (ii) a melt reflow process on nickel coated scales is demonstrated. Both processes are using 33 ns laser pulses at 355 nm generating a pulse energy of up to 1 mJ...|$|E

40|$|A {{post-tensioning}} tendon duct {{filled with}} grout can effectively prevent corrosion of the reinforcement, maintain bonding behavior between the reinforcement and concrete, {{and enhance the}} load bearing capacity of concrete structures. In practice, grouting of the post-tensioning tendon ducts always causes quality problems, which may reduce structural integrity and service life, and even cause accidents. However, monitoring of the grouting compactness is still a challenge due to the invisibility of the grout in the duct during the grouting process. This paper presents a stress wave-based active sensing approach using piezoceramic transducers to monitor the grouting compactness in real time. A segment of a commercial tendon duct was used as research object in this study. One lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoceramic transducer with marble protection, called a smart aggregate (SA), was bonded on the tendon and installed in the tendon duct. Two PZT patch sensors were mounted on the top outside surface of the duct, and one PZT patch sensor was bonded on the bottom outside surface of the tendon duct. In the active sensing approach, the SA {{was used as an}} actuator to generate a stress wave and the PZT sensors were utilized to detect the wave response. Cement or grout in the duct functions as a wave conduit, which can propagate the stress wave. If the cement or grout is not fully filled in the tendon duct, the <b>top</b> PZT <b>sensors</b> cannot receive much stress wave energy. The experimental procedures simulated four stages during the grout pouring process, which includes empty status, half grouting, 90 % grouting, and full grouting of the duct. Experimental results show that the bottom PZT sensor can detect the signal when the grout level increases towards 50 %, when a conduit between the SA and PZT sensor is formed. The <b>top</b> PZT <b>sensors</b> cannot receive any signal until the grout process is completely finished. The wavelet packet-based energy analysis was adopted in this research to compute the total signal energy received by PZT sensors. Experimental results show that the energy levels of the PZT sensors can reflect the degree of grouting compactness in the duct. The proposed method {{has the potential to be}} implemented to monitor the tendon duct grouting compactness of the reinforced concrete structures with post tensioning...|$|R
