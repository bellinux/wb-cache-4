50|$|Tilt filling, {{also known}} as <b>tilt</b> <b>casting,</b> is an {{uncommon}} filling technique where the crucible {{is attached to the}} gating system and both are slowly rotated so that the metal enters the mold cavity with little turbulence. The goal is to reduce porosity and inclusions by limiting turbulence. For most uses tilt filling is not feasible because the following inherent problem: if the system is rotated slow enough to not induce turbulence, the front of the metal stream begins to solidify, which results in mis-runs. If the system is rotated faster it induces turbulence, which defeats the purpose. Durville of France was the first to try <b>tilt</b> <b>casting,</b> in the 1800s. He tried to use it to reduce surface defects when casting coinage from aluminium bronze.|$|E

Vacuum casting, <b>tilt</b> <b>casting,</b> pressure assisted pouring and centrifugal casting are methods that use additional forces and are especially useful when moulds contain thin sections that would be otherwise be difficult to fill.|$|E
40|$|A coupled mould {{filling and}} {{solidification}} algorithm {{based on the}} Finite Element Method is presented for the <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> process. The incompressible, Navier-Stokes equations are solved by the Galerkin finite element method; the metal front is tracked by the pseudo-concentration approach, which is {{a variant of the}} volume of fluid method (VOF) and the latent heat release during solidification is taken into account through an effective specific heat. A coincidence-node technique is used to simulate the discontinuity in the temperature field across the metal/mould interface. The <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> phenomenon is numerically modelled by keeping the mould stationary and rotating the gravitational force vector. A mathematical expression relating tilting angle to the tilting speed has been proposed so that an optimal value of tilting speed can be predicted by minimising splashing effects. The free surface tracking algorithm is validated against the widely used broken dam problem. The <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> results are compared with the experimental results that were available in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Without {{relevant}} visual cues, {{the subjective}} visual vertical (SVV) is biased in roll-tilted subjects toward the body axis (Aubert or A-effect). This {{study focused on}} the role of the somatosensory system with respect to the SVV and on whether somesthetic cues act through the estimated body <b>tilt.</b> The body <b>cast</b> technology was used to obtain a diffuse tactile stimulation. An increased A-effect was expected because of a greater underestimation of the body position in the body cast. Sixteen subjects placed in a tilt chair were rolled sideways from 0 degrees to 105 degrees. They were asked to verbally indicate their subjective body position and then to adjust a luminous line to the vertical under strapped and body cast conditions. Results showed a greater A-effect (p <. 001) but an overestimation of the body orientation (p <. 01) in the body cast condition for the higher tilt values (beyond 60 degrees). Since the otolith organs produced the same gravity response in both conditions, errors were due to a change in somesthetic cues. Visual and postural errors were not directly related (no correlation). However, the angular distance between the apparent body position and the SW remained stable, suggesting that the change in somatosensory pattern inputs has a similar impact on the cognitive processes involved in assessing the perception of external space and the sense of self-position...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of the <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> process for TiAl alloys was investigated {{to achieve a}} tranquil mould filling and TiAl castings free of defects. Titanium alloys are very reactive in molten state, so they are widely melted in cold crucible, e. g. the Induction Skull Melting (ISM) furnace. Then the crucible holding the molten metal together with the mould is rotated to transfer the metal into the mould - ISM+ <b>tilt</b> <b>casting.</b> This paper emphasizes the effect of crucial parameters on mould filling and solidification of the castings during <b>tilt</b> <b>casting.</b> All crucial parameters, such as rotation rate, rotation profile, venting, initial mould temperature, casting orientation, feeder design, change of radius in 'T' junction and mould insulation have been discussed using numerical modeling data.

40|$|The <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> {{method is}} used to achieve {{tranquil}} filling of γ-TiAl turbine blades up to 400 mm long. The reactive titanium alloy is induction melted in a cold crucible, and the crucible with the attached mould is then rotated through 180 ° to transfer the metal into the mould. In the cold crucible, heat losses to the water cooled copper walls and base limit the superheat available, increasing the risk of premature freezing during mould filling. A compromise is required between fast and slow rotations to minimise the casting defects, such as misruns or gas entrainment. Simulations are presented using the authors’ Computational Fluid Dynamics code with several novel developments in front tracking, heat transfer algorithms and turbulence model adaptation, which accounts for an advancing solid front. The computational results are validated against prototype castings produced at the University of Birmingham, and the model is then used to optimise the <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> process...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the dimensional {{accuracy of the}} resultant (duplicative) casts made from two different impression materials (polyvinyl siloxane and polyether) in parallel and angulated implants. Materials and Methods: Three definitive master casts (control groups) were fabricated in dental stone with three implants, placed at equi-distance. In first group (control), all three implants were placed {{parallel to each other}} and perpendicular to the plane of the cast. In the second and third group (control), all three implants were placed at 10 ° and 15 o angulation respectively to the long axis of the <b>cast,</b> <b>tilting</b> towards the centre. Impressions were made with polyvinyl siloxane and polyether impression materials in a special tray, using a open tray impression technique from the master casts. These impressions were poured to obtain test casts. Three reference distances were evaluated on each test cast by using a profile projector and compared with control groups to determine the effect of combined interaction of implant angulation and impression materials on the accuracy of implant resultant cast. Results: Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in dimensional accuracy of the resultant casts made from two different impression materials (polyvinyl siloxane and polyether) by closed tray impression technique in parallel and angulated implants. Conclusion: On the basis of the results of this study, the use of both the impression materials i. e., polyether and polyvinyl siloxane impression is recommended for impression making in parallel as well as angulated implants...|$|R
40|$|TiAl {{castings}} {{are prone}} to various defects including bubbles entrained during the turbulent filling of moulds. The present research has exploited {{the principles of the}} Durville <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> technique to develop a novel process in which the Induction Skull Melting (ISM) of TiAl alloys in a vacuum chamber has been combined with controlled tilt pouring to achieve the tranquil transfer of the metal into a hot ceramic shell mould. Practical casting equipment has been developed to evaluate the feasibility of this process in parallel with the development of novel software to simulate and optimize it. The PHYSICA CFD code was used to simulate the filling, heat transfer and solidification during tilt pouring using a number of free surface modelling techniques, including the novel Counter Diffusion Method (CDM). In view of the limited superheat, particular attention was paid to the mould design to minimize heat loss and gas entrainment caused by interaction between the counter-flowing metal and gas streams. The model has been validated against real-time X-ray movies of the <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> of aluminium and against TiAl blade castings. Modelling has contributed to designing a mould to promote progressive filling of the casting and has led to the use of a parabolic tilting cycle to balance the competing requirements for rapid filling to minimize the loss of superheat and slow filling minimize the turbulence-induced defects...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} has investigated the modelling and optimisation of the <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> process of Titanium Aluminides (TiAl). This study {{is carried out}} in parallel with the experimental research undertaken in IRC at the University of Birmingham. They propose to use <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> inside a vacuum chamber and attempt to combine this <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> process with Induction Skull Melting (ISM). A totally novel process is developing for investment casting, which is suitable for casting gamma TiAl. As it is known, gamma TiAl alloys has great properties including low density, high specific yield strength, high specific stiffness, good oxidation resistance and good creep resistance at high temperature [Clemens - 2000][Appel et at. - 2000]. A worldwide research effort {{has been made to}} develop gamma TiAl because it can offer a great potential for reducing the weight of high performance components and also engine of power generation gas turbine. Titanium alloys are very reactive at molten condition, and so, they are melted in an ISM crucible in order to avoid crucible contamination. There is still a big challenge to produce a long blade, up to 40 cm, due to the low superheat provided by the Induction Skull Melting (ISM) furnace which is widely used to melt the alloys. Here computational simulation has been seen important to predict the casting defects and to help optimise the experimental process. Computational modelling for the casting process involves a range of interactions of physical phenomena such as heat transfer, free surface fluid flow, solidification and so on. A number of free surface modelling techniques are applied to simulate the interface between the molten metal entering the mould in the filling phase, and the gas escaping. The CFD code PHYSICA developed in the University of Greenwich is used to simulate the above physical phenomena and to simulate the fluid flow both within the rotating mould cavity/crucible assembly and in the porous mould wall (including vents). Modelling the mould in a finite volume method is cumbersome, so an alternative 3 D/ 1 D coupled transient heat transfer model has been developed in this study. It is {{based on the fact that}} the mould filling for titanium aluminide (TiAl) is carried out during a few seconds and the thermal conductivity of the mould material is very low. Heat can be assumed to transfer mainly in a direction perpendicular to the mould wall ID. ID transient heat transfer model is governed by ID heat conduction equation in the mould part where the coordinates of each defined cell centre were calculated rather than meshing them. The coupling method between ID and 3 D model is presented. The model is then validated using two simple geometries which describe two similar states in the mould filling as test cases. It has been applied to model short thin and long blades, especially to obtain accurate thermal boundaries. Comparisons with experiments have also been done. Across the presentation of the results, the factors affect the quality of the casting in the mould filling have been discussed. This thesis also presents a novel Counter Diffusion Method which was developed with suggestions from my supervisors as a corrective mechanism to counter numerical diffusion. This is a novel method to discretise the free surface equation fully implicitly in a fast, efficient way without numerical diffusion. Validation of the novel method was undertaken against the classical collapsing column experiment. The results showed that they are in good agreement. Then the method has been used to model a long thin blade for TiAl. A huge reduction in computational time is seen when the geometry is complex and massive amount of mesh cells are generated. That greatly speeds up the simulations. Solidification is modeled during the cooling which is following the filling stage. Gap formation between metal and mould is covered and the effects of the gap and gap size are presented by the application of model on a long twisted turbine blade.

40|$|No {{data are}} {{available}} about mechanical behavior of bulk glassy alloys (BGAs) in tension at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we investigated the effect of temperature on the mechanical behavior of ternary eutectic and hypoeutectic Zr-Cu-Al BGAs fabricated by an arc <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> method. Tensile tests were performed for the BGA plates with gauge dimensions of 5 mm in length, 1. 2 mm in width and 0. 5 mm in thickness at temperatures of 295, 223, 173 and 77 K, at an initial strain rate of 5 104 s 1. Measurements of elastic parameters were also made at temperatures from 97 to 342 K by an ultrasonic pulse method. It is found that the tensile strength and elongation for both BGAs increase with decreasing testing temperature, which is reported {{for the first time}} under a tensile condition. At cryogenic temperatures, the tensile elongation of the hypoeutectic Zr 59 Cu 31 Al 10 BGA tends to be higher than that of the eutectic Zr 50 Cu 40 Al 10 BGA, although the difference is small. Multiple shear bands are observed on the side surface deformed at lower temperatures. The Young’s and shear moduli, and Debye temperature monotonically increase with decreasing temperature. This indicates that the BGA becomes rigid and the effective atomic distance decreases at cryogenic temperatures, leading to the increase of the tensile strength at cryogenic temperatures.

Early in the 19 th century, German Bismarck had proposed a continuous casting process in his patent. The development of this method in the copper industry began in 1940 s, the type of equipment went through belt type, vibration mold, vertical traction type, <b>tilt</b> <b>casting</b> type and Horizontal traction type [1, 2]. Now, horizontal traction, as the most popular method abroad, because its products don’t need straightening, and consistency of properties along the length and high density of grain lead to the improvements of mechanical properties and electrical properties, its superiority in product quality and production efficiency is obvious.
