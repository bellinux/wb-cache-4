5|$|In March 2017 it was {{announced}} by the MCC that the law on handled the ball would be completely removed and subsumed into the law on obstructing the field. This means {{that the act of}} handling <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> still result in the batsman's dismissal, but will now always be recorded as obstructing the field. The new law is due to come into effect on 1 October 2017.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> go.|$|E

25|$|The upper {{panel in}} the image at right shows a ball in {{circular}} motion on a banked curve. The curve is banked at an angle θ from the horizontal, and {{the surface of the}} road is considered to be slippery. The objective is to find what angle the bank must have so the ball does not slide off the road. Intuition tells us that, on a flat curve with no banking at all, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> simply slide off the road; while with a very steep banking, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> slide to the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Tacklers' {{rights to}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> be {{restricted}} to 180 degrees, instead of 360 as in the current laws. This makes it nearly impossible for a defender to steal the ball while making a tackle.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, the {{corridor}} of uncertainty {{is an area where}} a cricket ball can pitch during a delivery: a narrow line on and just outside a batsman's off stump. The name is derived from the opinion that this is the area in which a batsman struggles most to determine whether to play forward or back, or to leave the delivery. If a batsman leaves the ball, there's a chance <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> turn inward and either bowl him or hit him with an increased chance of leg before wicket. If a batsman plays the ball, there's a chance <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> go to the outside instead, leading to an outside edge that can be easily caught.|$|E

25|$|Sixes and fours are automatic, {{there is}} no need to run if they deem <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> surely touch or go past the {{boundary}} rope. If the batsmen decide to run, they will be cancelled off, and four/six runs will be added to the score.|$|E
25|$|Swing bowling {{can also}} be roughly {{categorised}} as early swing or late swing, corresponding to when in the trajectory <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> change direction – the later the ball swings, the less chance the batter has of adjusting his/her shot {{to account for the}} swing.|$|E
25|$|If {{the ball}} is moving much more rapidly than it was spinning, {{translational}} friction will dominate. The ball's angular velocity will be increased after impact, but its horizontal velocity will be decreased. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> not exceed its original height and will keep spinning in the same direction.|$|E

50|$|Tennis {{balls are}} filled with air and are {{surfaced}} by a uniform felt-covered rubber compound. The felt delays flow separation in the boundary layer which reduces aerodynamic drag and gives <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> better flight properties. Often <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> have a number on them {{in addition to the}} brand name. This helps distinguish one set of balls from another of the same brand on an adjacent court.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the stage}} [...] "Mystic Mansion" [...] on Sonic Heroes, there are {{teleport}}ers called [...] "Switch Balls" [...] with symbols {{on the pad}} and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> that can allow players to teleport if they touch it. <b>The</b> active switch <b>ball</b> has glowing symbols on <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> These <b>will</b> release symbol particles spreading from the pad and the blue light starts to permeate on {{the middle of the}} screen. Once teleported to another room in the stage, <b>the</b> switch <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> stop glowing and become inactive. Thus, it cannot be reverted.|$|R
25|$|Newton's third law {{of action}} and {{reaction}} states that if the string exerts an inward centripetal force on the ball, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> exert an equal but outward reaction upon the string, shown in the free body diagram of the string (lower panel) as the reactive centrifugal force.|$|E
25|$|A caged metal ball may be {{arranged}} {{at the edge}} of an orifice. Upon seismic shock, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> roll into the orifice, sealing it to prevent gas flow. The ball may later be reset by the use of an external magnet. This device will respond only to ground motion.|$|E
25|$|If {{the ball}} is {{spinning}} much more rapidly than it was moving, rotational friction will dominate. The ball's angular velocity will be reduced after impact, but its horizontal velocity will be increased. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> be propelled forward but will not exceed its original height, and will keep spinning in the same direction.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe non-destruction {{determination}} of static coefficient-of-friction for round balls can be challenging. The traditional tilt-table test {{on an individual}} <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> just cause <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to roll {{off the table and}} little is accomplished. A three-ball test can be conducted however <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> tumble if <b>the</b> friction is too high. An additional problem occurs with this type of testing in that the precise moment of impending slip is determined by observing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> or ball sample material and this moment is hard to detect. A new nondestructive method of determining the precise moment of impending slip for a single-ball is presented using the center-of-pressure and a detectable change in the normal force acting on <b>the</b> <b>ball...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The film {{began with}} a prologue as the narrator {{explains}} to the viewers about how <b>the</b> Dragon <b>Balls,</b> seven orange balls with different number of red stars on each one, were forged and scattered throughout the Earth. It is said that when all seven are gathered together, the Eternal Dragon named Shenron; custodian of <b>the</b> Dragon <b>Balls,</b> <b>will</b> rise from his fiery lair and grant whoever summoned him any one wish. Afterwards, <b>the</b> Dragon <b>Balls</b> <b>will</b> again scatter {{all over the world}} while Shenron returns to his lair until another [...] "brave or foolish soul" [...] will find and reunite these magical balls.|$|R
25|$|The grubber {{is used in}} {{this manner}} to prevent the {{opposing}} team from trying to regather the ball or to force a mistake if they do try. A grubber also ensures that <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> fall {{in the field of}} play before going in to touch, which would result in a penalty otherwise. A punt in this situation is placed as close to the out of field line as possible, which gives the opposition little chances to regather.|$|E
25|$|Physically {{powerful}} batsmen often {{attempt to}} strike {{the ball on the}} rise, even though this obstructs their vision of the ball since it is not uncommon that their sheer brute force combined with the speed of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> cause it to fly to the boundary. This possibility, combined with the difficulty that the wicketkeeper will have trying to stop a high ball means that bouncers can be expensive in terms of runs against skilled batsmen.|$|E
25|$|Seam bowling is the act {{of using}} the seam of the ball to cause the ball to bounce in an {{unpredictable}} fashion when it hits the pitch. A good batsman {{will be able to}} predict where a ball is going to bounce and from that work out what height <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> be when it reaches him or her. By generating variations in bounce, the bowler can make it more likely the batsman will make a mistake in his assessment of the ball and give away their wicket.|$|E

25|$|If <b>the</b> cue <b>ball</b> hits {{an object}} ball {{at an angle}} and has follow on it, <b>the</b> cue <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> first travel on the tangent line and then parabolically arc forward from the tangent line in the {{direction}} of cue <b>ball</b> travel. By <b>the</b> same token, when such impact is made and <b>the</b> cue <b>ball</b> has draw on it, <b>the</b> cue <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> first travel on the tangent line and then parabolically arc backward from the tangent line in the opposite direction of cue ball travel. Whether follow or draw is on <b>the</b> cue <b>ball,</b> <b>the</b> faster <b>the</b> cue <b>ball</b> is traveling at the moment of impact, the farther it will travel on the tangent line before arcing forward or backward.|$|R
25|$|Tennis is {{a racket}} sport {{that can be}} played {{individually}} against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object {{of the game is}} to play the ball {{in such a way that}} the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> not gain a point, while the opposite player will.|$|E
25|$|Kicks in play can, if successful, {{result in}} rapid field advancement. Towards {{the end of}} the tackle count, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> often find its way to the best kicker on the team who will then return {{possession}} of the ball to the other side in the most favourable position for his team by kicking it down to the other end. These kicks are sometimes intended to go into touch (leave the field of play), resulting in a scrum to restart play. Scrums take a while to form, so this gives the attacking team a chance for a short rest before play resumes.|$|E
25|$|The various {{techniques}} of fast bowling {{lend themselves to}} three ways of getting the batsman out. They may be bowled or caught LBW either by speed, the yorker or by seam or swing causing the ball to move in toward them, in which case placement of fielders is irrelevant. Swing or seam may be employed to move the ball away from the batsman in which case <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>will</b> strike the outside edge of the bat and may {{be caught in the}} slips. A badly-played bouncer will either fly off the outside edge as above or may result in a mistimed shot that can be caught near the boundary.|$|E

Two of <b>the</b> lions have <b>balls</b> in their mouths and {{it is said that}} {{unmarried}} girls who can remove <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> eventually marry a prince. The two lions {{on the left side of}} the entrance are lionesses with a small cub beneath their paws, while those on the right are males with a ball beneath their feet.

5000|$|There {{are several}} types of balls used {{in this type of}} differential. Some of <b>the</b> most common <b>ball</b> {{materials}} used by high end racers are ceramic and tungsten based. The advantage to something like ceramic based balls are that they are much harder, and have a longer life expectancy. Often times when using less hard materials, <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> [...] "flat spot" [...] causing a semi locked direction of <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> This causes <b>the</b> differential to not turn with a smooth feeling and leaves it with an overall [...] "gritty" [...] feeling.|$|R
50|$|Often the {{electroscope}} {{will have}} a pair of suspended pith balls. This allows one to tell at a glance whether <b>the</b> pith <b>balls</b> are charged. If one of <b>the</b> pith <b>balls</b> is touched to a charged object, charging it, the second one will be attracted and touch it, communicating some of the charge {{to the surface of}} <b>the</b> second <b>ball.</b> Now both <b>balls</b> have <b>the</b> same polarity charge, so they repel each other. They hang in an inverted 'V' shape with <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> spread apart. <b>The</b> distance between <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>will</b> give a rough idea of the magnitude of the charge.|$|R
