50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> was loaded, <b>the</b> {{hydropneumatic}} action shunted {{it forward}} and {{up through a}} slot in the shield. After discharging, the recoil mechanism forced <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> back into its pit. This protected <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> crew while loading and made <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> a very difficult target for an enemy ship to hit.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> {{was then}} {{dismantled}} {{and moved to}} {{the northern part of the}} eastern front, where an attack was planned on Leningrad. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> was placed 30km (18.6mi) from the city near the railway station of Taizy. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> was fully operational when the attack was cancelled. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> then spent <b>the</b> winter of 1942/43 near Leningrad.|$|R
5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> directly.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> on {{the forward}} turret roof were {{transferred}} to the superstructure in 1914 and <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure in 1914–1915; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> on the aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft turret roof.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> {{on top of}} Cochranes {{centreline}} 9.2-inch turrets {{were removed}} in 1915–16. The aftermost 3-pounder guns on the superstructure were removed during 1917 as well as <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> {{on top of the}} forward 9.2-inch wing turrets. This reduced her total to twenty 3-pounder guns, excluding the AA guns. Cochranes foremast was converted to a tripod mast to support the weight of a fire-control director in 1917, but the director was not actually fitted until August 1918.|$|E

40|$|Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS) is a {{critical}} capability of the U. S. Navy, and is used to protect amphibious forces. Often, the execution of NGFS is time-critical. The accuracy of the shooting (called fall-of-shot) and {{the time it takes}} <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> crew to shoot <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> (called <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> cycle time), are two critical attributes of a mission. If the rounds land on or near the target, and if <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> crew can fire <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> quickly, <b>the</b> NGFS mission is most likely to be successful...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> {{was fitted}} {{with a set of}} side sights {{on each side of the}} barrel. This enabled <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> to be sighted for indirect, or direct fire, from either side of <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> A flat surface was {{machined}} on top of the barrel for a clinometer to be used, enabling <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> to be levelled, or to provide an alternate method of indirect sighting.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> were {{controlled}} from a Battery Commander's Post on the roof, from where commands {{to the gun}} detachments could be relayed via voice pipes. Three depression range finders were installed on the roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns' targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun once every two minutes. Rather than firing all <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> at once, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were positioned {{so that they could}} be fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides.|$|E
5|$|The ships mounted four 10-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns in twin-gun turrets {{fore and}} aft of the superstructure. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> could fire both solid shot and {{explosive}} shells. They were mounted on carriages that used hydraulic jacks to elevate and depress <b>the</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ships {{would have}} been {{similarly}} equipped to the preceding Deutschland-class ships. The ships would have mounted six of the same /52 C/28 quick-firing guns in the same triple turret mounts. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> had an actual bore diameter of , and fired both armor-piercing and high-explosive shells; both shells weighed 300kg (661.4lb). <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> used two sets of propellant charges: a 36.0kg (79.4lb) fore charge in a silk bag and a 71.0kg (156.6lb) main charge in a brass case. The shells were fired at 910meters per second (2,986fps), and at maximum elevation of 40degrees, a range of 36,475m (39,890yards). <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> had a rate of fire of 2.5 rounds per minute. However, eight guns were considered, had there been a quadruple turret available. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> were supplied {{by a total of}} 900 shells, for a total of 150 rounds per gun.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} main design {{alternatives}} to the broadside. In one design, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were placed in an armored casemate amidships: this arrangement was called the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery'. In the other, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> could be placed on a rotating platform {{to give them a}} broad field of fire; when fully armored, this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored, a barbette.|$|E
5|$|These guns fired 100lb (45.4kg) shells {{at a rate}} {{of between}} 57 per minute. The shells were fired with a muzzle {{velocity}} of 2,775fps (846mps), though <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were capable of higher velocities. It was reduced in order to standardize the performance of all the 6inch guns in Royal Navy service, which would simplify range calculations for guns of the calibre. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> could elevate to 20°, which enabled a maximum range of 15,800yd (14,450m).|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} armament plan Kronan was to be equipped with 124–126guns; 34–36guns {{on each of the}} gundecks and an additional 18 shared between forecastle and sterncastle decks. Guns were classed by the weight of the cannonballs they fired, varying between 3 and 36pounds (1.3–15.3kg). <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> themselves weighed from a few hundred kg (400–500lbs) up to four tonnes (4.4 tons) with the heaviest pieces placed {{in the middle of the}} lower-most gundeck with successively lighter ones on the decks above. Kronans most lethal weapons were the 30- and 36-pounders on the lowest gundeck which had a range and firepower that outclassed the armament of almost any other warship. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> lighter than 18-pounders were primarily intended to inflict damage on the enemy's crew and rigging rather than the hull.|$|E
50|$|When the student's bent bottom-three {{fingers are}} located just below <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> butt, <b>the</b> student raises his elbow (thus his gun hand) {{straight}} up, {{and the bottom}} three fingers scoop up <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> butt and lift <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> out of <b>the</b> holster without attempting to wrap themselves around the butt. This first move is completed when the muzzle of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> is an inch above {{the mouth of the}} holster.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} part of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> was <b>the</b> ammunition trailer ("trailer, artillery, No 27"). <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> was hooked to it and the trailer hooked to the tractor for towing. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> did not need a limber and could be hooked directly to a tractor. The trailer provided the brakes as only a hand-brake was fitted to <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> carriage. <b>The</b> trailer carried ammunition; thirty-two rounds in trays (two rounds per tray) in the trailer protected by two doors. Ammunition was also carried in <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> tractor with <b>the</b> detachment and various gun stores. Some stores, such as sights, were carried cased on <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> Each section (two guns) had a third tractor that carried ammunition and towed two ammunition trailers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> was {{commissioned}} and first fired in 1892. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> emplacement was provided with two range finder positions.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns {{which can}} be field-stripped, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|All of the castellations {{around and}} near the bridge were built to protect it, {{including}} Cromwell's Castle, The Salt Battery (Fort Eliza), Fort Falkland and the Martello Tower. However, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> mounted on these forts {{could be used to}} destroy the bridge if necessary, as well as to bombard attacking forces on the river.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> on the aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft turret roof.|$|E
50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> {{carriage}} {{was an old}} design, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> {{itself was}} a new design created by Krupp; though the design had been shelved {{at the time of}} its conception. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> had two distinctive features; first was the large four-baffle muzzle brake and the second was the vertical sliding block breech that was considered unusual for a Krupp designed <b>gun.</b> <b>The</b> breech operated in a semi-automatic fashion; once <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> was fired <b>the</b> breech block would open and eject the spent casing and remained open to allow for rapid reloading. The breech would then be closed once the next round was loaded and <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> was then ready to fire.|$|R
50|$|Steam {{was again}} raised the {{following}} morning and, in trying to move <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> back, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> slipped <b>the</b> rear bogie wheels off the rails. There were nine lifting jacks on the train. With the aid of these <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> was got on to the track again and brought back to Bayonvillers {{the following morning}} at 2 o'clock, and a receipt obtained from the officer sent up from Army Headquarters to take over <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> was complete in every detail, ready for firing, with 37 rounds of ammunition in the trucks. Each shell weighed over 320 kg (704 lbs).|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Mark 16" [...] {{designation}} {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> being 16th in the 6-inch series of designs, not <b>the</b> turret <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> is mounted in. Smaller guns {{at that time}} had a Mark number {{for the type of}} mounting. In modern times the USN refers primarily to the Mark number of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> mount (turret), but in WW II the model of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> was <b>the</b> primary reference point. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> turrets for 6-inch and larger <b>guns</b> of <b>the</b> 1920s through WW II were known according to the class of ship the turret was to be mounted on.|$|R
5|$|At 13.5degrees of elevation, the 30.5cm gun {{could hit}} targets out to 16,200m (17,717yards) with armor-piercing shells. After the turrets were {{improved}} to allow elevation to 16degrees, the range correspondingly increased to 20,400m (22,310yd). At {{a range of}} 12,800m (14,000yd), the L3 armor-piercing shells fired by the gun were expected to penetrate 254mm (10in) of armor plate. At 15,000m (16,000yd) {{the effectiveness of the}} shell decreased; it was able to pierce 229mm (9in)-thick plate. The range of the World War II guns was significantly greater than <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> used in World War I. With the 405kg shell at 45degrees, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> had a maximum range of 32,000m (35,000yd). With the 415kg shell at 49.2degrees, the range was 41,300m (45,166yd), and with the lighter 250kg round at 49.1degrees, the maximum range was 51,400m (56,200yd).|$|E
5|$|At 18:35, {{although}} Meldrum {{believed they}} {{could at least}} hold where they were, the regiment was ordered by Chetwode to withdraw. At 19:00 horse teams arrived to recover <b>the</b> <b>guns,</b> and at 19:45 they slowly retired back to the suburbs of Gaza. At 21:40 they rejoined the brigade and left the town. The next morning at 08:30 they arrived at Deir El Belah, where the division was now located. Casualties during the battle had again been rather light, at one dead and nineteen wounded. They had captured 197 prisoners, as well as <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> and field hospital.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the {{decision}} was made, French shipyards were heavily committed to producing vessels for the French Navy. So, despite its intention to develop a French concept, the KSCS engaged Yarrow Shipbuilders in Glasgow, Scotland, to build the ships. Unlike the French, who preferred to install guns of their own manufacture, Yarrow was happy to order <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> from the Czechoslovak firm Škoda. The initial Yarrow design {{was based on an}} enlarged version of the British Shakespeare class, with five Skoda 14 cm/56 naval guns. Excessive top weight resulted in the deletion of one of <b>the</b> <b>guns,</b> to be replaced with a seaplane mounting. The final version replaced the seaplane mounting with improved anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
25|$|The GAU-8/A {{utilizes}} recoil adapters. They are {{the interface}} between <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> housing and <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> mount. By absorbing (in compression) the recoil forces, they spread {{the time of the}} recoil impulse and counter recoil energy transmitted to the supporting structure when <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> is fired.|$|R
50|$|It afforded <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> crew {{protection}} from direct fire by raising <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> over <b>the</b> parapet (or wall {{in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>gun)</b> only when {{it was to be}} fired, otherwise leaving it at a lower level, where it was also able to be loaded easily.|$|R
