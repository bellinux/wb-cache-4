5|$|During World War I <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> {{became a}} haven for those opposed to the war. Henri Barbusse once gave a reading from his anti-war novel Under Fire and Barney hosted a Women's Congress for Peace at the Rue Jacob. Other {{visitors}} to <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> during the war included Oscar Milosz, Auguste Rodin and poet Alan Seeger, who came while on leave from the French Foreign Legion.|$|E
5|$|Created in {{the early}} 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> {{was taken over by}} SS general Reinhard Heydrich and his {{subordinate}} Walter Schellenberg in 1939. The brothel was managed by original owner Kitty Schmidt throughout its entire existence. The plan was to seduce top German dignitaries, foreign visitors as well as diplomats with alcohol and women so they would disclose secrets or express their honest opinions on Nazi-related topics and individuals. Notable guests included Heydrich himself, Joseph Dietrich, Galeazzo Ciano and Joseph Goebbels. The building housing <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> was destroyed in an air raid in 1942 and the project quickly lost its importance. Salon Kitty has been the inspiration or subject to many brothels featured in films involving Nazi espionage.|$|E
5|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} go on holiday {{together}} and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans {{to go on a}} round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David. Audrey's money is tied up in <b>the</b> <b>salon,</b> so she asks David to sign it back to her so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> back as he thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.|$|E
2500|$|The historiography of <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> is {{far from}} straightforward. <b>The</b> <b>salons</b> have been studied in depth by a mixture of feminist, Marxist, cultural, social and {{intellectual}} historians. Each of these methodologies focuses on different aspects of <b>the</b> <b>salons,</b> and thus have varying analyses of the salons’ importance in terms of French history and the Enlightenment as a whole. [...] Major historiographical debates focus {{on the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> and <b>the</b> public sphere, as well as the role of women within <b>the</b> <b>salons.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>salons</b> of Early Modern Revolutionary France {{played an}} {{integral}} {{role in the}} cultural and intellectual development of France. <b>The</b> <b>salons</b> were seen by contemporary writers as a cultural hub, responsible for the dissemination of good manners and sociability. It was not merely manners that <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> supposedly spread but also ideas, as <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> became a centre of intellectual {{as well as social}} exchange, playing host to many members of the Republic of Letters. In contrast to other Early Modern institutions, women played an important and visible role within <b>the</b> <b>salons.</b> <b>The</b> extent of this role is, however, heavily contested by some historians.|$|R
2500|$|Recent historiography of <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> {{has been}} {{dominated}} by Jürgen Habermas' work, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (triggered largely by its translation into French, in 1978, and then English, in 1989), which argued that <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> were of great historical importance. [...] Theatres of conversation and exchange – such as <b>the</b> <b>salons,</b> and <b>the</b> coffeehouses in England – {{played a critical role in}} the emergence of what Habermas termed the public sphere, which emerged in cultural-political contrast to court society. [...] Thus, while women retained a dominant role in the historiography of <b>the</b> <b>salons,</b> <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> received increasing amounts of study, much of it in direct response to, or heavily influenced by Habermas’ theory.|$|R
5|$|Two {{years later}} he was awarded an Honorary Grand Prix at <b>the</b> <b>Salón</b> Nacional and co-founded a mural {{workshop}} with fellow artists Spilimbergo, Juan Carlos Castagnino, Demetrio Urruchúa, and Manuel Colmeiro. The artists decorated {{the dome of the}} Galerías Pacifico.|$|E
5|$|Whistler {{created the}} {{painting}} {{in the winter of}} 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> in Paris, but eventually accepted at <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. The White Girl shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics both as an allegory of innocence and its loss, and as a religious allusion to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, the {{clientele}} of Salon Kitty decreased. In July 1942, {{the building was}} demolished during a British air attack and the brothel had to be relocated. Within the year the SD decided to abandon the project and handed <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> back to Schmidt, with the threat that she would keep silent or face retaliation.|$|E
50|$|In 1922 Hirsch was a {{founding}} director and recording secretary of <b>the</b> <b>Salons</b> of America. Hamilton Easter Field created <b>the</b> <b>Salons</b> {{as an alternative}} to the Society of Independent Artists which he felt unfairly was giving preferential treatment to some of its members. Hirsch would remain as a director and would continue to show at <b>the</b> <b>Salons</b> exhibitions until 1936.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>salons</b> were {{literary}} {{institutions that}} {{relied on a}} new ethic of polite sociability based on hospitality, distinction, and the entertainment of <b>the</b> elite. <b>The</b> <b>salons</b> were open to intellectuals, who used them to find protectors and sponsors and to fashion themselves as 'hommes du monde.' In <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> after 1770 there emerged a radical critique of worldliness, inspired by Rousseau. These radicals denounced the mechanisms of polite sociability {{and called for a}} new model of the independent writer, who would address the public and the nation.|$|R

5|$|In the 1900s Barney held early {{gatherings of}} <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> {{at her house}} in Neuilly. The {{entertainment}} included poetry readings and theatricals (in which Colette sometimes performed). Mata Hari performed a dance once, riding into the garden as Lady Godiva on a white horse harnessed with turquoise cloisonné.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Radclyffe Hall drew a crowd after her novel The Well of Loneliness had been {{banned in the}} UK.

At another Friday salon in the 1930s Virgil Thomson sang from Four Saints in Three Acts, an opera based on a {{libretto}} by Gertrude Stein.|$|E
5|$|The 1981 BBC comedy drama Private Schulz, about a German {{fraudster}} {{and petty}} criminal's unwilling World War II {{service in the}} SS, prominently features <b>the</b> <b>salon.</b> In the first episode, Schultz has been given the job of manning a listening post in the brothel's basement and recording the conversations {{picked up by the}} hidden microphones.|$|E

5|$|As in Iaşi, Goldfaden {{arrived in}} Bucharest with his {{reputation}} already established. He and his players performed {{first in the}} early spring at <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> Lazăr Cafegiu on Calea Văcăreşti (Văcăreşti Avenue, {{in the heart of the}} ghetto), then, once the weather turned warm, at the Jigniţa garden, a pleasant tree-shaded beer garden on Str. Negru Vodă that up until then had drawn only a neighborhood crowd. He filled out his cast from the great pool of Jewish vocal talent: synagogue cantors. He also recruited two eminently respectable classically trained prima donnas, the sisters Margaretta and Annetta Schwartz.|$|E
5|$|Audrey and David begin feuding {{over the}} rights to <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> and Lewis notices that the arguing is taking its toll on Audrey's health. He {{suggests}} they go to Wales {{for a few days}} instead. When Audrey serves David with an injunction to try and reclaim her business, an argument breaks out and Audrey suffers a heart attack. Lewis comforts Audrey until the ambulance arrives and stays with her at the hospital. Lewis and Audrey go on holiday. On her return, Audrey reveals to her family that Lewis disappeared from the Eurostar on the way home. Lewis later turns up at <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> to see Audrey and explains that he disappeared because he saw Penny Thornley (Susan Hanson), a woman he once conned. Lewis asks Audrey to run away with him and she agrees. While they are packing, Audrey's family and Penny arrive. Penny reveals that she is going to call the police, but Audrey stops her and gives her the money Lewis took. When Nick refuses to give Lewis his job back, Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) hires him to work at The Rovers Return.|$|E
5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did {{not plan}} to sell it, he gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000)– more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At <b>the</b> <b>Salon,</b> the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio.|$|E

5|$|Gauguin {{was celebrated}} by the Parisian avant-garde after the posthumous {{retrospective}} exhibitions at <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> d'Automne in 1903 and 1906. The power evoked by his work {{led directly to}} Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. According to David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio {{was a friend of}} Gauguin and held several of his works in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 Berni {{became the}} {{apprentice}} of Catalan craftsman N. Bruxadera at the Buxadera and Co. stained glass company. He later studied painting at the Rosario Catalá Center {{where he was}} described as a child prodigy. In 1920 seventeen of his oil paintings were exhibited at <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> Mari. On November 4, 1923 his impressionist landscapes were praised by critics in the daily newspapers La Nación and La Prensa.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell {{returned}} to Europe in 1923 with Tannahill and Kaesche, touring Italy and spending {{two months in}} Cassis before settling in Paris late that summer. Her friend Flora Schoenfeld convinced her to dye her hair red in the fashion of many women in their circle. While in Paris Lazzell studied Cubism and geometric abstraction alongside Fernand Léger, André Lhote, and Albert Gleizes. Lazzell's work was exhibited at <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> d'Automne and the American Women's Club in 1923.|$|E

5000|$|The {{second reason}} women were {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> was because <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> were based on high society's mixed gender sociability. [...] "The women of <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> ensured <b>the</b> 'decency of the household', enlivened conversation, and served as the guarantors of politeness.'" [...] A woman's presence ensured civilized conversation, not as [...] "governors", but as a discrete way of inducing men to control their conduct. Lilti also maintains that <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> were not used {{as a way for}} women to further their education, but as a gathering for social events involving both men and women [...] "in which hostesses welcomed into their homes both male and female socialites, as well as writers, as part of a mixed-gendered sociability dedicated to elite forms of entertainment: dining together, conversation, theatre, music, games, belles-lettres." [...] There was no emphasis on serious intellectual discussion; it was merely a form of entertainment that emphasized the hierarchy of social ranks.|$|R
5|$|Marrash {{was famous}} for <b>the</b> <b>salon</b> she held in the home she shared with her husband. She had {{travelled}} to Europe once, and was impressed by what she saw of life there. As related by Joseph Zeidan:Upon her return in Aleppo, Maryana Marrash turned her house into a gathering place {{for a group of}} celebrated writers who met there on a regular basis to cultivate each other's friendship and discuss literature, music, and political and social issues.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the famous}} Modernist writers who {{spent time in}} Paris, Ernest Hemingway never made an {{appearance}} at <b>the</b> <b>salon.</b> James Joyce came once or twice but didn't care for it. Marcel Proust never attended a Friday, though he did come to 20, Rue Jacob once to talk with Barney about lesbian culture whilst doing research for In Search of Lost Time. His visit was delayed repeatedly owing to his poor health, and when the meeting finally did happen he was too nervous {{to bring up the}} subject he had come to talk about.|$|E
5|$|Shows of her {{paintings}} were held after her death. The memorial {{exhibition at the}} Louvre, opened by American ambassador Myron T. Herrick, included 53 of {{her paintings}} in 1924.
