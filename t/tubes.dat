5|$|A new factory was {{constructed}} at 230 Duffy Avenue, Hicksville, New York, to manufacture electron <b>tubes</b> and semiconductors. Miniature receiving <b>tubes,</b> magnetrons, X-ray <b>tubes,</b> Geiger-Muller <b>tubes,</b> and large transmitting <b>tubes</b> were also manufactured at this location. This location became the headquarters for North American Philips (NAP). The factory {{was completed in}} 1953 and closed in 1989. All assets were then sold to Richardson Electronics of rural Lafox, near Batavia, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to cuffed or uncuffed, preformed endotracheal <b>tubes</b> are also available. The oral and nasal RAE <b>tubes</b> (named after the inventors Ring, Adair and Elwyn) {{are the most}} widely used of the preformed <b>tubes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neon {{is used in}} vacuum <b>tubes,</b> {{high-voltage}} indicators, lightning arresters, {{wave meter}} <b>tubes,</b> television <b>tubes,</b> and helium–neon lasers.

5|$|Termites {{construct}} shelter <b>tubes,</b> {{also known}} as earthen <b>tubes</b> or mud <b>tubes,</b> that start from the ground. These shelter <b>tubes</b> {{can be found on}} walls and other structures. Constructed by termites during the night, a time of higher humidity, these <b>tubes</b> provide protection to termites from potential predators, especially ants. Shelter <b>tubes</b> also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in any other way. These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour. The size of these shelter <b>tubes</b> depends on the amount of food sources that are available. They range from less than 1cm to several cm in width, but may extend dozens of metres in length.|$|E
5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic {{in using the}} <b>tubes,</b> issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the <b>tubes</b> anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not accepted in the United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum <b>tubes</b> was heavily waning {{in the face of}} the rise of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines. Kates went on to a distinguished career in Canadian engineering, but did not return to working on vacuum <b>tubes</b> or computer games.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of double-lumen endo-bronchial <b>tubes</b> that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw <b>tubes).</b> These <b>tubes</b> are typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These <b>tubes</b> enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during thoracic surgery, as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the thoracic cavity.|$|E
5|$|While Klein's use of {{aluminium}} for a bicycle frames {{was not entirely}} novel, his use of large diameter <b>tubes</b> was.

5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process <b>tubes</b> from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional <b>tubes</b> came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra <b>tubes</b> allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E
5|$|All {{the above}} Raman modes can be {{observed}} both as Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only <b>tubes</b> whose band gap energy {{is similar to the}} laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band gap of individual <b>tubes,</b> can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used in the measurement, which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E
5|$|Alternate plans {{included}} constructing {{two sets}} of two <b>tubes,</b> one for commuter and freight service from the LIRR {{and the other for}} rapid transit, or two tunnels each with individual <b>tubes</b> for freight and subway service. The freight service would have occurred during off-peak hours only, but simultaneous with subway service, with passenger trains running in 30-minute or one-hour headways during these times. A 1912 proposal had freight running at night between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., while the 1925 plans called for joint freight and passenger service during early mornings (5 a.m. to 6 a.m.), middays (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and overnights (8 p.m. to 5 a.m.).|$|E

30|$|The solar {{receiver}} <b>tube</b> is {{the most}} important part of the PTC due to its thermal and optical performance. This performance depends on the solar absorber materials, the prevention of heat loss by the glass envelope <b>tube,</b> the distance between the glass <b>tube</b> and the absorber <b>tube,</b> and the coating materials used on the absorber <b>tube</b> [2]. In this prototype, the solar receiver <b>tube</b> consists of a SS <b>tube</b> coated with three different thicknesses of Ni–Al coating. A glass envelope <b>tube</b> is fitted over the absorber <b>tube.</b> There is a vacuum between the absorber and the glass envelope <b>tube.</b> Coupling joints (made of Teflon) are used to fit the glass envelope <b>tube</b> at both ends to achieve an airtight enclosure and maintain a vacuum inside the solar receiver <b>tube.</b> This is one of the more complicated parts of the construction process. The vacuum is maintained to achieve a high amount of thermal energy in the absorber and to prevent heat loss.|$|R
25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike.
