To systematically review the measurement properties (i. e. internal consistency, reproducibility, validity, responsiveness and interpretability) of all performance-based methods which {{have been used to}} measure the physical function of patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Methods. A systematic search was conducted in Medline, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Embase. Standardized criteria were applied to assess the quality of the clinimetric studies and the measurement properties. Results. Twenty-six performance-based methods were included: 13 walking <b>tests,</b> two stair-climb <b>tests,</b> <b>one</b> chair <b>test</b> and ten multi-item <b>tests.</b> Three out of seven multi-activity <b>tests</b> were <b>tested</b> for internal consistency and two were rated positively. Fourteen <b>tests</b> were <b>tested</b> for reliability and five were rated positively. The absolute measurement error (agreement) was assessed for 10 <b>tests.</b> Only <b>one</b> <b>test</b> received a positive rating. Fourteen <b>tests</b> were <b>tested</b> for construct validity.

For example, the <b>test</b> statistic is invariant against re-ordering the outcomes. To remedy the shortcoming, G.

As consecutive tuples overlap, we call this <b>test</b> the overlapping chi-square <b>test.</b> Compared with the conventional <b>one,</b> this <b>test</b> checks the interdependence as well as the distribution of experiment outcomes and is thus more comprehensive.

40|$|Deciding {{the order}} of {{differencing}} {{is an important part}} in the specification of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) mode. In most, though not all, cases this means deciding whether to use the original observations or their first differences. Common <b>test</b> procedures used in this context are some variants of autoregressive unit root <b>tests.</b> In these <b>tests,</b> <b>one</b> <b>tests</b> the null hypothesis that {{the order of}} differencing is one against the alternative that it is zero. The null hypothesis thus states that the original series is nonstationary and integrated of order one, whereas the alternative assumes that it is stationary. In this paper the situation is reversed so that our null hypothesis states that the original series is stationary, whereas the alternative states that it is integrated of order one. In our approach the use of a differenced series thus means overdifferencing and, consequently, a model with a moving average unit root. <b>Testing</b> for this moving average unit root is the topic of this paper. As discussed by Saikkonen and Luukkonen [26] and Tanaka [31], <b>test</b> procedures obtained for this null hypothesis {{can also be used to}} <b>test</b> the null hypothesis that a multivariate time series is cointegrated with a given theoretical cointegrating vector. Since the null hypothesis of cointegration is often of interest and cannot be naturally <b>tested</b> by autoregressive unit root <b>tests,</b> this connection provides an important motivation for the <b>test</b> procedures of this paper. ...|$|R
