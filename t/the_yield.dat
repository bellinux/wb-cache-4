Investigations by Hertzberg et al. (2003) used a cone calorimeter to assess <b>the</b> <b>yields</b> of amines, aminoisocyanates and isocyanates from the flaming combustion of a flexible polyurethane foam. <b>The</b> average combined <b>yield</b> of isocyanates recovered was 0.869  mg g− 1 and <b>the</b> average <b>yield</b> of amines and aminoisocyanates was 0.321  mg g− 1. These yields are comparable to that of the results reported by Blomqvist et al. (2007). Additionally, the authors reported a yield of 13 – 15  mg g− 1 of CO, 1.4 – 1.5  mg g− 1 of HCN, and 10 – 12  mg g− 1 of NO. The authors noted that <b>the</b> <b>yields</b> of <b>the</b> toxicants produced an atmosphere in the tests which fell well below their Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) values.

5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much {{attention}} has been given to the compound nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>yields</b> of H 2 S show {{different}} trends {{compared with}} those of CO 2. For anhydrous experiments, <b>the</b> <b>yields</b> of H 2 S increased from 1.1 to 10.8  mL/g TOC before EasyR o% reached 1 %, and then <b>the</b> <b>yields</b> remained unchanged with increasing temperature and EasyR o%. On the contrary, in both hydrous experiments, <b>the</b> <b>yields</b> of H 2 S were substantially lower when EasyR o% was less than 1.5 %, especially in the experiments with uranium ore. When EasyR o% is larger than 1.5 %, yields of hydrous experiments without uranium ore (8.9 – 26.4  mL/g TOC) exceeded those of anhydrous experiments. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>yields</b> of experiments with U-ore gradually increased, but were still lower than those of the anhydrous pyrolysis. The phenomenon may be due to H 2 S being removed by dissolution in water, and rapid reaction with the iron or uranium contained in the mineral assemblage to form pyrrhotite (Fe 1 –x S) (Lewan 1993). Both hydrous pyrolysis tests displayed a very similar evolution pattern in terms of <b>the</b> <b>yields</b> of H 2 (Table  2; Fig.  2 d). The values increased from the initial value of 0.4  mL/g TOC (EasyR o% =  1.59 %) to 3.9  mL/g TOC (EasyR o% =  2.5 %). They are substantially higher than those in anhydrous experiments, with the values from 0.1  mL/g TOC (EasyR o% =  1.8 %) to 1.6  mL/g TOC (EasyR o% =  2.5 %).|$|R

The most significant differences between benzene extracts from Greek lignites and Riebeck crude montan wax were the differences in melting points and the greater resin content of the Greek waxes. Extraction with benzene/methanol mixture instead of benzene gave higher yields and extracts characterized by higher melting points, and higher acid and ester values. The compatibility of the extracts with paraffin wax was low; only benzene extract from Ptolemais lignite was completely miscible. No relation was found between <b>the</b> wax <b>yield</b> and <b>the</b> ratio volatile matter/fixed carbon of the coal.

5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers.

They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to <b>the</b> <b>yield.</b> If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that phosphoramidites activated with 1H-tetrazole react, to a small extent, with the O6 position of guanosine.

Three correlated signals were observed on 18 May 2011 that matched the predicted alpha decay energies of 299Ubn and its daughter 295Og, as well as the experimentally known decay energy of its granddaughter 291Lv: the decay chain could thus be interpreted as beginning from 299Ubn and undergoing four successive alpha decays to the spontaneously fissioning 283Cn, with the final alpha from 287Fl having been missed. However, the lifetimes of these possible decays differed from theoretical expectations, and the results could not be confirmed due to lack of beam time.|$|E
