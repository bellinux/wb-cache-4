5|$|In 1951, the California Supreme Court affirmed in Stoumen v. Reilly {{the right}} of homosexuals to {{assemble}} peacefully. To assist homosexuals with legal problems, in 1951 labor activist Harry Hay started the Mattachine Society, from his living room in Los Angeles. A few years later, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin started the Daughters of Bilitis with six other women in San Francisco, initially <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to socialize without fear of harassment or arrest. Within a few years, both organizations learned {{of each other and}} grew to have similar goals: helping assimilate homosexuals into general society, working for legal reform to repeal sodomy laws, and assisting those who were arrested. Both groups were headquartered in San Francisco by 1957.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1937, the BSA {{held its}} first {{national}} Scout jamboree in Washington, D. C., attended by 25,000Scouts and Scouters. In addition to overseeing the innovative event itself, Goodman's public relations service did yeoman work to ensure extensive news media coverage. A jamboree press tent accommodated 626 news media reporters, photographers, and broadcasters. Sixty-four news releases were issued and the public relations service assisted {{in the making of}} 11newsreels and 53magazine articles. The three major U.S. radio networks of the time, NBC, CBS and Mutual, all set up complete broadcasting studios near the jamboree headquarters to produce almost 19hours of live, on-site jamboree coverage broadcast coast-to-coast. Celebrities also visited the jamboree, including well-known broadcaster Lowell Thomas and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While at the jamboree, Scouts also attended a three-game baseball series between the Washington Senators and the Boston Red Sox at Griffith Stadium, with Goodman arranging for Eagle Scouts <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of honor with President Roosevelt in the stands (pictured).|$|E

Buffet-model bassoons are currently made in Paris by Buffet Crampon and the atelier Ducasse (Romainville, France). The Selmer Company stopped fabrication of French system bassoons a few years ago. Some players, for example the late Gerald Corey in Canada, have learned to play both types and will alternate between them depending on the repertoire.|$|E
25|$|The Yorkshire Committee still {{considered}} Cordingley <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> within the squad, particularly as his bowling style was different {{to that of}} Rhodes. However, Cordingley believed he would only be Rhodes' reserve and refused a contract in 1899. Instead, he became the professional at a cricket club in Nottinghamshire before moving to Sussex. He played club cricket in Brighton and qualified for the County team after making a good impression on the local press. He first played for Sussex in 1901 and, in total, he played 15 first-class games for the team, but his only notable performances were in 1902: he took five wickets for 22 runs against Nottinghamshire and shared a partnership of 115 for the ninth wicket with K. S. Ranjitsinhji. He remained with the club in 1903 but was not a first choice in the team and played only intermittently afterwards until 1905. He continued to live in Sussex and became a player, coach and groundsman at Pease Pottage, earning a good reputation for encouraging cricket in the local area. He died in 1945, aged 72.|$|E

This study used data from the National Survey of Current and Former Foster Parents to examine relationships between reasons for fostering and types of services and length of service foster parents provide.

Those who fostered to help children with special problems were more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> child <b>placed,</b> <b>had</b> more children, and had fostered more types of special needs children. Parents who fostered because their children were grown were more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> child <b>placed,</b> <b>had</b> more children, {{and were more likely}} to intend to continue fostering. Conversely, parents who wanted to be loved or who wanted companionship fostered fewer children. Implications for improving foster family utilization are discussed...|$|R

Martin and Lyon recalled later, [...] "Women needed privacy...not only from the watchful eye of the police, but from gaping tourists in the bars and from inquisitive parents and families." [...] Although unsure of how exactly to proceed with the group, they began to meet regularly, realized they should be organized, and quickly elected Martin as president. From the start they had a clear focus to educate other women about lesbians, and reduce their self-loathing brought on by the socially repressive times.|$|E

The ordinance required these and other private social groups to abandon their traditional code of secrecy and identify their members for the city's Human Relations Commission. In protest, the 19th century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season, but returned to the parade schedule in 2000.
