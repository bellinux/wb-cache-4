The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise that schools might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components: a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best <b>teaching</b> <b>practices,</b> emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form.|$|E

The study was necessitated by the lack of information on whether <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> really provides an effective context or not. A literature study focusing on planning of <b>teaching</b> <b>practice,</b> preparation of student teachers for <b>teaching</b> <b>practice,</b> placement of student teachers for <b>teaching</b> <b>practice,</b> mentoring during <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> as well as supervision and assessment of <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> was conducted. The activity and situated learning theories provided a theoretical framework for studying <b>teaching</b> <b>practice.</b> The mixed-methods approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used and data was collected through questionnaires and focus group discussions. The participants in the study were: thirty (30) student teachers in their third year of study; ten (10) host teachers who were hosting student teachers at the time of data collection for this study and ten (10) university supervisors responsible for <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> supervision. Data from closed-ended questionnaire items were analysed statistically. Frequencies and percentages were derived. Content analysis was used to analyse qualitative data. The results of the study revealed that there was a serious lack of communication between the university and the schools used for <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> and as a result student teachers were subjected {{to a wide range of}} treatment when they arrived at the schools.

Due to the combination of such barriers, girls are disproportionately affected by the direct and opportunity cost of schooling, which prevents girls from very poor households from attending school. Opportunity costs for girls' education include lost time that would otherwise be spent doing household chores and care work. School feeding programs reduce the costs of sending girls to school and allow for an increased number of girls to be sent to school by their families. Furthermore, improvements in female literacy that come from increased education have been linked to declining rates of fertility, increased economic opportunities, and other markers of female empowerment.|$|E

In order to accomplish this, basic questions on curriculum development were first investigated These were on curriculum intent, structure and content. In chapter two a conceptual framework for the proposed <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> curriculum was investigated. This involved an analysis of the influence of aims of education on curriculum theory and development, issues of curriculum foundations and models of curriculum development. The analysis culminated in the adoption of a cyclical model {{for the development of the}} proposed <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> curriculum. The cognitive framework of the study was further illuminated through the conceptualisation of the <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> curriculum, where philosophical foundations of <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> as well as its theoretical contexts were examined. Critical in this was the theory-practice relationship. In chapter four, the prevailing <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> situation in Zimbabwe was examined and views of lecturers and students on it analysed. This was accomplished in order to further identify flaws in the current approach to <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> which could be improved by means of the proposed <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> curriculum. The <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> curriculum being proposed was synthesised and developed in chapter five. This curriculum is founded on the philosophical foundations discussed in chapters two and three. It has theoretical components and is implemented in teachers' colleges and schools. It brings to the fore the importance of partnership between the practising schools and colleges as well as reflective teacher education. The development of the proposed <b>teaching</b> <b>practice</b> curriculum resulted in the following outcomes: • An investigation into how theory and practice in teacher education could be integrated. • Suggestions for improving the college-school relationship through the development of partnership in teacher education. • The extrication of theory p-orn practice. • An emphasis on the importance of reflective practice and reflective teacher education.
