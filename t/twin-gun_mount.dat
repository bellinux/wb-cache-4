500|$|The Presidents {{were armed}} with one <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> for QF 4.5-inch (114mm) Mk V dual-purpose guns forward and one twin mount for [...] Bofors {{anti-aircraft}} guns. For anti-submarine work, the ships were fitted with Type 162, 170, and 177M sonars for {{the pair of}} triple-barrelled Mk 10 Limbo anti-submarine mortars. They were equipped with a Type 293Q surface-search radar, Type 262 and 275 gunnery radars, Type 277Q height-finding radar and a Type 978 navigation radar.|$|E
500|$|In May 1940, Panthère began a refit at Toulon that {{included}} the addition of piping between the forecastle and forward fuel tank to allow the ship to refuel at sea {{and the removal of}} the mainmast in favor of a platform with a <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> for the [...] light AA gun. When France surrendered on 22 June, she was still being worked on and only one propeller shaft was available. Shortly afterwards, the ship was reduced to reserve with only a skeleton crew aboard and her anti-aircraft guns were transferred to more modern ships.|$|E

They fired a [...] shell at a muzzle velocity of [...] After her 1937 conversion to a minelayer, Zmaj carried 100 mines.|$|E
500|$|When {{reactivated}} and modernized in the 1980s each battleship {{retained the}} original battery of nine [...] guns, but the secondary battery on each battleship was reduced from ten <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts</b> and twenty guns to six <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts</b> with 12 guns {{to allow for}} the installation of two platforms for the Tomahawk missiles. Each battleship also received four Harpoon missile magazines, Phalanx anti-aircraft/anti-missile Gatling gun systems, and electronic warfare suites.|$|R
500|$|In 1931–33 the AA {{guns were}} {{replaced}} with eight 40-caliber [...] Type 89 dual-purpose guns, fitted {{on both sides}} of the forward superstructures in four <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts.</b> When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of they had a ceiling of [...] at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. Two <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts</b> for license-built Vickers two-pounder light AA guns were also added. These guns had a maximum elevation of +80 degrees and a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute. The pair of 14cm guns on the upper deck were removed at this time.|$|R
500|$|Around 1926, {{the four}} above-water torpedo tubes were removed and the ships {{received}} three additional 76-millimeter AA guns that were situated {{around the base}} of the foremast. They were replaced by eight 40-caliber 12.7-centimeter Type 89 dual-purpose guns in 1932, fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts.</b> When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of [...] Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. Two <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts</b> for license-built Vickers 2-pounder light AA guns were also added to the ship that same year. They had a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute.|$|R
500|$|A single [...] twin-gun Modèle 1933 {{anti-aircraft}} mount {{was installed}} on the rearmost deckhouse forward of turret Nr. 3. It used the 50-caliber semi-automatic [...] gun. It had a conventional sliding breech and used six-round cartridge boxes which gave it a maximum rate of fire of only 30-40 rounds per minute. This mount was used {{in lieu of the}} intended power-driven Modèle 1935 <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> which was to use a new 48-caliber, fully automatic 37mm gun that was expected to be able to fire at a rate of 165 rounds per minute, but the new gun was still in development when the ships were commissioned. 250 rounds were stored near the mount, but the main magazine, which held an additional 1,250 rounds, was adjacent to the forward 138mm magazines. This required a loader to move forward [...] to pick up each [...] cartridge box and carry it back to the waiting gun crew.|$|E
500|$|The {{anti-aircraft}} armament of the Chacal class {{consisted of}} two 50-caliber Canon de 75 mm modèle 1924 guns in single mounts positioned amidships. The mounts could elevate to +90° and depress to -10° and the guns could be loaded at any angle up to +75°. Their [...] shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of [...] The guns had a range of [...] and a ceiling of about [...] They had a theoretical rate of fire of 15 rounds per minute, but only about half that in service. The ships carried 150 rounds, plus 60 star shells, for each gun, of which 30 rounds could be stowed in ready-use lockers. In 1932, the navy decided that the ships were too top-heavy to accept a director for the guns so {{they were to be}} replaced by four twin mounts for [...] anti-aircraft machineguns. These were installed in 1933–34, together with a dedicated [...] OPL J.1930 stereoscopic rangefinder. The substitution saved about [...] of weight, although the machineguns proved to have limited utility in combat. Combat operations in 1939 had shown the French that their anti-aircraft defenses were inadequate and they planned to augment them beginning in 1940 by replacing the mainmast with a platform for a <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> for the [...] light AA gun. This was only installed aboard Panthère before the armistice with Germany and it was removed shortly afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in May 1940, {{the after}} bank of torpedo tubes was removed and {{replaced}} with a QF 12-pounder Mk V anti-aircraft gun, the after mast and funnel being cut down to improve the gun's field of fire. Four to eight QF 20mm Oerlikon cannons {{were added to the}} surviving ships, usually replacing the [...]50-calibre machine gun mounts between the funnels. One pair of these was added to the bridge wings and the other pair was mounted [...] the searchlight platform. Early in the war, depth charge stowage increased to 44. By 1943, only four ships were still afloat and all had the 'Y' gun on the quarterdeck removed to allow for additional depth charge stowage and two additional depth charge throwers. The 12-pounder was removed to allow for the installation of a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast and for more depth charges. All of the survivors, except , had 'A' or 'B' gun replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, and their director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge removed in exchange for a Type 271 target-indication radar. 'A' gun was later replaced in [...] while Hero had exchanged 'B' gun for a Hedgehog and a <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> for QF six-pounder Hotchkiss guns for use against U-boats at very close range. A Type 286 short-range, surface-search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force's ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship.|$|E
50|$|In 1931-33 the AA {{guns were}} {{replaced}} with eight 40-caliber 12.7 cm Type 89 dual-purpose guns, fitted {{on both sides}} of the forward superstructures in four <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts.</b> When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of 14700 m; they had a ceiling of 9440 m at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees.

500|$|The {{boats were}} armed with six {{internal}} [...] torpedo tubes, {{all in the}} bow. They carried one reload for each tube; a total of a dozen torpedoes. They were originally intended to be armed with two <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts</b> for the [...] Type 96 anti-aircraft gun, but a [...] deck gun for combat on the surface was substituted for one 25mm mount during construction.|$|R
2500|$|The Drh. LC/34 <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> was {{the most}} common mount for the gun in the Kriegsmarine.

Each mount was designed for full 360° of traverse, but was limited to much less than that by the ship's superstructure. Speed in train was a maximum of 9° per second. The fastest firing cycle was 7.5 seconds, or 8 rounds per minute. Ammunition was supplied by twin hoists between the guns, {{at the rear of the}} mount. The [...] was intended to use a lighter version of this mount with thinner armor that only weighed approximately [...] This may have designated as the Drh. LC/40, but development ceased when the ships were canceled in 1939.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, twin and quadruple Oerlikon mounts were developed, {{both for}} army and for navy use. The British Navy {{operated}} a hydraulically operated <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount.</b> The US Navy operated a quad mount developed for PT boats, the Thunderbolt, which was manufactured by International Harvester. It was placed experimentally on the battleships Arkansas, Colorado, Maryland, West Virginia, Washington, Massachusetts, and training ship Wyoming.|$|E
50|$|The 3.7 cm Flak 43 was a {{dramatic}} improvement over older models. A new gas-operated breech increased the practical firing rate to 150 RPM, {{while at the same}} time dropping in weight to 1250 kg in combat, and 2000 kg in transport. It was also produced in a <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount,</b> the 3.7 cm Flakzwilling 43, although this version was considered somewhat unwieldy and top-heavy.|$|E
50|$|Around 1926, {{the four}} above-water torpedo tubes were removed {{and the ship}} {{received}} three additional 76 mm AA guns that were situated {{around the base of}} the foremast.

50|$|The {{boats were}} armed with six {{internal}} 53.3 cm torpedo tubes, {{all in the}} bow. They carried one reload for each tube; a total of a dozen torpedoes. They were originally intended to be armed with two <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts</b> for the 25 mm Type 96 anti-aircraft gun, but a 120 mm deck gun for combat on the surface was substituted for one 25 mm mount during construction.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first order}} for the [...] "real" [...] L/60 {{was made by the}} Dutch Navy, who ordered five <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts</b> for the cruiser [...] in August 1934. These guns were {{stabilized}} using the Hazemeyer mount, in which one set of layers aimed the gun, while a second manually stabilized the platform the gun sat on. All five mounts were operated by one fire control system.|$|R
50|$|The main {{armament}} of the Matsu class {{consisted of}} three Type 89 127 mm dual purpose guns in one <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> aft and one single mount forward of the superstructure. They carried a total of twenty-four Type 96 25 mm anti-aircraft guns in four triple and a dozen single mounts. The ships were also armed with four 610 mm torpedo tubes in a single quadruple traversing mount and 36 depth charges.|$|E
50|$|The Presidents {{were armed}} with one <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> for QF 4.5-inch (114 mm) Mk V dual-purpose guns forward and one twin mount for 40 mm Bofors {{anti-aircraft}} guns.

50|$|The Algerine {{class was}} {{armed with a}} QF 4 in Mk V {{anti-aircraft}} gun and four <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts</b> for Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges.|$|R
50|$|The main {{armament}} of the Akizuki class {{consisted of}} eight Type 98 100 mm dual purpose guns in four twin-gun turrets, two superfiring pairs {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. They carried four Type 96 25 mm anti-aircraft guns in two <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts.</b> The ships were also armed with four 610 mm torpedo tubes in a single quadruple traversing mount; one reload was carried for each tube. Their anti-submarine weapons comprised six depth charge throwers for which 72 depth charges were carried.|$|R
50|$|Heavy {{losses to}} German air attack during the Norwegian Campaign {{graphically}} demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the Tribals' anti-aircraft suite and the RN decided in May 1940 to replace 'X' mount with two QF 4 in Mark XVI dual-purpose guns in a <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount.</b> To better control the guns, the existing rangefinder/director was modified {{to accept a}} Type 285 gunnery radar as they became available. The number of depth charges was increased to 46 early in the war, and still more were added later. To increase the firing arcs of the AA guns, the rear funnel was shortened and the mainmast {{was reduced to a}} short pole mast.|$|E
50|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with two single 55-caliber 83.5 mm Škoda {{anti-aircraft}} guns, {{mounted on the}} forecastle and the stern. They had a maximum elevation of 85° and fired a 10 kg shell at a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s. They had a rate of fire of 12 rounds per minute and had a maximum ceiling of 11300 m. Four 40 mm 67-caliber Škoda AA guns were mounted between the bridge and the mainmast in a <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> {{on each side of}} the ship abreast the aircraft hold. They fired a 0.95 kg shell at a muzzle velocity of 950 m/s. After her 1937 conversion to a minelayer, Zmaj carried 100 mines.|$|E
5000|$|The Ton-class coastal minesweepers were {{constructed}} with wooden hulls {{and almost all}} of their structure was made from aluminium to reduce their magnetic signature to aid sweeping magnetic mines. The ships displaced 360 LT at standard load and 1940 LT at deep load. They had an length between perpendiculars of 153 ft, a beam of 27 ft and a draught of 8 ft. The Tons were powered by two Napier Deltic diesel enginess, each driving one propeller shaft. The engines developed a total of [...] and gave a maximum speed of 15 kn. They had a range of [...] at 13 kn and had a complement of 4 officers and 25 ratings. The Ton-class ships were armed with a single 40 mm Bofors and two 20 mm Oerlikon light AA guns on a single <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The ships mounted six 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XI guns in <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts,</b> two superfiring {{in front}} of the bridge and one aft of the superstructure. Their light {{anti-aircraft}} suite was composed of one quadruple mount for 2-pounder [...] "pom-pom" [...] guns and six single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Later in the war, twin Oerlikon mounts replaced the singles. The L-class ships were fitted with two above-water quadruple mounts for 21 in torpedoes. The ships were equipped with 45 depth charges.|$|R
50|$|During Yamashiros {{modernization}} in {{the early}} 1930s, all six three-inch guns were removed and replaced with eight 40-caliber 127-millimeter dual-purpose guns, fitted {{on both sides of}} the fore and aft superstructures in four <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts.</b> When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of 14700 m; they had a maximum ceiling of 9440 m at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees.

2500|$|The main {{armament}} of the Kagerō class {{consisted of}} six Type 3 [...] guns in three twin-gun turrets, one superfiring pair aft and one turret {{forward of the}} superstructure. They were built with four Type 96 [...] anti-aircraft guns in two <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mounts,</b> but more of these guns were added {{over the course of}} the war. The ships were also armed with eight [...] torpedo tubes for the oxygen-fueled Type 93 [...] "Long Lance" [...] torpedo in two quadruple traversing mounts; one reload was carried for each tube. Their anti-submarine weapons comprised 16 depth charges.|$|R
5000|$|The {{eventual}} {{solution was}} to simplify the firing platform, {{based on the assumption}} it would always be securely bolted into concrete. The total weight of the Flakzwilling <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> system reached 26.5 tonnes, making it practically impossible to tow cross-country. In the end, this mattered little since by the time the gun entered production in 1942, it was used in primary static defensive applications. There were four twin mounts on the fortified anti-aircraft Zoo Tower, and they were also on other flak towers protecting Berlin, Hamburg, and Vienna. During the Battle of Berlin, the guns on the Zoo Tower were used successfully to support ground forces, where the heavy 128 mm shells obliterated Soviet armor, especially when hit from the side [...] The rush to capture the Reichstag led to dozens of tanks being destroyed. Approximately 200 were mounted on railcars, providing limited mobility.|$|E
50|$|A single 37 mm twin-gun Modèle 1933 {{anti-aircraft}} mount {{was installed}} on the rearmost deckhouse forward of turret Nr. 3. It used the 50-caliber semi-automatic 37 mm gun. It had a conventional sliding breech and used six-round cartridge boxes which gave it a maximum rate of fire of only 30-40 rounds per minute. This mount was used {{in lieu of the}} intended power-driven Modèle 1935 <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> which was to use a new 48-caliber, fully automatic 37 mm gun that was expected to be able to fire at a rate of 165 rounds per minute, but the new gun was still in development when the ships were commissioned. 250 rounds were stored near the mount, but the main magazine, which held an additional 1,250 rounds, was adjacent to the forward 138 mm magazines. This required a loader to move forward 50 m to pick up each 12.8 kg cartridge box and carry it back to the waiting gun crew.|$|E
5000|$|The Drh. LC/34 <b>twin-gun</b> <b>mount</b> was {{the most}} common mount for the gun in the Kriegsmarine.
