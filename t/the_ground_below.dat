5|$|The {{simplest}} classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is {{the most}} widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for Arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate {{the stability of the}} atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below</b> it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below</b> it, it is labeled w. While air mass identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} team began site excavation on March 3. Workers excavated artifacts {{dating to}} around 1150 AD. Fire pits and broken pieces of ceramic pans {{were found in}} <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below</b> what would be left field. Archaeologists believe the area {{was the site of}} a Native American settlement and that the artifacts were the remnants of a workshop where mineral water from underground sulfur-bearing springs was boiled to collect salt. The artifacts are on permanent display in the Tennessee State Museum's Mississippian Period exhibit. A portion of the property was used as a city cemetery in the 1800s. The interred were relocated.|$|E
5|$|At Valdez, {{construction}} was two-thirds complete by September as 4,200 workers hurried {{to complete the}} marine terminal. Because of loose soil found at the job site, enormous retaining walls had to be constructed to secure <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below</b> some of the 58 structures that were completed {{by the end of}} the year. During the first week of November, the first ship docked at the newly built Valdez quays. It was not a tanker but a ship bringing more construction material. In December, the first signal was sent from the Valdez operations center—where two new control computers had been installed—to Pump Station 2 on the North Slope.|$|E

5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS {{was that the}} settings, made through four main input dials, were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below.</b> As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} cake factory, {{where he is}} trapped in a vat of cake mix. His nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, appears and explains that today is his birthday. All throughout his life, his parents never showed up to his birthday parties (even his own birth); now, he plans on using a hypnotic device to force everyone to celebrate his birthday. He then rides off with the invention on a flying machine. Perry escapes from the mix and follows after him. In the air, Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight and the machine is activated, but while trying to get Perry {{to let go of}} the wall of the flying machine he accidentally makes the machine malfunction, causing the people below to still not want to celebrate his birthday. Doofenshmirtz, defeated, drops the ice cream cone he is eating in the fight and it falls to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite Convair's {{sales pitch}} and the {{anticipated}} {{effectiveness of the}} weapon, the Air Force was unenthusiastic about the concept; aside from the expense of developing the aircraft and weapon, the Sky Scorcher missile also suffered {{from the fact that}} there would be significant effects on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below</b> the location of an airburst of a multi-megaton nuclear warhead. As a result, the project was abandoned before any significant work was undertaken.|$|E

25|$|On March 4, 1921, the United States Congress {{approved}} the burial of an unidentified American serviceman from World War I {{in the plaza}} of the new Memorial Amphitheater. On November 11, 1921, the unknown soldier brought back from France was interred below a three-level marble tomb. The bottom two levels are six marble sections each and the top at least nine blocks with a rectangular opening {{in the center of}} each level through which the unknown remains were placed through the tomb and into <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below.</b> A stone, rather than marble, slab covers the rectangular opening.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 2007, {{a section}} of the Gardiner Expressway was closed between Spadina Avenue and Jarvis Street due to the threat of ice {{about the size of a}} kitchen table falling from the CN Tower. Several days before, a storm with snow and {{freezing}} rain had caused a great deal of ice to accrete on the tower. As the weather warmed and the sun heated the tower's concrete, large pieces of ice began falling off the tower and falling hundreds of metres to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below.</b> Although nobody was injured, the Gardiner was closed as a precautionary measure. On March 6, cooler weather reduced the risk of falling ice, and prevailing wind conditions had changed, reducing the risks of ice falling onto the highway; the road was reopened subsequently.|$|E

25|$|An {{inquiry into}} the {{accident}} by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) concluded that the balloon pilot made an error of judgement when contact with the power lines became imminent, trying to out-climb the power lines rather than using the rapid descent system to drop the balloon quickly to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below.</b> Toxicology analysis of the balloon pilot after the accident tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), suggesting {{he may have been}} under the influence of cannabis {{at the time of the}} crash, which ultimately led to the error of judgement. The crash was the sixth accident in ten years the TAIC had investigated (the TAIC also investigates marine and rail accidents) which involved key people testing positive for drugs or alcohol, and the commission has called for the Government to enact stricter measures in regards to drug and alcohol use in the aviation, marine and rail industries.|$|E
25|$|Zbyszko {{took part}} in an eighteen-man battle royal in Saint Paul, Minnesota on February 7, 1989 to fill the vacant AWA World Heavyweight Championship. By {{stalling}} and avoiding confrontations with other wrestlers, Zbyszko was able {{to remain in the}} match until only two men remained: himself and Tom Zenk. The two men fought for several minutes. When Zenk went for a pin, referee Gary DeRusha inexplicably entered the ring to make the count. Zbyszko kicked out and the two continued in what now appeared to be a conventional wrestling match. DeRusha ended up taking a bump and was unable to make the three count when Zenk covered Zbyszko for the pin. As DeRusha slowly recovered, Zenk continued to dominate the match. As he attempted a flying body press, however, Zbyszko managed to catch him in mid-air and deliver a fallaway slam, throwing him over the top rope and to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below.</b> Zbyszko was thus the new AWA World Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
25|$|Clutter {{may also}} {{originate}} from multipath echoes from valid targets caused by ground reflection, atmospheric ducting or ionospheric reflection/refraction (e.g., anomalous propagation). This clutter type is especially bothersome since {{it appears to}} move and behave like other normal (point) targets of interest. In a typical scenario, an aircraft echo is reflected from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below,</b> appearing to the receiver as an identical target below the correct one. The radar may try to unify the targets, reporting the target at an incorrect height, or eliminating it {{on the basis of}} jitter or a physical impossibility. Terrain bounce jamming exploits this response by amplifying the radar signal and directing it downward. These problems can be overcome by incorporating a ground map of the radar's surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below ground or above a certain height. Monopulse can be improved by altering the elevation algorithm used at low elevation. In newer air traffic control radar equipment, algorithms are used to identify the false targets by comparing the current pulse returns to those adjacent, as well as calculating return improbabilities.|$|E

25|$|Both {{airplanes}} {{were destroyed}} in the collision. All 248 passengers and crew aboard the KLM plane died, as did 335 passengers and crew aboard the Pan Am plane, primarily due to the fire and explosions resulting from the fuel spilled and ignited in the impact. The other 61 passengers and crew aboard the Pan Am aircraft survived, including the captain, first officer and flight engineer. Most of the survivors on the Pan Am walked out onto the intact left wing, the side away from the collision, through holes in the fuselage structure. The Pan Am's engines were still running {{for a few minutes}} after the accident despite first officer Bragg's intention to turn them off. The top part of the cockpit, where the engine switches were located, had been {{destroyed in the}} collision, and all control lines were severed, leaving no method for the flight crew to control the aircraft's systems. Survivors waited for rescue, but it did not come promptly, as the firefighters were initially unaware that there were two aircraft involved and were concentrating on the KLM wreck hundreds of meters away in the thick fog and smoke. Eventually, most of the survivors on the wings dropped to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
