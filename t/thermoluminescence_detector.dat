By means of dosimeters of different isotopic composition (standard, containing 10 B or prepared with heavy water) placed against the collimator exit, the spatial distribution of gamma and fast neutron doses and of thermal neutron fluence are attained. In order to investigate {{the accuracy of the}} results obtained with in-air measurements, suitable MC simulations have been developed and experimental measurements have been performed utilizing Fricke gel dosimeters, <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors</b> and activation foils.

The results of calculation and measurements have revealed good consistency of gamma dose and fast neutron 2 D distributions obtained with gel dosimeters in form of layers. In contrast, noticeable modification of thermal neutron fluence is caused by the neutron moderation produced by the dosimeter material. Fricke gel dosimeters in thin cylinders, with diameter not greater than 3 mm, have proved to give good results for thermal neutron profiling. For greater accuracy of all results, a better knowledge of the dependence of gel dosimeter sensitivity on radiation LET is needed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors</b> (TLD) {{were used}} for dose {{measurements}} at JET. Several hundreds of LiF detectors of various types, standard LiF:Mg,Ti and highly sensitive LiF:Mg,Cu,P were produced.

Pairs of 6 LiF/ 7 LiF detectors allow distinguishing between neutron/non-neutron components of a radiation field. For detection of neutrons of higher energy, polyethylene (PE- 300) moderators were used. TLDs, located in the centre of cylindrical moderators, were installed at eleven positions in the JET hall and the hall labyrinth in July 2012, and exposure {{took place during the}} last two weeks of the experimental campaign. Measurements of the gamma dose were obtained for all positions over a range of about five orders of magnitude variation.

40|$|For several decades, <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors</b> (TLDs) {{have been}} widely used in environmental, {{personal}} and medical dosimetry. With the development of heavy-ion accelerators, investigations concentrated on the thermoluminescent (TL) response of different TL phosphors to heavy charged particles (HCPs), motivated by the manifold potential TLD applications in HCP dosimetry. At the beginning, the research interest was focused particularly on the most common TL material, LiF:Mg, Ti. During the last years, considerable effort has been invested to determine precisely TL-efficiency also for other phosphors, either based on theoretical models or on experiments at heavy-ion accelerator facilities. The high amount of TLDs being used in space dosimetry in combination with plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) essentially requires the detailed knowledge of TL-efficiency to permit dose equivalent evaluation. The paper summarizes the theoretical models currently employed to describe TL-efficiency and reviews TL-efficiency measurements from the late 1960 s up to now. Difficulties in comparing TL-efficiency data from various laboratories due to different readout systems and experimental protocols will be addressed. Valuable input for a critical discussion is provided by the large pool of recent TL-efficiency data generated in the framework of the ICCHIBAN intercomparison experiment.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focused on}} the characterization of the lateral dose fall-off following the irradiation of the target with photons, protons and carbon ions. A water phantom was irradiated with a rectangular field using photons, passively delivered protons as well as scanned protons and carbon ions. The lateral dose profile in {{the depth of the}} maximum dose was measured using an ion chamber, a diamond <b>detector</b> and <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors</b> TLD- 600 and TLD- 700. The yield of thermal neutrons was estimated for all radiation types while their complete spectrum was measured with bubble detectors during the irradiation with photons. The peripheral dose delivered by photons is significantly higher compared to both protons and carbon ions and exceeds the latter by up to two orders of magnitude at distances greater than 50 mm from the field. The comparison of passive and active delivery techniques for protons shows that, for the chosen rectangular target shape, the former has a sharper penumbra whereas the latter has a lower dose in the far-out-of-field region. When comparing scanning treatments, carbon ions present a sharper dose fall-off than protons close to the target but increasing peripheral dose with increasing incident energy. For photon irradiation, the contribution to the outof- field dose of photoneutrons appears to be of the same order of magnitude as the scattered primary beam. Charged particles show a clear supremacy over x-rays in achieving a higher dose conformality around the target and in sparing the healthy tissue from unnecessary radiation exposure. The out-of-field dose for x-rays increases with increasing beam energy because of the production of biologically harmful neutrons...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{electronic}} portal {{imaging device}} (EPID) {{is used for}} patient setup during radiotherapy sessions. Dosimetric verification is done using ion chambers, diodes and <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors.</b> In intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) the dosimetry is a sophisticated and time-consuming task. The simultaneous use of amorphous silicon (aSi) detectors and the transit dosimetry (TD) option in the treatment planning system (TPS) (Eclipse, Varian) enables dosimetric pre-treatment verification of the IMRT plans. AimThe {{purpose of this study}} was to calibrate the EPID and TPS and to evaluate the usefulness of that method for dose verification in IMRT technique. Materials/MethodsThe first step was calibration of the aSi EPID mounted on three linear accelerators (Clianc 23 EXS, Varian). Afterwards, configuration of the calculation algorithm in TPS was carried out. Then dosimetric characteristics of the EPID were investigated. The EPID response depending on the beam mode, treatment time and static square field size was measured. The same measurements were repeated twice for three accelerators and analyzed. Additionally, three IMRT plans were treated for the pre-treatment dose evaluation. The calculated dose matrix was compared with the delivered one. The similarity of the calculated and measured fluency maps was evaluated by means of gamma index and score factor in Eclipse. ResultsThe linearity of the EPID signal was proven. For both beam modes EPID response is proportional to treatment time and field size, within the considered field size range. ConclusionsThe gamma evaluation indicates good correlation between predicted and acquired EPID image, although some differences in a high gradient area were found. We found the EPID-based pre-treatment IMRT verification method to be a good quality assurance (QA) procedure. Quite frequent control of the method and periodic recalibration of the used device are required...|$|R
40|$|The natural human {{exploratory}} urge {{is driving}} humankind {{to discover the}} universe and plan future human space missions to distant objects. Regarding the radiation exposures during exploration of space, the radiation environment, which significantly differs from the radiation environment on Earth, {{is one of the}} main hazards in space. The Van-Allen radiation belts, the Galactic Cosmic Rays and the Solar Particle Events significantly contribute to the increased radiation exposure in space compared to Earth. It is therefore important to determine the radiation field in respect of solar activity, orbit parameters and different shielding conditions. The “DOSe distribution inside the ISS” (DOSIS) experiment, under the lead of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) is an approach to measure the spatial and temporal radiation distribution inside the Columbus laboratory on-board the International Space Station (ISS). Remarkable about the DOSIS experiment is the enabling of a comparison of data measured by different institutions with different measurement methods and materials. For the first time twelve institutes compared radiation measurement results for a defined experiment condition. Active and passive dosimeters distributed at eleven positions inside the Columbus laboratory measured the radiation field and the radiation distribution inside Columbus for two different periods in the years 2009 and 2010. The two “DOSimetric TELescopes” (DOSTEL) belong to the active dosimeters. <b>Thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors</b> (TLD) and “plastic nuclear track etch” detectors (CR- 39) were used as passive dosimeters, to determine a complete coverage of the entire Liner Energy Transfer (LET) range. The comparison of DLR data, as well as the comparison with data provided by other participating groups for both experiment periods consistently showed good agreements. A decrease of daily absorbed dose rates from experiment phase I to II due to the increasing solar activity was observed.

Radiation treatment plans were developed following the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and theRadiologicalPhysicsCenterguidelines for lung treatment using Stereotactic Radiation Body Therapy. The tumor was covered such that at least 95 % of Planning Target Volume (PTV) received 100 % of the prescribed dose while ensuring that normal tissue constraints were followed as well. Calculated doses were exported from the Eclipse TPS and compared with the experimental data as measured using <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors</b> (TLD) and radiochromic films that were placed inside the phantom. The results demonstrate that the AAA superposition-convolution algorithm is able to calculate SBRT treatment plans with all clinically used photon beams {{in the range from}} 6 MV to 18 MV. The measured dose distribution showed a good agreement with the calculated distribution using clinically acceptable criteria of ± 5 % dose or 3 mm distance to agreement. These results show that in a heterogeneous environment a 3 D pencil beam superposition-convolution algorithms with Monte Carlo pre-calculated scatter kernels, such as AAA, are able to reliably calculate dose, accounting for increased lateral scattering due to the loss of electronic equilibrium in low density medium. The data for high energy plans (15 MV and 18 MV) showed very good tumor coverage in contrast to findings by other investigators for less sophisticated dose calculation algorithms, which demonstrated less than expected tumor doses and generally worse tumor coverage for high energy plans compared to 6 MV plans.

40|$|Heavy-ions beams offer several {{advantages}} {{compared to other}} radiation such as low lateral scattering and high biological effectiveness (RBE) in the Bragg peak region, making them particularly attractive {{for the treatment of}} radio-resistant tumours localized close to organs at risk [1]. The extension of ion therapy to new clinical cases requires the exploitation of a dedicated treatment planning system (TPS) based on the existing version of TRiP 98 [2, 3], established TPS for carbon ions. The theoretical models and experimental databases included in TRiP 98 are presently mainly based on measurements in water. This approximation can be applied successfully to reproduce many biological tissues with the exception of bones, where the presence of heavy elements, like calcium, might change significantly the composition of the resulting mixed radiation field. Presently, the TriP 98 physical beam model takes into account for the bone only its density variation, but it neglects difference between bones and water in attenuation of the primary and production of secondary particles through nuclear fragmentation. However, a detailed knowledge of the particle field at each point of the treatment area is crucial for an accurate estimate of the actual dose. A previous study [4] investigated the influence of different types of bone on the carbon particles range. In the present work we aim at understanding the influence of medium inhomogeneities on the 12 C beam dose distribution. For the experiment, a bone target was placed inside a water phantom. The irradiation of the target volume positioned partially behind the bone target and partially directly in water was simulated with TRiP 98 and the dose at the interface measured at several depths along the primary beam direction. Absolute dose measurements were achieved with a system of pin-point ionization chambers, while the relative dose distribution was investigated with two different solid states detectors: <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors</b> of type TLD- 700 and alanine ESR pellets.

Low-energy x-ray beams in the typical energy ranges of mammography, produced with a tungsten target and additional 60 µm molybdenum filtration were implemented and characterized at the Laboratory of Metrology of Ionizing Radiation at Instituto Superior Técnico. These beams were used for the characterization of the TLDs in terms of sensitivity, linearity, reproducibility, energy dependence and fading at 40 °C. The energy dependence test was further extended using clinical beams produced by mammography units at hospitals and clinics. The method proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency was used for the measurement of ESAK and assessment of MGD. The combined standard uncertainty for the measurement of ESAK (and MGD) was determined in accordance to the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement. The x-ray beams generated in the 23 - 40 kVp range presented HVL values from 0. 36 to 0. 46 [*]mm Al. The beam produced at 28 kVp (HVL 0. 39 [*]mm Al) was considered as reference. The radiation field defined a circle with 84 [*]mm diameter with a maximum variation of the beam intensity of less than 1 % at the top flat (plateau) within 4 [*]cm of the central axis. The estimated total uncertainty for the measurement of air kerma was 0. 42 %. All the TL detectors tested showed good performance except the commercial Li 2 B 4 O 7 :Mn (or TLD- 800) which was excluded due to its poor sensitivity in our experimental set up. Both lithium fluorides showed better linearity and reproducibility as well as lower energy dependence and fading when compared to lithium borates.

40|$|AIM: Investigation of {{the risks}} of {{radiation}} exposure among an interventionalist, assistant and sonographer during installation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) by assessment of the fractional dose in comparison to dose threshold values. Moreover, an evaluation of additional measures towards radiation shielding protection was undertaken. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 30 TIPS, the surface doses were measured using <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors</b> (TLD) which were attached to the eyebrows, {{both sides of the}} thyroids, backs of the hands, lower legs over the tibia, the breast, umbilicus and symphysis. The values measured were considered to represent a conservative estimation for organs beneath these sites. During the first 15 interventionists, the interventionalist, assistant and sonographer wore only a lead apron, whereas in the next 15 interventionists, they wore a thyroid protecting shield as well. Furthermore, a lead glass plate was positioned between the interventionist and the video amplifier, a protection of {{the lower part of the}} body was placed between the sonographer and the X-ray tube, and the sonographer wore a lead protecting glove on the hand used to hold the accustic header. RESULTS: The highest surface dose without any additional protection was measured among the intervestionalist, the assistant and the sonographer standing to the right of the patient, on the left tibia. The partial body dose of the red bone marrow  considered upon simplification to be represented by the surface dose of the tibia  allowed a dose threshold value compliance of a maximum of 12, 18, 62, that is, 32 TIPS interventions per year. For the interventions with permanent protection, thyroid protection, lead protecting gloves and lower body protection, the highest surface dose for the interventionalist and assistant was measured in the right tibia, and for the sonographer in the left hand. The partial body dose, considered upon simplification to be represented by the surface dose of the tibia, allowed the interventionalist a maximum of 15, and the assistant a maximum of 21 TIPS per year. The sonographer, when standing to the left could have carried out more than 750 TIPS, and when standing to the right, 312 TIPS. By use of the additional protective measures, the stochastic risk of radiation was reduced by 35 % for the interventionalist, 41 % for the assistant, and 65 % for the sonographer. CONCLUSIONS: Protection of the lower body had a decisive effect on the compliance of dose threshold values, because without protection of the lower body, tibia bone marrow is subject to a high dose...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis has been to investigate the neutron doses from radiotherapy with photons and ions. The advantages of proton and ion therapy, {{compared to the use}} of photons were also examined. During cancer radiotherapy, patients receive undesired dose from neutrons produced in collimators and in the patient. Measurements with bubble detectors were performed to investigate neutron doses from radiotherapy, using 200 MeV/u 12 C ions, at GSI-Darmstadt in Germany, and a 15 MeV photon beam at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen. Neutron energy spectra were also obtained from the photon beam measurements. The bubble detectors were tested in a series of measurements to investigate the uncertainties in the measurements of neutron dose. The principles of neutron production were investigated both for radiotherapy with photons and carbon ions. During photon radiotherapy, neutrons are produced through photonuclear reactions. The majority of the neutrons are produced in the target and the collimators in the linear accelerator, but neutrons can also be produced in the patient body if the photon energy is sufficiently high. The carbon therapy facility at GSI do not use collimators, but neutrons are still produced through nuclear interactions between the primary carbon ions and nuclei in the patient. Neutron sensitive <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors</b> and a uranium-based fission counter have also been tested as neutron detectors in this study. Only preliminary tests have been performed with these detectors, and neutron doses have not been obtained with these detectors in this work. The total neutron dose from radiotherapy with photons was found to be in the order of mSv per Gray. The spectra obtained indicate a neutron fluence in the order of 10 ^ 7 n. cm^(- 2) per Gray with a peak in the neutron energy around 1 MeV for measurements without a phantom, while compared to this, the spectra for in-phantom measurements are shifted downwards in energy. Concerning the spectra obtained, the results indicate that the uncertainties are relatively large, making it difficult to reach conclusive information. Changes in response of the bubble detectors due to temperature variations in the measuring environment {{has been one of the}} factors which increased the uncertainties in the measurements. Changes in response for the bubble detectors after repeated use have also had an influence on the results. Future measurements should be made using the knowledge gained in this work in order to reduce uncertainties. The bubble detectors' response to neutrons of energies above 20 MeV was not established during these measurements, therefore, no conclusion has been drawn concerning the equivalent neutron doses from carbon radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{adequate}} {{knowledge of}} the radiation environment and the doses incurred during a space mission is essential for estimating an astronaut's health risk. The space radiation environment is complex and variable, and exposures inside the spacecraft and the astronaut's body are compounded by the interactions of the primary particles with the atoms of the structural materials and with the body itself Astronauts' radiation exposures are measured by means of personal dosimetry, but there remains substantial uncertainty associated with the computational extrapolation of skin dose to organ dose, {{which can lead to}} over- or underestimation of the health risk. Comparisons of models to data showed that the astronaut's Effective dose (E) can be predicted to within about a + 10 % accuracy using space radiation transport models for galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and trapped radiation behind shielding. However for solar particle event (SPE) with steep energy spectra and for extra-vehicular activities {{on the surface of the}} moon where only tissue shielding is present, transport models predict that there are large differences in model assumptions in projecting organ doses. Therefore experimental verification of SPE induced organ doses may be crucial for the design of lunar missions. In the research experiment "Depth dose distribution study within a phantom torso" at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL, Brookhaven, USA the large 1972 SPE spectrum was simulated using seven different proton energies from 50 up to 450 MeV. A phantom torso constructed of natural bones and realistic distributions of human tissue equivalent materials, which is comparable to the torso of the MATROSHKA phantom currently on the ISS, was equipped with a comprehensive set of <b>thermoluminescence</b> <b>detectors</b> and human cells. The detectors are applied to assess the depth dose distribution and radiation transport codes (e. g. GEANT 4) are used to assess the radiation field and interactions of the radiation field with the phantom torso. Lymphocyte cells are strategically embedded at selected locations at the skin and internal organs and are processed after irradiation to assess the effects of shielding on the yield of chromosome damage. The initial focus of the present experiment is to correlate biological results with physical dosimetry measurements in the phantom torso. Further on, the results of the passive dosimetry within the anthropomorphic phantoms represent the best tool to generate reliable data to benchmark computational radiation transport models in a radiation field of interest. The presentation will give first results of the physical dose distribution, the comparison with GEANT 4 computer simulations based on a Voxel model of the phantom, and a comparison with the data from the chromosome aberration study...|$|R
40|$|A passive neutron {{dosemeter}} with <b>thermoluminescence</b> and etched-track <b>detectors</b> {{was used}} in the space station MIR in 1995 and 1997 and during some shuttle flights to MIR. High neutron doses of about 200 mu Sv d/sup - 1 / were measured with track detectors, while the contribution of protons to the track density was estimated to be small. An active personal dosemeter based on silicon diodes providing a direct readout, improved sensitivity and spectrometric properties is proposed for additional monitoring. Firstly, measurements with a prototype were performed in the stray radiation fields of the CERN-EU Reference Radiation Facility. When mounted on a phantom at different positions, both the passive and the active dosemeter provide the directional distribution of neutrons via an unfolding procedure. This can be helpful for {{a better understanding of the}} complex radiation field in space and for comparisons with calculations. (21 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Characterization of the out-of-field dose profile {{following}} irradiation of {{the target}} with a 3 D treatment plan delivered with modern techniques. METHODS: An anthropomorphic RANDO phantom was irradiated with a treatment plan designed for a simulated 5 × 2 × 5 cm(3) tumor volume located {{in the center of}} the head. The experiment was repeated with all most common radiation treatment types (photons, protons and carbon ions) and delivery techniques (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, passive modulation and spot scanning). The measurements were performed with active diamond <b>detector</b> and passive <b>thermoluminescence</b> (TLD) <b>detectors</b> to investigate the out-of-field dose both inside and outside the phantom. RESULTS: The highest out-of-field dose values both on the surface and inside the phantom were measured during the treatment with 25 MV photons. In the proximity of the Planned Target Volume (PTV), the lowest lateral dose profile was observed for passively modulated protons mainly because of the presence of the collimator in combination with the chosen volume shape. In the far out-of-field region (above 100 mm from the PTV), passively modulated ions were characterized by a less pronounced dose fall-off in comparison with scanned beams. Overall, the treatment with scanned carbon ions delivered the lowest dose outside the target volume. CONCLUSIONS: For the selected PTV, the use of the collimator in proton therapy drastically reduced the dose deposited by ions or photons nearby the tumor. Scanning modulation represents the optimal technique for achieving the highest dose reduction far-out-of-field...|$|R
40|$|Medical {{linear accelerators}} (linacs) used for {{radiotherapy}} with photons produce an undesirable neutron contribution as treatment energies exceed the (γ,n) {{threshold of the}} high-Z constituents of the linac. Secondary neutrons in radiotherapy contribute to additional dose outside the treatment volume in the patient. Treatment techniques offering improved confinement of the dose to the target volume are rapidly evolving and will contribute differently {{to the production of}} neutron doses outside the volume at target. The intention in this work has been two-fold: (1) Investigation of the characteristics and the responses of the detectors applied. (2) Measurements of the secondary neutron yield outside the treatment volume of a 15 MV photon beam produced by a Varian 23 iX medical linac at Haukeland University Hospital (HUS). Neutron yields measured from the treatment techniques Three-Dimensional Conventional Radiation Therapy (3 D-CRT) are compared to Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). The neutron measurements were performed using bubble <b>detectors</b> and <b>Thermoluminescence</b> <b>Detectors</b> (TLDs). The TLD- 600 is photon and thermal neutron sensitive, and the TLD- 700 is photon sensitive. Pairs of TLDs were applied together in order to discriminate against the photon component of the mixed field. The bubble detectors employed were the Bubble Detector Spectrometer (BDS) used for obtaining information of the neutron energy spectrum, and the Bubble Detector Thermal (BDT) sensitive to thermal neutrons only. The response of the detectors was also measured in a mixed photon thermal-neutron field of the nuclear reactor at Institute for Energy Technology (IFE) at Kjeller (Norway). The BDS detectors were found to be sensitive in this field, either to neutrons with lower energy than the discrimination thresholds given from the vendor or to the photon component of the field. The BDT sensitivity measured in this field was four times higher than the calibrated sensitivity supplied by the manufacturer. The TLDs applied in the reactor field revealed a strong photon background, which made reliable photon discrimination in the TLD signal a challenge. The spatial distribution of the neutrons produced by the medical linac was also measured outside the target volume with TLDs positioned in a plastic phantom. The neutrons were principally detected in the outer layers of the phantom, close to the linac head where the neutrons are produced. Two dose plans were created (in the Eclipse treatment planning system) in order to compare the neutron yield during the IMRT and 3 D-CRT treatment techniques. Measurements were performed during delivery of the plans in a solid state plastic phantom, with TLD and BDS detectors situated outside the primary photon fields. The IMRT dose plan resulted in a higher neutron dose than the dose produced during 3 D-CRT. The ratio of the neutron dose produced during the delivery of the two plans scales roughly with the ratio of the radiation output of the linac; the Monitor Units (MUs). The neutron fluences measured were 107 n/cm² per treatment Gy delivered to the target volume. For a full treatment of 70 Gy, the additional neutron doses were 0. 2 ± 0. 1 Sv for 3 D-CRT and 0. 4 ± 0. 3 Sv IMRT. Two characteristic features of the neutron energy spectrum were observed; the low energy continuous distribution from neutron evaporation processes and a rather distinct peak from direct neutron knock-out processes. The sensitivity of the detectors to neutron energies, and potentially to photons, should be further investigated with respect to the correspondence between the response to fluence and dose. To obtain further information of the neutron energy spectrum, the use of TLDs with moderators of different sizes can be an alternative method...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to present the results of the interlaboratory {{comparisons}} for ring dosimeters and to confirm that the applied method is suitable for measuring the personal dose equivalent HP(0. 07). In addition, calibration procedures used in dosimetric measurements in persons occupationally exposed to ionizing photon radiation X and γ were presented. Materials and Methods: Ring dosimeters made of flexible plastics with the diameter of approximately 20 mm, equipped with two <b>thermoluminescence</b> (TL) <b>detectors</b> type MTS-N, were the subject of interlaboratory comparisons. Irradiated detectors were red out using a new manual TLD's reader (FIMEL, France). All TLD exposures were done for validation of TLD readers and were performed using the reference X-ray and γ beams with the ISO rod phantom. The methodology of performed exposures corresponded with the methods applied by the European Radiation Dosimetry Group (EURADOS), the European organizer of interlaboratory comparisons. Results: The energy, dose and angular characteristics of the ring dosimeter allowed to elaborate the formula for estimating and verifying the personal dose equivalent HP(0. 07). The test was performed to check and confirm the correctness of the estimated characteristics. The test results were satisfactory, and thus the readiness to implement TLD reader in the used method and to participate in interlaboratory comparisons was confirmed. Conclusions: According to the requirements of the Polish Centre for Accreditation, the laboratory was participating in the interlaboratory comparison organized by EURADOS in terms of the personal dose equivalent HP(0. 07). The result of the comparison was satisfactory, therefore the correctness of the testing procedure was confirmed. Med Pr 2013; 64 (5) : 631 – 63...|$|R
