Following the state's approval of its charter, <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of Romney commenced its {{operations in}} the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. <b>The</b> <b>bank</b> occupied two rented rooms on the Wirgman Building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. <b>The</b> <b>bank</b> initially used a safe as its bank vault and security for <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> office's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further enhanced with the installation of wire mesh glass and bars in the windows.
