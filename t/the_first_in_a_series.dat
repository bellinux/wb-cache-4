After Pelli Chesi Choodu, Prasad and Vijaya Vauhini Studios collaborated on Missamma (1955) and Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu (1959). All three films were profitable ventures and achieved cult status in Telugu cinema. Pelli Chesi Choodu is considered {{as one of the}} acclaimed films in the careers of Prasad and Varalakshmi. Relangi Narasimha Rao's 1988 Telugu film, which was also about the negative effects of dowry system in India, was titled Pelli Chesi Choodu.

5|$|In 1947, Marguerite Henry {{released}} the children's book Misty of Chincoteague, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of novels {{that made the}} Chincoteague breed internationally famous. The real Misty was foaled on Chincoteague Island in 1946, and was purchased as a weanling by Henry. In 1961, the publicity was increased even more when the film Misty was made, based on the book. The publicity generated by the books assisted the Chincoteague Fire Department and the breed in remaining viable into the 21st century. While fictionalized, the books {{were based on a}} real horse and ranch on Chincoteague Island, and the Misty of Chincoteague Foundation was established in 1990, to preserve the Beebe Ranch and establish a museum with memorabilia from the series. Model horse company Breyer Animal Creations has created models of Misty and five of her descendants. As of 2001, there were around 40 surviving descendants of Misty worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his film and television work, Roddenberry wrote the novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Although it has been incorrectly attributed to several other authors (most notably Alan Dean Foster), it was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of hundreds of Star Trek-based novels {{to be published by}} the Pocket Books imprint of Simon & Schuster, whose parent company also owned Paramount Pictures Corporation. Previously, Roddenberry worked intermittently on a novel The God Thing that he had based upon his rejected 1975 screenplay for a proposed low-budget ($3 to $5 million) Star Trek film preceding the development of Phase II throughout 1976. Attempts to complete the project by Walter Koenig, Susan Sackett, Fred Bronson, and Michael Jan Friedman have proven to be unfeasible for a variety of legal and structural reasons.|$|E
