They both would join Moody to eventually form the band We Are the Fallen. Wind-up issued a press release on May 17, 2007, stating that two Dark New Day members, drummer Will Hunt and guitarist Troy McLawhorn, would be joining the band to replace LeCompt and Gray. It was initially stated that Hunt and McLawhorn would tour with Evanescence {{until the end of the}} Family Values Tour in September 2007, but both continued to play with the band <b>through</b> <b>The</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Door</b> tour.|$|E

Xuân snapped to {{attention}} and stated, [...] "Mission accomplished." [...] Shortly after midnight on 2 November 1963 in Washington, D.C. the CIA sent {{word to the}} White House that Diệm and Nhu were dead, allegedly by suicide. Vietnam Radio had announced their deaths by poison, {{and that they had}} committed suicide while prisoners in an APC transporting them to Tân Sơn Nhứt. Unclear and contradictory stories abounded. General Paul Harkins reported that the suicides had occurred either by gunshot or by a grenade wrestled from the belt of an ARVN officer who was standing guard. Minh tried to explain the discrepancy, saying [...] "Due to an inadvertence, there was a gun inside the vehicle. It was with this gun that they committed suicide." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1781, Boardman took {{work as a}} {{clerk and}} as a merchant. He spent time {{employed}} in New Haven, training as a shopkeeper in the store of Elijah and Archibald Austin, before setting up his own company in his home town of New Milford later that same year. This business, a dry-goods store, was operated in conjunction with his two brothers, David and Daniel. As part of his travels, he visited Ohio, where he founded the town of Boardman. In 1789, he {{was the subject of}} a portrait by Ralph Earl, which [...] "portrayed the richly dressed dry goods merchant... in his store in New Milford... <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>door,</b> bolts of textiles tell the viewer how Boardman earned a living." [...] Earl's most [...] "accomplished" [...] and successful series of paintings were of the Boardman family. Boardman then married Mary Anna Whiting on September 25, 1792, for whom he would build '', which still stands in New Milford. By this time, he had also opened a second shop outside of any partnership with his brothers, which was situated in Litchfield County and was designed by architect William Sprats, and on October 10, 1794 his first son, William Whiting Boardman, was born.|$|E

60|$|<b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doors</b> {{and windows}} of Madeline's chamber burst {{the sounds of}} horses {{stamping}} to a halt, then harsh speech of men, and a low cry {{of a woman in}} pain.|$|R
60|$|Occasionally, {{a servant}} entered or {{left the room}} in silence, giving admission, however, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>opened</b> <b>door,</b> to <b>the</b> rushing sounds of the gale, as the wind murmured amid the angles and high {{chimneys}} of the edifice.|$|R

60|$|This {{was true}} enough, {{but there was}} another quaint room of {{corresponding}} dimensions {{on the opposite side of}} the entry: so I stepped across to it, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>doors</b> of both rooms, and asked what this chamber was for.|$|R
