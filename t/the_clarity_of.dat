Maryland improved their ACC record to 4–2and took the uncontested lead of the Atlantic Division. Florida State lost to Boston College that same day, which meant four teams were still able to secure the division title: Boston College, Florida State, Maryland, and Wake Forest.|$|E

5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E

25|$|Accidentally or {{deliberately}} introduced {{populations of}} common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) are found on all continents except Antarctica.

Carp in particular stir up the riverbed reducing <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> the water, making it difficult for plants to grow.|$|E

25|$|Historically, <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> Lake Tahoe {{continued}} to decrease through 2010, when the average Secchi depth, 64.4 feet, {{was the second}} lowest ever recorded (the lowest was 64.1 feet in 1997). This represented a decrease of 3.7 feet from the previous year. However, the lake's clarity increased from 2011 to 2014, improving by nearly 20 percent.|$|E
25|$|If {{a stereo}} {{binocular}} microscope has been used, a final assessment using a 10x loupe is performed {{before the final}} judgment is made on <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> the stone. The grader first decides the clarity category of the diamond: none (FL, or IF for a blemish), minute (VVS), minor (VS), noticeable (SI), or obvious (I). The decision is then made on the grade of the diamond.|$|E
25|$|The British {{edition of}} the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions {{generally}} had fewer. The popular United States paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving many readers in that country a very different experience when reading the novel. All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these lacked <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> early printings.|$|E

25|$|The {{lake was}} formed about 2 {{million years ago}} {{as part of the}} Lake Tahoe Basin, with the modern extent being shaped during the ice ages. It is known for <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> its water and the {{panorama}} of surrounding mountains on all sides. The area surrounding the lake is also referred to as Lake Tahoe, or simply Tahoe. More than 75% of the lake's watershed is national forest land, comprising the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the United States Forest Service.|$|E
25|$|Type not trait: The MBTI sorts for type; it {{does not}} {{indicate}} the strength of ability. It allows <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> a preference to be ascertained (Bill clearly prefers introversion), but not the strength of preference (Jane strongly prefers extraversion) or degree of aptitude (Harry is good at thinking). In this sense, it differs from trait-based tools such as 16PF. Type preferences are polar opposites: a precept of MBTI is that people fundamentally prefer one thing over the other, not a bit of both.|$|E

25|$|The {{plans are}} {{controversial}} {{because they would}} mean {{the loss of the}} minimalist appearance of the building, <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> the layout and public spaces in the building. The closure of Secklow Gate was even proposed, removing the rooftop loading facility that is such an important feature of the building. Additionally, objectors say that the plans to erect dwellings in the central area run the risk of hampering movement around and {{in and out of the}} centre as well as spoiling views of the shopping building.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo's {{observational}} acumen, drawing skill, and <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> {{depiction of}} bone structures reveal {{him at his}} finest as an anatomist. However, his depiction of the internal soft tissues of the body are incorrect in many ways, showing that he maintained concepts of anatomy and functioning that were in some cases millennia old, and that his investigations were probably hampered {{by the lack of}} preservation techniques available at the time. Leonardo's detailed drawing of the internal organs of a woman (See left) reveal many traditional misconceptions.|$|E
25|$|Between 1912 and 1918, Congress debated {{three times}} to protect Lake Tahoe in a {{national}} park. None of these efforts succeeded, and after World War II, towns such as South Lake Tahoe grew around {{the shores of the}} lake. By 1980, the permanent population of the Lake Tahoe area grew to 50,000, while the summer population grew to 90,000. The development around Lake Tahoe affected <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> the lake water. In order to preserve the lake's clarity, construction in the Tahoe basin is currently regulated by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.|$|E

30|$|Data {{analysis}} was performed using SPSS 16.0 software (Chicago, USA). The Kruskal-Wallis {{test was used to}} compare <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five-line sign and the angles between the fissures and tangent lines derived from the two CT units and the four calculation methods. The Kruskal-Wallis test and a subsequent Mann-Whitney U test were used for multiple comparison analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> levels. <b>The</b> χ-square test was used to compare the rate <b>of</b> assignment to <b>clarity</b> level 3 and combined (2 [*]+[*] 3) <b>clarity</b> levels for <b>the</b> four calculation methods and the two CT units as well as <b>the</b> <b>clarity</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five-line sign among six locations on axial or oblique positions. The significance level of the statistical analyses was set as α[*]=[*] 0.050. Inter-observer agreement for <b>clarity</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five-line sign from different CT scanners and different algorithms was estimated by using weighted κ statistics [7].|$|R
