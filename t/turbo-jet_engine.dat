40|$|In-service {{performance}} {{deterioration of}} gas turbine engines can be identified, at the engine module level, {{in terms of}} reductions in the component mass flow and the efficiency. Continued operation of a deteriorated gas turbine is (i) uneconomical and (ii) unsafe. Timely identification of the faults and ensuing maintenance could prevent both. Gas Path Analysis is a technique to establish the current performance level of the gas turbines and identify the faulty modules. Computer models can predict the off_design performance of gas turbines by aero-thermo-dynamically matching the engine components. This thesis describes the development of DETEM (DEeteriorated Turbine Engine Model), a generalised computer program, developed to model degraded gas turbine engines and analyse faults. The program has an integrated graphics module and creates windows on the VDU terminal,for displaying the program output and accepting the user input. This enables the user to compare the results of {{two different types of}} runs at the same time. The program incorporates sensor models that modify the output, with noise and in bias, based on the sensor characteristics, thus simulating a real engine. It is possible to simulate the engine performance at design point, off-design and under transient conditions. The runs could be for a "clean" and a deteriorated engine. Three techniques, iterative, fault coefficient matrix, and a statistical best-estimation technique, have been used to analyse the engine performance and identify the fault. Analysis of two and three shaft turbo-shaft engines and two spool turbo-fan and <b>turbo-jet</b> <b>engines</b> have been worked out in the thesis. Effects of reducing the number of measurements and measuring different engine parameters, on the accuracy of the fault identification, have been studied. The program is considered to have a potential for the generation of fault trees for rule-based expert system applied to gas turbine diagnostics. Because of the controlled output to the screen, a direct comparison of two different runs side by side, on the same screen, makes the program a good teaching aid for gas turbine diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{commercial}} and military <b>turbo-jet</b> aircraft <b>engines</b> use capacitive discharge ignition systems to initiate fuel combustion. The fuel-rich conditions required to ensure engine re-ignition during flight yield less than optimal engine performance, {{which in turn}} reduces fuel economy and generates considerable pollution in the exhaust. Los Alamos investigated two approaches to advanced ignition: laser based and microwave based. The laser based approach is fuel ignition via laser-spark breakdown and via photo-dissociation of fuel hydrocarbons and oxygen. The microwave approach involves modeling, and if necessary redesigning, a combustor shape to form a low-Q microwave cavity, which will ensure microwave breakdown of the air/fuel mixture {{just ahead of the}} nozzle with or without a catalyst coating. This approach will also conduct radio-frequency (RF) heating of ceramic elements that have large loss tangents. Replacing conventional systems with either of these two new systems should yield combustion in leaner jet fuel/air mixtures. As a result, the aircraft would operate with (1) considerable less exhaust pollution, (2) lower engine maintenance, and (3) significantly higher fuel economy...|$|R

A small <b>turbo-jet</b> <b>engine</b> (produced in France for remotely piloted vehicles) was procured in order to evaluate what levels of performance, power and endurance potential are currently achieved in commercially-available small engines.

40|$|Current {{progress}} in gas turbine performance is achieved mainly {{by increasing the}} turbine inlet temperature. State of-the-art military aircraft gas turbines operate with turbine inlet temperatures exceeding 2 000 K, and future development plans call for even higher temperature levels.

40|$|Summary. The {{performance}} of a <b>turbo-jet</b> <b>engine</b> has been measured, and alternative methods of determining gross thrust and air mass flow calibrated in a ground level static test bed and an altitude test bed simulating flight conditions. The agreement between the two test beds is very good. It is shown that if {{it is necessary to}} extrapolate calibrations to flight conditions, this may be made most accurately in terms of 'effective areas'. The preferred method of measuring gross thrust in flight is that based on the final nozzle static pressure measurements. The measurements of air mass flow required to convert gross thrust to net thrust are subject to quite large random errors, but the method based on the measurements from the transition section between the turbine and jet pipe is easiest to apply, and {{it should be possible to}} improve its accuracy. Using these methods, random errors of the order __ _ 4 per cent for net thrust determination can be expected. Comparison of 'non-dimensional ' performance measured in flight, and in the test beds, was good for non-reheat conditions, but significant differences were noted for the reheat results. It is believed that these differences were due to the effects of the intake on the reheat fuel control unit in flight. The accurac...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made to evaluate the durability and permeability {{of a group of}} transpiration-cooled, strut-supported turbine blades. The porous shells were formed from a woven-wire material. The blades were fabricated by a contractor for the Bureau of Aeronautics. The results of permeability tests indicated that the shell material exhibited large random variations in local permeability, which result in excessive coolant flows and very nonuniform cooling. For this reason no heat-transfer evaluations were made because any results would have been inconclusive. Four blades were investigated for structural soundness in a <b>turbo-jet</b> <b>engine</b> operating at a turbine-inlet temperature of approximately 1670 deg F and a turbine tip speed of approximately 1305 feet per second. The maximum temperature of the porous-shell material was approximately 1050 deg F. Inspection of the first two blades after 10 minutes of engine operation revealed that the tips of both of the blades had failed. For the second pair of blades, an improved tip cap was provided by the use of built-up weld extending from strut tip to shell.

40|$|Aircraft Establishment 10 ft X 7 ft High Speed Wind Tunnel {{to examine}} how the {{longitudinal}} characteristics of a fighter-type aircraft {{are affected by the}} installation of air intakes in the nose, fuselage sides, or wing roots. None of these intakes alters the lift or pitchingmoment characteristics significantly, but their effects on external drag vary, and only the nose intake avoids an increase. This superiority derives principally from its low area ratio, the value of which largely determines not only the critical Mach number and hence the behaviour at transonic speeds of the intake fairing but also its sensitivity to spillage and aircraft attitude. Both forms of divided intake cause an increase in profile drag of roughly 20 per cent; on the side intake {{this is due to the}} siting of the boundary-layer by-passes and on the wing-root intake to the increased wing thickness. Their high area ratios make them sensitive to changes in flow direction and lead to high suction levels over the intake fairings which are expected to cause drag increases early in the transonic range. Separation in the canopy-intake junctions of the side intake reduces the drag divergence Mach number to 0, 87, compared with 0 Â· 89 for the other models. The shaping of the wing-body junction which was combined with the nose and side intake installations leads to a marked reduction in drag at transonic speed, an advantage not shared by the wing-root lay-out. 1.

40|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that, {{in order}} to achieve supersonic flight with nuclear powered aircraft, a reactor -power plant combination capable of operating at temperatures considerably in excess of current practice must be developed. It is pointed out that there exist two general avenues of approach toward the goal of attaining high temperature reactors and power plants. The first approach involves the continuation and augmentation of research along the lines pursued by the conventional <b>turbo-jet</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturer, namely a search for material coatings or materials that will retain structural strength in high temperature oxidizing atmospheres. The second approach seeks {{to take advantage of the}} peculiar characteristics of the compressor-jet engine that permit the operation of the high temperature components in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. The results of a preliminary design study of a supersonic aircraft powered by a high temperature sodium, liquid vapor compressor -jet engine are summarized. The analysis considered, in as much detail as was warranted by the limited experimental information available, the characteristics of the reactor, power plant and airframe involved in determining performance. This study has been conducted for the purpose of guiding future, long -t e r rn, research work along the lines of high temperature reactors and power plants for aircraft propulsion. The sodium vapor compressor -jet is not presented as an engine that is presently considered feasible nor is any attempt made to establish a time table for its development. ï»¿The present status of reactor -power plant combinations of the type discussed in this report is such that the configurations presented and the thermodynamic requirements set forth are highly c onj ectural.
