500|$|In 2008, UMBC again faced Albany in the America East {{championship}} game. Halfway {{through the}} second period, the Retrievers trailed 11–2, but rallied to edge their opponents, 14–13. Zimmerman was named the 2008 America East Coach of the Year. In June, he was considered the frontrunner to replace John Haus who had been fired as North Carolina's head coach, but Zimmerman removed his name from consideration. He said, [...] "The people at UMBC have been good to me, {{and this is my}} home ... <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> kids and I recruited them. I just didn't think this was the right time to move." [...] UMBC granted Zimmerman a contract extension through the 2014 season.|$|E
500|$|The intro, [...] "The Genesis", is {{composed}} as an aural montage {{that begins with}} the sound of an elevated train and an almost-inaudible voice rhyming beneath it. Over these sounds, a snatch of dialogue, two men arguing. It samples Grand Wizard Theodore's [...] "Subway Theme" [...] from the 1983 film Wild Style, the first major hip hop motion picture. Nas made another ode to Wild Style, while shooting the music video for his single, [...] "It Ain't Hard to Tell", on the same stage as the finale scene for the film. His verse on [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] is played in the background of [...] "The Genesis". According to music writer Mickey Hess, in the intro, [...] "Nas tells us everything he wants us to know about him. The train is shorthand for New York; the barely discernible rap is, in fact, his [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] verse; and the dialogue comes from Wild Style, one of the earliest movies to focus on hip hop culture. Each of these is a point of genesis. New York for Nas as a person, 'Live at the Barbeque' for Nas the rapper, and Wild Style, symbolically at least, for hip hop itself. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> roots, Nas was saying, and he proceeded to demonstrate exactly what those roots had yielded." ...|$|E

500|$|The concert {{opened with}} Spears taking the stage {{accompanied}} by four blonde female dancers {{to perform a}} short version of [...] "...Baby One More Time", wearing a silver beaded bra, a pleated white skirt and white boots. She wore a long brown (blond in later dates) wig to cover the head she had shaved {{two and a half}} months previously and appeared in physically good shape. (By now her hair was about an inch long, and one of her dancers said of her hair without the wig, [...] "It's getting longer and she looks beautiful.") The show then segued into a flashy shortened version of [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U". Though while Spears performed the original choreography, the performance was compared to the style of the Pussycat Dolls. The dancers then left Spears alone onstage to perform a chair routine of [...] "Breathe on Me". They re-entered with a male fan from the audience with them and Spears giving him a lap dance. Half way through the lap dance, Spears disappeared for a costume change leaving her dancers to continue the performance. She then reappeared in a hot pink bra, white fur coat and jean skirt to perform [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] with Spears throwing air guitars to the crowd. The show then concluded with [...] "Toxic", which featured Spears and her dancers performing in a mix of Spears and Shakira dance styles. As the performance came to an end, Spears said [...] "Thank you so much. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> dancers"– her only words during the show– and left the stage. The show lasted around 12–16 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the topic}} of whether his next project would be an album or a mixtape, Lamar answered: [...] "I treat every project like it's an album anyway. It's {{not going to be}} nothing {{leftover}}. I never do nothing like that. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> leftover songs you all can have them. I'm going to put my best out. My best effort. I'm trying to look for an album in 2012." [...] In June 2011, Lamar released [...] "Ronald Reagan Era (His Evils)", a cut from Section.80, featuring Wu-Tang Clan leader RZA. On July 2, 2011, Lamar released Section.80, his first independent album, to critical acclaim. The album features guest appearances from GLC, Colin Munroe, Schoolboy Q, and Ab-Soul, while the production was handled by Top Dawg in-house production team Digi+Phonics as well as Wyldfyer, Terrace Martin and J. Cole. Section.80 went on to sell 5,300 digital copies in its first week, without any television or radio coverage and received mostly positive reviews.|$|E
2500|$|Stone {{began work}} on her third studio album, Introducing Joss Stone, at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, in May 2006. Released on 12 March 2007, the album was coordinated by A Chris Anokute, {{produced}} by Raphael Saadiq, and included collaborations with Lauryn Hill, Common, and Joi. Virgin Records describes the album as [...] "an electrifying mix of warm vintage soul, 1970s-style R, Motown girl-group harmonies, and hip-hop grooves". Stone herself describes it as [...] "truly me. That's why I'm calling it Introducing Joss Stone. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> words, and this is who I am as an artist." [...] She also revealed on The Tavis Smiley Show that her break-up with Beau Dozier {{was a source of}} inspiration while writing Introducing Joss Stone. The album debuted and peaked at No. 12 on the UK Albums Chart, not managing to match the success of Stone's two previous albums. It nevertheless debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 selling 118,000 copies in its first week, becoming the highest debut for a British solo female artist on the US chart, surpassing the record previously held by Amy Winehouse with Back to Black (which in turn would later be outdone by Leona Lewis, whose album Spirit debuted at No. 1 the week of 26 April 2008).|$|E
2500|$|When the {{surprise}} {{attack on the}} Ardennes took place on 16 December 1944, starting the Battle of the Bulge, {{the front of the}} US 12th Army Group was split, with the bulk of the US First Army being on the northern shoulder of the German 'bulge'. The 12th Army Group commander, General Omar Bradley, was located south of the penetration at Luxembourg and command of the US First Army became problematic. Montgomery was the nearest commander on the ground and on 20 December, Eisenhower (who was in Versailles in France) temporarily transferred Courtney Hodges' US First Army and William Simpson's US Ninth Army to Montgomery's 21st Army Group until the [...] "bulge" [...] could be reduced and a simpler line of communications restored, despite Bradley's vehement objections on national grounds. When Bradley learned that Montgomery had been given command of two American armies totalling some 200,000 men, he phoned Eisenhower to say: [...] "I cannot be responsible to the American people if you do this. I resign!" [...] Eisenhower sharply responded that Bradley was in fact responsible to him and [...] "Your resignation means absolutely nothing...Well, Brad, <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> orders." [...] Montgomery grasped the situation quickly, visiting all divisional, corps, and field army commanders himself and instituting his 'Phantom' network of liaison officers. He grouped the British XXX Corps as a strategic reserve behind the Meuse and reorganised the US defence of the northern shoulder, shortening and strengthening the line and ordering the evacuation of St Vith. The German commander of the 5th Panzer Army, Hasso von Manteuffel said: ...|$|E

Seven more skulls rolled down from rock to rock; while the infuriate Jew, {{following}} them with ghastly looks, exclaimed--"And <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> wives!"
