5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the operating temperature (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes, resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine thrust. The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E

Working under a NASA contract for U.S. DOE's Division of Automotive Technology Development, Williams Research performed the design and analysis on the gas turbine engine, while AMC's AM General subsidiary did the vehicle installation studies, supplied the vehicle, transmission, drivetrain, and the typical car accessories. The two-door sedan used a dual-rotor gas turbine with variable power <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle,</b> and a 3-speed automatic transmission for conventional rear-wheel-drive. Williams Research conducted all the performance and fuel economy analysis, with the turbine powered Concord meeting expectations. The final report estimated that the IGT vehicle would have a 10% higher cost over the conventional piston engine, of which {{less than half of}} the cost penalty would be in the turbine engine, but the remainder would be the cost of adapting existing production of vehicles and systems. However, fuel economy improvements, as well as reduced maintenance and repairs, would result in an overall life-cycle cost saving of 9% for the IGT vehicle.|$|E

50|$|The nozzle, {{by virtue}} of setting the back-pressure, acts as a {{downstream}} restrictor to the compressor, and thus determines what goes into {{the front of the}} engine. It shares this function with the other downstream restrictor, the <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The areas of both the propelling nozzle and <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> set the mass flow through the engine and the maximum pressure. While both these areas are fixed in many engines (i.e. those with a simple fixed propelling nozzle), others, most notably those with afterburning, have a variable area propelling nozzle. This area variation is necessary to contain the disturbing effect on the engine of the high combustion temperatures in the jet pipe, though the area may also be varied during non-afterburning operation to alter the pumping performance of the compressor at lower thrust settings.For example, if the propelling nozzle were to be removed to convert a turbojet into a turboshaft, the role played by the nozzle area is now taken by the area of the power <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes or stators.|$|E
50|$|According {{to simple}} theory, {{if the ratio}} of turbine rotor inlet temperature/(HP) {{compressor}} delivery temperature is maintained, the HP turbine throat area can be retained. However, this assumes that cycle improvements are obtained, while retaining the datum (HP) compressor exit flow function (non-dimensional flow). In practice, changes to the non-dimensional speed of the (HP) compressor and cooling bleed extraction would probably make this assumption invalid, making some adjustment to HP turbine throat area unavoidable. This means the HP <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes {{would have to be}} different from the original. In all probability, the downstream LP <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes would have to be changed anyway.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{production}} cars to use these turbos was the Japanese 1988 Honda Legend and used a variable geometry turbo with an integrated water cooled intercooler installed on its 2.0 L V6 engine. There was also the limited-production (only 500 produced) 1989 Shelby CSX-VNT, equipped with a 2.2-liter Chrysler K engine. The Shelby CSX-VNT utilised a turbo from Garrett, called the VNT-25 because it used the same compressor and shaft as the more common Garrett T-25. This type of turbine is called a variable-nozzle turbine (VNT). Turbocharger manufacturer Aerocharger uses the term variable-area <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> (VATN) to describe this type of <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Other common terms include variable-turbine geometry (VTG), variable-geometry turbo (VGT) and variable-vane turbine (VVT).|$|E
50|$|Although each {{off-design}} {{point is}} effectively a design point calculation, the resulting cycle (normally) {{has the same}} turbine and nozzle geometry as that at the engine design point. Obviously the final nozzle cannot be over or underfilled with flow. This rule also applies to the <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes, which act like small nozzles.|$|E

50|$|In nozzle {{governing}} the flow rate of steam is regulated by opening and shutting of sets of nozzles rather than regulating its pressure. In this method groups of two, {{three or more}} nozzles form a set and each set is controlled by a separate valve. The actuation of individual valve closes the corresponding set of nozzle thereby controlling the flow rate. In actual <b>turbine,</b> <b>nozzle</b> governing is applied only to the first stage whereas the subsequent stages remain unaffected. Since no regulation to the pressure is applied, the advantage of this method lies in the exploitation of full boiler pressure and temperature. Figure 2 shows the mechanism of nozzle governing applied to steam turbines. As shown in the figure the three sets of nozzles are controlled by means of three separate valves.|$|E

The earlier rainbow tests which evaluated various top coat compositions resulted in confirmation of the superiority of YSZ and especially the 6 - 8 YSZ composition.

50|$|The most {{sensitive}} surface is the high-pressure <b>turbine</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vanes (NGVs), situated immediately downstream of the combustor. The gas flow is choked through the NGVs, {{and so the}} flow area through the NGVs is a controlling area for the engine. If this area is reduced due to an accretion of ash, a smaller mass flow rate of gas passes through the engine core. Reduced mass flow leads to the turbine doing less work. The turbine drives the compressor, which accordingly also does less work compressing the air. If the compressor can no longer contain the high pressure gas in the engine core, the gas flow can reverse and flow {{out of the front}} of the engine. This is known as an engine surge or a compressor surge, and is often accompanied by a ball of flame that bursts out the front of the engine. This surge is likely to extinguish the flame in the engine combustor, known as a 'flame-out'.Once the high pressure in the core dissipates, the engine should be free to restart. Restarting an engine at altitude can be difficult, due to the lower temperatures and pressures of the ambient gas, but is not normally a problem. The reduced flow area of the NGVs can make it harder to restart the engine.|$|E
