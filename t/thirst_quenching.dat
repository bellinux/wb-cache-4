It falls on every 9th day of September in the lunar calendar and is said that two yang (positive cosmic forces) is overlapped on the date. It was a custom for Korea people to eat yuja hwachae along with gukhwajeon (국화전), flower pancake made with chrysanthemum and gukhwaju (국화주), rice wine made with the flower on the date.|$|E

5000|$|The various {{experiments}} undertaken {{either by}} Becker-Freyseng or under his supervision {{during the course}} of his work resulted in a number of fatalities. In particular, the high altitude experiments performed on inmates of Dachau concentration camp by Becker-Freyseng, Ruff and Hans-Wolfgang Romberg claimed a number of lives. One of the most well-known was that detailed in a paper published by him and Konrad Schäfer entitled [...] "Thirst and <b>Thirst</b> <b>Quenching</b> in Emergency Situations at Sea". For the experiments, the academics had personally asked Heinrich Himmler for 40 healthy camp inmates who were then forced to drink salt water or in some cases had it injected into their veins. Half the subjects were then given a drug called berkatit whilst all were subjected to an invasive liver biopsy without anaesthetic. All subjects died, including those given the berkatit, which proved toxic.|$|E
50|$|Tuak is {{originally}} made {{of cooked}} glutinous rice (Asi Pulut) mixed with home-made yeast (Chiping/Ragi) for fermentation. It is a wine used to serve guests, especially as a welcoming drink when entering a longhouse. Nowadays, {{there are various}} kinds of tuak, made with rice alternatives such as sugar cane, ginger and corn. However, these raw materials are rarely used unless available in large quantities. Tuak {{and other types of}} drinks (both alcohol and non-alcoholic) can be served on several rounds in a ceremony called nyibur temuai (serving drinks to guests) as ai aus (<b>thirst</b> <b>quenching</b> drink), ai basu kaki (Feet Washing drink), ai basa (respect drink) and ai untong (profit drink). Another type of a stronger alcoholic drink is called langkau, which contains a higher alcohol content because it is actually made of tuak which has been distilled over fire to boil off the alcohol, cooled and collected into containers.|$|E
40|$|Additional contributor: Zata Vickers (faculty mentor). My {{research}} {{focuses on}} thickened beverages. Thickened beverages are for those with dysphagia, a condition experienced most frequently post surgery. These patients cannot swallow water or similar beverages because the fluids go into their lungs causing choking. The goal of my research was to take a thick beverage and make it <b>thirst</b> <b>quenching.</b> Some describe <b>thirst</b> <b>quenching</b> as refreshing, or said another way, after you drink something you are not thirsty anymore. Most {{people would say that}} thick beverages are not <b>thirst</b> <b>quenching</b> or palatable, thus the problem I wanted to solve in my research. I designed six different thick beverages with varying ingredients and temperatures that would possibly quench thirst. My research included a taste test where 42 people participated by consumingmy six beverages and answering questions pertaining to their <b>thirst</b> <b>quenching</b> ability. The variations of the beverages in this study did not significantly improve the <b>thirst</b> <b>quenching</b> ability of the thickened beverage.

40|$|Fluid {{ingestion}} {{is necessary}} for life, and thirst sensations are a prime motivator to drink. There is evidence {{of the influence of}} oropharyngeal stimulation on thirst and water intake in both animals and humans, but how those oral sensory cues impact thirst and ultimately the amount of liquid ingested is not well understood. We investigated which sensory trait(s) of a beverage influence the <b>thirst</b> <b>quenching</b> efficacy of ingested liquids and the perceived amount ingested. We deprived healthy individuals of liquid and food overnight (> 12 hours) to make them thirsty. After asking them to drink a fixed volume (400 mL) of an experimental beverage presenting one or two specific sensory traits, we determined the volume ingested of additional plain, 'still', room temperature water to assess their residual thirst and, by extension, the thirst-quenching properties of the experimental beverage. In a second study, participants were asked to drink the experimental beverages from an opaque container through a straw and estimate the volume ingested. We found that among several oro-sensory traits, the perceptions of coldness, induced either by cold water (thermally) or by l-menthol (chemically), and the feeling of oral carbonation, strongly enhance the <b>thirst</b> <b>quenching</b> properties of a beverage in water-deprived humans (additional water intake after the 400 ml experimental beverage was reduced by up to 50 %). When blinded to the volume of liquid consumed, individual's estimation of ingested volume is increased (~ 22 %) by perceived oral cold and carbonation, raising the idea that cold and perhaps CO 2 induced-irritation sensations are included in how we normally encode water in the mouth and how we estimate the quantity of volume swallowed. These findings have implications for addressing inadequate hydration state in populations such as the elderly...|$|E
40|$|Soft {{drinks are}} {{consumed}} daily in Nigeria {{due to its}} affordability, characteristic taste, and <b>thirst</b> <b>quenching</b> potential. However, the high demand may compromise the quality of production with possible contamination of heavy metals which have shown to cause intoxication and death in humans. This study evaluated some constituents of twenty-six soft drinks in Nigeria and investigated the presence of some heavy metal contaminants. The soft drinks were screened {{for the presence of}} sugar, carbon dioxide, phosphate and alcohol as well as the pH and acidity determined. The level of cadmium, mercury and lead were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The study showed the presence of sugar, carbon dioxide, phosphate, and alcohol in the soft drinks. The soft drinks were acidic in nature, pH ranging from 3 to 5 with a mean of 3. 6 and the acid concentration was relatively low between 3 and 12  g/L with a mean of 8. 1  g/L. Lead was present in all the samples ranging from 0. 17 to 3. 39  mg/L with a mean of 0. 8, mercury was present in 22 samples ranging from 0. 29 to 11. 32  mg/L with a mean of 2. 08  mg/L while cadmium was present only in one sample (0. 149  mg/L). When compared to EPA, WHO and NIS standards, the levels of the heavy metal contaminants were above the tolerated limits for good quality drinking water in most samples. These results suggest that soft drinks in Nigeria may be contaminated with heavy metals which constitute a major public health problem. Thus, quality control is recommended during the production process especially at the stages of sterilization and purification...|$|E
