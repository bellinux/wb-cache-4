Simplexity was whimsically defined by computer scientists Broder and Stolfi as a concept worthy of as much attention as complexity:"The simplexity of a problem is the maximum inefficiency among the reluctant algorithms that solve P [...] An algorithm is said to be pessimal for a problem P if the best-cast inefficiency of A is asymptotically equal to the simplexity of P"The concept of Simplexity was amplified in the mid 1970s by Bruce Schiff (self-described theorist) and restated as [...] "The process by which nature strives towards simple ends by complex means. The result of a simple random act can only be predicted by complicated means. The spatial placement of each atom in a <b>transplanted</b> <b>plant</b> root ball is difficult to predict, but, the plant will adapt its root ball to the hole, and continue to thrive.

40|$|International audienceClimate {{change is}} {{expected}} to alter the magnitude and variation of flow in streams and rivers, hence providing new conditions for riverine communities. We evaluated plant ecological responses to climate change by transplanting turfs of riparian vegetation to new elevations in the riparian zone, thus simulating expected changes in water-level variation, and monitored the results over 6 years. Turfs moved to higher elevations decreased in biomass and increased in species richness, whereas turfs transplanted to lower elevations gained biomass but lost species. <b>Transplanted</b> <b>plant</b> communities were inert in their response to new hydrologic conditions. After 6 years, biomass of transplanted turfs did not differ statistically from target level controls, but species richness and species composition of transplants were intermediate between original and target levels. By using projections of future stream flow according to IPCC climate change scenarios, we predict likely changes to riparian vegetation in boreal rivers. Climate-driven hydrologic changes are predicted to result in narrower riparian zones along the studied Vindel River in northern Sweden {{towards the end of}} the 21 st century. Present riparian plant communities are projected to be replaced by terrestrial communities at high elevations as a result of lower-magnitude spring floods, and by amphibious or aquatic communities at low elevations as a result of higher autumn and winter flows. Less area available to riparian plants {{is expected to}} result in fewer species, even if no species lose their hydrologic niches. Changes to riparian vegetation may be larger in other boreal climate regions: snow-melt fed spring floods are predicted to disappear in southern parts of the boreal zone, which would result in considerable loss of riparian habitat. Our study emphasizes the importance of long-term ecological field experiments given that plant communities often respond slowly and in a non-linear fashion to external pressures...|$|E
40|$|The rate {{at which}} a plant species is {{attacked}} by invertebrate herbivores has been hypothesized to depend on plant species richness, yet empirical evidence is scarce. Current theory predicts higher herbivore damage in monocultures than in species-rich mixtures. We quantified herbivore damage by insects and molluscs to plants in experimental plots established in 2002 from a species pool of 60 species of Central European Arrhenatherum grasslands. Plots differed in plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 60 species), number of functional groups (1, 2, 3, 4), functional group and species composition. We estimated herbivore damage by insects and molluscs {{at the level of}} <b>transplanted</b> <b>plant</b> individuals ("phytometer" species Plantago lanceolata, Trifolium pratense, Rumex acetosa) and of the entire plant community during 2003 and 2004. In contrast to previous studies, our design allows specific predictions about the relative contributions of functional diversity, plant functional identity, and species richness in relation to herbivory. Additionally, the phytometer approach is new to biodiversity-herbivory studies, allowing estimates of species-specific herbivory rates within the larger biodiversity-ecosystem functioning context. Herbivory in phytometers and experimental communities tended to increase with plant species richness and the number of plant functional groups, but the effects were rarely significant. Herbivory in phytometers was in some cases positively correlated with community biomass or leaf area index. The most important factor influencing invertebrate herbivory was the presence of particular plant functional groups. Legume (grass) presence strongly increased (decreased) herbivory at the community level. The opposite pattern was found for herbivory in T. pratense phytometers. We conclude that (1) plant species richness is much less important than previously thought and (2) plant functional identity is a much better predictor of invertebrate herbivory in temperate grassland ecosystems.

40|$|Previous {{field and}} {{glasshouse}} studies suggested that oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) was especially sensitive to zinc (Zn) deficiency {{in the recovery}} period following transplanting. However, {{it is not clear}} whether transplanting, per se, or root damage during transplanting was primarily responsible. Three glasshouse experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that transplanting increases external Zn requirement of canola cv. Hyola 42 during its post-transplanting recovery. Canola was either directly sown into Zn-treated soils or transplanted at four-leaf stage, and grown until harvest at 7 - and 10 -leaf stages. In a second experiment with chelate-buffered solution culture, direct-sown and <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> were treated with three concentrations of Zn. In the third experiment, plants were given three levels of Zn supply, and either direct-sown into soils or transplanted at four-leaf stage with pruned (50 % of roots removed) or unpruned root systems. <b>Transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> required higher soil Zn supply for maximum root length and root dry weight than direct-sown plants. By contrast, shoots required similarly low external Zn for maximum dry weight in both direct-sown and <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> in soil. Direct-sown plants were more efficient in utilizing soil supplied Zn than <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> particularly compared to those transplanted with a pruned root system, and achieved maximum growth at 100 μg Zn kg- 1 soil compared to 500 μg Zn kg- 1 required by <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants.</b> Since the higher external Zn requirement for the growth of <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> was also obtained in well-stirred solution culture, it was concluded that it was related to the time required for <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> to recover from root injury and re-establish a favourable shoot: root ratio rather than to rhizosphere modification processes. Both transplanting, per se, and root damage during transplanting appeared to contribute to higher external Zn requirements for canola growth compared to direct-sown plants...|$|R

40|$|Transplanting is {{a common}} {{practice}} for many horticultural crops and some field crops. Recently, transplanted oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops {{have been reported to}} be sensitive to zinc (Zn) deficiency. However, Zn nutrition in transplanted field crops has not been investigated in detail. The objectives of this present research were to investigate whether transplanting increases external Zn requirements of transplanted oilseed rape, and the mechanisms of root function, growth and Zn uptake after transplanting including rhizosphere modification capacity by plant roots. The second objective was to examine the relative effects of root pruning and transplanting on Zn responses of oilseed rape, and the third objective was to determine external and internal Zn requirements of transplanted oilseed rape for diagnosing and predicting Zn deficiency. An experiment on a low Zn sand (DTPA extractable Zn 0. 14 mg kg- 1) was set up to determine whether transplanted oilseed rape had a higher Zn requirement than that of direct-sown plants. Low Zn supply depressed shoot dry weight, however, root growth was relatively more strongly suppressed than shoots. Maximum root dry weight required much higher external Zn for <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> compared to direct-sown plants, whilst shoot dry weight required a similarly low external Zn supply. In addition, <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> were sensitive to zinc deficiency during the early post-transplanting growth, and the response weakened as the plants recovered from root injury or transplanting stress. However, the <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> also experienced root pruning before transplanting and so in this experiment the higher Zn requirement could have been due to root pruning or transplanting or both. A further experiment was undertaken to determine the comparative external Zn requirements of direct-sown and <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> in well-stirred chelate-buffered solution culture where a rhizosphere effect on plant availability of Zn forms is absent and the effects of poor root-soil contact on post-transplanting growth are minimized. In solution culture at the same level of Zn supplied, direct- sown plants produced higher shoot and root dry matter and greater root length than those of <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants.</b> However, since a higher external Zn requirement was found for <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> in buffered solution culture than for direct- sown plants, it was concluded that the higher Zn requirement was not related to decreased rhizosphere modification, to greater demand for Zn or to poor root-solution contact, but rather to the time required for <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> to recover from transplanting and root injury. The recovery of root function in solution culture was more rapid than that in soil culture and expressed as a higher Zn requirement for shoot as well as root growth. It suggested that the delay in root recovery in soil culture was due to slower absorption of Zn from the soil after transplanting than was the case in solution culture. Chelate-buffered nutrient solution culture and harvesting plants successively at 5 day intervals until 25 days after transplanting was used to examine the mechanisms of the recovery of root growth and function. In this experiment, the external Zn requirement of <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> was investigated with unpruned or pruned root systems. Plants with unpruned root system and sufficient Zn supply exhibited faster recovery from transplanting than those with pruned root system plants. The results suggest that root pruning impaired Zn uptake by plant roots and slowed down the root and shoot growth after transplanting. Increased solution Zn partly alleviated the effects of root pruning and presumably this is a major reason why transplanted oilseed rape had a high external Zn requirement. However, root pruning also appeared to impair water uptake, and may have suppressed shoot growth through sequestering carbon for new root growth and through decreased phytohormone production by roots. Since rapid root recovery of <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> is essential for successful of growth in the field, Zn application to the nursery bed was explored as a starter fertilizer to stimulate root growth after transplanting. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether increasing the seedbed Zn would stimulate new root growth of transplanted oilseed rape, and therefore would alleviate the need for increased external Zn for post-transplanting growth. Results showed that adequate Zn concentration in the seedbed promoted the post-transplanting growth by stimulating the new root growth especially increased root length, and also hastened the recovery of root systems. However, high Zn concentration at transplanting still had a more dominant effect in stimulating the new root growth of oilseed rape after transplanting. The final experiment was set up using rhizobags with three rates of Zn supply and unpruned or pruned root systems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the chemical change in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere or bulk soil and its relationship to the recovery of root function after transplanting, and also to identify and quantify the organic acids in soil extracts of direct-sown and <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants.</b> The rhizosphere soil pH was lower than that of non-rhizosphere soil, and the decrease of soil pH was suggested as the mechanism of the increase of Zn availability and mobility in the rhizosphere soil. Direct-sown plants were more efficient in utilizing Zn than those of <b>transplanted</b> <b>plants</b> especially compared to those of plants with pruned root system. Zinc deficient plants excreted higher concentration of organic acids particularly citric acid, suggesting this was a mechanism of Zn mobilization and Zn uptake by roots of oilseed rape. The main implications of the present study for the management of Zn nutrition of transplanted crops were: the need to increase the Zn application to crops in the nursery and at transplanting compared to direct-sown plants; the possibility that external requirements of other nutrients will be greater in transplanted crops also requires further consideration; and in cropping systems where transplanting is practised, greater attention should be given to the avoidance of root damage during the transplanting...|$|R

Specialized plants of Geumodo were a total of 41 species; 30 taxa in Grade I, 1 taxon in Grade II, 9 taxa in Grade III and 1 taxon in Grade V. Milletia japonica (Siebold & Zucc.) A. Gray was the only species found in important Grade IV to V. Currently, ferries ply to the island, attracting many tourists. This poses a threat to the rare plants living in the island and presses down the island to develop. Therefore, in the long-term perspective, the conservation plan such as comprehensive research and monitoring on the ecosystem shall be established to protect evergreen broad-leaved forests...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Vegetables are a rich mineral {{source in}} human diet. It was {{demonstrated}} that lithium, a nonessential mineral in plants, {{has an important}} role on the psychosomatic normality of mau, with its use related to human health problems such as hypertension, depressive state, hormonal balance, leukemia, diabetes, dental cavities, immunological functions, and others. To determine Li uptalce by piants, a greenhouse study {{was carried out in}} solution culture with radish, lettuce and watercress at lithium leveis of 0. 1, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mM. Thirty days after <b>transplanting,</b> <b>plants</b> were collected, had their fresh and dry weights measured and nutrient contents were analyzed. In general, lithium increased iron uptake but did not affect uptake of other nutrients by lettuce. (Jrowth of watercress was depressed at 2 mM Li but radish and iettuce growth was not significantly affected. Lithium content of watercress increased from 37 ppm with 0. 1 mM Li to 1216 ppm with 2 mM Li in a quadratic response relationship to Li rate. The other plants responded similarly...|$|R
