40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the new {{phenomena}} in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> the Russian defence-industrial complex. Based on the data generated by the repeated survey of the CEOs (general directors) of defence enterprises in 1995 - 99, it examines economic performance of enterprises, their conflicts with the government and efforts at internal restructuring brought about by reductions of Russia's defence spending, mass privatisation and opening up of the domestic market. We found that despite the dramatic reduction in defence orders, inconsistent government policies and extremely unfavourable macroeconomic environment, the Russian defence industry has made significant progress in its adjustment to the market. Even before the devaluation of the ruble in the autumn of 1998 economic performance of defence enterprises had been gradually improving; it entered a virtual boom since then. Contrary to widely held views, the painful experience of the 1990 s has not made the top managers of the defence industry more hostile to reforms: {{at the end of the}} decade they were generally more supportive of the market than in 1995. ...|$|E

It is noted that <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> Russian economy caused technological degradation and industry stagnation, which resulted in the drop of the social wellbeing of citizens who retired. The authors determined that technological industrial degradation is having a particularly negative impact on the life quality. This makes the social wellbeing of the population in the country, passing through the painful market reforms, not life-time, with marginalization of the majority of senior citizens. For the formation of a truly life-time social wellbeing in countries with transitive economy such as Russia, it is necessary to restore its industry on a new technological basis - neo-industrialization. Its implementation in Russian economy requires a number of phases during which natural resources should to be used to restore the competitive manufacturing industry, form the basis of an innovative economy and modern high-tech industries. Long time required for neo-industrialization of transitive economies, allows to create a social group with the life-time wellbeing, which will be determined not by the high social state benefits, but by the possibility of long-term usage of gained professional experience. Convergent technologies are being formed in innovative clusters of network type, and help to establish the life-time wellbeing for specialists who used them for their whole life.

The objective {{of this research is}} to explore the neoliberal production of middle-class citizenship through the lens of educated non-elite local youth in Singapore. By combining geographical, sociological and anthropological insights about education and youth, I develop a theoretically informed ethnographic case study to examine how this segment of young people reproduce themselves as middle-class citizens. The research is based on eleven months of fieldwork at a local private institute of higher education, where I hanged around, talked to, and observed Singaporean young people between ages 18 and 25 studying for their first degree. The ethnographic materials are written up into four substantive papers, demonstrating the ways in which educated non-elite Singaporean youth in private higher education engage with state disseminated ideas around neoliberal accumulation and human capital formation. I argue that these students draw on class-based sensibilities and feelings to produce vibrant forms of normativities, subjectivities, and politics that pose a challenge to dominant assumptions of a "hollowed out" citizenship under neoliberalism. The research makes two overall interventions in geographic and social scientific writings about neoliberal restructuring of higher education and its implications for youth citizenship. First, it cautions against a straightforward claim that neoliberal technologies of control have extended market values into citizenship subjectivity and, with it, the erosion of progressive political projects. Second, it provides a much-needed analysis of middle-class citizenship formation among young people caught at the losing end of a diversifying educational landscape. </p...|$|E
40|$|Refrigerators and {{freezers}} (subsumed {{under the}} term "cold appliances") {{are among the}} most widely used electrical appliances in the residential sector all around the world. Currently, about 1. 4 billion domestic cold appliances worldwide use about 650 TWh electricity, which is 1. 2 times Germany’s total electricity consumption, and cause CO 2 emissions of 450 million tons of CO 2 eq. Although the specific electricity consumption per volume of cold appliances has decreased during recent years due to technical progress and policy instruments like labelling and eco-design requirements, total worldwide energy consumption of these appliances is on the increase. Scenario calculations were carried out for 10 world regions by the Wuppertal Institute. Results show that about half of the energy consumption could be saved with the most energy-efficient appliances available today, and even higher savings will be possible with next generation technologies by 2030. According to the analysis, these savings are usually very cost-effective. All these aspects are part of the new website "bigEE. net - Your guide to energy efficiency in buildings" which aims to provide information about technical options but also about policies to support the development of energy-efficient appliances. To initiate and foster market transformation of energy-efficient appliances it is highly advisable for policymakers to generate appliances-specific policy packages. Since each regional market has its specificity (e. g. energy prices, typical appliance affecting the cost effectiveness of efficient appliances), the barriers for <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> single product groups are also specific and need to be addressed by appropriate policies and measures.

S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the Unitary Air Conditioner (UAC) Technology Procurement ([URL] In February 2003, Fort Gordon in Augusta, Georgia was chosen as the demonstration site. With the goal of validating the field performance and operation of one of the awarded products, a 10 -ton high-efficiency packaged rooftop unit (RTU) manufactured by Global Energy Group (GEG) was installed at Fort Gordon in October 2003. Following equipment installation, power metering, air- and refrigerant-side instrumentation was installed on the GEG RTU and a 4 -year old typical-efficiency 20 -ton RTU manufactured by AAON. The GEG and AAON units were instrumented identically and operated May through July, 2005, to observe performance under a range of conditions. Based on the data collected as part of this demonstration, the GEG equipment performed at least 8 % better in stage- 1 (single compressor running) cooling and at least 16 % better in stage- 2 (both compressors running) than the baseline AAON equipment. Performance comparisons are based on what we call application EER normalized to equivalent specific fan power. The full-load, specific-fan-power-normalized application EERs at ARI design conditions were 10. 48 Btu/Wh for the GEG and 9. 00 Btu/Wh for the baseline machine. With a cost premium of nearly 50 %, and slightly higher maintenance costs, the life-cycle cost analysis shows that the GEG technology pays for itself [...] a positive net-present value (NPV) [...] only in climates and buildings with long cooling seasons. Manufacture of this equipment on a larger scale can be expected to reduce costs {{to the point where it}} is more broadly cost-effective. The assumed 10 -ton baseline and new-technology unit costs are $ 3824. 00 and $ 5525. 00 respectively. If the new technology cost is assumed to drop as sales increase to $ 4674. 50 for a 10 -ton unit (i. e. the original cost difference is halved), the life-cycle costs improve. A grid of first cost, annual maintenance cost and electricity price is enumerated and the results presented in the report show the sensitivity of life cycle cost to these three financial parameters in each of eight different climates...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} a strategic sustainability innovation that enables a market transformation. In order to create positive social, environmental and economic impact, scientists argue that sectors should move beyond competing on sustainability standards and towards a more collaborative process approach towards sustainability. The dairy sector aims to do this through {{the implementation of the}} Dairy Sustainability Framework (DSF), a process approach towards standardization of sustainable dairy production that enables them to implement a sustainability strategy with a common language and vision that can be applied globally, nationally, regionally and within organizations. However, as the approach of the DSF is new, flexible, collaborative and different from the conventional standards, it is a challenge for dairy companies to implement such a strategic sustainability innovation. The objective of this research is to understand <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> the dairy sector in terms of strategic collective system building and to find out how the dairy sector can implement the DSF in a credible manner. In order to answer the research question, a theoretical framework based on market transformation and strategic collective system building was used. Until now, this theoretical framework has mostly explored technological innovation and had not been validated for other types of innovation yet. Therefore, this research performed a case study on the implementation of the DSF at FrieslandCampina in the Netherlands, which was done in collaboration with key stakeholders through a pilot. To collect data, desk research, 27 in-depth interviews, observations, and comparable food case studies in the cocoa and coffee sector were carried out. Empirical data showed that market transformation is crucial for positive social, environmental and economic impact in the dairy sector. Also, a validation of the strategic collective system building framework showed that most of the system building activities seem to be relevant in the dairy sector. But, empirical findings also revealed that several additional activities are needed to implement the DSF in a credible manner. Therefore, this thesis proposes a refinement of the strategic collective system building framework. This refinement includes: attitudinal and instrumental commitment as a precondition for strategic collective system building; a change of the concept coordination into the concept governance to capture more formal mechanisms of coordination; the use of levels of maturity of sustainability performance and implementation as a way for standardization of the innovation; the creation of transparency by including minimum standards, monitoring, reporting, verification and traceability; and, the inclusion of communication in the definition of governance. The refined strategy framework enables actors within an innovation system to build a strategic collective system and thereby move beyond standards and towards a collaborative process approach towards sustainability in order to create positive social, environmental and economic impact. Also, it empowers them to have more control of the collaboration in order to successfully implement their sustainability innovation in a credible manner through the inclusion of formal mechanisms of control...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years Australian higher {{education}} has undergone a transformation from a binary structure, marked by a division of 'traditional universities' and colleges of advanced education, to a uniform university structure. This transformation was first proposed in 1987 by the Hon. John Dawkins, Minister for Employment, Education and Training in the Hawke Labor Government. The proposals appeared {{in the form of a}} 'Green' policy discussion paper which drew substantial amounts of criticism from the academy, but nonetheless were swiftly transformed into policy as a 'White' paper or policy statement. Since that time, Australian higher education institutions have been subject to a series of changes that have fundamentally changed the patterns of tertiary education provision established over the previous forty years. They have experienced a re-allocation of research funds which has eroded the established advantage of the traditional universities; they have been obliged to accept amalgamations; and, student numbers have expanded at a rate and to a proportion never previously imagined. All of this has been achieved under the banner of improving Australia's place in the highly competitive international economy. The champions of a restructured higher education sector have argued that this competitiveness is greatly dependent upon Australia's ability to improve the scientific and technical base of its human capital: higher education must move towards a more efficient and effective provision of education which will meet the needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> <b>The</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> higher education has been achieved without the unanimous blessing of the academy. Many of the most strident critics of what have come to be known as the Dawkins Reforms are academics who have expressed dismay at these changes. In particular there has been as strongly argued case that the reforms, with their ++emphasis on science and technology, mark the end of liberal education in Australia. Australian higher education is now, they declare, the site of mass education based upon a new instrumentalism in which the liberal arts have no significant place. This dissertation takes such criticisms as its focus. In particular it attempts to show that the critique founded upon a defence of the inherent role of liberal education in the Australian university sector has been misguided. Furthermore, the dissertation argues that because so much of the attack on the restructuring policy took this form there was little place for a substantial critical appraisal of the validity of restructuring based upon an imperative of <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> <b>The</b> idea of the university in Australia as one fundamentally defined by liberal education is examined at two levels. First, it is argued that the notion of liberal education used to defend the university against new instrumentalism is an idealised notion which both ignores the historical construction of such an idea at a time when liberalism itself was undergoing transformation, and, wrongly assumes the absence of instrumentalism, within it. Second, the history of the establishment of the university in Australia is reviewed to show that whilst the founders of the universities often had sympathies for the liberal arts, from the outset Australian universities were consistently conditioned by the drive for instrumental education. Higher education policies in the post-WWII era are given particular attention in order to show that mass higher education is no new phenomenon, but the continuation of the drive towards expanded education provision. Just as with the expansion of schooling to mass schooling, a greatly expanded higher education sector has been necessary to fulfil the continued demands of the social democratic consensus. The thesis concludes with the argument ++that the critique of higher education reforms has been hobbled by the absence of a critical sociology of education which could place the restructuring of Australian higher education in the context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> social to <b>market</b> democracy...|$|R

New characteristics of labor <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> business practices which they represent are yet to be established in American labor and employment law. Changes in legal doctrine and legal process, {{as well as the}} changes in business and labor institutions and practices, need to address the demands of firms and workers for fairness as well as efficiency. The widely documented shift from internal to external labor <b>markets,</b> <b>the</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> many remaining internal labor markets from ladders to tournaments, the increased emphasis on shareholder primacy in corporate law and capital markets, and many other developments, call for new legal doctrine and new ways of resolving legal disputes. All these changes demand a new way of thinking about the nature, function, interpretation, and enforcement of employment contracts. Commentary on the lecture is provided by by Greg W.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{about the}} functional exchange <b>of</b> fish wholesale <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> wholesalers and middle-wholesaler's business, and {{the implication of}} amended Wholesale Market Law (WML) in 1999. <b>The</b> wholesale <b>market</b> system regulated by the WML and considered as a main fish marketing channel has reduced its function and role in the recent decades. It was caused by an appearance of large scale fish suppliers and consumers such as supermarkets which play the role in fixing price, classifying equal quality, and ensuring a constant supply. In addition, {{the volume of the}} fisheries products handled at <b>the</b> wholesale <b>market</b> is decreased, while a competition between wholesale <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> outsiders is increased. At the same time, many wholesalers and middle-wholesalers in <b>the</b> wholesale <b>markets</b> are also having financial difficulties. The principle on <b>the</b> <b>marketing</b> method of <b>the</b> WML has been differed expandedly from the recent trend of business style. The WML was amended in 1999 for the purpose of negotiation behavior if the wholesalers that should be changed in term of bargaining power enabling the wholesalers to have more ability to compete in fresh food merchandise. Prospect of the consequences are: (1) The amendment of the WML will create various types of wholesale markets and/or wholesalers, especially in the strategy and scale of their management. (2) Some competitions among wholesalers and/or wholesale markets will occur more intensively. (3) Combination or the discontinuance of middle/small-scale wholesalers and/or wholesale markets will be observed.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, I suggest that, {{even more}} than the state, {{capitalist}} enterprise is the most influential institution of neoliberalism, both for the effect it conveys in terms of management in public institutions (New Public Management) and its influence on the subjectivity of neoliberal individuals. However, one could stress, from the perspective of economic theory of the firm, the neoliberal <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> the capitalist enterprises itself. Two transformations that are taking place from the 1980 s seem particularly important. The first is the firm's transformation in a "nexus of contracts" as claimed by the agency theory of Jensen and Meckling that describe and enable the current financialization of the economy. The second is the <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> organisations in a "nexus of skills" as claimed by the cognitive paradigm of the firm that apply to the company economic reasoning in terms of "human capital". I then examine the effects on neoliberal subjectivation of these two major changes, from the labour point of view. First, the neoliberal subject imagines, describes and manages itself as the subject of investment in "human capital". Second, the disappearance of traditional employment contract corresponds to the emergence and intensification of another form of contract, the "psychological contract", which tends to become a major form of relationship-employed but also a model for relationships between individuals. Finally, lifelong learning is becoming the major form of empowerment of employees, but also a "lifestyle" based on the appreciation of one's own human capital and the infinite task of perfecting oneself to match up our "skills portfolio" with <b>the</b> labour <b>market.</b> These <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> neoliberal subjectivity have costs that can be summarised by the widespread phenomena of burn out, but also the birth of a new form of racism, based on "quality" of human capital (skills, abilities, capabilities) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of three pieces of research on moral hazard, reputation and market structure. In particular, following an opening discussion of previous literature, I explore the dynamic interaction between moral hazard and market structure in two distinct game theoretic settings and empirically test a fundamental assumption of these models concerning consumer rationality. In the first Chapter, I survey the studies which shed light on some dimension {{of the relationship between}} asymmetric information and market structure and identify the gap in the literature that my research aims to fill. The mechanism of reputation has been primarily investigated in the setting of perfect competition; however, this setting is ill suited for uncovering the rich set of relations between asymmetric information and market structure. Only a handful of articles departed from the perfect competition framework and only few of those introduced strategic interaction among firms, a fundamental ingredient of my research interest. The models which do include strategic interaction have, however, ignored some important dynamics in the interaction of asymmetric information and market structure. Therefore in Chapter II, I develop a model in which market structure affects moral hazard while, in turn, moral hazard fuels <b>market</b> structure dynamics. <b>The</b> model is very general allowing for all kinds of strategic interaction among firms usually considered in the literature. I identify and analyse an important driving force -a survival contest - which has so far been overlooked. The main conclusion is that market concentration in and of itself reduces moral hazard and moral hazard drives <b>the</b> <b>market</b> towards concentration through the survival contest. The model is suitable to explain <b>the</b> puzzling <b>market</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> important industries such as banking, audit and health care. In Chapter III, I extend the model of Chapter 11 by introducing stochastic entry. First, I demonstrate that my results in the previous Chapter are robust to the entry process. Second, stochastic entry allows me to derive a non-degenerate steady state distribution which exhibits a very intuitive dynamics. Finally, although the complex nature of the dynamics prevents a detailed comparative static analysis of this distribution, it displays two well known empirical regularities. In particular, my model shows that the presence of moral hazard in and of itself produces shake-outs in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> {{from time to time and}} also correlated exit and entry rates. The reputation mechanisms in general and in the models of Chapter II and III in particular crucially depend on consumers' ability and willingness to develop an understanding of imperfect information on quality. In order to make reputation an effective disciplinary force, consumers must be strongly rational so that they read and understand imperfect quality indicators. In Chapter IV, this basic assumption on consumer rationality is tested empirically in discrete choice settings in <b>the</b> audit <b>market.</b> I find robust empirical evidence that if consumers are firms rather than individuals, they are strongly rational.

Thus, the study here proposed pretends the elaboration and characterization of new "wine-type" beverages based on the use of berries, resulting in products with added value due to the increase in their content of bioactive compounds. Strawberry is a fruit with a great economic relevance in Spain, being the first producer and exporter country in Europe. On the other hand, a large amounts of surplus from this fruit are obtained and destined to industrial purposes every year. Taking into account this, the main objective of this work has been to study the possibility of providing another utility to these surpluses, as well as to diversify the wine production towards new elaborations that could be adapted to <b>the</b> <b>markets.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> this surplus from strawberry in more durable new products via fermentation could be an economically viable solution for the industry and producers. These new products would allow tasting the fragrance and exquisiteness of strawberries in form of a beverage elaborated on the basis of traditional procedures for winemaking. For this, a puree of strawberry of 7 º Brix was mixed with water and sugar to reach 12 º Brix in order to obtain a fermented product with an alcoholic graduation between 6 - 7 º. Periodic controls of density, temperature, pH, acidity, and ºBrix were performed during the vinification process. At the end of this process, potassium metabisulfite was added to stabilize the product. The "strawberry wine" obtained was characterized by the determination of parameters related to organoleptic, nutritional and nutraceutical quality (phenolic and volatile profile, acids and sugars, antioxidant capacity and color parameters). The results obtained were compared with those of samples of commercial fruit wines (elderberry, blackcurrant and cherry) ...|$|R

The federal system allows to use effects of either greater economic space or more complete considering of local conditions and interests. Specificity of modern Russian federalism lies {{in the history of the}} formation and organization of its space. Russian history is a history of over-centralized state, which however considered the specificities of individual territories. Introduction of federalism in a state management practices in Russia in early 1990 s. occurred in the wave of democratization, but excluding the condition of Russian economy and inherited status of the Russian state space. Strong regions won from the devolution to the RF regions, but it was the result of unequal conditions in which the subjects of the federation were in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>transformation</b> and dissolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USSR. Among economic reasons of recentralization in 2000 are growing regional disparity, payments crisis, regional protectionism, the contradictions between the center and the regions about the financial and production assets. In the most critical moment <b>of</b> <b>market</b> <b>transformation</b> economic disintegration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space of the country began to amplify. Business - elite close to the authorities, seek to free hands in resources development and their export. Request to strengthen the central government came also from the management of economically weak RF subjects who needed financial support from the federal budget. After the restoration of the vertical of power in relations with the regions intergovernmental transfers became the main instrument of the federal government. Huge volume redistribution operations have become a key element of regional policy. Built vertical power was aimed at neutralizing possible political and social consequences of divergence space growth, but not the reasons for its cause. Today federal relations are in a certain accordance with a level of the Russian economy and its spatial structure. The introduction of more democratic forms of federalism without appropriate technological and structural changes in the economy of the RF subjects can create more problems than positive effects. To change the system of power, it is necessary to change a space and the technological base of the economy. Change of the space requires joint efforts of all levels of government and local communities. The task of the central government is to organize their partnership, using political, economic and social institutions...|$|R

Arguably not, for diversity, or variety, {{is the essence of}} economic life in the sense of underlying choice; economic calculation gives numerical substance to how people make choices in their daily endeavours, either as consumers or entrepreneurs. How does variety/diversity takes shape in the realm of institutions and policy making? Is the range of choices open-ended? The last couple of decades has revealed an overwhelming offensive of the neo-liberal paradigm in terms of defining "best practices". Even language was shaped accordingly with market reforms being seen in a quasi-single theoretical and policy framework. Are we heading towards increasing uniformity with regard to institutional and policy set ups, worldwide? An affirmative answer would underline <b>the</b> successful <b>market</b> based <b>transformation</b> <b>of</b> a series of command economies. Some convergence between institutional patterns in the USA and the EU economies might be alluded to in the same vein A supportive argument for this line of reasoning would be that what matters for individual achievement, in the end, are equal opportunities. But this argument can be turned around when debating the merits of various institutional set ups in terms of creating fair chances for people. A sceptical answer would highlight the mounting challenges which confront societies, whether rich and poor, and the international community in general [...] in spite of the high hopes of not long ago. The demise of the "New Economy", the series of corporate scandals in wealthy economies and the subsequent recourse to new regulatory legislation, recurrent financial and currency crises throughout the world, the controversies surrounding the activity of IFIs, should compel "ideologues", of all sorts, to be more humble in their prescriptions.
