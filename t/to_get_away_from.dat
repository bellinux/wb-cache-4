Here he still complained of being unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his mother, with her {{regularly}} phoning him and paying him surprise visits,. He often had limited funds which frequently caused him having to return to her apartment in Aptos.|$|E
5|$|Brian Delate as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his {{character}} {{on the show}} was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and as he tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 she {{travelled}} {{on her own}} to Paris <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{her marriage}} and family commitments. There she had {{a love affair with}} the Egyptian scholar Ahmed Al-Haggagi. He encouraged her to work on Arab patterns, sketching for her the basis of her Poppy (not the same as Unikko). Her Arab-inspired patterns of this period include Kungatar, Naamio, Sadunkertoja, Tumma, and Välly. In 1971 she separated from Tissari, realizing that she preferred to live alone. She spent three years in Algeria, taking a lover named Muhamed.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{its meaning}} was soon reversed, and {{thereafter}} it referred <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> fandom and fannish doings. When fans say they're gafiating, {{it means they}} intend to put some distance between themselves and fandom. This can be either a temporary or a long-term separation.

The commercial features a cameo appearance by The Flaming Lips.|$|R
5000|$|Threat {{management}} {{experts are}} often suspicious of restraining orders, believing they may escalate or enrage stalkers. In his 1997 book The Gift Of Fear, well-known American security specialist Gavin de Becker characterized restraining orders as [...] "homework assignments police give to women to prove they're really committed <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> their pursuers," [...] {{and said they}} [...] "clearly serve police and prosecutors," [...] but [...] "they do not always serve victims." ...|$|R
5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{explored}} {{the world around}} them, experiencing a second childhood with no wives, jobs, or responsibilities. They passed the time by speculating about their fellow townspeople and testing inventions. Regular subplots {{in the first decade}} of the show included: Sid and Ivy bickering over the management of the café, Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge having a secret love affair that everyone knows about, Wally trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Nora's watchful eye, Foggy's exaggerated war stories, and Compo's schemes to win the affections of Nora Batty.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from.</b> The step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she was transformed into a dolphin, and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise.|$|E

5|$|Keith {{finds out}} that Selma might have {{disappeared}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her husband. Veronica shows Wallace the Roman numerals, and they deduce {{that it is a}} date, and Veronica learns that a sorority house member died on that day. Veronica confronts a sorority girl about the dead member, and she implies that others believe that something happened to her. After finding out that leaving her husband after ten years would be beneficial to Selma, Veronica and Keith break into the Roses’ house and find Selma on the couch. Selma tells the pair why she has “disappeared”: Mr. Rose is trying to scam her for more money and has blackmailed her with knowledge of a lesbian affair with her dog walker.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{took three}} years to release a {{follow-up}} album. After a decade without taking time off, {{he said in an}} interview, he needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> music completely and ceased listening to it for several months. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff Upper Lip, came to nothing, and Morrison's next album was A Period of Transition in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Moo, You Bloody Choir saw Richards {{expected}} by record label Sony BMG {{to produce a}} quality follow-up. He denied being under significant pressure, though {{the persistence of the}} label—"Richo, have you got a single? Do you have singles? Please, do you have singles?"—was noted. Much of the writing for Augie March's fourth album took place while touring the United States, which Richards argued minimised the band's opportunities to be creative. In 2008, Augie March began recording Watch Me Disappear at Neil Finn's Auckland studios; they also recorded in Melbourne, Sydney, and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the distraction of Melbourne, their hometown, thus allowing them to focus solely on recording.|$|E

5|$|Working prolifically in cinema, in 1979 Lansbury {{appeared}} as Miss Froy in The Lady Vanishes, {{a remake of}} Alfred Hitchcock's famous 1938 film. The following year she appeared in The Mirror Crack'd, another film based on an Agatha Christie novel, this time as Miss Marple, a sleuth in 1950s Kent. Lansbury hoped <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the depiction of the role made famous by Margaret Rutherford, instead returning to Christie's description of the character; in this she created a precursor to her later role of Jessica Fletcher. She was signed to appear in two sequels as Miss Marple, but these were never made. Lansbury's next film was the animated The Last Unicorn (1982), for which she provided {{the voice of the}} witch Mommy Fortuna.|$|E
5|$|By 1985, Bobby and Pam {{realize that}} they want to be together. Bobby proposes, Pam accepts and they spend the night together. The next day, Bobby is tragically cut down by a car driven by her half-sister, Katherine Wentworth, and dies hours later, leaving Pam heartbroken. Pam goes on to make {{television}} history by dreaming Bobby's death. Pam awakes and finds Bobby in the shower, alive and well. Pam receives good news {{at the end of the}} 1986–1987 season finale: she is finally able to conceive a baby, after confirming that there would be no health risks involved. However, she never gets that chance. While calling her husband to tell him the good news, she is in a massive auto accident where she hits an oil tanker and is severely burned in a subsequent fire. While recovering from her burns, she decides <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Ewings and everyone else, including her son, disappear and divorce Bobby for a second time.|$|E
5|$|The {{spring of}} 1912 was emotionally unsettling for Potter; {{her father was}} ill and severe strikes across the country caused hardships. In April 1912, she managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> London for Hill Top to execute {{background}} drawings for the tale. By July, most of the colour blocks were finished, but Potter {{was concerned about the}} anatomy of the fox, and checked photographs and reference books in the Natural History Museum in an attempt to distinguish the true English red fox (Vulpes vulpes) from other species. The book was finished by the end of July when she left for holiday at Lake Windemere. Completion of the tale had taken longer than usual because her time had been shared with participation in a campaign opposing hydroplanes on Lake Windemere and the proposed construction of an aeroplane factory near the lake.|$|E

5|$|As {{development}} continued, id Software hired {{their former}} Softdisk liaison Kevin Cloud {{as an assistant}} artist, and moved the company out to Mesquite, Texas, near where Apogee was located. Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their royalty rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ScubaVenture, so that id could focus on Wolfenstein. The game {{was intended to be}} released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode. Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day, using {{a modified version of the}} Commander Keen 2D map editor, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs. Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the noise.|$|E
5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E
5|$|Tara and Madison Rayne {{had their}} first match against each other since the break–up of their {{partnership}} on the May 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, where Tara teamed with Mickie James and Ms. Tessmacher against Rayne, Sarita and Rosita. Tara won the match for her team by pinning Rosita, after Rayne, who avoided her former partner throughout the match, sacrificed her in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the ring. Tara and Rayne faced each other again on the July 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, where Tara was victorious after distracting Rayne with her tarantula. On the July 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Tara and Ms. Tessmacher, later named TnT, defeated Mexican America (Rosita and Sarita) to win the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship. Tessmacher and Tara made their first title defense on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, defeating Mexican America in a rematch. On the September 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, Tara was defeated by her former partner Madison Rayne in a match to determine {{the third and final}} challenger for the TNA Knockouts Championship at Bound for Glory.
