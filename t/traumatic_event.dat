5|$|The {{conquest of}} Amorium {{was not only}} a major {{military}} disaster and a heavy personal blow for Theophilos, but also a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> for the Byzantines, its impact resonating in later literature. The sack did not ultimately alter the balance of power, which was slowly shifting in Byzantium's favour, but it thoroughly discredited the theological doctrine of Iconoclasm, ardently supported by Theophilos. As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842.|$|E
5|$|Scientist David Banner has {{the idea}} to create super {{soldiers}} by introducing modified DNA sequences extracted from various animals to strengthen the human cellular response, but General Thaddeus Ross denies him permission to use human subjects. Banner subsequently conducts the experiments on himself. After {{the birth of his}} son Bruce, he finds that his son may have inherited the effects and seeks a cure, but is stopped in the process. Following a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event,</b> Bruce remembers nothing of the incident, and has been raised by the Krenzlers. Years later, Bruce is a geneticist working with his girlfriend, Betty Ross, within the Berkeley Biotechnology Institute on nanomed research. The pair hopes to achieve instantaneous cell repair by using low level Gamma radiation exposure to activate the nanomeds once they are introduced into a living organism. During routine maintenance of their appropriated gamma-ray spectrometer, a circuit shorts and triggers the experiment's program sequence. Unable to prevent the machine from firing, Bruce throws himself in front of a colleague to shield the man and is exposed to a massive amount of gamma radiation.|$|E
5|$|Shirley {{resolves}} {{to complete}} a ritual to fully become the Merines and fulfill her destiny, meeting with Walter and the Ferines leader Maurits Welnes. However, soldiers from the country of Gadoria attack during the ceremony attempting to kill her thinking she willfully sided with Vaclav, with Fenimore jumping {{in the way of}} one of their blades and dying instead. The <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> causes Shirley to be fully engulfed by Nerifes, the malevolent spirit of the ocean itself, before leaving with Maurits. Senel and his friends go after her, passing through the deeper areas of the ship where they discover from fractured recordings that the Legacy was a colony ship from another world, and the Ferines came to the planet and made war with the Orerines 4000 years ago. Arriving at Maurits' stronghold, the party faces Walter, who reveals his jealousy over Shirley choosing Senel over him, and fights until his life gives out. They learn from Maurits that it was in fact the Orerines, not the Ferines, who are the outsiders. He explains that the Orerines' terraforming technology upset the will of the sea so much that his people can no longer live in it, and wishes to use Shirley to flood the world and appease the ocean so that the Ferines can thrive once more. After he is beaten and Shirley brought back to her senses, Maurits summons a physical manifestation of Nerifes itself, which is driven back by Senel and his friends. In the end, Maurits resolves to put aside old hatreds and work towards an era of peace between Orerines and Ferines as the characters return to their old lives.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> among epileptic patients compared with non-epileptic individuals, we distributed a questionnaire on physically <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> occurring during the preceding three months to consecutive epileptic patients and to age- and sex-matched controls. There were 145 epileptic patients, 121 with seizures (age 36 ± 15 y, 60 males) and 24 who were seizure free during this period (age 39 ± 17 y, 13 males), and 145 controls (age 36 ± 15 y, 73 males). There {{was no significant difference}} in the duration of epilepsy between the two groups of patients with epilepsy. <b>Traumatic</b> <b>events</b> (n= 27, three of them unrelated to seizure) were most common in patients with seizures, followed by controls (n= 20), and absent in seizure-free patients (P< 0. 001). Patients with epilepsy most commonly injured the head while the extremities were more usually involved in controls. Patients with epilepsy had significantly more <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> at home, whereas controls underwent most <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> at work and in public areas. There {{was no significant difference in}} the type and severity of trauma between the two groups. We conclude that physically <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> not related to seizures are fewer among patients with epilepsy with and without seizures compared with controls, probably because of increased cautiousness...|$|R

25|$|PTSD is {{believed}} to be caused by the experience {{of a wide range of}} traumatic events and, in particular if the trauma is extreme, can occur in persons with no predisposing conditions. Most people will experience at least one traumatizing event in their lifetime. Men are more likely to experience a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event,</b> but women are more likely to experience the kind of high-impact <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> that can lead to PTSD, such as interpersonal violence and sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} have {{experienced}} a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> will not develop PTSD. People who experience interpersonal trauma (for example rape or child abuse) {{are more likely to}} develop PTSD, as compared to people who experience non-assault based trauma such as accidents and natural disasters. About half of people develop PTSD following rape. Children are less likely than adults to develop PTSD after trauma, especially if they are under ten years of age. Diagnosis is based on the presence of specific symptoms following a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the frequency and}} impact of exposure to potentially <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> among a nonclinical sample of older adults (n = 3, 575), a population typically underrepresented in epidemiological research concerning the prevalence of <b>traumatic</b> <b>events.</b> Current PTSD symptom severity and the centrality of events to identity were assessed for events nominated as currently most distressing. Approximately 90 % of participants experienced one or more potentially <b>traumatic</b> <b>events.</b> Events that occurred with greater frequency early in the life course were associated with more severe PTSD symptoms compared to events that occurred with greater frequency during later decades. Early life traumas, however, were not more central to identity. Results underscore the differential impact of <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> experienced throughout the life course. We conclude with suggestions for further research concerning mechanisms that promote the persistence of post-traumatic stress related to early life traumas and empirical evaluation of psychotherapeutic treatments for older adults with PTSD...|$|R

25|$|Among other symptoms, {{post-traumatic}} stress disorder involves anxiety, over-alertness, sleeplessness, chronic fatigue syndrome, motor difficulties, failing short term memory, amnesia, nightmares and sleep-paralysis. Flashbacks are characteristic to the disorder: the patient experiences the <b>traumatic</b> <b>event,</b> or pieces of it, again and again.

25|$|The {{inability}} {{to relate to}} others {{is also known as}} emotional detachment. Emotional detachment makes it difficult for an individual to empathize with others or to share their own feelings. An emotionally detached person may try to rationalize or apply logic to a situation to which there is no logical explanation. These individuals tend to stress the importance of their independence and may be a bit neurotic. Oftentimes, the {{inability to}} relate to others stems from a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, trauma differs between individuals, {{according}} to their subjective experiences. People will react to similar events differently. In other words, not all people who experience a potentially <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> will actually become psychologically traumatized. This discrepancy in risk rate {{can be attributed to}} protective factors some individuals may have that enable them to cope with trauma, they are related to temperamental and environmental factors. Some examples are mild exposure to stress early in life, resilience characteristics, and active seeking of help.|$|E
25|$|Traumatic {{events are}} more subjective. What is {{traumatic}} {{is dependent on}} what the person finds to be traumatic. Regardless, a <b>traumatic</b> <b>event</b> is an event where something so distressing occurs that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with the stress. A common example of amnesia that is caused by traumatic events is dissociative amnesia, which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply disturbed them. An example would be a person forgetting a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones.|$|E

25|$|MTL amnesic {{patients}} with localized {{damage to the}} hippocampus retain other perceptual abilities, {{such as the ability}} to intelligently function in society, to make conversation, to make one's bed, etc. Additionally, anterograde amnesics without combined retrograde disorders (localized damage to the MTL system) have memories prior to the <b>traumatic</b> <b>event.</b> For this reason, the MTL is not the storage place of all memories; other regions in the brain also store memories.

25|$|Psychological {{trauma is}} a type of damage to the mind that occurs {{as a result of a}} {{severely}} distressing event.

The literature review focused on the causes of trauma, the symptoms related to trauma and <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> and the different trauma intervention models that can be applied to those exposed. The information obtained from the literature review was utilised when drafting and consolidating information relevant and necessary for the survey questionnaire. Through a systematic sampling technique within stratified sampling, a sample was selected and a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data from centre-based correctional officials. The results obtained were used to come to a theoretical conclusion of the study. The empirical study established that centre-based correctional officials are exposed to <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> in DCS and that there is limited provision of support upon exposure to <b>traumatic</b> <b>events.</b> Based on analysis and interpretation of the research findings, recommendations were made to management, Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) personnel and to centre-based correctional officials at Kgoši Mampuru II Local correctional centre for Awaiting Trial Detainees (ATD’s) on how to manage issues related to trauma upon exposure in DCS.

40|$|The aims were, first, to {{identify}} behavioural, cognitive, emotional, and social coping responses to traumatic and stressful situations, and second, {{to examine how}} the nature and severity of <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> are associated with coping dimensions. Third, the effectiveness of coping dimensions was evaluated {{for their ability to}} buffer the children’s mental health from negative trauma effects. The participants were 153 Kurdish girls and boys (Mean age 12. 26 0. 14) from Northern Iraq living in both orphanages and family homes. Coping strategies were measured by a cartoon test depicting traumatic and stressful situations to which children responded in their own words. Factor analyses identified Reconstructing, Active Affiliation, Passivity, and Denial as the coping dimensions. The nature of <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> determined their impact on coping strategies. Family-related hardships were associated with low Reconstructing, and economic hardships with low Active Affiliation, while military violence was not associated with coping dimensions. The effectiveness of coping dimensions was symptom specific. Active Affiliation moderated between exposure to <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> and post-traumatic symptoms and sleeping difficulties, and Denial between exposure to <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> and aggressive symptoms. Reconstructing was marginally directly associated with low levels of post-traumatic and aggressive symptoms, but showed no buffering effect.

40|$|The present Master thesis {{documents}} {{an exploratory}} survey study based on quantitative data from 37 unaccompanied minor asylum-seekers between 15 and 18 {{years of age}} in Norway. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate past <b>traumatic</b> <b>events,</b> present everyday hassles and mental health problems in the lives of these adolescents awaiting decision on their asylum-applications. The associations between the <b>traumatic</b> <b>events,</b> hassles and mental health problems were explored. The potential mediator effect of hassles on the link between past <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> and mental health problems was also investigated. Results indicated high occurrence of past <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> and high prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression and anxiety. Externalizing was recorded to be relatively low, consistent with similar studies of unaccompanied minors. Mediator effect of Hassles on the association between <b>traumatic</b> <b>events</b> and depression was found. The study is unique in exploring a group argued to be scarcely studied in international and Norwegian context. The study aims at broadening the focus from a predominantly trauma-focused to a more psychosocial framework in the assessment of mental health among unaccompanied minor asylum-seekers. The present study is based on a relatively small sample, hence more work with larger samples is needed to understand these processes and validate findings, as well as looking at intergroup differences. Also, longitudinal studies of this group may produce indications of causal pathways between adversities and pathology, from past to present...|$|R
