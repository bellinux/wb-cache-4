5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E

The flower girls answer that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> garlands for bride and groom to be decorated during wedding night. Alternately they also weave sheets of white flowers which are placed on graves for fragrance purposes.|$|E
25|$|Other magazines, such as Granta, Tin House, and Boston Review {{have responded}} to The Count by making a {{conscious}} effort to remedy the gender disparity within their journals. Not only do the editors of these publications say that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> these efforts, but the numbers of The Count show this to be the case.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{can result}} from {{a situation in which}} the perpetrator thinks <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> themselves clear, but is not understood the way they intended. The misunderstanding can either be reasonable or unreasonable. An example of unreasonable is when a woman holds a certain stereotypical view of a man such that she did not understand the man’s explicit message to stop.|$|E

25|$|A false nine is {{a player}} {{who appears to be}} playing as a centre-forward (traditionally a number nine shirt), but drops deeps or pulls wide disrupting the {{opposing}} team's marking. Usually the centre forward will be marked by one of the centre-backs but the false nine will often move away into a grey area causing a dilemma on whether the centre-back follows, isolating them from the other centre-back or stays where <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>making</b> themselves redundant.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consider}} that singing {{is not a}} natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others {{consider that}} some ways of singing {{can be considered as}} natural. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.|$|E
25|$|Convergent Scientific, Inc. (CSI) is an American company {{founded in}} December 2010 and based in Huntington Beach, California. They tested their first polywell design, the Model 1, on {{steady-state}} operations from January to late summer 2012. The MaGrid {{was made of}} a unique diamond shaped hollow wire, into which an electric current and a liquid coolant flowed. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> an effort to build a small-scale polywell fusing deuterium. The company filed several patents and in the Fall of 2013, did a series of web-based investor pitches. The presentations mention encountering plasma instabilities including the Diocotron, two stream and Weibel instabilities. The company wants to make and sell Nitrogen-13 for PET scans.|$|E

25|$|One {{objection}} is that {{a democratic}} republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech {{in the context of}} the ritual of pledging allegiance. Another objection is that the people who are most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely understand the Pledge <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making.</b> Another criticism {{is that a}} government requiring or promoting this phrase violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Tectonic {{activity}} {{along the}} North Coast of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska {{is characterized by}} transform movements of the Queen Charlotte Fault, a plate boundary where the Pacific Plate skids by the North American Plate. As the Pacific Plate moves northward to the Aleutian subduction zone, it generates rifting in the North American continent. Magma rises along cracks created by the rifting, and eventually erupts on the surface to form a volcano. This geological process has, over time, created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, {{which is the most}} volcanically active area in Canada. However, most of the volcanoes have not been directly dated or have not been dated in sufficient detail to recognize how active <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>making</b> the prediction of volcanic events difficult and volcanic hazards uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The 1st European Coastal Conservation Conference 1991, {{organised}} by the EUCC and the Dutch government, {{marked the}} start of the development of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) as a policy approach in the European Community. It led to the EC Demonstration Programme for ICZM and to the adoption of the European Council and Parliament Recommendation on ICZM (2002). EUCC was invited by the European Commission to join the EU ICZM Expert Group; Dr. Alan Pickaver was EUCC’s representative in this expert group until August 2013. As a result, a novel means for Member States to measure the progress <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> on ICZM implementation through the use of indicators was developed. This method was presented to the Working Group on Indicators and data and accepted by the Group of Experts in 2006.|$|E

I remembered thinking just a little further west <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> the films I want to see. I'm going to do this. Sink or swim... I wanted to be a writer on my way to being a director. Directors were already my heroes. Kurosawa, number of Italian directors... Movies from England, France, Sweden, Italy. Poland... One wanted a chance to tell stories in an open, loose, not constricted Hollywood kind of way. At the same time you wanted to work in Hollywood... I was tremendously interested in genre films. Wanted to work within genre films.|$|E
500|$|In a tea {{house in}} Hong Kong, Officer [...] "Tequila" [...] Yuen (Chow Yun-fat) {{and his partner}} Benny (Bowie Lam), attempt to arrest a group of gun smugglers while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> a deal. After an ambush from another gang member, a fierce gun battle breaks out. The gangsters are {{defeated}} but several police officers are badly wounded and Benny is killed. Angered {{by the death of}} his partner, Tequila decides to kill the gangster who ambushed them rather than arrest him. This angers his boss, Officer Superintendent Pang (Philip Chan), who wanted the gangster alive to testify. Tequila is subsequently ordered off the case for his misdemeanor.|$|E
500|$|During the five-years {{from the}} end of 2004 through 2009, {{worldwide}} renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies, while actual production grew 1.2% overall. In 2011, UN under-secretary general Achim Steiner said: [...] "The continuing growth in this core segment of the green economy is not happening by chance. The combination of government target-setting, policy support and stimulus funds is underpinning the renewable industry's rise and bringing the much needed transformation of our global energy system within reach." [...] He added: [...] "Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment, projects and geographical spread. In doing so, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity".|$|E

500|$|In {{everyday}} life, psychologists {{noticed that}} people are persuaded by messages differently based on {{the identity of the}} author. It seemed that the more prestige the author/speaker has, the more likely the person will believe them. [...] Many social psychologists prior to Asch had studied this phenomenon. However, Asch disagreed with many of them and critiqued their interpretations. His main conclusion was that a change in evaluation requires a change in the content and meaning of the response {{as a result of the}} change in context. Therefore, the meaning of the message is interpreted differently depending on who is the author of the message. He suggests that participants are not blindly accepting a message based on the author, but rather <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> meaning of the quote based on the author.|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture Worlds Thomas Bedding {{provided}} the best {{recognition of the}} company. Bedding wrote, [...] "The Gnome Company {{seem to be working}} on, what to our minds, is the most interesting phase of the Christmas sentiment. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> fairy pictures for young people. We fully expect to see other makers follow suit, when they realize what the real Christmas sentiment is, namely one of lightness, brightness, joyousness." [...] Advertisements for the productions show the great desire of the company to produce the three films in the December 1910 season, but interest in the Christmas and New Year's productions would have waned by mid-January 1911 with the productions still not released. Ultimately, the Gnome Motion Picture Company represents an early attempt to cater film productions to children and during the Christmas season.|$|E
500|$|The final {{few months}} of 1862 saw a high water mark for Benjamin's diplomacy. In October, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Gladstone, {{expressed}} confidence in Confederate victory, stating in Newcastle, [...] "There {{is no doubt that}} Jefferson Davis and other leaders of the South have made an army. [...] <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>making,</b> it appears, a navy, and they have made what is more than either—they have made a nation." [...] Later that month, Napoleon proposed to the British and Russians (a U.S. ally) that they combine to require a six months' armistice for mediation, and an end to the blockade; if they did so, it would likely lead to Southern independence. The proposal divided the British Cabinet. In mid-November, at the urgings of Palmerston and War Secretary George Cornewall Lewis, members decided to continue to wait for the South to defeat Lincoln's forces before recognizing it. Although proponents of intervention were prepared to await another opportunity, growing realization among the British public that the Emancipation Proclamation meant that Union victory would be slavery's end made succoring the South politically infeasible.|$|E
