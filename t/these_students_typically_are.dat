30|$|Slovakia has {{suffered}} from high unemployment rates, whereby youth and the low-skilled are particularly disadvantaged, and since the regime change, the country has experienced a rapid expansion of tertiary education. In 2012, around 56 % of young people aged 20 – 24  years were enrolled in tertiary education, but only about 5 % of students under 25  years were working in Slovakia compared to 22 % on average in the EU 27 (Fabo and Beblavý 2015). Most Slovak universities offer distance learning degrees which allow students to combine (full-time) employment and studies (CVTI SR 2016). Between the years 2009 and 2014, distance learning students formed 24 to 33 % of all registered university <b>students.</b> <b>These</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> older than full-time students, adding to the overall body of working students in the country.

40|$|The {{general health}} of Australians {{is a growing}} concern, {{particularly}} with the current focus on reducing the prevalence of preventable risk factors for disease and overweight in children and adults. Schools are becoming increasingly responsible for health promotion, and educating young people about healthy lifestyle behaviours, yet {{there has not been}} an increase in required health education training for primary school teachers. The likely place for training future teachers to adapt to the demands of a changing curriculum is during their pre service training, but the health of university students is a concern in itself. The transition to university and the university environment, with its increase in personal responsibility and culture of alcohol consumption; and the focus on competition and success in personal and academic areas can place students at risk of a multitude of health problems. In addition <b>these</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> at an age where risk taking is common and they rarely know or care about the consequences for their health in the future. To address these issues, a first year undergraduate health education subject was developed and delivered to all Bachelor of Education students at the Bendigo campus of La Trobe University in Australia. This subject was designed to utilise behaviour change theory and best practice in pre-service teacher preparation to focus on improving student’s personal health behaviours in order to prepare them for teaching about such health issues in schools.

40|$|Students have {{difficulty}} understanding {{the concept of}} interaction in analysis of variance, implications {{of the presence of}} a significant interaction for interpretation of main effects, and appropriate follow-up procedures. While grasping computational procedures and how to get software to generate the appropriate terms, interpretation and communication of results poses a challenge. In this paper exercises for teaching interpretation of interaction are presented. The context was an anova course designed for doctoral students in a college of education. <b>These</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> interested in substantive research areas such as counseling or educational administration, so the course is applied in nature. The approach taken to teaching interaction was scaffolding or layering of skills. Students first listened to explanations and examples of what interaction is and answered multiple choice questions oriented to comprehension and application outside of class. They then worked in small groups in class to calculate interaction terms both by hand and using statistical software. Next students wrote both technical summaries of results suitable for submission to a journal and one-paragraph “press releases, ” both of which were critiqued by the course instructor and graduate teaching assistant. These exercises were standard across students and were highly structured. Students then received different data sets and were asked to repeat the analysis, technical, and brief write-up of results for the new data as a homework exercise. The “press releases ” were the basis of 5 -minute in-class presentations done to encourage verbal communication of results. After the presentation, classmates were given a 3 -item quiz about their understanding of the results just presented. The quiz responses were used as feedback to the presenter about the effectiveness of their communication. Successes and failures of this approach are discussed as are thoughts about future directions in teaching about interaction...|$|R

The strongest factor that emerged was parental influence. The findings revealed a statistically significant relationship between parental influence and students' educational aspirations. Moreover, chi-square tests for independence revealed significant differences between the levels of parental influence and students' thinking of dropping out and students' believing that they would drop out. These findings suggest that there is a strong positive relationship between parental influence and students' attitude toward dropping out of school and students' educational aspirations...|$|R
5000|$|Cognitive {{academic}} language proficiency (CALP) is a language-related term developed by Jim Cummins {{which refers to}} formal academic learning, as opposed to BICS. In schools today, the terms BICS and CALP are most frequently used to discuss the language proficiency levels {{of students who are}} in the process of acquiring a new language. <b>These</b> <b>students</b> <b>typically</b> develop proficiency in BICS well before they acquire a strong grasp of CALP or {{academic language}}. As a result, students may initially appear fully proficient and fluent, while still struggling with significant language gaps. In a 1996 ethnographic study of Salvadorean students in Washington, D.C., Carolyn Vincent found that the students' language attainments were [...] "largely deceptive." [...] Students were less proficient than they appeared because they were able [...] "to converse on a few everyday, frequently discussed subjects" [...] but often lacked proficiency in academic language. Although the terms BICS and CALP are still widely used, Jim Cummins has more recently used the terms conversational language and academic language.|$|R

My analysis examines the North Carolina Virtual Public School (NCVPS) and specifically uses the state Algebra I and English I end-of-course (EOC) tests to compare the academic outcomes of students in a statewide, entirely virtual classroom to those in a traditional brick-and-mortar setting. I also use a survey of NCVPS students to examine how students experience the virtual system and why they selected that option. I find that students use NCVPS for two distinct reasons. On one hand, certain students use the course as an opportunity to take an overload of courses or to pursue a course not offered in their local school. <b>These</b> <b>students</b> <b>typically</b> live in rural areas, but they <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> not poor and have a history of academic success.
