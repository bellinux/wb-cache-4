25|$|House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt {{said the}} middle class will not benefit enough from the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> the wealthy will reap unfairly high benefits.

25|$|Obama's {{plan is to}} cut {{income taxes}} overall, which he states would reduce {{revenues}} to below the levels that prevailed under Ronald Reagan (less than 18.2 percent of GDP). Obama argues that his plan is a net <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>and</b> that his tax relief for middle-class families {{is larger than the}} revenue raised by his tax changes for families over $250,000. Obama plans to pay for the tax changes while bringing down the budget deficit by cutting unnecessary spending.|$|E

25|$|In the 2003 {{legislative}} session, Frist enjoyed many successes. He {{was able}} to push many initiatives through to fruition, including the Bush administration's third major <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> legislation that was against partial-birth abortion. However, the tactics {{that he used to}} achieve those victories alienated many Democrats. He also was instrumental in developing and then passing the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the historic and unprecedented funding commitment to fight disease. In 2004, by comparison, he saw no major legislative successes, with the explanations ranging from delay tactics by Democrats to lack of unity within the Republican Party.|$|E
500|$|With {{considerable}} {{experience in}} the General Assembly – first as speaker of the House, and later presiding over the Senate as lieutenant governor – Carroll exercised {{a great deal of}} control over the proceedings of the legislature. One observer quipped [...] "A cockroach couldn't crawl across the Senate floor without an OK from the governor stamped on his back." [...] His reaction to criticism was often severe, prompting his political enemies to derisively refer to him as [...] "Emperor Julian." [...] During the final year of Carroll's term, Lt. Gov. Stovall, who was left as acting governor when Carroll had left the state on business, called a special session of the legislature to enact a tax cut that Carroll opposed but later endorsed. The General Assembly passed the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> began asserting its independence, especially in the Senate, which especially resented Carroll's tight control of previous sessions.|$|E
500|$|The Baird {{nomination}} was emblematic of other difficulties Clinton had {{during the transition}} period and his early days in office, including most prominently the dropping of a promised middle-class <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> resistance to his proposal to allow gays in the military. [...] Stephanopoulos later wrote that [...] "We should have never let the Baird nomination get {{as far as it}} did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step." [...] And the timing of the announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his ability to lead the country, overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began. [...] His [...] "presidential honeymoon" [...] period was thus extremely brief.|$|E

500|$|As governor, Johnson {{followed}} a strict small-government approach. According to former New Mexico Republican National Committee member Mickey D. Barnett, [...] "Any time someone approached him about legislation for some purpose, his first response always {{was to ask}} if government {{should be involved in}} that to begin with." [...] He vetoed 200 of 424 bills passed in his first six months in office—a national record of 47% of all legislation—and used the line-item veto on most remaining bills. [...] In office, Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to reduce the 10% annual growth of the state budget. [...] In his first budget, Johnson proposed a wide range of tax cuts, including a repeal of the prescription drug tax, a $47 million income <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>and</b> a 6-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax cut. However, of these, only the gasoline tax cut was passed. During the November 1995 federal government shutdown, he joined 20 other Republican governors who called on the Republican leadership in Congress to stand firm against the Clinton administration in budget negotiations; in the article reporting on the letter and concomitant news conference he was quoted as calling for eliminating the budget deficit through proportional cuts across the budget. Although Johnson worked to reduce overall state spending, in his first term he raised education spending by nearly a third. [...] When drop-out rates and test scores showed little improvement, Johnson changed his tactics and began advocating school vouchers—a key issue in budget battles of his second term as governor.|$|E

2500|$|Richardson {{was elected}} {{governor}} of New Mexico in November 2002, having defeated the Republican nominee, John Sanchez, 56–39%. During the campaign, {{he set a}} Guinness World Record for most handshakes in eight hours by a politician, breaking Theodore Roosevelt's record. He succeeded a two-term Republican governor, Gary Johnson. He took office in January 2003 as the only Hispanic Governor in the United States. In his first year, Richardson proposed [...] "tax cuts to promote growth and investment" [...] and passed a broad personal income <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> won a statewide special election to transfer money from the state's Permanent Fund to meet current expenses and projects. In early 2005, Richardson helped make New Mexico the first {{state in the nation}} to provide $400,000 in life insurance coverage for New Mexico National Guard members who serve on active duty. Thirty-five states have since followed suit.|$|E

2500|$|When {{it turned}} to the environment, the Carbon Tax {{proposal}} came up repeatedly, with both Dion and May supporting it, although May to more ambitious figures than Dion, pointing out {{it was the most}} recommended and proven way to deal with carbon emissions by countries and organizations around the world, noting the growth that Sweden and Germany have had with this system. Harper criticized the plan, saying would increase taxpayers' burden and that Dion should be [...] "honest with the people" [...] that some environmental measures will cost the economy and said the plan includes $40 billion in carbon taxes and $26 billion in tax cuts. Dion defended the Liberal's Green Shift, saying that [...] " [...] not true at all", and that [...] "for every dollar that we will raise, you will have a <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>and</b> these tax cuts will be on your income". Duceppe commented that he would like targets to be applied to individual provinces, thereby allowing Quebec to financially benefit due to already-implemented greenhouse gas reductions. Layton, who favours a cap-and-trade system, said that it is a [...] "figment of Mr. Harper's imagination" [...] that emissions will fall under his plan. When Harper sought to outline his government's record on other environmental fronts, giving examples of his minority government supported the preservation {{of hundreds of thousands of}} hectares of environmentally sensitive land through the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and that the government declared a protected marine area by Lake Superior and created a whale sanctuary by Baffin Island, May responded by saying [...] "The only word he said that's true is on national parks".|$|E
