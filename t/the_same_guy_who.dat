There's a big light wall, streaks of light, xenon lighting effects and strobe lights. [...] But it's all wrapped around this very simple performance environment".|$|E

5000|$|Bentley {{commented on}} the album, saying it was named after his wife Cassidy's maiden name but it's {{intended}} to tell a universal story of breakups, hookups, mess-ups and everything in between, shining a light {{on the things that}} happen after the sun goes down. He also noted that [...] "It's a relationship album that covers {{the ups and downs of}} the journey and ends with some self-realization and evolvement. The song 'Black' helps set all of that in motion at the top of the album by guiding you into the darkness and the shadows of the night. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> sings 'Somewhere On a Beach' winds up growing and having enough perspective to sing something introspective like 'Different for Girls'.

[...] She also opined [...] "the subtly-sexy song" [...] shows an [...] "edgier side of Niall." [...] Colin Stutz from the publication, added, [...] "The combination of a thumping beat and Horan's raspy vocals makes the song hardly even sound like <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> sang Town". But what [...] "Slow Hands" [...] shows is that Horan definitely won't just be sticking to the sweet singer-songwriter sound on his solo debut." [...] Rolling Stones Althea Legaspi also noted Horan [...] "goes for a more muted sound. Above a stomp-and-clap beat and muted guitar, Horan allows his lower register to showcase his more seductive side on the track." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{spirituality of}} George MacDonald, as is {{patented}} in its “unuttered Sermons” (and other works and of these emanate), orbiting three main poles: the God-Love that ignites what {{for the subject}} is unloving; <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> needs help to estimate {{the skin of his}} “ego” to move to live from his “I”; and finally, the “other” that come to the subject in all the most imponderable circumstances, are fundamentals so that you can operate such transformation made possible only by the filial and fraternal love. Founded the interrelationships between these three poles, questions arise as important for Christian spirituality (and Catholic) as the delivery to the Cross; the role of sensory dryness; the salvific solidarity; love and forgiveness (of God and subject to either with this or towards others) that overcomes the retributive justice; delivery to the present moment; delivery to divine providence; the configuration with Christ; and loving obedienceinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
