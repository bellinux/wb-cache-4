500|$|After his {{freshman}} season, Swanigan was {{one out of}} 162 underclassmen to enter their names for the 2016 NBA Draft. However, despite being one of 63 invitees for the NBA Draft Combine that year, he ultimately {{decided to return to}} college on May 25, which was also the new date set for players to withdraw their names from the draft and try again for another year. An NBA scout said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> chance if he can improve his jump shot and help defense. Big-time rebounder, works hard on his own. He's still more undersized center than power forward, though." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means. But {{you know}} he has a roving disposition, and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> sort of fondness for Jackson--the boss of the ranch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. James," [...] said Walthew, [...] "runs no {{risk that}} I can see. However, if you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to something, you can divide with him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'He <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{beautiful}} profile. Couldn't {{you make}} {{one of the girls}} say something about Willie having the goods in that line?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Easy with him," [...] Harry said. [...] "Steady {{with that}} arm. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{shoulder}} broken, {{as well as}} this knock on the head that has stunned him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'A chance!' says she. 'Well, he may <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> chance; but I hope he won't think he's got a cinch, {{after what}} he's been next {{to all the}} evening.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But my idea is this: {{if a man}} {{has saved}} a few pounds himself, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right {{to give it to}} those he loves best. Now I have no {{children}} of my own.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what,' said Charles, {{lowering}} his voice,' from what Bolton says, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dread of worse than brain fever.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> {{extraordinarily}} good face,' {{she said}} at last gravely. 'I've never seen a man whose honesty of purpose was so transparent.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's true," [...] said Blake, who {{had kept}} away {{for fear of}} his {{resolution}} melting if he saw much of her. [...] "Still, my uncle seems to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> prior claim, and I mayn't {{be able to stay}} with him long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} it is,' muttered Ralph, {{walking up and down}} the room, 'but {{whenever}} a man dies without any property of his own, he always seems to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to dispose of other people's. What is your daughter fit for, ma'am?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are simply}} scandalous," [...] Rees {{declared}} gloomily. [...] "One does not speculate with one's own money. I {{should have thought}} that any one with the least knowledge of finance would understand that. This man seems to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lien upon our private fortunes." ...|$|E
5000|$|George V. Higgins {{wrote in}} 1975: [...] "Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, {{and there are}} some who <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Washington Post alias {{borrowed}} from a dirty movie." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My partner has {{a horror}} of the swamps," [...] Marston remarked with a smile. [...] "If he was not keen to earn some money, he would not enter the lagoon. He has not joined me long and wants his friends to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> talent for business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have now}} known Mr. Wychecombe several months," [...] {{observed}} Mildred, fastening her full, blue eye calmly on Tom's sinister-looking face; [...] "and {{we have never}} known any thing to cause us to think he would bear a name--or names--that he does not at least <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "He {{rejected}} categories generally," [...] Sklenicka says. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> abstract mind at all. He just wasn't {{built that}} way, {{which is why}} he's so good at picking the right details that will stand for many things." ...|$|R

60|$|Mr Bloom, glancing {{sideways}} up {{from the}} cross he had made, saw the foreman's sallow face, <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.

6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> nice temper, Jake; {{but people}} learn {{to control their}} temper, and I don't see why horses shouldn't.

Off his feed, too, a bit, I noticed." ...|$|E

60|$|Mordaunt hesitated. <b>He</b> would <b>have</b> liked Dick to tell Jim, {{since this}} might lead {{the latter to}} take the cottage from Shanks.
