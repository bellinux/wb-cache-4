5|$|Today, the {{international}} border is firmly established and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The <b>trade</b> <b>corridor</b> once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E

The Heartland Expressway is a portion of a high priority international corridor between Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada called the Ports to Plains Corridor. This international corridor is made up of three high priority systems, of which the Heartland Expressway is one. The other two systems include the Theodore Roosevelt Expressway between Rapid City and Saskatoon and The Ports to Plains Corridor between Monterrey and Denver. Together, the systems complete an international <b>trade</b> <b>corridor</b> between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Portions of the Heartland Expressway in Colorado and South Dakota are already complete, however progress has been slow in Nebraska. Prior to 2016, no portion of US385 had been upgraded to four lanes in Nebraska, however portions of the expressway along US 26 between Morrill and Minatare as well as N-71 south of Scottsbluff to I-80 are upgraded to four-lane divided highway.|$|E

25|$|By the 1850s the Fraser Canyon was {{transformed}} from a First Nations and fur <b>trade</b> <b>corridor</b> to a busy route, called the Cariboo Road, used by gold rush miners seeking access to the upper Fraser Basin. During the 1880s, the Canadian Pacific Railway built a new transcontinental railroad to unite the far-flung provinces of the young Dominion of Canada. This nation-building project saw new railroad tracks constructed on the west riverbank at Hells Gate, connecting the British Columbia coast to the Interior (and the rest of Canada) through the Fraser Canyon. Some assert that rocks and debris dumped into the river during construction of the CPR constricted the river flow and impeded salmon passage, {{though there is no}} documented historical or physical evidence to support this claim. By early 1911 the Canadian Northern Railway began a second transcontinental railway along the south and east bank of the canyon, which was completed in a year's time. While carving into canyon walls to create new rail-bed, rock and debris were again dumped into the river in significant volumes at various locations, including Hells Gate. In early 1914, two years after the completion of the CNR and during construction of a new tunnel, a large rockslide fell into the river just above the Hells Gate portal. Debris dispersed on the river bottom caused a 5-meter vertical drop in water depth and increased water velocity from five meters per second to 6.75m/second. As observed and noted by local residents and later by biologists {{in the aftermath of the}} slide, noticeably higher water velocity seemed to exceed the swimming capacity of the salmon, resulting in premature mortality and reduced populations of salmon fry in the subsequent year. In an initial attempt to redress the ecological and physical changes at Hells Gate that impeded migrating salmon, tons of rocks and debris were removed from the river during the winter of 1914-1915. By early 1915, Hells Gate was pronounced clear. While government officials declared that the river at Hells Gate was fully restored, many biologists maintain that the slide permanently altered the river's ecology.|$|E

[...] Work included the construction of two new steel bridges over the Oldman River in 1996 which formed a bypass to the south of Monarch. [...] The former alignment of the highway through Monarch was re-designated as Highway3A, relegating the previously controversial interchange at Highway23 to service of local Monarch traffic. [...] Travellers continuing west on Highway3 toward Fort Macleod from Lethbridge no longer had to exit the highway and reduce their speed to navigate a single lane ramp, and were not at risk of missing the exit and accidentally proceeding north on Highway23 toward Vulcan.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 30 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 11 - 14 July 2011 "Africa on the Move", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. The integration and spatial development on the African continent is promoted through initiatives that enhance interconnectivity and facilitate trade by focusing on transport corridors. The speed of freight movement along these corridors {{is crucial to the}} competitiveness of most African economies, especially those that are landlocked. The speed is affected by the throughput time at ports and border posts and also by the condition of the transport infrastructure. Overloading of heavy vehicles can cause considerable damage to road infrastructure which in turn affects the speed at which freight moves alona these corridors. A corridor can link several economic centres, countries and ports and &-ordination and harrnonisation of overload control among the countries along the corridor could become a bureaucratic nightmare. The paper briefly describes the routes along the main <b>trade</b> <b>corridors</b> in Southern Africa. It then demonstrates how the private sector can get involved in overload control on the roads along these corridors in terms of the recommendations in the SSATP's Working Paper No 90. The paper also proposes a regional overload control network for the Southern Africa <b>trade</b> <b>corridors</b> and provides a "first order" estimate of the benefiffcost ratio of such a network. The functions of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for overload control at SADC level and a possible concept of the agreements between the SPV, the private sector service provider and the financial institution(s) is also proposed.
