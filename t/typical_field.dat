5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a <b>typical</b> <b>field</b> goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E

2500|$|MRI has the {{advantages}} of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging. [...] MRI does have several disadvantages though. [...] First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10−3 mol/L [...] to 10−5 mol/L, which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting. [...] This problem {{stems from the fact}} that the population difference between the nuclear spin states is very small at room temperature. [...] For example, at 1.5 teslas, a <b>typical</b> <b>field</b> strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2 million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength, and hyperpolarization via optical pumping or dynamic nuclear polarization. There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{half-life}} of glyphosate in soil ranges between 2 and 197 days; a <b>typical</b> <b>field</b> half-life of 47 days {{has been}} suggested. Soil and climate conditions affect glyphosate's persistence in soil. The median half-life of glyphosate in water varies {{from a few}} to 91 days. At a site in Texas, half-life was as little as three days. A site in Iowa had a half-life of 141 days. The glyphosate metabolite AMPA {{has been found in}} Swedish forest soils up to two years after a glyphosate application. In this case, the persistence of AMPA was attributed to the soil being frozen for most of the year. Glyphosate adsorption to soil, and later release from soil, varies depending on the kind of soil. Glyphosate is generally less persistent in water than in soil, with 12- to 60-day persistence observed in Canadian ponds, although persistence of over a year has been recorded in the sediments of American ponds. [...] The half-life of glyphosate in water is between 12 days and 10 weeks.|$|E
