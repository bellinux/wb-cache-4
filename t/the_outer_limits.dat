5|$|Paris is {{provided}} in electricity through a 'periphery' grid fed by multiple sources., around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-France comes from cogeneration energy plants located near <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>limits</b> of the region; other energy sources include the Nogent nuclear power plant (35%), trash incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power (0.034 GWh).

5|$|Tobe Hooper, then {{preparing}} both Invaders From Mars and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, was mooted as director. Golan and Globus misunderstood {{the concept}} of the character ("They thought it was like The Wolf Man", said director Joseph Zito) and instructed writer Leslie Stevens, creator of <b>The</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Limits,</b> to write a treatment reflecting their misconception. In Stevens' story, a corporate scientist intentionally subjects ID-badge photographer Peter Parker to radioactive bombardment, transforming him into a hairy, suicidal, eight-armed monster. This human tarantula refuses to join the scientist’s new master-race of mutants, battling a succession of mutations kept in a basement laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{returned}} to Pomona, California and {{stayed at the}} home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes, where he wrote the draft for The Terminator. Cameron's influences included 1950s science fiction films, the 1960s fantasy television series <b>The</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Limits,</b> and contemporary films such as The Driver (1978) and Mad Max 2 (1981). To translate the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher, who had a similar approach to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write. As Wisher lived far from Cameron, the two communicated ideas by recording tapes of what they wrote by telephone. Frakes and Wisher would later write the US-released novelization of the movie.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} the cellular context of neuronal differentiation in the vertebrate retina, we analyzed {{the behavior of}} a class of progenitor cells in <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> nuclear layer of the teleost retina which divide throughout the animal's life and generate only rod photoreceptors. We present evidence that these progenitors reside adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane of <b>the</b> retina during all phases of cell cycle. After final cell division, postmitotic cells move inward, toward the vitreal boundary of <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> nuclear layer, before they give rise to new rods. This movement is remarkable because it occurs in the mature, functioning retina. We hypothesize that only one of the two progenitor daughter cells moves while the other remains adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane to divide again...|$|R

40|$|Ultrastructural {{studies of}} thin-sectioned and freeze-cleaved {{materials}} {{were performed on}} developing retinal tissues of 3 - to 9 -day-old chick embryos to clarify the junctional structures between neural retinal cells and between neural retinal cells and cells of the pigmented epi-thelium. Frequency, size and position of gap junctions in developing neural retina are different at each stage of development. In 3 -day-old embryos, some cells adhere to each other by gap junctions immediately below <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane of neural retinae. The size and number of gap junctions increase remarkably during 5 - 6 days of incubation. In this period of development, well developed gap junctions consisting of subcompartments of intramembrane particles are found between cell surfaces at both <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane region and the deeper portion of the neural retina. Gap junctions disappear thereafter, and at 7 5 days of incubation, small gap junctions are predominant between cell surfaces at <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>limiting</b> membrane region, while the frequency of gap junctions in the deeper portion is very low. At 9 days of incubation, gap junctions are rarely found. Typical gap junctions are always found between neural retinal cells {{and those of the}} pigmented epithelium in embryos up to 7 5 days of incubation.
