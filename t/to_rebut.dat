5|$|Creationist sources {{frequently}} define evolution {{according to}} a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning. As a result, many attempts <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> evolution do not address the findings of evolutionary biology (see straw man argument). This also means that advocates of creationism and evolutionary biologists often simply speak past each other.|$|E

A similar approach was made by Ivan Banks in 1996. Michael Coleman in an SPR report in 1997 wrote Price's defenders are unable <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> the criticisms convincingly.|$|E
5|$|Irish {{immigrants}} generally remained {{loyal to}} the Democratic Party, but McKinley's promises of sound money attracted German-Americans who were appalled by Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans had long been Democratic; efforts by that party <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> McKinley, including circulating a statement by Bismarck in support of bimetallism, were ineffective. Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association had for him.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{remainder}} of the 1970s, Velikovsky devoted a great deal of his time and energy <b>to</b> <b>rebutting</b> his critics in academia, and he continued to tour North America and Europe to deliver lectures on his ideas. By that time, the elderly Velikovsky suffered from diabetes and intermittent depression, which his daughter said may have been exacerbated by the academic establishment's continuing rejection of his work. [...] He died in 1979.|$|R
5000|$|Principles of Political Economy (1820) was a {{successful}} book by Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834). The last chapter of the book was devoted <b>to</b> <b>rebutting</b> Say's law, and argued that the economy could stagnate {{with a lack of}} [...] "effectual demand". In other words, wages if less than the total costs of production cannot purchase the total output of industry, causing prices to fall; price falls decrease incentives to invest, creating a downward spiral.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to Uncle Tom's Cabin, {{writers in the}} Southern United States produced {{a number of books}} <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> Stowe's novel. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that African Americans were a childlike people unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.|$|E

According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E
5|$|The Shakespeare authorship {{question}} is the argument that someone other than William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield {{the identity of the}} real author or authors, who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit. Although the idea has attracted much public interest, all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and, for the most part, acknowledge it only <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> or disparage the claims.|$|E

40|$|Argumentation is {{receiving}} an increasing attention as a technique for practical and uncertain reasoning underlying {{the realization of}} intelligent autonomous agents. In line with the evolution of agent architectures towards distribution, we propose a distributed approach to argumentation, where independent processes construct arguments and revise their defeat status by exploiting local information only. We present and compare two distributed self-stabilizing algorithms for defeat status computation, one specifically tailored <b>to</b> <b>rebutting</b> defeat, and the other able to handle any form of defeat. The property of self-stabilization is enforced to ensure a globally correct behavior of the system...|$|R
2500|$|Macaulay's {{approach}} has been criticised by later historians for its one-sidedness and its complacency. Karl Marx referred {{to him as a}} 'systematic falsifier of history'. His tendency to see history as a drama led him to treat figures whose views he opposed as if they were villains, while characters he approved of were presented as heroes. Macaulay goes to considerable length, for example, to absolve his main hero William III of any responsibility for the Glencoe massacre. Winston Churchill devoted a [...] of the Duke of Marlborough <b>to</b> <b>rebutting</b> Macaulay's slights of his ancestor, expressing hope 'to fasten the label [...] "Liar" [...] to his genteel coat-tails.' ...|$|R
5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, {{on the kitchen floor}} beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter from the airport to their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage. The man who had helped Dion stands to one side, watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus {{that there is no}} convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, has said that the media has a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} a multi-agent system where agents perform ar-gumentation {{activity on the}} basis of knowledge both stated in their knowledge-bases and acquired from other agents. Starting from a previous proposal, we introduce a distributed approach to argumentation, removing some limiting assumptions, and we show by means of an example that the system can not be guaranteed to reach a state which satisfy a well-founded semantics, and not even to terminate. In order to tackle this problem, we devise two self-stabilizing algorithms for the computation of the de-feat status, one specifically tailored <b>to</b> <b>rebutting</b> defeat, and the other able to deal with any form of defeat. ...|$|R

50|$|In 1953, the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) {{held its}} annual conference at Grace. Whitcomb was {{especially}} impressed by Dr. Henry M. Morris' presentation defending Flood geology against day-age, ruin-restoration and pictorial-day views. The two {{found that they}} shared a belief in a literal six-day creation and a global Flood. Bernard Ramm's book The Christian View of Science and Scripture, {{which was published in}} 1954 and led to ASA rejection of Flood geology, impelled Whitcomb to devote his doctoral dissertation <b>to</b> <b>rebutting</b> Ramm and defending a literal interpretation of Genesis 6-9. Whitcomb polled Old Testament, archeology and apologetics scholars at evangelical schools, but although he found a wide range of viewpoints, he found little support for Flood geology. Whitcomb completed his dissertation on 'The Genesis Flood' in 1957.|$|R
5|$|In 1173, {{more than}} two years after the murder of Becket, King Henry II of England decided to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury; there were two candidates: Richard, and Odo, prior of Canterbury. Previously, Roger, the abbot of Bec Abbey, had been elected, but refused the office. On 3 June 1173, Richard was chosen, {{although}} the monks preferred Odo. Both sides appealed to Rome, and Richard journeyed to Rome with Reginald fitz Jocelin, who had recently been elected Bishop of Bath, <b>to</b> <b>rebut</b> the charges of simony, illegitimate birth, and swearing an oath to the king that had been raised. After hearing the charges, they were dismissed and the election was ratified on 2 April 1174 and on 7 April 1174 the new archbishop was consecrated at Anagni by Pope Alexander III. Richard returned to England {{at the close of the}} year bearing his pallium which he had received directly from the pope. He was also granted legatine powers by Alexander III.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, Seward {{was advised}} by his {{political}} supporters {{that he would}} be better off avoiding additional controversial statements, and left the country for an eight-month tour of Europe and the Middle East. Seward spent two months in London, meeting with the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, and was presented at Court to Queen Victoria. Seward returned to Washington in January 1860 to find controversy: that some southerners blamed him for his rhetoric, which they believed had inspired John Brown to try to start a slave insurrection. Brown was captured and executed; nevertheless, Mississippi representatives Reuben Davis and Otho Singleton each stated that if Seward or another Radical Republican was elected, he would meet with the resistance of a united South. <b>To</b> <b>rebut</b> such allegations, and to set forth his views in the hope of receiving the nomination, Seward made a major speech in the Senate on February 29, 1860, which most praised, though white southerners were offended, and some abolitionists also objected because the senator, in his speech, said that Brown was justly punished. The Republican National Committee ordered 250,000 copies in pamphlet form, and eventually twice that many were printed.|$|E
