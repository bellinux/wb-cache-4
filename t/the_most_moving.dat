500|$|Fauré {{scholars}} are {{generally agreed that}} the last nocturne – which was the last work he wrote for the piano – is among the greatest of the set. Nectoux writes that along with the sixth, it is [...] "incontestably <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving</b> and inspired of the series." [...] Bricard calls it [...] "the most inspired and beautiful in the series." [...] For Pinkas, the work [...] "achieves a perfect equilibrium between late-style simplicity and full-textured passionate expression." [...] The work opens in a [...] "pure, almost rarefied atmosphere" [...] (Nectoux), with a [...] "tone of noble, gentle supplication... imposing gravity and... rich expressive four part writing." [...] This is followed by an allegro, [...] "a true middle section in a virtuoso manner, ending in a bang" [...] (Pinkas). The repeat of the opening section completes the work.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{almost universal}} critical praise. Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times called {{it one of}} his favorite Fringe episodes due to the [...] "incredible" [...] opening, Brady and Noble's [...] "outstanding" [...] performances, and the scene with Olivia unknowingly talking to Walternate. Like Hanson, Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly also praised the actors' performances, and thought it was [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving</b> and revelatory episodes in the series' short history". Though he felt the episode did not quite match up to [...] "Peter", Ramsey Isler from IGN rated [...] "Subject 13" [...] an 8.5/10. He believed the opening to be [...] "tense and surprising" [...] and praised the child actors' performances. Finally, he thought the scene in which Olivia accidentally encounters Walternate was a [...] "brilliant plot twist that ties a lot of things together".|$|E

500|$|Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline opines {{that the}} work is [...] "a {{portrait}} of the artist at a turning point" [...] in his life. He believes that it [...] "stands alone" [...] in The Adventures of Tintin due to its lack of antagonist and few characters, describing it as [...] "a spiritual quest" [...] where the [...] "only conflict is between man and nature... put the best of himself into Tintin in Tibet." [...] Referring to its [...] "stripped-bare story and archetypal clarity", Benoît Peeters believes Tintin in Tibet {{to be one of the}} two [...] "pivotal" [...] books in the series, alongside The Blue Lotus, and deems it poignant that Chang features in both. He also suggests that Hergé included the benevolent Yeti to [...] "make up for the interminable massacre" [...] of animals in the second Tintin adventure, Tintin in the Congo, and that the sadness the Yeti experienced at the story's end reflected Hergé's feelings about his separation from Germaine. Peeters concluded, [...] "Even more than Art Spiegelman's Maus, Tintin in Tibet is perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving</b> book in the history of the comic strip." ...|$|E
500|$|Poulenc {{composed}} songs {{throughout his}} career, and his output in the genre is extensive. In Johnson's view, {{most of the}} finest were written in the 1930s and 1940s. Though widely varied in character, the songs are dominated by Poulenc's preference for certain poets. From the outset of his career he favoured verses by Guillaume Apollinaire, and from the mid-1930s the writer whose work he set most often was Paul Éluard. Other poets whose works he frequently set included Jean Cocteau, Max Jacob, and Louise de Vilmorin. In {{the view of the}} music critic Andrew Clements, the Éluard songs include many of Poulenc's greatest settings; Johnson calls the cycle Tel Jour, Telle Nuit (1937) the composer's [...] "watershed work", and Nichols regards it as [...] "a masterpiece worthy to stand beside Fauré's La bonne chanson". Clements finds in the Éluard settings a profundity [...] "worlds away from the brittle, facetious surfaces of Poulenc's early orchestral and instrumental music". The first of the Deux poèmes de Louis Aragon (1943), titled simply [...] "C", is described by Johnson as [...] "a masterpiece known the world over; it is the most unusual, and perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving,</b> song about the ravages of war ever composed." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Day We Died" [...] has {{generally}} received positive reviews from television critics. Sam McPherson from TV Overmind graded the finale with an A, writing [...] "From a show {{known for its}} mindbending episodes came the most mindbending episode of all. 'The Day We Died'... not only reinvigorated the show's fantastic (but inevitably aging) premise, but gave the show a breath of life that has me waiting -- no, begging -- for the show's fourth season." [...] Though he wouldn't call the finale the best Fringe episode yet, McPherson referred to the season as {{the best of the}} three and [...] "probably the best season of television that's aired in recent years". Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker lauded the finale, commenting in his review's conclusion [...] "Consider about the whole arc of this season and tell me this wasn’t one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving,</b> thrilling, funny, inspiring chunks of television you’ve watched. The performances by Noble, Torv, and Jackson were extraordinarily adroit, never showy or merely clever. I was so glad that, by season’s end, Jackson/Peter had once again taken center-stage — a central importance — to a season that, by the nature of its design, needed to concentrate a lot on Walter(s) and Olivia(s)." ...|$|E

The {{publication}} stated that [...] "this fast-paced episode…had switches and secrets and is a tad reminiscent of Oceans 11" [...] and that the characterization of Vinnie Van Lowe was [...] "a pleasing little touch." [...] Vulture listed the episode's use of [...] "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart" [...] by Al Green and [...] "Adelaide" [...] by The Old 97's on its list of [...] "16 Perfect Musical Moments from Veronica Mars". Katie Atkinson of Entertainment Weekly ranked [...] "Donut Run" [...] as one of [...] "the 10 essential episodes of Veronica Mars", noting [...] "The Air That I Breathe" [...] by The Hollies as a musical standout. Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote called the episode the 2nd best of the series, behind [...] "Not Pictured", writing that [...] "This episode is arguably the biggest game-changer of Veronica Mars. It’s {{also one of the}} saddest," [...] also writing that it [...] "featured one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving</b> scenes of the series."

500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, Morning/Evening received an average score of 77 based on 17reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Exclaim! reviewer Chad Barnes called it [...] "a gorgeous, daring album", saying that [...] "Hebden spins intricate sonic gold while subtly exploring {{a range of}} moods and moments on the complex, constantly morphing compositions". Kitty Empire, writing for The Observer, {{said that it was}} a [...] "low key treat" [...] that contained [...] "effortless prettiness." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Andy Beta called the album [...] "daring and expansive" [...] and said that [...] "the scope and ambition of Morning/Evening is profound, and will hopefully inspire producers to take bigger chances and not be satisfied with pop- or club-friendly lengths." [...] NME called [...] "Morning Side" [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving</b> pieces of music Hebden has ever put his name to" [...] and said the album ranked [...] "alongside Four Tet's very best work." [...] Critic Nina Corcoran of Consequence of Sound said that [...] "Hebden has done what he does best: create an atmosphere so encompassing that you lose sight of wherever you are while you're listening". Spins Dan Weiss called the album [...] "ambitious" [...] and [...] "beautiful in its own right, if you’re patient." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{were some}} improvised scenes. These {{included}} {{a scene in}} the beginning of the episode where Alan and Joanna are in a middle of a field and the scene begins with a low-angle shot. Later, when Alan is [...] "humping" [...] Joanna, the scene suddenly becomes a crane shot. This is because the crew at the time had a crane camera after they had finished filming the final scenes in series 2 where Alan, Joanna and Martin are teetering over the edge of a cliff in the stolen camper van. The camper van scenes were the hardest to shoot, especially the scene where the van explodes, as this had to be done in one take. Another problem was the smell of the van, which Pippa Haywood said, [...] "smelt of old dogs." [...] The van also suffered other problems such as bits of the steering wheel and gear stick coming off. Julian Rhind-Tutt commented that the scene where Alan and Boyce talk together for the last time was one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving</b> scenes in the whole of Green Wing. The wedding was shot at Hall of Bayham Abbey in Kent, where the crew had difficulty filming due to bad weather. The show also features a guest appearance from Jeremy Sheffield near the end of the episode as Sue's new boyfriend.|$|E

500|$|Tom Shone, {{writing for}} The Sunday Times, praised the novel for its {{atypical}} qualities for Ellis, [...] "known for his orgies of violence". Shone asks [...] "Why {{is a new}} sequel to Less Than Zero... so moving?", noting the presence of [...] "feelings" [...] in the novel to be starkly different from Ellis' usual style. Touching on its personal qualities, Shone notes [...] "If Lunar Park unspooled the atrocities of American Psycho back to their source, Imperial Bedrooms pulls the thread further and reaches Less Than Zero". The emotive energy {{in the new book}} is traced back to the last pages of Lunar Park as well; fellow writer Jay McInerney observes that [...] "The last few pages of [...] are among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving</b> passages I know in recent American fiction ... Bret was coming to terms with his relationship with his father in that book." [...] Vice observes that the [...] "final passages in both Imperial Bedrooms and Lunar Park pack a lot of emotional impact." [...] San Francisco Chronicle hails Imperial Bedrooms as [...] "the very definition of authorly meta: Ellis is either so deeply enmeshed in his own creepy little insular world that he can't write his way out of it, or else he is such a genius that he's created an entire parallel universe that folds and unfolds on itself like some kind of Escher print." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Dot was {{featured}} in a storyline about euthanasia, when her oldest friend Ethel, who had terminal cancer, asked her to help her die. The storyline allowed the production team to present {{all sides of the}} debate about euthanasia, {{from the perspective of the}} sufferer and from the person who is asked to assist in the mercy killing, religious and moral opposition. According to author Dorothy Hobson, [...] "Dot suffered torment as she struggled with her conscience and she tried to resist the request [...] to assist [...] in the ultimate sin". In the storyline, Ethel enjoyed the last days of her life and chose her final evening. Assisted by Dot, she took an overdose of her medication and died. Written by Simon Ashton and directed by Francesca Joseph the episode ended with a scene in which Ethel tells a weeping Dot [...] "you're the best friend I ever had". Alternative credit music replaced the typical drum beats and theme tune at the end of the episode. The 1931 song used instead of the usual theme was [...] "Guilty" [...] by Al Bowlly. Ben Summerskill from The Observer has suggested that Dot's part in the euthanasia storyline was [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving</b> dramatic sequences shown in recent years on British TV". The episode was voted the most emotional soap death in a Radio Times poll of 4,000 readers in 2006.|$|E
500|$|The three lead {{characters}} do {{not have}} last names because [...] "they are not normal people". Romanek believed that the three main characters act with great dignity. He noted {{that they are not}} materialistic or looking for power, but just desire to acknowledge their love for each other and stay close in their friendship. An example he mentioned was how Ruth tries to seek redemption by attempting to set right a big mistake she had made. What he found <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>moving</b> aspect of the film was the [...] "graceful place of acceptance that Kathy comes to at the end". Child actors Isobel Meikle-Small, Ella Purnell, and Charlie Rowe play the younger versions of Never Let Me Gos three lead actors. Hawkins, who co-starred with Mulligan in An Education, had a supporting role as Miss Lucy, who is a teacher at an isolated English boarding school where the students slowly become {{aware of the fact that}} they are feared by people in the outside world. Charlotte Rampling portrays Miss Emily, a schoolmaster who presides over the orphanage at Hailsham. Richard was cast as an administrator, who is known as Madame. The character has been conducting an ongoing project that aims to analyse the students’ characters and psychologies, which has been compared to treating them as if they were subjects in an experiment. Riseborough's casting in Never Let Me Go was announced in April 2009 by Screen Daily; she had a small role in the film.|$|E
