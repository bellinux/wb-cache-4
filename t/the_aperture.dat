5|$|The Scotch bonnet is preyed upon by vertebrates, such as fish, and invertebrates, {{including}} crabs such as {{the blue}} crab and the Florida stone crab. Crabs can crush the snail's shell, eating the soft internal organs and muscle tissue. The snail's only defense mechanism against predation is to draw its body into the shell. By doing so, they can close <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> using the operculum.|$|E
5|$|A second {{access to}} the castle leads up from a rocky cove, <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> to a marine cave on the {{northern}} side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers {{access to the}} castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E
40|$|Strong {{and weak}} {{quadrupole}} apertures have been optimized and fabricated for relatively dense O. 12 ~im geometry’s. All of <b>the</b> <b>apertures</b> were optimized using PROLITH/ 2 simulation software. <b>The</b> <b>apertures</b> were fabricated as fused silica reticles that are inserted at the lens pupil plane. <b>The</b> <b>apertures</b> change <b>the</b> illumination profile that is {{collected by the}} condenser lens.

5000|$|Despite {{it being}} a {{versatile}} technique, there are still several challenges {{to be addressed by}} stencil lithography. During deposition through the stencil, material is deposited not only on the substrate through <b>the</b> <b>apertures</b> but also on the stencil backside, including around and inside <b>the</b> <b>apertures.</b> This reduces <b>the</b> effective <b>aperture</b> size by an amount proportional to the deposited material, leading ultimately to aperture clogging.|$|R
50|$|Dewatering screens operate {{by passing}} {{particles}} over a screen. The particles {{pass over the}} screen while the water passes through <b>the</b> <b>apertures</b> in <b>the</b> screen. This process is only viable for coarse ores that have a close size distribution as <b>the</b> <b>apertures</b> can allow small particles to pass through.|$|R
5|$|Flagged {{initially}} as {{a transit}} event by the satellite, Kepler-9d {{was given the}} designation KOI 377.03. It was recognized as a potential planet after a study into the system confirmed Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c, but follow-up studies had to be completed to verify that it was indeed a planet, and that the apparent transit event was not due to a background eclipsing binary star in <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> of Kepler's photometer. Kepler's team exhaustively disproved that the small transit event could have been anything but a planet, and their results {{were published in the}} Astrophysical Journal on January 1, 2011. Follow-up observations were conducted by the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, as well as the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, {{there is}} a {{well-defined}} lowered area {{in the middle of}} the rostrum (front part), which nearly touches the back margin of the large, V-shaped nasal aperture (opening for the nose). Next to <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> are two elevated areas, above the incisors. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are slender. The supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) are well-developed. P.abramus, P.endoi, and P.paterculus have a flatter rostrum and less prominent supraorbital ridges. The braincase is of average size and bears a poorly developed sagittal crest on its roof. The supraoccipital, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave palate are about parallel.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{residential}} areas at Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in place or close to <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{performance}} of frequency selective structures with defects. A frequency selective structure is in this case a periodic pattern of apertures in a conducting plate. The plate can be of arbitrary thickness. The defects can be by deviations in the placing of <b>the</b> <b>apertures,</b> in <b>the</b> material parameters, or in the shape of <b>the</b> <b>apertures.</b> First <b>the</b> perturbation to the far- ﬁeld pattern from a deviation in one aperture is analyzed. Then a statistical analysis is performed for a frequency selective structure where <b>the</b> <b>apertures</b> have a stochastic variation...|$|R
30|$|In antenna-radome systems, radome is an {{indispensible}} {{part and}} we cannot remove it, {{but we could}} change the phase distribution in <b>the</b> original <b>aperture.</b> If phase difference in <b>the</b> original <b>aperture</b> has an inverse trend to that in <b>the</b> transmission <b>aperture.</b> <b>The</b> wave propagates through the radome.

5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate, slender, acute, and of {{moderate}} thickness. The shell suture is deep. The spire is gently convex, laterally compressed, with 3¼ whorls. The spire is long, {{slightly less than}} half the shell length, and <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> is very oblique. The shell color is subtranslucent, calcareous pale yellow to white. The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth wrinkles and lines. The size varies somewhat, but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20.9millimeters (mm) in shell length. Various adult specimens measured during the summer of 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24mm.|$|E
5|$|The spire is a {{protruding}} part of {{the shell}} that includes all of the whorls except the largest and final whorl (known as the body whorl). It is usually more elongated than in other strombid snails, such as the closely related and larger goliath conch, Lobatus goliath that is endemic to Brazil. In L.gigas, the glossy finish or glaze around <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> of the adult shell is primarily in pale shades of pink. It may show a cream, peach or yellow colouration, {{but it can also}} sometimes be tinged with a deep magenta, shading almost to red. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost {{part of the}} shell surface, is thin and a pale brown or tan colour.|$|E

50|$|The spectrographs {{could be}} used with either of two <b>apertures.</b> <b>The</b> larger <b>aperture</b> was a slot with a field of view roughly 10 &times; 20 arcsec; <b>the</b> smaller <b>aperture</b> was a circle about 3 arcsec in diameter. The quality of the {{telescope}} optics was such that point sources appeared about 3 arcsec across, so use of <b>the</b> smaller <b>aperture</b> required very accurate pointing, {{and it did not}} necessarily capture all of the light from the object. <b>The</b> larger <b>aperture</b> was therefore most commonly used, and <b>the</b> smaller <b>aperture</b> only used when the larger field of view would have contained unwanted emission from other objects.|$|R
5|$|Continuous zonal {{patterns}} {{can take}} the form of whitish subsutural bands (A. similis), heavy subperipheral pigmentation (A. perversus var. infraviridis), subsutural color lines (A. columellaris), broad spiral color bands (A. metabletus, A. webbi), or narrow spiral bands (A. laevus). Interrupted zonation can consist of the interruption of bands into spots in (A. maculatus); highly irregular splitting of zones (A. perversus vars. sultanus and interruptus); formation of oblique radial streaks which run parallel to (in A. inversus) or cross (in A. latestrigatus) the incremental growth lines; or almost every conceivable combination and variation of these factors. Often the pattern will change radically from the apex to the body whorl (in A. quadrasi vars.). <b>The</b> <b>aperture,</b> parietal callus, columella, lip, and umbilical region are variously marked with pink, brown, purple, white, or black. Haniel (1921) includes several color plates which clearly demonstrate the extent of color variation within two species of the Syndromus type. A. perversus and A. maculiferus of the subgenus Amphidromus are equally variable, whereas species such as A. inversus and A. similis are almost uniform in coloration.|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} was made, but in 2005 the Environment Agency and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust promoted {{the formation of}} the Itchen Navigation Trust. They were committed to conserving the remains, rather than a full restoration to navigable standards. A request was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund in the United Kingdom for funds to restore the watercourse. Known as The Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail Project, funding was granted and a five-year restoration project began. Work has included widening <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> at College Mead Lock and the construction of a bypass channel around Malm Lock to assist the movement of fish and other aquatic fauna. The navigation has been designated a European Special Area of Conservation as well as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, due to the rich diversity of wildlife found along the system, and its historical importance.|$|E
5|$|Portal 2 is a first-person {{perspective}} puzzle game. The Player {{takes the}} role of Chell in the single-player campaign, as one of two robotsAtlas and P-Bodyin the cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These four characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent checkpoint; in the cooperative game, the robot respawns shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle. The goal of both campaigns is to explore <b>the</b> <b>Aperture</b> Science Laboratory—a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.|$|E

2500|$|A Standard Gerber file {{on its own}} is not {{an image}} {{description}} {{because it does not}} contain all information: the coordinate unit and the definitions of <b>the</b> <b>apertures</b> are not defined in <b>the</b> RS-274-D file.

There are no standards for wheel files. The designer and the plotter operator had to agree on these case-by-case.

5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large {{morphological}} plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E
5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) later {{reports to}} Reyes and Scully that Comer has died. Reyes accuses Toothpick Man {{and others in}} the room of killing Comer. Meanwhile, Scully visits Doggett, who warns her not to trust the cultists. However, Scully goes to meet Josepho near Calgary. Josepho claims to be {{protecting}} William, but demands Mulder's head as collateral in exchange for the baby's release. When Josepho returns to the wreck site, the Overcoat Woman relates that <b>the</b> <b>aperture</b> of the craft began to glow when William started crying. The craft soon rises up out of the ground. Looking on the site from a distance, Scully and Reyes see the craft burst out of an enclosure and into space, lighting the ground beneath it on fire as it goes. The two find an unharmed William among the charred bodies of the cultists.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt too much of <b>the</b> <b>aperture)</b> and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution {{of the system is}} determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another chat room user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding the password for one of <b>the</b> <b>Aperture</b> Science login screens from another gameNeuse felt they could have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out. The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the image with the encrypted message to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling some of the players out by name.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{vibrating}} screen is that particles are introduced to the gaps in the screens repeatedly.
