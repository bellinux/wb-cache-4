5|$|Between 9:00am and 11:00am, about 100,000people {{gathered}} on the Adam Mickiewicz Square {{in front of the}} Imperial Castle in Poznań, surrounded by buildings occupied by the city and Party authorities and police headquarters. The demonstrators demanded lower food prices, wage increases and the revocation of some recent changes in the law that had eroded workers' conditions. They further requested a visit from Polish Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz, as the local government declared that they had no authority <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems.</b> Some police officers also joined the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{competitions}} {{occur in}} both {{indoor and outdoor}} settings. The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets {{of four or five}} boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems, with ties settled {{by the total number of}} attempts taken <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E

5|$|In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci, {{the senior}} manager of IBM's Semantic Analysis and Integration department, Watson was given 500 clues from past Jeopardy! programs. While the best real-life {{competitors}} buzzed {{in half the}} time and responded correctly {{to as many as}} 95% of clues, Watson's first pass could get only about 15% correct. During 2007, the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems.</b> By 2008, the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with Jeopardy! champions. By February 2010, Watson could beat human Jeopardy! contestants on a regular basis.|$|E

5|$|Most major belligerents {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> {{of complexity}} and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine. Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau, {{which had been}} decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Another aspect of military intelligence {{was the use of}} deception, which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard. Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel.|$|E

Lê Đức Thọ wanted to change the party's role in the economy from that of implementer to one of supervisor. The central leadership faced an obstacle; most party cadres had what the party leadership considered an outdated education from 20 to 30 years ago, while the party lacked young cadres. To solve this problem, the central party leadership began talking about the need to introduce personnel planning, a retirement age, rotation of officials and tenure length for cadres and sensitive posts.|$|E

Also in 1828, Andrew Jackson, the old enemy of the Seminoles, was elected President of the United States. In 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act.
