'You don't say so!' exclaimed the statesman. 'I must get you to <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lord Chancellor.' And so saying, he fastened the electrician on Lord Westbury, and effected his escape.

St Cuthbert's coffin (actually {{one of a series}} of several) as reconstructed by Ernst Kitzinger and others remains at the cathedral and is an important rare survival of Anglo-Saxon carving on wood. When the coffin was last inspected on 17 May 1827, a Saxon square cross of gold, embellished with garnets, in the characteristic splayed shape, used later as the heraldic emblem of St Cuthbert in the arms of Durham and Newcastle universities, was found. One legend <b>tells</b> <b>that,</b> prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arrival of Henry's commissioners, the monks covertly removed Cuthbert's body from the cathedral, reburying it in a secret location within the grounds of Crayke Abbey. The body was replaced by that of a recently deceased local brother.
