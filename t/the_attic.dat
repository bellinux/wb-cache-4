5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises coming from <b>the</b> <b>attic.</b> Homer claims {{not to know}} what they are talking about, even though he is seen heading into <b>the</b> <b>attic</b> with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into <b>the</b> <b>attic,</b> and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in <b>the</b> <b>attic,</b> where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to <b>the</b> <b>attic</b> and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in <b>the</b> <b>attic.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting in <b>the</b> <b>attic,</b> where he had several Studer tape recorders. Little was done with them until fellow Beatle Paul McCartney came over and helped re-install them in sequence, so overdubs could be made. Lennon could thus record his own doubletracked song demos. (These demos, and some other, more avant garde sound {{recordings}} also made in <b>the</b> <b>attic,</b> have appeared on various bootlegs). <b>The</b> <b>attic</b> also contained a mellotron, an electronic organ, a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting. Lennon also wrote on an upright piano in the sunroom.|$|E
50|$|This doorway {{leads to}} <b>the</b> <b>attics</b> which were <b>the</b> servants’ {{quarters}} during the Georgian period. However, {{the door is}} now kept locked and <b>the</b> <b>attics</b> undisturbed because {{it is now a}} bat roost. There are 3 species of bats living in <b>the</b> <b>attics</b> at Nantclwyd y Dre - pipistrelle, long eared and lesser horseshoe bats. The lesser horseshoes are the rarest and their colony size is estimated at around 60 individuals.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{entrance to}} the cell in the center along the east wall, the door was replaced with a modern door {{at the time of}} nomination. Inside, a winding staircase leads to <b>the</b> <b>attic.</b> To the north is the kitchen, retaining a hewn summer beam and flared cased posts while sporting modern cabinets and wallpaper. The room to the south also has a visible hewn summer beam and its original casing on the flared posts. <b>The</b> <b>attic</b> is finished with vertically placed beaded boarding, and the roof is framed with hewn rafters.|$|E
5|$|A full-height {{extension}} {{exists to}} the left-hand {{side of the}} building (looking at the north front), and <b>the</b> <b>attic</b> storey was extended by one bay on each side after this full-height extension was built. The building is now flanked by two modern wings.|$|E

5|$|George Sr. is not, in fact, gone. After faking {{his death}} in Mexico by paying off the cops, George Sr. returns to the family model home, where George Michael discovers him and hides him in <b>the</b> <b>attic.</b> To protect his son from legal implications, Michael hides George Sr. in Gob's prop Aztec Tomb, orchestrates a diversion, and tells the family that George Sr. has escaped once more. Throughout {{the rest of the}} season, Michael sneaks George Sr. provisions, and George Sr. keeps tabs on the Bluth family through the {{ventilation}} system. George Sr. also faces onslaught from the outside world; the press begins looking for him in Iraq, fumigators surround the house while he's still in <b>the</b> <b>attic,</b> and Kitty returns to steal a sample of his semen to make her own Bluth baby.|$|E

There are two rooms on the upstairs floor, the southern one having been partitioned, plus an additional two rooms in <b>the</b> <b>attic</b> complete with modern fittings. The first floor and attic was used as a flat, with a kitchen, living room and office on the first floor, and two bedrooms in <b>the</b> <b>attic.</b> The roof is thought to be from around 1800 but has subsequently been strengthened.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the heat transfer through <b>the</b> <b>attics</b> of buildings under realistic (periodic) thermal forcing. The {{objective of this}} study is to investigate numerically the effect of the aspect ratio (height to base ratio) on the heat transfer through <b>the</b> <b>attics.</b> A fixed Grashof number 1. 33 x 10 ^ 6 is considered for three different aspect ratios 0. 2, 0. 5 and 1. 0. The Prandtl number is also fixed at 0. 71 for air. The details of the numerical model as well as the flow structures and heat transfer data are presented...|$|R
5|$|The low granite block {{foundation}} {{of the house is}} more exposed {{on the west side of}} the house, allowing for a full-height door exiting from the cellar. The stone stack supports four fireplaces that each support the hall, hall chamber, parlor and the cellar. Also there is a smoke chamber in the stack in <b>the</b> <b>attic.</b> The original kitchen, now in the hall, features a large fireplace with bake oven in the rear wall of the firebox. <b>The</b> <b>attic</b> once housed a large loom that was later moved down to the west side of the cellar. Amos G. Avery, who owned and restored the house prior to its 1992 National Register of Historic Places listing, removed a 1871 Victorian balustrade on the front staircase installed by the second Theophilus Avery.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the thesis}} is a {{comprehensive}} view {{on the issue of}} construction of <b>the</b> <b>attics</b> flats, especially in view of civil law relations.

5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to {{the very nature of}} Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried men and women to intermingle.
