[...] She {{goes on to say}} that [...] "'Precious' proves you don't always have to choose between artistic and commercial success; the film's first opening weekend was record-breaking. It's a sign how much we needed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> story. And, perhaps, how many stories there are left to tell." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{former vice}} {{president}} opens the film by greeting an audience with his well-known line about his campaign in 2000: [...] "I am Al Gore; I {{used to be the}} next President of the United States." [...] He is shown using his laptop to edit his presentation, and pondering the difficulty he has had in awakening public concern: [...] "I've been trying <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> story {{for a long time and}} I feel as if I've failed to get the message across." ...|$|E
500|$|In Greek mythology, Troilus {{is a young}} Trojan prince, one of {{the sons}} of King Priam (or Apollo) and Hecuba. Prophecies link Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he is ambushed and murdered by Achilles. Sophocles {{was one of the}} writers <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> tale. It was also a popular theme among artists of the time. Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents.

500|$|In {{addition}} to the ride's motion base and 3D projections, special effects including fog machines, fire, wind, heat, mist, strobe lights, and water spray are also employed throughout the attraction. All of these effects, along with the ride system, 3D projections and soundtrack, are controlled by a central industrial control system which knows, to one thirtieth of a second, when they are to execute. Just shy of the ride's debut, the director of show and ride engineering at Islands of Adventure, Steve Blum, described The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man as the [...] "most technically complex {{of all of the}} attractions" [...] at the park. Vice president of design and creative development Mark Woodbury stated that they [...] "would not have been able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> particular story if it weren't for the technical tools".|$|E

He further elaborated that the goal now is to [...] "have the energy of the show get bigger as [...] goes along... We're learning how <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> version of a detective story. It's not really a police procedural. There are elements of that. But it's an incredible mish-mash of genres. I think we're getting better at finding our way through these stories." ...|$|E
500|$|The notes {{range from}} nearly {{insignificant}} details to major discrepancies and deliberate distortions. [...] They have a self-deprecatory tone that {{is common in}} North American comics, tracing its roots to the awkwardly self-aware underground comix of the 1960s and 1970s. [...] They also reveal Brown's process in shaping the story from conflicting sources. [...] He acknowledges {{some of the more}} capricious details. [...] He explains he was not committed to the conspiracy theory he presented, but included it in order to present Macdonald in a certain light: [...] "illains are fun in a story", he said, and he was [...] "trying <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> tale in an engaging manner". [...] He also included a [...] "Major-General Thomas Bland Strange" [...] in an 1885 meeting at which the general was not actually present. [...] Brown explains that he included Strange because he was amused by the Major-General's name.|$|E

[...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
500|$|A Channel Seven {{spokeswoman}} {{revealed that}} the network received fewer than 30 telephone calls nationally after screening the [...] "lesbian kiss" [...] episode of the show. The calls were evenly split between those supporting the broadcast of the kiss, and those raising concerns. The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, [...] "The idea of this show {{has always been that}} we hold a mirror to society – and when society changes, we change with it. What's ahead in Home and Away is right not only for the series, but also for the times we are living in". Anderson said that she felt it was the right time <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> story and added, [...] "It's really important for us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life". She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship.|$|E
500|$|The {{on-screen}} {{relationship between}} Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written {{out of the}} soap due to Bardon's health problems. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and {{was placed in the}} care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the Daily Mirror: [...] "Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] The feeling is that {{this is the end of}} Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't ever be a regular in Albert Square again." [...] It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it. Jim left the show on 26 May 2011. Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim, saying, [...] "I think she'll be very lonely and feel she doesn't have much purpose in life. It was really important <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> story because there are so many people in a similar situation to Dot. It was moving to act out, too—not just because of Dot and Jim's relationship, but because I'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Dan Adams scored it 7 out of 10, {{comparing}} it unfavourably to [...] His biggest criticism concerned {{the lack of}} differentiation from Settlers III, writing [...] "aside from some improved graphics and small additions, it's hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> is really a new game." [...] He was also critical of the AI, pathfinding, and repetitive missions, and he felt the designers had failed to steer the gameplay away from an over-reliance on combat.

2500|$|In {{response}} to viewer {{concern about the}} direction the writers seemed to be taking Todd and Marty's bond, Carlivati assured Soap Opera Digest {{that he would have}} never written this under different circumstances. [...] "We're not talking about Marty with all her memories. She would never get close to Todd in any way," [...] he said. [...] "This is about a Marty who doesn't remember anything about him, and he starts to feel close to this new person and starts to feel this gratitude for the fact that she doesn't remember this horrible thing he did." [...] Carlivati added, [...] "It is like this new chapter and this new arc. I don't think I would ever attempt <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> relationship the way we're telling it if she knew who she was." [...] He said, [...] "I think that's a much different scenario.

2500|$|Among {{the things}} that endeared him to his public was his comic use of {{language}} in his films; his characters (all of which were really variations of the main [...] "Cantinflas" [...] persona but cast in different social roles and circumstances) would strike up a normal conversation and then complicate it {{to the point where}} no one understood what they were talking about. The Cantinflas character was particularly adept at obfuscating the conversation when he owed somebody money, was courting an attractive young woman, or was trying to talk his way out of trouble with authorities, whom he managed to humiliate without their even being able <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>This</b> manner of talking became known as Cantinflear, and it became common parlance for Spanish speakers to say [...] "¡estás cantinfleando!" [...] (loosely translated as you're pulling a [...] "Cantinflas!" [...] or you're [...] "Cantinflassing!") whenever someone became hard to understand in conversation. The Real Academia Española officially included the verb, cantinflear, cantinflas and cantinflada in its dictionary in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|During the secession crisis {{following}} Lincoln's election, Federal {{troops were}} {{under the command of}} Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Albert Sidney Johnston, in Benicia, headquarters of the Department of the Pacific. General Johnston strongly believed in the Southern right to secede but regretted that it was occurring. A group of Southern sympathizers in the state made plans to secede with Oregon to form a [...] "Pacific Republic". The success of their plans rested on the cooperation of General Johnston. Johnston met with some of these Southern men, but before they could propose anything to him he told them that he had heard rumors of an attempt to seize the San Francisco forts and arsenal at Benicia, that he had prepared for that and would defend the facilities under his command with all his resources and to the last drop of his blood. He told them <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> to their Southern friends. Deprived of his aid the plans for California and Oregon to secede from the United States never came to fruition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{style of}} film is {{presented}} in a nonlinear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film {{was based on a}} real romance. Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the London School of Economics in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell [...] "crazily, madly, hopelessly in love" [...] with the girl who [...] "returned his kisses but not his ardor." [...] The ending of the relationship was [...] "painfully and unforgettably awful," [...] which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, [...] "we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt that the only way <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy".|$|E

2500|$|Eleanor Gower of the Daily Mail {{thought the}} slow moving number shows Rihanna at her most vulnerable. A {{reviewer}} of The Huffington Post commented, [...] "The heartfelt ballad, from her latest album Unapologetic, {{is full of}} emotion - and the video matches that, as a stripped-down Rihanna soaks in a tub." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times commented on the video saying, [...] "we kind of want to curl up in a hot shower {{and have a good}} cry ourselves." [...] They continued saying, [...] "It's kind of an echo of her famous [...] "We Found Love" [...] video, with that clip's quick-cut, drugged-up frenzy of bad romance replaced with solitary, locked-off shots that feel more intimate than exploitative. She looks amazing, but the focus isn't so much her body as the look of constant devastation on her face." [...] Brown summarised the clip as being [...] "appropriately minimalist" [...] and concluded calling it [...] "a beautiful video that broaden's Rihanna's emotional-musical palette." [...] Bené Viera of VH1 commented on the video saying, [...] "Usually the tough girl posturing is a cover up for a very sensitive soul. Rihanna cut the 'I don't give an eff' attitude for four minutes of makeup free, teary-eyed, glistening wet, raw emotion in the video for 'Stay.'" [...] Sarah Flanigan of Yahoo! thought the video shows [...] "a softer side of [...] personality audiences rarely get to see." [...] She also stated, [...] "There are no gimmicks, no flashy clothes, just a very raw and emotional performance allowing her <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> love story in her own words." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV labelled the video as [...] "perfectly heartbreaking/emotionally vulnerable" [...] and thought the [...] "baptismal effect" [...] of the video [...] "feels like a seamless transition from Rihanna's 'Diamonds' video." [...] Tamar Anitai also of MTV compared the video to Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] (2004), writing that both videos [...] "are equal parts stunning and sobering, haunting and harrowing, and both feature impossibly famous singers reflecting upon damaged relationships while inviting us into their well-designed bathrooms as they vulnerably perform their ablutions." [...] Rihanna's [...] "Stay" [...] video was also compared to and said to be inspired by Janet Jackson's [...] "Every Time" [...] video, as well as Britney Spears' [...] "Everytime" [...] video, with one critic noting [...] "Rihanna isn't the first pop star to brood in a bathtub. Janet Jackson and Britney Spears also bared their emotion immersed in water. Janet bared all in a blue lagoon for her 'Every Time' video. A little less glam, Britney's tub scene in her 'Everytime' video proved dark foreshadowing into her troubled world." ...|$|E
