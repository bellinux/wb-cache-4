5|$|After the State of Israel was established, Silverman {{recognized}} the diverse needs {{to build the}} nation and she and Archibald channeled funds into planting orchards, building the Sharon Hotel, and supplementing the Synagogue Centre Building Fund. The Sharon Hotel, built in Herzliya, on the Sharon Plain, {{was part of an}} effort to build infrastructure and develop tourism sites to stimulate further growth. Silverman founded and served the board of the company which created the hotel. In the Jezreel Valley, she chaired a water development company and established a mixed-fruit orchard of around 70 acres of trees. She also was involved in several projects in Rhode Island. In 1955 she founded and served as president of the Friends of Butler Hospital in an attempt to reopen the health center, which had been shut down. They were successful in proving its benefit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> the hospital reopened. In 1957, Silverman served as chair of the fundraising for the Rhode Island Association of Mental Health. By the early-1960s, 33 synagogues throughout Israel had been built through the synagogue fund. During the two years she lived in Israel, she helped erect around 80 additional synagogues and by the time of Silverman's death, the number was over 100 synagogues in Israel and elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|The aim of <b>the</b> {{study was}} <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> impact of {{traditional}} leaders and ward councillors‟ roles on service delivery in Mnquma Local Municipality. Not much {{research has been}} conducted in this field. <b>The</b> researcher wanted <b>to</b> ascertain <b>the</b> extent of conflict between traditional leaders and ward councillors in providing services <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> provide mechanisms <b>to</b> harness these. In this study relevant literature and legislative frameworks were reviewed. From the literature review, it was evident that service delivery is essential <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>communities,</b> <b>and</b> as such, municipalities have a critical role <b>to</b> play. <b>The</b> data collection instruments used, were questionnaires and interviews. In order <b>to</b> achieve <b>the</b> objectives, questionnaires were distributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> participants and interviews were conducted. After analysing the data, the researcher formulated conclusions and from those conclusions, some recommendations were made...|$|R

5|$|As {{de facto}} racial {{segregation}} increased, so did tensions between {{residents of the}} northeast {{and members of the}} predominantly white male Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a teenager with a gun. After an initial confrontation near Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Phillip Pannell, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and {{had been shot in the}} back. Protest marches, some violent, ensued; most African Americans believed that Pannell had been killed in cold blood, while other residents insisted that Spath had been justified in his actions. Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell was shot in the back, and that he was carrying a gun. A police officer testified to finding a modified starter's pistol with eight cartridges in Pannell's jacket pocket. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an international news event that brought Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> inspired the 1995 book Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town, by Mike Kelly.|$|E
