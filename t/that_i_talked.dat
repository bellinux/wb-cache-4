6000|$|By all the {{standards}} of the former time it would have been remarkable <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> quite easily and freely with so great a man. [...] "Yes," [...] I said; [...] "that's it. One feels one has awakened--from something more than that green gas. As though the other things also--weren't quite real." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't {{find out}} {{anything}} about them twins," [...] he said, getting down to what was in their minds without delay. [...] "The man was seen around Fort Bedford for two days, but he didn't tell his business, and nobody <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to had seen the babies nor had they seen him a-talkin' to any wimmen folks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's good to {{be quiet}} for a change," [...] Gore said. [...] "When I'm with you <b>I</b> feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needn't <b>talk</b> unless <b>I</b> want to. <b>That's</b> a relief, because it's when <b>I</b> feel least <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> the most. You're tranquilizing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not. Perhaps <b>I</b> am <b>talking</b> nonsense. But it is {{only with}} you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> nonsense. <b>I</b> never do so with my cousin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will be mute," [...] said Nello, laying {{his finger}} on his lips, with a {{responding}} shrug. [...] "But it is only under our four eyes <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> any folly about her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so glad, {{for now it}} will {{be easier}} for me to tell you. And since that I have seen Mr. Furnival, and he says the same. I tell you because you are so good and so loving to me. I will keep nothing from you; but you must not tell Sir Peregrine <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to Mr. Furnival about this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye're not a-going to sell yereself {{for seven}} year, my lad?" [...] said he. [...] "I was near that myself when I was young, and I thank God' {{to this day}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> first to an honest man, even as you are doing. They'll give ye a pretty tale,--the factors,--of a land of milk and honey, when it's naught but stripes and curses yell get." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Mademoiselle, {{you have}} read me strangely {{if you think}} <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to her with my lips, yes--but it was of you I was {{thinking}}. I was thinking that you were born to {{play a part in}} many dramas, that you have the fatal beauty which is rare in all ages." [...] The Vicomte bent towards her, and his voice became caressing. [...] "You cannot realize how beautiful you are," [...] he sighed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> know. <b>That</b> kind of God! Well, well! <b>I</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> {{like a crazy}} person! Do {{you suppose}} it was providential, my being {{with you in the}} office that morning when Bartley came in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was silent}} a little; then I concurred. [...] "It's doubtless your best line; and I really quite feel, at all events, {{that when you}} {{mentioned}} a while since <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> too much you only meant too much to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yokohama," [...] St. Vincent cut in shortly; [...] "eleven years ago, in cherry-blossom time. But Baron Courbertin does me an injustice, which stings, unhappily, {{because it}} is not true. I am afraid, when <b>I</b> get started, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> too much about myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{know not}} what we conversed about during the {{remainder}} of that hour. Whether I talked sense or nonsense I cannot tell. The only thing I am quite sure of is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> incessantly, enthusiastically, to Mrs McTougall, but kept my eyes fixed on Lilly Blythe all the time; and I know that Lilly blushed a good deal, and bent her pretty head frequently over her [...] "darling Pompey," [...] and fondled him to his heart's content.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} help feeling <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> better to Walkirk than I had ever done to any one else; and I did not {{hesitate}} to admit to myself that this gratifying result was due in great part to his ability as a listener. I do not say that he drew me out, but he gave me opportunities to show myself in the broadest and best lights. This truly might be said to be good listening; it produced good speech.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah?" [...] said he, mystified. Then: [...] "The {{news will}} be none the less welcome from your lips, ma'am," [...] said he. [...] "Is {{it that you}} are {{interested}} in the ravings of delirium, and welcomed the opportunity of observing them at first hand? I hope I raved engagingly, if so be that I did rave. Would it, perchance, be of a lady <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> in my fevered wanderings?--of a lady pale as a lenten rose, with soft brown eyes, and lips that--" ...|$|E
50|$|Among {{his poems}} are Don't Tell Me <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> Too Much and Flowers are a Silly Bunch, which starts by listing aspects of nature (such as trees are bossy, and lakes are shy), but {{turns out to}} be a poem about liking the city.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Wish <b>I</b> Could <b>Talk</b> to You" [...] {{contains}} {{a sample of}} [...] "Wish <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Could <b>Talk</b> to You" [...] by The Sylvers ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Edgar; [...] "far from it!" [...] He {{indicated}} the miry wagons and the torn-up trails. [...] "You wouldn't expect {{a man to}} do this kind of thing, if it wasn't needful. The fact is, I don't always express myself very happily; and George has told me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} that he thought your mother ridiculous, Florida?" [...] asked Mrs. Vervain gravely. [...] "You must have {{misunderstood}} his looks; indeed you must. I can't imagine why he should. I remember <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> particularly well during our whole visit; my mind was active, for I felt unusually strong, and I was interested in everything. It's nothing but a fancy of yours; or your prejudice, Florida. But it's odd, now I've sat down for a moment, how worn out I feel. And thirsty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could tell}} you a {{different}} story, Olaf; {{but it was not}} of this kind of courage <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked.</b> It was of that which made you offer to eat the poisoned fig in place of Constantine. Why did you do so? It is true that, as things have happened, he'll remember it in your favour, for I'll say this of him, he never forgets one who has saved him from harm, any more than he forgets one who has harmed him. But if you had eaten you would have died, and then how could he have rewarded you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{am afraid}} I am {{that kind of}} a man," [...] said I. [...] "But do not think of me too harshly for <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> just now of {{something}} to remember by. I have many of them myself, of these beautiful reminders, of these keepsakes, that I cannot be parted from until I lose memory and life. Many of them are great things, many of them are high virtues--charity, mercy, faith. But some of them are trivial enough. Miss Flora, do you remember the day that I first saw you, the day of the strong east wind? Miss Flora, shall I tell you what you wore?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must think}} it rather strange <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>talk</b> {{so much about}} Dr. Bretton, ask so many questions, take such an interest, but--".|$|R
5000|$|... "Some {{would say}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could <b>talk</b> under wet cement. I know {{at least one}} {{property}} developer {{who would like to}} give me the opportunity." ...|$|R
6000|$|Renouard {{could hardly}} find words for a protest: “I assure you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never <b>talk</b> with Miss Moorsom—on—on—that. And if you, her father [...] . ” ...|$|R
60|$|That night I {{found a new}} friend, {{although}} at the time I thought Farrar's visit to me the accomplishment of a perfunctory courtesy {{to a man who}} had refused to take a case against him. It was very characteristic of Farrar not to mention this until he rose to go. About half-past eight he sauntered in upon me, placing his hat precisely on the rack, and we talked until ten, which is to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> and he commented. His observations were apt, if a trifle caustic, and it is needless to add that I found them entertaining. As he was leaving he held out his hand.|$|E
60|$|From then on I {{began to}} take some notice of my fellow-travelers. The {{conductor}} {{proved to be an}} agreeable old fellow; and the train-boy, though I mistrusted his advances because he tried to sell me everything from chewing-gum to mining stock, turned out to be pretty good company. The Negro porter had such a jolly voice and laugh <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to him whenever I got the chance. Then occasional passengers occupied the seat opposite me from town to town. They were much alike, all sunburned and loud-voiced, and it looked as though they had all bought their high boots and wide hats at the same shop.|$|E
60|$|A {{thousand}} {{thanks for}} your note, which has reached me here this afternoon. At breakfast this morning Dolby showed me the local paper with a paragraph in it recording poor dear Tennent's[99] death. You may imagine how shocked I was. Immediately before I left town this last time, I had an unusually affectionate letter from him, enclosing one from Forster, and proposing the friendly dinner since appointed for the 25th. I replied {{to him in the}} same spirit, and felt touched at the time by the gentle earnestness of his tone. It is remarkable <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> of him a great deal yesterday to Dolby (who knew nothing of him), and that I reverted to him again at night before going to bed--with no reason that I know of. Dolby was strangely impressed by this, when he showed me the newspaper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, bother! {{you know}} very well <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>talk</b> in it yet, and you surely do not expect <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am going to ride along without opening my lips." ...|$|R
50|$|And the Lord said unto Moses, thus {{thou shalt}} say unto the {{children}} of Israel, Ye have seen <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>talked</b> with you from heaven.|$|R
6000|$|... "What dream? Why, {{the dream}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am in Arthur's court--a person who never existed; and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am <b>talking</b> to you, who {{are nothing but}} a work of the imagination." ...|$|R
60|$|Yet {{all these}} things, {{had no effect}} upon me, {{or at least not}} enough to resist the strong {{inclination}} I had to go abroad again, which hung about me like a chronical distemper; particularly the desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, and the colony I left there, ran in my head continually. I dreamed of it all night, and my imagination ran upon it all day; it was uppermost in all my thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon it, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> of it in my sleep; in short, nothing could remove it out of my mind; it even broke so violently into all my discourses, that it made my conversation tiresome; for I could talk of nothing else, all my discourse ran into it, even to impertinence, and I saw it myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should never}} have got her to agree to it, uncle. I {{wanted to go to}} sea, but after father's death she would not hear of it. She said I was her only boy and that she could not spare me, and I had to promise to give up the thought. She was still more against your plan, but when I wrote to you I thought that {{possibly}} in time she might agree to it. But it was not long afterwards that her health began to fail, and I saw then that I must give up all thought of leaving her, and must, when I left school, take anything that offered; and it was only after her death <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> it over with the girls, and they agreed that to come here was the best thing for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in any way, count; and I thank you, {{with all}} my heart, for your kindness. My feeling for your {{daughter}} has grown up gradually, {{and it was not}} until I was last here that I recognized how much I cared for her. I then, when I went away, resolved {{it would be better for}} me not to return; at any rate, not to stay here again, until I heard that she was married. It is true <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> of paying you a visit, even were Dresden captured; but I knew that when the time came I should be able to find excuses for not doing so. During the time that I was laid up with fever, she was ever in my mind; but the necessity for my remaining away from here only impressed itself, more and more strongly, upon me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mother, {{perfectly}} satisfied, {{thanks to}} you all, and so happy <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>talk</b> about it," [...] with a look that was far better than words.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't say why," [...] he said quickly, [...] "but {{it seems}} to me as if this had {{happened}} before. <b>I</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am <b>talking</b> nonsense--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think it's {{the heat}} {{makes me so}} drowsy," [...] I said, hoping, but not feeling quite sure, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was <b>talking</b> sense. [...] "Am I awake now?" ...|$|R
