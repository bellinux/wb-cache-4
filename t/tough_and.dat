In spite of his lack of game time, Jesé still managed to contribute 6 goals and 8 assists for the season and was a regularly used as back-up in the team's triumphant 2015–16 UEFA Champions League campaign.|$|E

5|$|The body {{is divided}} into a thorax of three {{segments}} and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The wings {{are attached to the}} second and third thoracic segments. The tegmina, or first pair of wings, are <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} breed {{clubs in the}} UK {{supporting}} the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations on a yearly basis. The breed is friendly but <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> is suitable for interaction with older children. There are no breed specific health concerns, {{but they can be}} affected by spinal problems due to their elongated body and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.|$|E

5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but <b>tough,</b> <b>and</b> could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E
5|$|John Henry Johnson (November 24, 1929 – June 3, 2011) was a {{gridiron}} football {{running back}} {{known for his}} excellence at the fullback position as both a runner and a blocker. His first professional stint was in Canada in the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) for one season with the Calgary Stampeders. He then played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, Detroit Lions, and Pittsburgh Steelers before spending his final season in the American Football League (AFL) with the Houston Oilers. Commonly referred to as simply John Henry, an allusion to the folk hero of the same name, Johnson was a <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> tenacious player who performed {{at a high level}} well into the tail end of his career.|$|E

5|$|Lithium, sodium, and {{potassium}} have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts {{but do not}} have many applications yet. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium stearate is a thickener {{and can be used}} to make lubricating greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines. Lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> light alloys.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus's {{success in}} high school led to a {{scholarship}} to the University of Notre Dame, where he played from 1940 to 1942. He was known in college as a <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> durable tackle. In a 1941 game against Georgia Tech, Rymkus was elbowed in his upper lip. He left the game to get 14 stitches and returned {{to play in the}} 20–0 Notre Dame victory. Notre Dame went undefeated that season, coach Frank Leahy's first year at the school. During his junior year in 1942, Rymkus earned All-America honors, and in his final season at Notre Dame he was named the team's Most Valuable Player.|$|E

5|$|Some scutes {{contain a}} single pore {{known as an}} {{integumentary}} sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while alligators and caimans only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, {{but it has been}} suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs. Another possibility is that they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from adhering to the skin. There are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh is}} reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> corky as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit body tissue {{is made of}} {{generative}} hyphae that do not expand. This slows {{the growth of the}} fruit body, often enabling it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E
5|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers: the epicuticle, {{which is}} a thin and waxy water {{resistant}} outer layer and contains no chitin, and a lower layer called the procuticle. The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers: an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle. The <b>tough</b> <b>and</b> flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., caterpillars), especially during their larval stages.|$|E
