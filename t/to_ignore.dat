5|$|A level-number of 66 is used {{to declare}} a re-grouping of {{previously}} defined items, irrespective of how those items are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated , is rarely used and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the hierarchical and logical structure data meant its use was not recommended and many installations forbade its use.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} went by with further childlessness, Ernest became more distant to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine continued to be devoted, choosing <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> those relationships she was aware of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest in his wife.|$|E
5|$|Cobb has {{consistently}} opposed the splitting {{of education and}} knowledge into discrete and insulated disciplines and departments. He believes that the current university model encourages excessive abstraction because each specialized area of study defines its own frame of reference and then tends <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the others, discouraging interdisciplinary dialogue and inhibiting a broad understanding of the world.|$|E

5|$|Impossible <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> was Day's {{disparity}} to his rival, Paige. Historians {{have noted}} that Paige had a boisterous approach compared to Day's reserved demeanor; Paige was tall and Day was short and slender; and Paige worked hard to promote his name while Day shied away from attention. The pitchers' infrequent head-to-head matchups led to remarkable pitching duels, three of which Day won.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943, the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, {{was invited}} by Berger {{to assist in}} organising and {{recruiting}} Muslims into the Waffen-SS and other units. He was escorted by von Krempler, who spoke Turkish. The Mufti successfully convinced the Muslims <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the declarations of the Sarajevo, Mostar and Banja Luka Ulama (Islamic clerics), who in 1941 forbade them from collaborating with the Ustaše.|$|E
5|$|In {{the matter}} of the annulment, no {{progress}} seemed possible. The Pope seemed more afraid of Emperor Charles V than of Henry. Anne and Cromwell and their allies wished simply <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the Pope, but in October 1530 a meeting of clergy and lawyers advised that Parliament could not empower the archbishop to act against the Pope's prohibition. Henry thus resolved to bully the priests.|$|E

5|$|King Philip V and Frederick IV of Denmark paid Violante Beatrice visits in 1703 and 1709, respectively.

5|$|An allocator, A, for {{objects of}} type T {{must have a}} member {{function}} with the signature A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n objects of type T; only the memory is allocated, and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional pointer argument (that points to an object already allocated by A) {{can be used as}} a hint to the implementation about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality. However, the implementation is free <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the argument.|$|E

5|$|As growth {{continued}} The Churchill Machine Tool Co's {{share capital}} was increased to £70,000, and in 1911 the four directors, {{who had not}} drawn a salary since its inception, were voted £25 each as remuneration. By 1913 the businesses had attained such a position with in-house manufacturing of grinding machinery that Charles Churchill was able <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> a threat to withdraw from him, {{on the grounds of}} conflict of interest, the agency agreement with US company Brown & Sharpe which had been set up in 1872 before his bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|But within minutes, the Do 17 {{formation}} {{had been}} reduced to 15 aircraft and most of them were damaged. Six had been shot down and four were attempting to make a run for home. The remainder dropped their bombs and were met by a covering force of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat. LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone. They saw one rail station and released their bombs and returned home. They saw only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> their raid.|$|E
5|$|Enron {{was formed}} in 1985 by Kenneth Lay after merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, he {{developed}} a staff of executives that – {{by the use of}} accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting – were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Arthur Andersen <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the issues.|$|E

As the background to Bond's childhood, Higson used Bond's obituary in You Only Live Twice {{as well as his}} own and Fleming's childhoods. In forming the early Bond character, Higson created the origins of some of Bond's character traits, including his love of cars and fine wine.|$|E
5|$|In June 1941, Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union. Unlike {{many of the}} border troops who were caught off guard by the offensive, Bagramyan and his commander, General Mikhail Kirponos, {{believed}} an invasion by Germany was inevitable. However, Kirponos chose <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> Bagramyan's viewpoint that the German offensive would employ the lightning speed Blitzkrieg tactics like those seen in the campaigns in Poland in 1939 and Western Europe in 1940. Since the winter of 1939–40, Bagramyan had been busy devising a battle plan that would counter threats from the western Ukraine, which was approved after numerous revisions on 10 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social experimentation, {{particularly}} with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> it. Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts {{were a part of}} lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E

50|$|The film {{introduced}} {{significant changes}} for the character of Paul Kersey. One involved his modus operandi as a vigilante. In the original film, Kersey would shoot and kill every criminal in his vicinity. In the sequel, he is after five specific criminals {{who are responsible for}} the death of his daughter. His single-minded pursuit extends <b>to</b> <b>ignoring</b> other potential targets. He is seen <b>to</b> mostly <b>ignore</b> thieves, drug dealers, and one violent pimp. Another change involves his abilities. In the first film, his activities as a vigilante rely only on his use of weapons. In the sequel he is able to beat up men considerably younger than himself.|$|R

5|$|Life in {{proximity}} to humans and other domestic animals {{has led to}} a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans <b>to</b> <b>ignore.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phát and Thảo were {{stripped}} of their ranks, but nothing was initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup. The new junta decided <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> Khiêm’s actions and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken. Phát and Thảo stayed in hiding in Catholic villages. They offered to surrender and support the government if they and their officers were granted amnesty.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Suzuki felt {{compelled}} to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the Allies' demands and fight on. The Japanese government did not react. Emperor Hirohito, the government, and the war council considered four conditions for surrender: {{the preservation of the}} kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, or Formosa, and delegation of the punishment of war criminals to the Japanese government.|$|E
