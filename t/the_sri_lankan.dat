5|$|Although Sri Lankan Tamils are {{culturally}} and linguistically distinct, genetic {{studies indicate that}} they {{are closely related to}} Sinhalese ethnic group in the island. <b>The</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils are mostly Hindus with a significant Christian population. Sri Lankan Tamil literature on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Civil War in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict. Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are noted for their archaism and retention of words not in everyday use in the Tamil Nadu state in India.|$|E

5|$|The {{infrastructure}} of the town was heavily damaged when the SLA took control of it. Most of the houses were badly damaged and a large water tank had been destroyed, which the SLA accused had been done by the LTTE using explosives.

5|$|The {{two groups}} of Tamils located in Sri Lanka are <b>the</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils and the Indian Tamils. There also exists a {{significant}} population in Sri Lanka who are native speakers of Tamil language and are of Islamic faith. Though several evidence point them towards being ethnic Tamils, they are however controversially listed as a separate ethnic group by <b>the</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> government. Sri Lankan Tamils (also called Ceylon Tamils) are descendants of the Tamils of the old Jaffna Kingdom and east coast chieftaincies called Vannimais. The Indian Tamils (or Hill Country Tamils) are descendants of bonded labourers sent from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in the 19th century to work on tea plantations.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} {{scholarly}} consensus over {{the presence of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamil people in Sri Lanka, also known as Eelam in Sangam literature.

Theories about Tamil people's presence in Sri Lanka feed into the cycle of ethnic conflict. Another theory states that <b>the</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Tamils are descendant of the Nagas, who started to assimilate to Tamil culture and language around 3rd BCE.|$|E

5|$|The news of {{the fall}} of Kilinochchi to <b>the</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Military {{resulted}} in celebration, including gathering on the streets and lighting firecrackers, in places like Nuwara Eliya, Anuradhapura, Colombo, Ampara and Kalutara. The Government of Sri Lanka claimed that the population in Jaffna celebrated the capture by raising the national flag with anti-LTTE slogans and demonstrations. However Tamilnet, the pro-rebel website, denied these claims and claimed that the public were forced {{to take part in the}} celebrations. It claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Army confiscated the National identity cards of many residents in order to force them to take part.

It was part of a global outcry by the Tamil diaspora to end <b>the</b> <b>Sri</b> <b>Lankan</b> Civil War, investigate acts of war crimes by the Government of Sri Lanka, and restore civil rights for Tamils in Sri Lanka. The aim was also to create awareness and appeal to leaders, notably the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, the President of the United States, Barack Obama and the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Canada, Bandula Jayasekara, to take action in ending the conflict. Several Tamil Canadian citizens and business-owners from different parts of Canada and the United States took part in major protests set up in Toronto and Ottawa, while smaller scale demonstrations took place in Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.|$|E
