5|$|M-156 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. The highway is entirely within Lenawee County and begins in Morenci at the Ohio state line with State Route108 (SR108) and runs north to M-34 at Clayton. The highway runs through farm land along Lime Creek outside of the <b>two</b> <b>communities,</b> providing access to the Lake Hudson State Recreation Area. The trunkline {{dates back to the}} early 1930s, and has been unchanged since a realignment in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway is}} legislated {{to begin in}} Ritzville at a {{junction}} with concurrent highways I-90 and US395 and travel east through a mixture of farm and desert landscapes, crossing over the Adams–Whitman county line in the process. A junction with SR23 near Ewan {{is to be the}} eastern terminus of the highway. Currently travelers wishing to travel between the <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> take the freeway to Sprague, then head southeast along SR23.|$|E
5|$|At this {{interchange}} with I-96, US31 has its southernmost business loop as U.S. Route 31 Business runs westerly and northward into downtown Muskegon. The main freeway {{continues through}} the suburban {{eastern edge of}} the city through several interchanges, including one with M-46 (Apple Avenue). Just south of the Muskegon River, the business loop merges back into the main freeway. US31 crosses the river and turns northwesterly through forests. The freeway passes to the east of Michigan's Adventure, an amusement park, and crosses the White River near the communities of Whitehall and Montague; a business loop curves off to the west to connect the <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> with the freeway. In this area, US31 runs through the southern portion of the Manistee National Forest as well.|$|E

5|$|M-222 is {{the current}} {{designation}} of a state trunkline highway in Allegan County of the US state of Michigan. It runs between the city of Allegan, where it connects with M-40/M-89, and the US Highway131 (US131) freeway near Martin. The highway runs along a series of streets in Allegan and through rural farm fields and woods between the <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> along 116th Avenue. The roadway was a state highway back in 1919 when the system was initially signed. It was assigned as part of M-89 and M-40 before being given its own number, M-118. That designation {{was applied to the}} highway until 1988 when that was retired in favor of the current M-222.|$|E

Community activities {{take place at the}} Birchington Village Centre, including adult education classes, drama productions by the Birchington Guild of Players and concerts by the Birchington Silver Band. In 1989, Birchington-on-Sea was twinned with the town of La Chapelle d'Armentieres, near Lille in northern France; Birchington Twinning Association arranges events between the <b>two</b> <b>communities,</b> such as school trips, concerts and war remembrance services. Since 1932, Birchington has held a street carnival each summer.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} {{within the}} park vary with elevation. The TMD has two distinct communities, desert scrub—such as fourwing saltbush and brittlebrush—at the lowest elevations and desert grassland a little higher. The RMD includes these <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> as well as four more at higher elevations, oak woodland, pine–oak woodland, pine forest and, high in the Rincons, mixed conifer forest—Douglas-fir, Ponderosa pine, white fir, Gambel oak, and many other trees, shrubs, and understory plants. During annual inventories in 2011 and 2013, hundreds of scientists and thousands of volunteers identified 389 species of vascular plants, 25 of non-vascular plants, and 197 species of fungi in Saguaro National Park.|$|E

5|$|The Church of Ireland {{community}} had worshipped {{at the old}} church, which was in a ruinous state by 1829 when the new St. Paul's Church was built {{at the top of}} the hill, overlooking the town. The new Catholic church of St. Rynagh's had been constructed some three years earlier and on land given by the Armstrongs, the most influential and wealthiest Protestant family in the area, who consistently and energetically advocated Catholic Emancipation and repeal of the Penal Laws. This situation demonstrated the friendly relations that existed between the <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> in Banagher during those difficult times for Catholics in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} the French {{presented}} the Radyr community with a wine press, now sited in the gardens of the Old Church Rooms.

In 2008, 45 visitors from St Philbert visited Radyr, and a visit by villagers to St Philbert also took place. The twinning committee also arranges Boules tournaments and social events throughout the summer.|$|E
5|$|After Sri Lanka {{achieved}} {{independence in}} 1948, the ACTC decided {{to merge with}} the ruling United National Party (UNP). This move was not supported by half of the ACTC members and resulted in a splitone half of the party decided to merge with the UNP {{and the other half}} decided to leave the party altogether, forming a new Tamil party in 1949, the Federal party. Policies adopted by successive Sinhalese governments, and the 1956 success of the Sinhala Nationalist government under Solomon Bandaranaike, made the Federal Party the main voice of Tamil politics. Increased racial and political tension between the <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> led to the merger of all Tamil political parties into the Tamil United Liberation Front. This was followed by the emergence of a militant, armed form of Tamil nationalism.|$|E

5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the village}} of Carabane's {{official}} population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most {{of the population is}} Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée {{at the time of the}} first colonization. <b>Two</b> <b>communities</b> from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.|$|E
5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} {{takes on a}} more agricultural character along US2. The highway passes through {{the edge of the}} community of Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding {{on the south side of}} the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community. Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the <b>two</b> <b>communities,</b> but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of Bark River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E

5|$|M-21 was {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 on a routing from Ionia to Goodells. Along the way, it ran through Lyons and Pewamo, joining its current routing to Ovid. M-21 continued through Corunna to Lennon and Flint. There it joined its last routing between Flint and the Port Huron area. The highway {{was extended to}} Port Huron by 1924, and the west end was extended to Grand Rapids in 1925 along M-16 (later US16). The previous routing through Owosso and Lennon was redesignated as M-71 at this time when M-21 was shifted along the current routing between the <b>two</b> <b>communities.</b> The 1926 creation of the United States Highway System led to the extension of M-21 along US16 to Grand Rapids. From there west, M-21 replaced M-51 on Chicago Drive to Holland. The highway was {{moved to a new}} routing between Flint and Lapeer in 1929; the old route was renumbered M-21A. All in-city portions of M-21 were transferred to state control in 1931 {{with the passage of the}} Dykstra Act of 1931 (PA 131 of 1931).|$|E
5|$|Olaf {{was a part}} of a {{rainy year}} in Mexico, {{producing}} more rain than Hurricane Nora. Although no deaths were reported, flooding caused serve damage to roadways and crops in the Mexican state of Jalisco. In the same state, more than 12,000 homes were damaged. In the state of Guanajuato, an estimated total of 15,000 people were impacted from the floods. In addition, <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> were isolated. After the hurricane, a program wanted donation from food to basic home supplies. Moisture from the remnants of Nora and Olaf interacted with an upper-level low to produce heavy rainfall across Texas, producing flooding near Waco that forced a family to evacuate in McGregor. The floodwaters closed portions of Interstate 35, U.S. Route 84, and Texas State Highway 36. It also spawned a tornado in Sugar Land that damaged four buildings, including a school.|$|E
5|$|The Antemoro figure {{among the}} more recent {{settlers}} {{on the island of}} Madagascar. They are descended from Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500. Boats carrying Muslim settlers had arrived on Madagascar's shores in the past, but there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time. Upon arrival they encountered several other Malagasy ethnic groups including the Zafiraminia, who also traced their origins back to Mecca by way of East Africa, although some scholars suggest that the origins of the Zafiraminia was in Sumatra and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas, and who had the prerogative of practicing ritual animal sacrifice for the ancestors (sombili), a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities. Oral and written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between the <b>two</b> <b>communities,</b> but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia. A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy, which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups describe as a battle between two giants. The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves.|$|E

5|$|The {{alignment}} of NY167 follows the Paine's Hollow Road, constructed between Little Falls and Paines Hollow. This new road would shorten {{time between the}} <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> through Herkimer County. The Paine's Hollow Road opened on October 4, 1921, opening a new road through the dairy country of the Mohawk Valley. The new road had branch alignments toward Oneonta, Cooperstown and Richfield Springs. At 1 p.m. (1800 UTC) that day, a convoy of vehicles drove the route south from Little Falls, with a band on a large truck and a coach with six horses. When the group reached Paines Hollow, a ceremony was held, led {{by the president of}} the Little Falls Chamber of Commerce and H.P. Snyder, the local legislator for Herkimer County. The new section between Paines Hollow and Jordanville cost $123,136.25 (1921 USD) and was designated as State Highway1363.|$|E
5|$|West of the village, US20, NY5, and NY414 {{become a}} major {{commercial}} strip as it heads through an area situated between the hamlet of Seneca Falls and the village of Waterloo. Roughly midway between the <b>two</b> <b>communities,</b> NY414 splits from US20 and NY5, becoming a commercial strip itself as it heads north through the northern portion {{of the town of}} Seneca Falls as Mound Road. Near the northern end of the strip, the route crosses the main line of the Finger Lakes Railway at a grade crossing. Past the crossing, the businesses give way to mostly undeveloped areas that persist into the neighboring town of Tyre, where it intersects NY318 in the small hamlet of Magee as Ridge Road. Just north of this intersection, NY414 intersects the New York State Thruway (I-90) at exit41. North of the Thruway, NY414 maintains a constant north-northwest alignment across rolling farmland into Wayne County.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was {{originally}} signposted in 1919, the highway running northwest–southeast through Roscommon was numbered M-76. In 1949, M-18 was extended north into Roscommon and then west along M-76. During the early 1970s, M-76 was being {{converted into a}} freeway {{to be used as}} part of I-75. In 1971, I-75 was completed southward from the Grayling area to what is now exit239. Two years later, I-75 was completed between Roscommon and West Branch, and M-76 between the <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> was decommissioned. At the same time, M-18 was realigned to northeasterly out of Roscommon instead of following M-76 toward Grayling. BL I-75 was commissioned at this time to overlap M-18 from the freeway north into Roscommon and to replace the former M-18/M-76 west of the village to the new freeway.|$|E
