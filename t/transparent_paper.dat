When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on <b>transparent</b> <b>paper</b> on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E

"Having {{obtained}} drawings or {{photographs of}} several persons alike in most respects, but differing in minor details, what sure method is there of extracting the typical characteristics from them? I may mention a plan which had occurred both to Mr. Herbert Spencer and myself, {{the principle of}} which is to superimpose optically the various drawings, and to accept the aggregate result. Mr. Spencer suggested to me in conversation that the drawings reduced to the same scale might be traced on separate pieces of <b>transparent</b> <b>paper</b> and secured one upon another, and then held between the eye and the light. I have attempted this with some success. My own idea was to throw faint images of the several portraits, in succession, upon the same sensitised photographic plate. I may add that it is perfectly easy to superimpose optically two portraits by means of a stereoscope, and that a person who is used to handle instruments will find a common double eyeglass fitted with stereoscopic lenses to be almost as effectual and far handier than the boxes sold in shops." ...|$|E

Generally, a secret image is distribute {{more than two}} shadow images, which are dealt out among participants. In order to find out secret image, participants print shadow images to <b>transparent</b> <b>papers.</b> Then, a secret image will appear as stacking <b>transparent</b> <b>papers.</b> The secret sharing scheme in this paper distribute secret image into natural grayscale images using multiplexer and data hiding scheme. After then, two participant have two shadow images respectively. The merit of the proposed scheme is that shadow images have small loss in aspect of the quality with steganographic features. Therefore, the proposed secret sharing scheme in this paper is not easily detected by attackers. The experiment result verified that the proposed scheme, obviously outperforms previous S...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 This thesis will outline {{a new way}} of {{fabricating}} flexible photodetectors. Solution-processable colloidal {{quantum dots}} (QDs, or nanocrystals(NCs)) are incorporated into cellulose structures to form a composite structure {{that can be used for}} photodetection. This enables new ways of device fabrication and also makes ultrathin, ultraflexible and even transparent optoelectronic devices possible. Inkjet printing with an office inkjet printer is introduced and applied towards PEDOT:PSS transparent electrode deposition. This offers a low cost method for material deposition. Flexible photoconductors are fabricated with these electrodes and CdSe quantum dot embedded tracing paper by utilizing the porous cellulose structure. Consistent photoresponse is achieved with such a structure under 550 nm light illumination. After further realizing the shortcomings of tracing paper for its large thickness and low porosity, which both deteriorate the performance of these devices, natural plant-membranes are chosen as an alternative and offer superb properties for optoelectronic device fabrication. Visible-blind self-powered ultra-violet detectors are designed and fabricated with the incorporation of ZnO NCs on reed membrane. Schottky junction devices are fabricated with the use of gold and aluminum as the electrodes. Sub-second responses are observed at a bias of zero, which is superior than most of the flexible photoconductors in the literature. An external quantum efficiency of over 3 % is discovered with the device at 350 nm light illumination under zero bias. A great performance enhancement is also observed on the devices fabricated on reed membrane comparing to the ones on tracing paper. Nanofibrillated cellulose(NFC) can be readily used to fabricate <b>transparent</b> <b>papers.</b> ZnO NC-NFC composite structure is prepared and fabricated into ultrathin <b>transparent</b> <b>papers</b> with a thickness less than 1 micrometer. Self-powered Schottky photodiodes are fabricated on such papers and relatively fast response is observed at zero bias...|$|R

5000|$|Cliché verre is a {{combination}} of painting and or drawing, with photography. In brief, it is a method of either etching, painting or drawing on a transparent surface, such as glass, thin paper or film and printing the resulting image on a light sensitive paper in a photographic darkroom. It is a process first practiced by a number of French painters during the early 19th century. The French landscape painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was the best known of these. Some contemporary artists have developed techniques for achieving a variety of line, tone, texture and color by experimenting with film, frosted Mylar, paint and inks and a wide assortment of tools for painting, etching, scratching, rubbing and daubing. Scratching a negative is another form of cliche verre. Many ways to get different designs for a cliche verre is to print a design off of the computer onto <b>transparent</b> <b>paper.</b> Or even scan a photo onto <b>transparent</b> <b>paper</b> and alter it that way before exposing it.|$|E
