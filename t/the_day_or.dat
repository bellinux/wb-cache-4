5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy {{in the life of}} the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, and if there is a conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E
5|$|For these {{long-range}} desert operations, it {{was necessary}} for all supplies to be well-organised and suitably packaged for transportation on camels, moving with the column or following closely behind. It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>or</b> bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could mean no water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E

Later, Dogface and Kris were similarly punished, also for discussing nominations. All three failed to keep quiet and faced the public vote, along with Halfwit and Marcus, who received the most nominations. On Day 35, the housemates failed the circus-themed shopping task and received a basic shopping budget. On Day 37, Kris became the sixth person to be evicted from the House with 63.0% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex {{share similar}} {{behaviours}} with other Myrmeciinae relatives. Prionomyrmex may have foraged {{on the ground}} or onto trees and low vegetation, feeding on nectar and arthropods. Nothomyrmecia workers, however, drink hemolymph from the insects they capture, and the larvae are carnivorous. It is not known if the ants were active during <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> night, but Nothomyrmecia is a nocturnal ground forager that prefers very cold nights. Both ants have large compound eyes, relying on their vision for prey and navigational purposes. Due to their primitive and simplified social life, workers of both genera do not recruit others to food sources or leave down trail pheromones, suggesting that both these ants are solitary foragers. Prionomyrmex ants were hosts to female stylopid parasites. Predators are unknown for both ants.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel {{and bottom of the}} foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E
5|$|Plants face severe {{challenges}} in arid environments. Problems {{they need to}} solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce. Photosynthesis {{is the key to}} plant growth. It can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot. Opening stomata to allow in the carbon dioxide necessary for the process causes evapotranspiration, and conservation of water is a top priority for desert vegetation. Some plants have resolved this problem by adopting crassulacean acid metabolism, allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow CO2 to enter, and close them during <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>or</b> by using C4 carbon fixation.|$|E

5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} taken before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness {{takes the form of}} general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{stated that}} it wished to run up to four multichannels at {{different}} times of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> alternatively offer an HDTV service. It claimed that up to $100 million would be needed to prepare for these services, half of which would need to be government-funded. Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three-quarters of}} all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, {{sleeping}} in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their {{competition with the}} simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living {{in the absence of}} simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet {{some or all of the}} brown lemurs (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.|$|E

5|$|Fish {{and other}} aquatic prey {{taken in the}} water or at the water's edge form the major part of American alligator's diet and may be eaten {{at any time of}} <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> night. Adult American {{alligators}} also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50m (170ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them {{from the edge of the}} water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the American alligator are designed to grip prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard instead to masticate their food. The American alligator is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone. Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed and documented killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that bonnetheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays and nurse sharks are components of the animal's diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators in turn, indicating encounters between the two predators are more common than thought.|$|E
