5|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the comets C/1843 D1, C/1880 C1, C/1882 R1, C/1887 B1, C/1963 R1, C/1965 S1, and C/1970 K1 are all members of a family known as the Kreutz Sungrazers, which are all descended from one comet. Current models {{do not support the}} frequent supposition in the prior literature that the famous comet of 372 BC is in fact the ultimate parent of the Sungrazers. The comet of 372 BC is often associated with Aristotle who, along with others from his time, described that comet in his writings. However, Aristotle was only twelve {{at the time of the}} comet's appearance and the historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, who also wrote about it was born ten years after its appearance. Consequently, their reports should not be taken as eye-witness accounts. Further, there is no mention of the comet in Chinese literature of the time. Instead either the comet of February 423 or of February 467 with orbital periods of around 700 years is now considered the likely progenitor of the Sungrazers. The fragments of the Great Comet of 1882 will return in several hundred years' <b>time,</b> <b>spread</b> out over perhaps two or three centuries.|$|E
5|$|With an {{interest}} in pathology, Stansfield spent {{the last few months}} of his time in Edinburgh working at the Royal Infirmary. In 1889, the London County Council (LCC) was established and took over the running of several London mental asylums; in the process, it advertised for a Fourth Assistant Medical Officer and Pathologist at Banstead Asylum, essentially a junior assistant with pathological duties which often related to postmortems. Stansfield successfully applied for the position. While at Banstead, he became interested in the pathology of mental illness and asylum administration. Accustomed to the laboratories at Edinburgh and drilled in rigorous note-taking skills, he set about instilling similar facilities and ethos at Banstead under the auspices of its superintendent, Dr T. Claye Shaw. Each ward would also have its own fixed notebook for medical officers, a practice which over <b>time</b> <b>spread</b> to all other asylums in the country. Thanks to this and his enjoying good relations with its steward, F. Alderton, Stansfield was made Banstead's Second Assistant Medical Officer in 1890 and, when Claybury Asylum opened in 1892–93, he was transferred there as First Assistant Medical Officer, helped by Claye Shaw's influence at the LCC. Over the course of the 1890s, he visited numerous domestic and foreign institutions, travelling to Germany and the United States.|$|E

From 17 May, the buses were returned to the company, but quotas for petrol were introduced, and the company was forced to install wood gasifiers on its fleet. Both Steinkjer and Namsos were bombed in 1940, but in both towns the company's facilities survived, except the garage in Steinkjer. The buses were at the <b>time</b> <b>spread</b> around the county, and only a single bus was destroyed. After the war ended in 1945, the company had 21 operational buses. The company needed to have a license to purchase buses, and in the following five years, 17 buses were bought for about NOK1 million. They were mostly Volvos and Scania-Vabis, including one from the municipal bus company in Høylandet. In 1946, Fylkesbilene bought Kvam Billag and the routes from Steinkjer to Øvre Kvam. At the same time, the route to Follafoss was extended to the county border. From 1 January 1948, Fylkesbilene bought the private bus operators in Ytre Namdal, and started routes from Vikna, Nærøy, Leka and Bindal via Ottersøy to Namsos. The company in Høylandet was bought to allow direct connection from Ytre Namdal via Høylandet to Grong. The same year, the company introduced a direct service between Verdalsøra and Levanger, that previously had only been served by the railway.|$|E

This gave accurate timing of the implosion, from which its symmetry could be evaluated. It {{turned out to be}} the most useful of several methods of timing the implosion. When the director, Robert Oppenheimer, reorganised the Los Alamos Laboratory to focus on implosion in August 1944, Titterton joined Kenneth Greisen's X-1A Section in Norris Bradbury's X-1 (Implosion) Group. The group studied the timing of the primacord detonations using X-rays. Titterton designed a circuit for measuring the spread of detonations using a variation of the pin method. He developed a device called [...] "the informer" [...] that measured the <b>time</b> <b>spread</b> among detonations (and whether all the detonators had indeed fired). In July 1945 he was a senior member of the timing group at the Trinity nuclear test that fired the first nuclear weapon at Alamogordo, New Mexico. His electronic timers tracked the progress of the detonation. In February 1946, he became the head of the P-1 (Electronics) Group. He participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll, and performed the countdown for both tests.|$|E

The thesis starts with an introduction to turbo codes which is presented on the basis of classical turbo codes introduced by Berrou et al in 1993 (Berrou et al., 1993). This is illustrated by some examples of their performance across the Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel (AWGN). Then a detailed description of the Space <b>Time</b> <b>Spreading</b> (STS) channel and the Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS) turbo codes. Using the UMTS turbo codes this thesis produces simulation results showing to what extent they reduce the bit error rate of the STS channel. A description of the system in Simulink and Matlab is presented. The simulation results show that UMTS turbo codes applied on the top of the STS channel can improve the bit error rate performance by approximately 5 dB. This is done at the expense of increased complexity and reduced effective data rate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Multi-path <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} factor in the bit error rate of high-frequency ionospheric communication channels and in the target detection performance of over-the-horizon radars. In this study, the probability density distribution of multi-path time delay and Doppler shift of ionospheric radio signal are derived using Rayleigh fading. Moreover, the probability density distribution of time delay, average power of the received signal, and received signal variance are discussed in detail. Using a designed experimental circuit, the measured value of the multi-path <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> is obtained from three given radio paths by the sweep-frequency pulse sounding technique. The average value of the multi-path <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> that changes with the ratio K, which is the operating frequency of the basic maximum usable frequency, is also analyzed and fitted using the least-squares fitting method. Theoretical and statistical research shows that for a given radio path and specific frequency, the multi-path <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> approximately follows a normal distribution. The average <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> decreases with the increase in the ratio K; however, it eventually approaches a steady value. The results of this research provide an empirical reference for further prediction and estimation of the <b>time</b> delay <b>spread</b> of a radar wave propagating through the ionosphere...|$|R
