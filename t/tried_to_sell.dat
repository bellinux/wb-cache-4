5|$|Smith {{rebuilt the}} defence for 1993–94, signing right-back Brian Mitchell and centre-back David Thompson, and oversaw a mixed {{start to the}} season. City won four {{straight}} home matches but also lost 5–1 to West Ham, 5–0 at Newcastle, and most significantly 4–0 to local rivals Bristol Rovers at Twerton Park. He {{found it difficult to}} control the club's talented and popular players, as Dziekanowski regularly got into trouble in his social life and skilled left-winger Junior Bent was unwilling to deliver crosses as regularly as Smith demanded. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> Bent but was unable to have the deal sanctioned by the club's directors. His relationship with the board was poor and he found himself regularly undermined and sensitive boardroom discussions were leaked. He also <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> Cole in order to provide funds to restructure the first team but again the board refused to sanction the deal. He was dismissed on 21 January 1993 following a run of 10 matches without a victory, and his assistant Russell Osman was appointed as his successor.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 {{to convert it}} from iron to steel. It was {{repeatedly}} reinforced throughout its existence. When Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley line in 1977, {{the stability of the}} trestle had been one of its primary reasons for doing so. Conrail had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the bridge as early as 1983, and in 1986 the trestle was sold to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.|$|E

Over the next three years Whitehead's attempted to sell the boat to the navies of Peru, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Bulgaria, before the Austro-Hungarian Navy rejected an offer for the second time. With the outbreak of war, however, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased the unsold submarine to quickly bolster its fleet.|$|E

According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.|$|E

Given abundant funds and materials, the Hungarian engineer built the gun within three months at Edirne, from which it was dragged by sixty oxen to Constantinople.

However the Cavendish family did not succeed until thirteen years later in 1959 during which time the house was unoccupied and started to decay. It was sold at this time to Bristol City Council who still owns it today.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off. The first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an airplane.|$|E
5|$|His {{library and}} {{collections}} {{were left to}} his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> it to Banks, but {{he was no longer}} interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later.|$|E

The first stage of the stadium opened on 10 August 2008, after which further {{construction}} was terminated. Stage one cost NOK92.5 million to build and NOK19 million for purchase of real estate. By April 2010, BG had combined negative assets, debt and received grants of NOK240 million. Of this, NOK78 million was written-off bad debts to BE1 and NOK19 million was purchase of lots. On 25 September 2009, Hamar Municipality bought HSA, BG, BIP and BE1 for NOK73,000. In December 2009, the municipality increased the share capital in BG with NOK16 million and in BE1 with NOK32 million.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Connex Norge {{offered to}} {{purchase}} Timetoget from NSB, and start operations. However, by February, Connex had changed their mind, {{and no longer}} wanted to purchase the company. Terje Bulling admitted that Timetoget {{had a very good}} agreement for operating the Arendal Line, and that a fourth Y1 railcar had been bought from Sweden for this route. However, when NSB had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> Timetoget, this agreement {{was not part of the}} estate. By April, NSB estimated that they had lost NOK10 million on their engagement in Timetoget. However, they had three Y1 trains, and would be able to start using them on the Bratsberg Line and the Arendal Line.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, Cloverleaf <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> Rosecroft {{multiple}} times. In mid-2002, several buyers {{became interested}} in the track, but Cloverleaf was involved in lawsuits, so the track could not be sold. One bidder was Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, but he withdrew in 2005. All the lawsuits were resolved in 2006, and only one remaining bidder was left—Penn National Gaming. Maryland passed a casino bill in 2007, but Rosecroft was not one of the locations sanctioned for expanded gambling by the law. As a result, Penn National lost its interest in Rosecroft and decided not to purchase the track. From the gambling revenue, 7 percent goes to the horse-racing industry.|$|E

Walter was flattered, but initially <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> Lucas on a different screenplay called Barry and the Persuasions, a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his was a story about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.|$|E
5|$|The Cage {{provides}} {{further insight}} into why Shakespeare {{would not have}} trusted Judith's husband. Around 1630 Quiney <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the lease on the house but was prevented by his kinsmen. In 1633, to protect the interests of Judith and the children, the lease was signed over to the trust of John Hall, Susanna's husband, Thomas Nash, the husband of Judith's niece, and Richard Watts, vicar of nearby Harbury, who was Quiney's brother-in-law and who had officiated at Thomas and Judith's wedding. Eventually, in November 1652, the lease to The Cage {{ended up in the}} hands of Thomas' eldest brother, Richard Quiney, a grocer in London.|$|E
5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial ones. For {{years he had}} been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E
