6000|$|... "I regret <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> differently," [...] I answered. [...] "Unless Mrs. Van Reinberg withdraws her invitation, I shall {{certainly}} be present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was going}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he fidgets less,' said Laura; 'but I think his chief contortions of the {{scissors}} have been when Philip has been here.' ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{going to}} give {{anything}} away about the mystery itself except <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> obliged myself <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was glad}} {{he had made his}} apology.|$|R
60|$|I stared. Indeed, {{it would}} not be too much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> gaped.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for that. I was going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{you need not}} take any further trouble with the fire. It will light of itself now." ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD GORING. Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn’t so, life wouldn’t {{be worth}} living. [...] . Well, I am bound <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{you should have}} told her years ago.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Clive {{lost all}} patience. [...] "In what company, Barnes, {{would you like}} me <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you are a snob? Will you have it on the Parade? Come out and I will speak to you." ...|$|E
60|$|He. I suppose <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{can trust}} you. I've ample reason.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{was obliged}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{did not think}} I had ever heard it.|$|R
60|$|HE. I suppose <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{can trust}} you. I've ample reason.|$|R
6000|$|... "Except his uncle," [...] said Mrs. Woodford. [...] "I fear it is vain <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{the best}} hope of his {{becoming}} a good and valuable man, a comfort and not a sorrow to yourself, would be to let him even now rejoin Sir Peregrine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't mean <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it will; God forbid! {{but it is}} just possible. I {{dare say}} that I am very wrong to tell you this, but I know that you have sense enough to bear it. Papa has gone to London, and we shall hear from him soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you ask me, I am bound <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it would}} not be wise. If I were you, I would leave her for awhile. Mary is as good as gold, but she is a woman; and, like other women, the more she is sought, the more {{difficult}} she will be." ...|$|E
60|$|It is needless <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{declined}} <b>to</b> {{understand that}} he was offended with me.|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS. I {{was only}} going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't know <b>that</b> you and Craven were acquainted.|$|R
60|$|It is needless <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> eagerly {{accepted}} the service {{which he had}} offered to me.|$|R
6000|$|I did not {{get your}} kind and {{interesting}} letter till yesterday, and can only write in utter haste this morning <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> nothing can possibly be more satisfactory (to me personally at least) and more honourable than what you tell me of the wish of the meeting to have the letters printed for their quiet consideration.[29] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifteen hundred a year," [...] {{said his}} lordship, going off {{at once to}} this one point of true vital importance. [...] "I am bound <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I could have done better for you had you consented to bear the title, which is as {{completely}} your own, as is that mine by which I am called." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is my son, your Majesty, of whom I {{spoke to}} you. I am happy <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he will some day {{be able to}} follow you to battle as I {{followed}} the noble prince your father; for he has now resolved, should his health remain good, to take up the profession of arms." ...|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. I think I may {{go so far}} as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{can depend}} on Miss Robinson's consent.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{am sorry}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{do not get}} {{favorable}} news from Orvil. He {{does not seem to}} improve.|$|R
60|$|Shepherd. Ou, sir, troth <b>I</b> am no <b>that</b> free <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> mind wha I {{might think}} they were.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Tony, I am glad <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I have {{arranged}} a plan by {{which you will}} be got safely out of the country. Of course, it may fail; but there is every hope of success. I {{have arranged}} for a boat, and shall take you down the river, and put you on board a ship bound for England." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Gage {{waved the}} facts aside with his hand. [...] "I don't undervalue those things. If I could be master, {{no one should}} have my girl without them. But they do not {{constitute}} a livelihood. From what you tell me of Mr. Kendricks's prospects, I am not prepared <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the outlook is brilliant. If he has counted upon my supplying a deficiency--" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were other}} peculiarities, {{but it is}} not {{necessary}} to describe them further than <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the soil benefited by the natural heat of the volcano, and that when this erupted, as happened occasionally, the lava streams always passed to the north and south of the cup of land. Indeed, it was these lava streams that had built up the protecting cliffs.|$|E
60|$|SYKES. Sinjon: {{you have}} no right <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> {{expressly}} said <b>that</b> I'm ready to go through with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "My love to your sister, if you please; {{and when}} you see my cousin, my cousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> suppose I shall soon hear from him." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} him in astonishment. <b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought these {{relations}} strange would have been a waste of words.|$|R
60|$|I {{have gone}} {{carefully}} over your story again, and quite {{agree with you}} that the episode of the clergyman could be told in a very few lines. Startling as I know it will appear to you, I am bound <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the purpose of the whole tale would be immensely strengthened by great compression. I doubt if it could not be told more forcibly in half the space.|$|E
6000|$|Allow me also <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> in your {{comparison}} of the effect [...] of taxes and loans you have looked (p. 262) too much to the effect [...] on labour at the moment. Capital and labour are in permanent [...] competition for {{the division of the}} fruits of production. When in [...] years of war say twenty millions annually are provided by loan say [...] for three, five, or ten years, then two consequences follow.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will forget}} Mrs. Dods for the present, if you please, Captain MacTurk," [...] said Tyrrel--"and, {{to speak to}} the present subject, you will permit me <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this summons comes a little of the latest. You know best as a {{military}} man, but I have always understood that such differences are usually settled immediately after they occur--not that I intend to baulk Sir Bingo's inclinations upon the score of delay, or any other account." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> began <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hoped I was not interrupting, {{when the}} clerk shoved this gentleman out {{with as little}} {{ceremony}} as I ever saw used, and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> ventured <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was glad}} she said they, and hoped {{it was a sign}} that she was finding out Clarence.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guessed. You {{were going}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{must have heard}} your criticisms in the train. You were very lenient, I thought." ...|$|R
