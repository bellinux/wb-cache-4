5|$|In November 1945, with league {{competition}} still suspended, Arsenal {{were one}} of the teams that played a Dynamo Moscow side touring the UK. With many players still serving abroad in the armed forces, Arsenal were severely depleted and used six guest players, including Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen, which led Dynamo to declare they were playing an England XI, although three of the side were actually Welsh. In any case, Dynamo themselves had Vsevolod Bobrov on loan from CDKA Moscow. The match, at White Hart Lane, kicked off in thick fog and <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> and technically proficient Dynamo won 4–3, after Arsenal had led 3–1 at half-time.|$|E
5|$|The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand {{and water}} to make mud mortar. They {{obtained}} most of the material from canyon deposits, {{but some of the}} clays may have been collected {{from the base of the}} cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of record}} company support {{frustrated}} {{the band and}} led the band to self-produce their next album, The Beacon Street Collection, in a home-made studio, causing them {{to move away from}} <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> pop sound desired by Interscope and towards a more punk style. Their independence shocked their record company representative Tony Ferguson and the album sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, the year of its release, over three times as many as No Doubt sold. To capitalize on this success, Interscope offered the band extensive help with their third album, Tragic Kingdom, under the division Trauma Records to which the band was signed.|$|E
50|$|The local horse thieves {{were known}} as the Pony Club, and the vigilantes were <b>the</b> <b>Slicks.</b> At first, <b>the</b> <b>Slicks</b> would just hold Pony Club members caught {{stealing}} horses until a jury trial could be held. But Pony Club members usually had no trouble finding witnesses to prove their innocence, so <b>the</b> <b>Slicks</b> eventually started holding their own trials and the guilty were whipped. Things {{came to a head}} during the election of 1832 when large numbers of Pony Club members and Slicks got into a brawl. <b>The</b> <b>Slicks</b> won <b>the</b> fight, and the Pony Club demanded a grand jury try <b>the</b> <b>Slicks</b> on charges of assault and battery with intent to kill. However, the jury ended up commending <b>the</b> <b>Slicks</b> and thanking them for their work.|$|R

5|$|In 1957, American News Company, by far {{the largest}} {{magazine}} distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen {{by the end of the}} decade. For a while If was hard to find on the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> format (using glossy paper, unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, Space Age, which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve Ifs circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.|$|E
5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E
5|$|Aldridge {{also started}} the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining {{for a week}} in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and drizzle, with a very wet {{pitching}} mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success {{in the first two}} games to the seventh, but it was not to be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.|$|E

25|$|From 17 to 27 November, {{there was}} slight leakage from the tanker. Another major {{explosion}} occurred {{on board the}} vessel {{on the night of}} 6 December at 10:40p.m., which resulted in more oil spillage. <b>The</b> <b>slick</b> from the vessel drifted towards the Port of Haydarpaşa, and the booms across its entrance could not prevent approximately 50 tons of oil entering the harbor.

Despite grass being his worst surface, his first major win was at <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> grass of Wimbledon in 1992, a tournament that he professed to hating at the time. His strongest surface {{over the course of}} his career, was indeed hardcourt, where he won six of his eight majors.|$|E
25|$|He {{took the}} sound to Nashville, {{where he was}} the first {{musician}} to play electric guitar on Grand Ole Opry. In the 1950s, honky tonk entered its golden age, with the popularity of Webb Pierce, Hank Locklin, Lefty Frizzell, Faron Young, George Jones, and Hank Williams. In the mid- to late 1950s, rockabilly (which melded honky-tonk country with rhythm and blues) and <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> country music of the Nashville sound ended honky-tonk's initial period of dominance.|$|E

25|$|The {{light crude}} oil spilled in the Mega Borg {{incident}} was brown and evaporated much quicker than the {{heavy crude oil}} in spills such as the Exxon Valdez. This means that the oil {{is less likely to}} heavily coat nearby beaches, flora and fauna, however the tanker was carrying more oil than the Exxon Valdez incident spilled in total, so {{there was a lot of}} concern about the oil not being able to evaporate if <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> became too thick.|$|E

Landry would say he expected a rollout pass attempt because an incompletion would stop the clock and allow the Packers one more play on fourth down, either for a touchdown (to win) or a field goal attempt (to tie and send the game into overtime). But Green Bay's pass protection on <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> field had been seriously tested during the game; the Cowboys had sacked Starr eight times.|$|E

25|$|The Koppenberg {{has been}} dropped some years {{because it was}} deemed too {{difficult}} and too dangerous. Particularly when wet weather had made the cobbles slippery, {{it was hard for}} riders to take the steep slopes all the way riding. One rider falling could bring many others down and, in turn, halt those behind, who often had to shoulder their bikes and run up the remainder of the hill. In 1984 only two riders– Phil Anderson and Jan Raas– got to the top on their bikes. In 1987 Danish rider Jesper Skibby slipped and fell on <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> cobbles, before being run over by an official's car who tried to pass him. The climb was subsequently banned from the Tour of Flanders for the next 15 years.|$|E
25|$|In the 1968 World Series, the Tigers met the {{defending}} World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals, led by starter Bob Gibson (who had posted a record 1.12 ERA {{during the regular}} season) and speedy outfielder Lou Brock. The series was predicated with a bold decision by manager Mayo Smith to play center fielder Mickey Stanley at shortstop, replacing <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> fielding but weak hitting of Ray Oyler. Stanley had never played shortstop before, but was a gold glover in the outfield and an excellent athlete. Smith started him at short for the final nine games {{of the regular season}} and all seven World Series games, with Oyler only appearing as a late-inning defensive replacement. This allowed Smith to play an outfield of Willie Horton, Jim Northrup and Al Kaline in every Series game.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few more}} hours, the strikers {{attempted}} to burn the barges. They seized a raft, loaded it with oil-soaked timber and floated it toward the barges. The Pinkertons nearly panicked, and a Pinkerton captain had to threaten to shoot anyone who fled. But the fire burned itself out before it reached the barges. The strikers then loaded a railroad flatcar with drums of oil and set it afire. The flatcar hurtled down the rails toward the mill's wharf where the barges were docked. But the car stopped at the water's edge and burned itself out. Dynamite was thrown at the barges, but it only hit the mark once (causing a little damage to one barge). At 2:00p.m., the workers poured oil onto the river, hoping the oil slick would burn the barges; attempts to light <b>the</b> <b>slick</b> failed.|$|E
