25|$|An African slave named Stephan {{changed the}} process of curing the Bright Leaf <b>tobacco</b> <b>variety</b> (a lighter flavored tobacco leaf) by curing it with {{charcoal}} taken from a local blacksmith's fire rather than the usual logwood. This fire burned hotter and faster and accelerated the curing process. The process was refined further to include a furnace in which heat from the charcoal was applied through flues, so that dark soot and off flavors did not {{come in contact with}} the tobacco. This changed the curing process of a lighter leaf and produced a new, lighter tobacco which was able to be inhaled. This, linked together with the British Victorian desire for cigarettes, along with the aforementioned French and other European countries, gave way to an emerging market to minced tobacco.

A total of twenty eight flue-cured cultivars (sixteen from China, six from Brazil, two from South Africa and four from Zimbabwe) were studied. Phenotypic data for tobacco descriptor traits were collected from a field experiment carried out using standard cultural practices for flue-cured tobacco in Zimbabwe. A sample of fifteen cultivars was genotyped with simple sequence repeats markers. Low levels of diversity were detected among the cultivars using analysis of either phenotypic or DNA marker data.

40|$|Drought {{is a major}} {{environmental}} factor that limits crop growth and productivity. Flue-cured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) {{is one of the}} most important commercial crops worldwide and its productivity is vulnerable to drought. However, comparative analyses of physiological, biochemical and gene expression changes in flue-cured <b>tobacco</b> <b>varieties</b> differing in drought tolerance under long-term drought stress are scarce. In this study, drought stress responses of two flue-cured <b>tobacco</b> <b>varieties,</b> LJ 851 and JX 6007, were comparatively studied at the physiological and transcriptional levels. After exposing to progressive drought stress, the drought-tolerant LJ 851 showed less growth inhibition and chlorophyll reduction than the drought-sensitive JX 6007. Moreover, higher antioxidant enzyme activities and lower levels of H 2 O 2, Malondialdehyde (MDA), and electrolyte leakage after drought stress were found in LJ 851 when compared with JX 6007. Further analysis showed that LJ 851 plants had much less reductions than the JX 6007 in the net photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance during drought stress; indicating that LJ 851 had better photosynthetic performance than JX 6007 during drought. In addition, transcriptional expression analysis revealed that LJ 851 exhibited significantly increased transcripts of several categories of drought-responsive genes in leaves and roots under drought conditions. Together, these results indicated that LJ 851 was more drought-tolerant than JX 6007 as evidenced by better photosynthetic performance, more powerful antioxidant system, and higher expression of stress defense genes during drought stress. This study will be valuable for the development of novel flue-cured <b>tobacco</b> <b>varieties</b> with improved drought tolerance by exploitation of natural genetic variations in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of polyphenols in tobacco waste was identified by HPLC-PDA–ESI/MS/MS and {{the contents of}} chlorogenic acids and rutin in 10 <b>varieties</b> of <b>tobacco</b> wastes were determined by HPLC–UV. The relationships between the contents of active polyphenols and the <b>varieties</b> of <b>tobacco</b> wastes were interpreted by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that 15 polyphenols were identified in a methanolic extract of dried tobacco waste. The tobacco wastes were characterized by high levels of chlorogenic acids (3 -CQA, 5 -CQA, and 4 -CQA) and rutin; their ranges in the 10 <b>tobacco</b> <b>varieties</b> were 0. 116 – 0. 196, 0. 686 – 1. 781, 0. 094 – 0. 192, and 0. 413 – 0. 998 %, respectively. According to multivariate statistics models, two active compound variables can be considered important for the discrimination of the <b>varieties</b> of <b>tobacco</b> wastes: chlorogenic acids and rutin.

40|$|AbstractTo {{explain the}} {{observation}} in field experiments that <b>tobacco</b> <b>variety</b> CB- 1 was more nitrogen (N) -efficient than K 326, {{the influence of}} two N levels on growth, N uptake and N flow within plants of the two tobacco varieties was studied. Xylem sap from {{the upper and lower}} leaves of both tobacco varieties cultured in quartz sand was collected by application of pressure to the root system. CB- 1 took up more N with smaller roots at both high (HN, 10 mmolL− 1) and low (LN, 1 mmolL− 1) N levels, and built up more new tissues in upper leaves especially at LN level, than K 326. Both varieties showed luxury N uptake, and CB- 1 accumulated significantly less NO 3 − in new tissues than K 326, when grown at the HN level. At both N levels, the amount of xylem-transported N and phloem-cycled N from shoot to root in K 326 was greater than those in CB- 1, indicating higher N use efficiency in CB- 1 shoots than in K 326 shoots. The major nitrogenous compound in the xylem sap was NO 3 − irrespective of N level and variety. Low N supply did not cause more NO 3 − reduction in the root. The results indicated that the N-efficient <b>tobacco</b> <b>variety</b> CB- 1 was more efficient in both N uptake by smaller roots and N utilization in shoots, especially when grown at the LN level...|$|E
