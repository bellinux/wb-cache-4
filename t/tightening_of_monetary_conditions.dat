40|$|Historically, {{rapid and}} {{unsustainable}} {{increases in the}} demand {{for goods and services}} originating within the economies of Canada's major trading partners have {{had a significant impact on}} the domestic economy. These episodes are typically characterized by increases in world commodity prices and by a <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> abroad to contain inflationary pressures. In this article, the author uses the Bank's quarterly projection model (QPM) (described in the autumn 1994 issue of the Review) to trace the mechanisms that transmit these foreign developments throughout the Canadian economy. In addition, he outlines the response that is required from domestic monetary authorities to maintain a target rate of inflation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{economies of}} the major industrialised {{countries}} have proved quite resilient to the steady <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> which occurred during 1988 and 1989. Growth in the OECD countries is now expected to be just below 3 % for 1990, with Japan and West Germany being the main growth economies. There is some concern about underlying inflationary pressure, however. Although OECD inflation is expected to remain relatively steady at around 4. 5 % during 1990, large wage settlements could undermine this projection. The prospect of widening trade surpluses in West Germany and Japan, coupled with the recent weakness of the Yen {{is an area of}} some concern, especially if there is any hint that disruption in the financial markets could spread beyond Japan...|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of the conduct of monetary policy in Europe must necessarily be made along two distinct and complementary lines. The first is a comparison with the policies followed in the past. The second line has to assess whether monetary policy is adapted to the new conditions that came into existence with {{the inception of the}} Euro. The picture with respect to these two criteria is mixed. Monetary policy has certainly improved with respect to the policies followed in the 1990 s, during the run up to the euro. In fact, the ECB proved to be much more growth friendly than its predecessors. On the other hand, though, the challenges posed by the new environment, the management of a large open economy, have not been internalized by the ECB, that was less reactive than the Fed, and too focussed on current inflation. The <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> in the euro zone, mainly due to the euro appreciation, was not sufficiently cautioned by monetary policy. Especially considering the poor economic performances of the euro zone in the past few years, we must conclude that monetary policy was not helpful in fostering growth recovery in the euro area. The ECB did not fully recognise its new responsibility of conducting the monetary policy of a "big country"...|$|E
40|$|Some {{observers}} have worried that under or over-estimating the output gap may unnecessarily induce <b>tightening</b> or loosening <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions,</b> causing real fluctuations. To investigate {{the relationship between}} the output gap and inflation, we examine models of inflation that do and do not use the output gap. The Phillips curve, which relates inflation to real activity, is regarded as the maintained theory of inflation. Models of inflation without the output gap include the equation of exchange of the quantity theory of money, the real interest rate gap, and two versions of the P* model. Since none of these economic models are either totally wrong nor complete, it makes sense to diversify across models rather than relying on one model exclusively. The forecasts derived from different stable models can be combined through averaging, which offsets biases and reduces the forecast error variance. Such model diversification spreads the risks of errors (i. e., insurance about bad outcomes that arise from the reliance on a single model) and provides greater robustness for policy. This paper examines ten different models of inflation and estimates sixty-seven different specifications, some of which outperform others. Some explanatory variables like money and the real interest rate gap seem to provide more information about future inflation than does estimates of output gap. ...|$|R

40|$|Economic and {{financial}} developments on the Mainland {{have important implications}} for Hong Kong. This paper presents an empirical framework for assessing monetary {{and financial}} conditions on the Mainland by estimating a monetary conditions index (MCI). An MCI is usually defined as a weighted sum of some measures of real interest rate and the real effective exchange rate (REER). Because bank credit is an important channel of monetary policy transmission mechanism in Mainland China, this study extends the conventional MCI by including a quantity variable to capture the credit availability effect. Estimates suggest that, in terms of the effect on real GDP growth, a rise in real interest rates by 1 percentage point is equivalent to an increase in REER appreciation by about 4 percentage points or a fall in real credit growth by 2. 5 percentage points. The estimated MCI suggests a sharp easing in monetary conditions in 2002 - 2003, reflecting a weaker US dollar, relaxed credit stance of banks, and easing of deflation which reduced real interest rates. The fall in the MCI is equivalent to a decline of about 10 percentage points in real interest rates during the period. Easy monetary conditions have contributed to an acceleration in economic growth since 2002. Fears of overheating pressures prompted the authorities to implement administrative measures in early 2004 to curb credit supply to selected sectors and raise interest rates in late October 2004. The estimated MCI suggests that the <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> is equivalent to a rise in real interest rates by about 4. 6 percentage points. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{contributing}} {{to the use of}} stress testing techniques, by now a commonly-used practice adopted by the financial community to understand the determinants of financial instability, and to measure the size of financial risk, this work represents an application of macro stress testing to the Italian banking system. The paper tries to provide an answer to two interrelated questions. Whether, and the extent to which, procyclicality is a prominent feature of banks’ soundness and whether exogenous, or policy induced, <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> (sharp and sustained increases in the interest rate and/or appreciation of the exchange rate) significantly increases banks’ fragility. The task is accomplished by the estimation of three alternative VAR models each using different indicators of banks’ soundness: the ratio of non performing loans (flow and stock data) and interest margins to outstanding loans. Two main conclusions emerge. First: the behaviour of either non performing loans or interest margins is only weakly procyclical: i. e. that the solidity of Italian banks could be seriously undermined only in case of falls in output far more severe than in any previous recession {{since the end of the}} World War II. The preoccupation expressed by the literature about the dangers of financial procyclicality seems, therefore, grossly exaggerated in the case of Italy. Second: in a hypothetical scenario where monetary conditions are drastically tightened our banks’ soundness indicators exhibit little variations. In this case too the importance attached by the literature to exchange rate swings, or monetary tightening more generally, for the setting off of financial crises is vastly overstated. banking crises; financial crises; procyclicality; profitability; stress testing; VAR...|$|E

The paper analyzes the theoretical and empirical information content of these concepts for asset markets. The analysis classifies, reviews and assesses measures <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions.</b> For those that qualify as excess liquidity measures, the analysis continues with {{a comparison of the}} sources of imbalances and a discussion of the adequacy for asset markets. The theoretical results are cross-checked with empirical evidence. All excess liquidity measures are estimated and compared in the light of recent US asset bubbles. The analysis draws the following main conclusions. Firstly, not all measures <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> qualify as excess liquidity measure. Secondly, the increasing relevance of asset markets leads to growing distortions of excess liquidity measures. Thirdly, the choice of excess liquidity measure has influence on the assessment <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> in asset markets. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conditions</b> Index (MCI) is {{a concept}} with a twofold use in the {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> and in the development <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> policy strategies. The idea of this concept is that (real) interest rates are not a sufficient indicator for <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> in rather small and open economies. Apart from interest rates, exchange rates also have a sig-nificant influence on <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions.</b> Therefore, the MCI combines interest rates and exchange rates to a single measurement <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> within an economy. The MCI can be employed to measure conditions in order to evaluate monetary policy in an early stage and to give a guideline to policy makers to set their instruments and operating targets accord-ing to target final objectives such as inflation targets. The paper provides a brief introduction into {{the concept of the}} MCI and focuses on the estimation of the respective parameters of this index concept for South Africa. The estimated weights of the MCI suggest that changes of real interest rates have a 1. 9 times higher influence on <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> than changes in real exchange rates.

In the United States, adherence to {{the gold standard}} prevented the Federal Reserve from expanding the money supply to stimulate the economy, fund insolvent banks and fund government deficits that could [...] "prime the pump" [...] for an expansion. Once off the gold standard, it became free to engage in such money creation. The gold standard limited {{the flexibility of the}} central banks' monetary policy by limiting their ability to expand the money supply. In the US, the central bank was required by the Federal Reserve Act (1913) to have gold backing 40% of its demand notes. Others including former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Nobel Prize-winner Milton Friedman place the blame for the severity and length of the Great Depression {{at the feet of the}} Federal Reserve, mostly due to the deliberate <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> policy even after the gold standard.
