500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} intended for a rock opera Townshend {{had been working}} on, Lifehouse, which was a multi-media exercise based on his followings of the Indian religious avatar Meher Baba, showing how spiritual enlightenment could be obtained via a combination of band and audience. The song was written {{for the end of}} the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the [...] "universal chord" [...] is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other. Townshend described the song as one [...] "that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is better than no cause". He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric [...] "We'll be fighting in the streets", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, [...] "Don't expect to see what you expect to see. Expect nothing and you might gain everything." [...] Bassist John Entwistle later said that the song showed Townshend [...] "saying <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> mattered to him, and saying them for the first time." ...|$|E

God of War II was officially {{announced}} at the 2006 Game Developers Conference (GDC). God of War Game Director David Jaffe stepped down and became the Creative Director of its sequel. God of Wars lead animator Cory Barlog assumed the role of Game Director. In an interview with Computer and Video Games (CVG) in June 2006, Barlog said that while working on the first few drafts of script, he studied the mythology extensively. He said that the mythology is so large that [...] "the real difficulty is picking <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> fit within the story of Kratos as well as being easy to swallow for audiences." [...] Although he loves the idea of teaching things through storytelling (in this case Greek mythology), Barlog said, [...] "you can't let your story get bogged down by that." [...] He said that in the game, players would see [...] "a larger view of Kratos' role within the mythological world." [...] He also said that he liked the idea of a trilogy, but there were no plans [...] "as of right now." ...|$|E

Despite liking actor Lance Reddick, Wigler was displeased with his character's increased screentime, believing Broyles works better as an [...] "enigmatic figure". Wigler did however praise the villain's [...] "murderous method of choice", writing [...] "Those who've read my Fringe reviews know that I'm not big on the mystery-of-the-week element, but I have to give this episode some credit for at least making it look good." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, noting the [...] "great work" [...] done with the CGI and props {{while at the same time}} acknowledging the opening was not [...] "particularly exciting". Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode is kind of a yawner. The only <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> spice up the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual). The monster of the week, an alien stowing away in a Russian cosmonaut's body, isn't all that scary or even malevolent (it's just trying to stay alive by feeding on radiation)." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Redding {{performed}} at the influential Monterey Pop Festival as the closing act on Saturday night, {{the second day of}} the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler. Until that point, Redding was still performing mainly for black audiences. [...] At the time, he “had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market.” But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, “his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in Otis Redding’s career.” [...] His act included his own song [...] "Respect" [...] and a version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction." [...] Redding and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's [...] "Shake", after which he delivered an impulsive speech, asking the audience if they were the [...] "love crowd" [...] and looking for a big response. The ballad [...] "I've Been Loving You" [...] followed. The last song was [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. [...] "I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go", said Redding and left the stage of his last major concert. According to Booker T. Jones, [...] "I think we did one of our best shows, Otis and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were there? With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> moved Otis. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey." [...] According to Sweet Soul Music, musicians such as Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix were captivated by his performance; Robert Christgau wrote in Esquire, [...] "The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens." ...|$|E

[...] In the scientific journal Immunology, Rook states that, because parasitic worms were almost always present, the human immune system developed a way to treat them that didn't cause tissue damage.|$|E

I was thinking, maybe he just didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me.

At first sight, the show lends itself to cheap moralising, till one recalls that one only sees busy folk when they are idle, and rich folk when they have made their money.

60|$|Macaulay {{makes the}} {{foundation}} of the Victorian age in all its very English and unique elements: its praise of Puritan politics and abandonment of Puritan theology; its belief in a cautious but perpetual patching up of the Constitution; its admiration for industrial wealth. But above all he typifies the two <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> make the Victorian Age itself, the cheapness and narrowness of its conscious formulæ; the richness and humanity of its unconscious tradition. There were two Macaulays, a rational Macaulay who was generally wrong, and a romantic Macaulay who was almost invariably right. All that was small in him derives from the dull parliamentarism of men like Sir James Mackintosh; but all that was great in him has much more kinship with the festive antiquarianism of Sir Walter Scott.|$|E
