Parsons felt that the Navy should work with the Manhattan Project, and arranged for Naval officers to be assigned to Oak Ridge. The most senior of them was his former classmate Rickover, who became assistant director there.

5|$|Preussen, though {{assigned}} to the II Squadron, missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916. She had been temporarily transferred to the Baltic {{to serve as a}} guard ship. Her sister ship, Lothringen, also missed the battle, as she had been deemed to be in too poor a condition to participate in the fleet advance. Jutland proved <b>to</b> <b>Vice</b> Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the fleet commander, that the pre-dreadnought battleships were too vulnerable {{to take part in a}} major fleet action, and so detached the II Squadron from the High Seas Fleet. As a result, Preussen remained in service as a guard ship in the Baltic. From 1917 to the end of the war, she served as a fleet tender based in Wilhelmshaven. Preussen briefly held Edouard Izac, a US Navy sailor captured after his ship was sunk by , in June 1918; Izac would go on to escape from a German prisoner of war camp and win the Medal of Honor.|$|E
