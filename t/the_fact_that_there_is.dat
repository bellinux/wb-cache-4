5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species {{apparently were}} present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The primary aims {{of therapy}} are {{returning}} function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications {{used in the}} management of MS may have several adverse effects, and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different alternative treatments are pursued by many people, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> little supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study. Stem cell therapy is being studied.|$|E
5|$|Within the conch fisheries, one of {{the threats}} to {{sustainability}} stems from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> almost as much meat in large juveniles {{as there is in}} adults, but only adult conchs can reproduce, and thus sustain a population. In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing, larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate. On a number of islands, subadults provide the majority of the harvest.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of {{committees}} is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the masing molecule, {{there are}} a few {{requirements}} that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place. The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.|$|E

25|$|The kinetic {{relationship}} with the other substrate, MgATP, can be described by classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an affinity at about 0.3–0.4mmol/L, well below a typical intracellular concentration of 2.5mmol/L. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nearly always an excess of ATP available implies that ATP concentration rarely influences glucokinase activity.|$|E

25|$|Butler {{argues that}} the {{performance}} of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender {{to the performance of}} the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However she also brings into light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter because of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a clear distinction from reality within the theater.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{the study}} of {{perception}} as his point of departure, Merleau-Ponty was led to recognize that one's own body (le corps propre) {{is not only a}} thing, a potential object of study for science, but is also a permanent condition of experience, a constituent of the perceptual openness to the world. He therefore underlines <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an inherence of consciousness and of the body of which the analysis of perception should take account. The primacy of perception signifies a primacy of experience, so to speak, insofar as perception becomes an active and constitutive dimension.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who argue}} against a blanket {{moratorium}} on the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth point out that wisdom teeth commonly develop periodontal disease or cavities which may eventually damage the second molars {{and that there are}} costs associated with monitoring wisdom teeth. They also point to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an increase in the rate of post-operative periodontal disease on the second molar, difficulty of surgery and post-operative recovery time with age. The UK has also seen an increase in the rate of dental caries on the lower second molars increasing from 4–5% prior to the NICE guideline to 19% after its adoption.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of domains as structural building blocks and elements of evolution {{has brought about}} many automated methods for their identification and classification in proteins of known structure. Automatic procedures for reliable domain assignment {{is essential for the}} generation of the domain databases, especially as the number of known protein structures is increasing. Although the boundaries of a domain can be determined by visual inspection, construction of an automated method is not straightforward. Problems occur when faced with domains that are discontinuous or highly associated. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no standard definition of what a domain really is has meant that domain assignments have varied enormously, with each researcher using a unique set of criteria.|$|E
25|$|Shallow water {{blackout}} – {{caused by}} hyperventilation prior to swimming or diving. The primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. The body detects CO2 levels very accurately and relies on this to control breathing. Hyperventilation reduces the carbon dioxide content of the blood but leaves the diver susceptible to sudden loss of consciousness without warning from hypoxia. There is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout, and victims (often capable swimmers swimming under the surface in shallow water) become unconscious and drown quietly without alerting anyone to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a problem; they are typically found on the bottom.|$|E
