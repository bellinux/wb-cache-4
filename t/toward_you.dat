500|$|Richard was nicknamed [...] "the Comet" [...] {{early in}} his career. When {{teammate}} Ray Getliffe remarked that Richard [...] "went in like a rocket" [...] {{as he approached the}} opposition goal, Richard was dubbed [...] "The Rocket" [...] by a local sportswriter; both Baz O'Meara from the Montreal Star and Dink Carroll of the Montreal Gazette have been credited for the appellation. The nickname described Richard's play in terms of speed, strength, and determination. Teammate and coach Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because [...] "when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him". Goaltender Jacques Plante declared {{it one of the most}} appropriate nicknames given to an athlete, noting the fierce intensity that often showed in Richard's eyes and comparing it to [...] "the rocket's red glare" [...] referenced in [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". Glenn Hall agreed: [...] "What I remember most about Rocket was his eyes. When he came flying <b>toward</b> <b>you</b> with the puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing and gleaming like a pinball machine. It was terrifying." ...|$|E

2500|$|I've seen proof, {{black on}} white, that Herr Dr. [...] {{has not yet}} severed his {{connection}} with the anti-Semitic movement...Since then I've had difficulty coming up {{with any of the}} tenderness and protectiveness I've so long felt <b>toward</b> <b>you.</b> The separation between us is thereby decided in really the most absurd way. Have you grasped nothing of the reason why I am in the world?...Now it has gone so far that I have to defend myself hand and foot against people who confuse me with these anti-Semitic after my own sister, my former sister, and after Widemann more recently have given the impetus to this most dire of all confusions. After I read the name Zarathustra in the anti-Semitic Correspondence my forbearance came to an end. I am now in a position of emergency defense against your spouse's Party. These accursed anti-Semite deformities shall not sully my ideal!! ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of the [...] "ripple effect," [...] Rouse {{explains}} that, to {{a certain}} extent, it was dictated {{by a sense of}} narrative logic; [...] "it's really crucial that Carmen treats you differently depending on whether you killed her or not. It doesn't make sense that she'd still be loving <b>toward</b> <b>you</b> if you killed her in cold blood." [...] However, it was also important that the player never feel locked into one morality; they could begin the game with bad morality and finish with good morality; [...] "you can travel down different moral paths, and both the beginning you started with and the choices you make during Ties that Bind will affect your final outcome. So there are really a surprising number of possible stories to be told. I want every player to have their own unique version of Torque's story. I hope no two players will remember the game and the story exactly the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was the {{development}} of the knitting machine that introduced hooked needles and enabled faultless, automated knitting. Most knitters probably aren’t even aware of the many processes that their fingers perform in the making of a single stitch. [...] However, large gauge needles emphasize those actions and knitting becomes increasingly more awkward when the needle diameter is greater than the width of the knitter's finger. [...] On a one-inch diameter (size 50) needle for instance, the shaft begins to taper one and three quarter inches from the tip. This means that the stitches are spread much further apart on mega knitting needles, making them more difficult to control. [...] The hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers don’t have to work so hard and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle. The position of the hook is most important. [...] Turn the left (non-working) hook to face away at all times; turn the right (working) hook <b>toward</b> <b>you</b> up whilst knitting (plain stitch) and away whilst purling.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a private}} dinner in November 2014, Emil Michael, senior vice {{president}} of Uber, suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to dig into the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber. Specifically, he targeted Sarah Lacy, editor of the technology website PandoDaily, who has accused Uber of sexism and misogyny. The controversy made national news and stirred criticism against Uber. [...] "The comments, reportedly made by {{senior vice president}} for business Emil Michael at a New York dinner attended by BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith," [...] wrote a Washington Post columnist, [...] "ignited a powder keg of criticism about a company already perceived as cut-throat – landing Uber on the front pages of The Washington Post, USA Today and The New York Times." [...] Michael issued a public apology. Later, he sent an email to Lacy: [...] "I was at an event and was venting, but what I said was never intended to describe actions that would ever be undertaken by me or my company <b>toward</b> <b>you</b> or anyone else. I was definitively wrong and I feel terrible about any distress I have caused you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Clarke {{followed}} Wesley {{in opposing}} a Calvinistic scheme of salvation, preferring instead the Wesleyan-Arminian positions regarding predestination, prevenient grace, {{the offer of}} justification to all persons, the possibility of entire sanctification, and assurance of salvation. [...] "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but <b>toward</b> <b>thee,</b> goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off." ...|$|R

2500|$|O'Donnell {{condemned}} {{many of the}} Bush administration's policies, {{especially the}} war in Iraq and the resulting occupation. She also questioned the official explanation {{for the destruction of}} the World Trade Center, and stating in one episode, [...] "I do believe that it's {{the first time in history}} that fire has ever melted steel". She consistently mentioned recent military deaths and news about the war, and criticized the U.S. media for its lack of attention to these issues compared to media coverage throughout the world. This led to a series of heated exchanges with co-host Hasselbeck, as well as [...] "the most-discussed moment of her professional life." [...] On May 17, 2007, O'Donnell rhetorically asked, [...] "655,000 Iraqi civilians dead. Who are the terrorists? ... if you were in Iraq and another country, the United States, the richest in the world, invaded your country and killed 655,000 of your citizens, what would you call us?" [...] Conservative commentators criticized O'Donnell's statements, saying that she was comparing American soldiers to terrorists. On May 23, 2007, a heated discussion ensued, in part, because of what O'Donnell perceived as Elisabeth Hasselbeck's unwillingness to defend O'Donnell from the criticisms; O'Donnell asked Hasselbeck, [...] "Do you believe I think our troops are terrorists?" [...] Hasselbeck answered in the negative but also stated [...] "Defend your own insinuations." [...] O'Donnell was hurt and felt Hasselbeck had betrayed her friendship: [...] "there's something about somebody being different on TV <b>toward</b> <b>you</b> than they are in the dressing room. It didn't really ring true for me." [...] O'Donnell stated that Republican pundits were mischaracterising her statements and the right-wing media would portray her as a bully, attacking [...] "innocent pure Christian Elisabeth" [...] whenever they disagreed. O'Donnell decided to leave the show that day, but afterwards stated that the reason was not the argument itself, but rather the fact that she saw on the studio monitor that the camera had shown a split screen, with her and Hasselbeck on either side. O'Donnell felt that the show's director and producer [...] "had to prepare that in advance [...] I felt there was setup egging me into that position. The executive producer and I did not gel." [...] O'Donnell and ABC agreed to cut short her contract agreement on May 25, 2007. ABC News reported that her arguments with Hasselbeck brought the show its best ratings ever.|$|E
