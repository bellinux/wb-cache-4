Acclimation improved toluene removal, since biodegradation yield increased from 72 % to more than 91 %. A <b>total</b> <b>consumption</b> was <b>observed</b> after only 4 days culture with acclimated AS, since the rest of the toluene corresponded to gas leak; while in the case of non-acclimated sludge, losses cannot account for all non-degraded toluene.

Background According to economic theory well-being or utility depends on consumption and possibly other inputs such as leisure. However, at the household level <b>total</b> <b>consumption</b> is rarely <b>observed</b> because its collection requires a great deal of survey time. 1 As a result income has been widely used to assess well-being and poverty rates. Because households can use wealth to consume more than income or save to consume less than income, an income-based measure of well-being could yield misleading results for many households. As argued in a number of studies consumption is therefore a better measure than income for assessing material well-being and poverty status (Cutler and Katz, 1991; Jorgenso...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{has become}} increasingly critical in designing and operating wireless networks, especially for mobile ad hoc networks consisting of portable mobile wireless computing/communication devices powered by limited battery capacity. Since the energy required to transmit a given amount of data is a convex and monotonically increasing function of the transmission rate [5, 12], theoretically one can improve energy efficiency by transmitting data at lower rates. Unfortunately, low data rates result in longer transmission duration and larger communication delay at receiving end, which is usually undesirable. How to optimally schedule transmission process to both minimize the <b>total</b> power <b>consumption</b> and <b>observe</b> all time constraints (available times and transmission deadlines) is a challenging and interesting problem. In this paper, we propose a technique to solve the above rate scheduling problem by transforming it into finding the shortest path between two vertices of a two dimensional polygon, which yields an elegant analytical solution and easy-to-prove optimality.

In spite of complement activation, B. burgdorferi was resistant to the nonspecific bactericidal activity of NHS. The addition of human anti-B. burgdorferi IgG to NHS, however, resulted in the complete killing of 297 cells. Bactericidal activity of this serum was abrogated if NHS was immunochemically depleted of C 1, indicating that killing was mediated by the classical pathway.

The positive impact {{of the use of}} a multiphase bioreactor is that the organic phase constitutes a pollutant reservoir and also helps to overcome possible pollutant toxicity. In addition and to overcome the drawbacks of the use of a solid organic phase (high pressure drop and low mass transfer) instead of a liquid organic phase, the considered solid phase was the aqueous. Consequently, silicone oil (polydimethylsiloxane) which showed its relevance for implementation in multiphase bioreactors was used. Promising results were observed from the analysis of toluene in the gaseous phase; for an initial amount of 2 g L(- 1) related to the organic phase, a v/v ratio of 0. 5 of the organic phase to the aqueous agar phase, <b>total</b> toluene <b>consumption</b> was <b>observed</b> in about 9 days, leading to a global biodegradation rate of approximately 3. 1 mg L(- 1) h(- 1), namely in the range of values previously observed in liquid/liquid systems.

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{quantities}} of alcohol and types of alcoholic beverages consumed, and the timing of consumption, in centres participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). These centres, in 10 European countries, are characterised by widely differing drinking habits and frequencies of alcohol-related diseases. Methods: We collected a single standardised 24 -hour dietary recall per subject from a random sample of the EPIC cohort (36 900 persons initially and 35 955 after exclusion of subjects under 35 and over 74 years of age). This provided detailed information on the distribution of alcohol consumption during the day in relation to main meals, and was used to determine weekly consumption patterns. The crude and adjusted (by age, day of week and season) means of <b>total</b> ethanol <b>consumption</b> and consumption according to type of beverage were stratified by centre and sex. Results: Sex was a strong determinant of drinking patterns in all 10 countries. The highest <b>total</b> alcohol <b>consumption</b> was <b>observed</b> in the Spanish centres (San Sebastian, 41. 4 g day(- 1)) for men and in Danish centres (Copenhagen, 20. 9 g day(- 1)) for women. The lowest total alcohol intake was in the Swedish centres (Umea, 10. 2 g day(- 1)) in men and in Greek women (3. 4 g day(- 1)). Among men, the main contributor to total alcohol intake was wine in Mediterranean countries and beer in the Dutch, German, Swedish and Danish centres. In most centres, the main source of alcohol for women was wine except for Murcia (Spain), where it was beer. Alcohol consumption, particularly by women, increased markedly during the weekend in nearly all centres. The German, Dutch, UK (general population) and Danish centres were characterised by the highest percentages of alcohol consumption outside mealtimes. Conclusions: The large variation in drinking patterns among the EPIC centres provides an opportunity to better understand the relationship between alcohol and alcohol-related diseases...|$|R
