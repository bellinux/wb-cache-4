5|$|Some {{fragments}} of the priory travelled further afield. At Hardwick Hall near Sedgefield, a mock ruin was built incorporating sculptured stones brought from the priory. The priory's wealth became <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> of local legends, one of which claimed an underground passage led from the priory to a cave under the hills in which a raven stood guard over a chest of gold.|$|E
5|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold <b>the</b> <b>stuff.</b> He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>stuffed</b> shield with {{multi-layer}} insulation(MLI) {{was designed}} by improving on Al Whipple shield, {{and a series of}} high-velocity impact tests were practiced with a two-stage light gas gun facility at vacuum environment. The damage model of <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> shield with different MLI location by Al-sphere projectile impacting was obtained. The effect of MLI on damage of <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> shield by high-velocity impact was studied. The results indicate when the MLI is located at front side of the first Al-plate, the protection performance of <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> shield is improved with the larger perforation diameter of the first Al-plate and more impact kinetic energy dissipation of the projectile. When MLI is arranged at back side of the first Al-plate, the expansion of the secondary debris cloud from projectile impacting the first Al-plate is restrained, it is not good to improve the protection performance of <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> shield. When MLI is arranged at front side of <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> wall, <b>the</b> perforation size of <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> wall increases; when MLI is arranged at front side of the rear wall, the distribution range of crater on the rear wall decreases...|$|R

5|$|In <b>The</b> <b>Stuff</b> of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E

DDOSing the CIA website, stealing customer data and posting it online just for shits and giggles is not a good thing.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's 10-year {{campaign}} in Asia, and the Macedonian {{conquest of the}} Persian empire, were to become <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> of legend. The Macedonian army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule {{over most of the}} territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the Macedonian army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted by years of hard campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.|$|E
50|$|Masala dosa is <b>stuffed</b> dosa. <b>The</b> {{two parts}} are the dosa and <b>the</b> <b>stuffing.</b> <b>The</b> dosa {{is made in}} the usual way by soaking rice and lentils {{overnight}} in water and then grinding it to a batter. <b>The</b> <b>stuffing</b> is made from boiled potatoes with a seasoning of mustard seeds and garnishing of grated coconut, coriander, and lemon juice.|$|R

5|$|All these bands {{played a}} part in {{developing}} the overall look and sound of glam metal during the early 1980s. In 1985, many more commercially successful glam metal albums began to appear. Mötley Crüe released Theatre of Pain, Ratt's second album Invasion of Your Privacy, Dokken's third album Under Lock and Key, Stryper's first release Soldiers Under Command, Bon Jovi's second release 7800° Fahrenheit, and Autograph's second album That's <b>The</b> <b>Stuff.</b> Los Angeles continued to foster the most important scene around the Sunset Strip, with groups like London, which had originally formed as a glam rock band in the 1970s, and had seen future members of Mötley Crüe, Cinderella and Guns N' Roses pass through its ranks, finally releasing their début album Non Stop Rock in 1985 as well.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and <b>The</b> <b>Stuff</b> of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E
50|$|After {{releasing}} Excuse My French, Salama went on {{to release}} another film in 2014, Made in Egypt. This film focuses on {{a little girl and}} her desire for her stuffed animal and her older brother to switch bodies so <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> animal could inhabit her brother's body. The little girl gets her wish and the plot continues with the brother being mischievous in <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> animal's body, while <b>the</b> <b>stuffed</b> animal does much more in the brother's body than he was doing in it.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, I. C. Filitti {{worked with the}} {{formerly}} Junimist tribune Convorbiri Literare, which published fragments of his research on Maiorescu (1922) and novelist Costache Negruzzi (1923). Filitti subsequently {{turned his attention to}} some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to the debate surrounding the historicity of Negru Vodă (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> of legend, concocted by the 17th-century Wallachian Lord Matei Basarab. The next year, he returned to social history, with the book Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc ("Social Classes in the Romanian Past"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, on one hand, and the Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had no concept of knighthood, as all boyars were defined by their demesnes.|$|E

The casing for <b>the</b> <b>stuffing</b> is <b>the</b> stomach sack and larger intestines. These are flushed many times with water to clean them.|$|R

25|$|The {{private sector}} {{partners}} {{pulled out of}} the Plains Upgrader because upgrading heavy oil at that time was a risky financial proposition. To be economic, these projects rely on substantial differences in pricing ("differentials") between light and heavy crude oil. Heavy oil is worth less than light oil; the question is, How much less? Unless upgraded oil fetched considerably more per barrel than the less attractive heavy oil, the upgrader would not make money on processing <b>the</b> <b>stuff.</b>|$|E
25|$|Husky's {{move into}} the area spurred {{drilling}} and production. Within two years of Husky's arrival, there were oversupplies of heavy oil and shortages of storage space. Producers solved the problem by storing the oil in earthen pits holding up to 16,000 cubic metres each. For a while Husky bought the oil by weight rather than volume since it was clogged with earth, tumbleweed and jackrabbits. The company had to strain and remeasure <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> before it could begin refining.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Hydro-Balanced <b>Stuffing</b> Box is a seal {{assembly}} for polished rod pumping installations commonly used in oil and gas pumping well installations to contain produced well fluids. <b>The</b> improved <b>stuffing</b> box was developed and patented by Harold H. Palmour of The Palmour Group of Livingston, TX. <b>The</b> <b>stuffing</b> box is designed to {{reduce the incidence of}} seal leakage and to utilize an environmentally safe fluid, so that if there is any leakage, environmental damage is reduced or eliminated. The unit was tested on two wells at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center. During the test period, the performance of <b>the</b> <b>stuffing</b> box was measured by monitoring the pressure on the tubing and the inner chamber with a Barton Two-pen recorder. The amount of safe fluid consumed, fluid leakage at the top of <b>the</b> <b>stuffing</b> box, pressure supplied from the nitrogen bottle, ambient temperature, and polish rod temperature was recorded. <b>The</b> <b>stuffing</b> box is capable of providing a better seal between well fluids an d the environment than conventional stuffing boxes. It allows the polished rod to operate cooler and with lubrication, extending the life of the packing elements, and reducing the amount of attention required to prevent leakage...|$|R
