500|$|In the 90-minute, one-act play, lawyer Amir Kapoor and {{his wife}} Emily host an Upper East Side dinner. Amir is an American-born, Muslim-raised Manhattan mergers and {{acquisitions}} lawyer, while Emily is an up-and-coming artist who focuses on Islamic themes in her art. Amir has cast aside his Muslim heritage {{for the sake of}} his career and serves as Emily's muse, who has an affinity for Islamic artistic traditions. Prior to the dinner, Amir, who is on the partner track, becomes involved in a controversial case. Amir's assimilated nephew, Abe (born Hussein Malik), has concerns regarding the propriety of the arrest of a local imam who is imprisoned on charges that may be trumped-up of financing terrorist-supporting groups, leading Amir to question whether it is religious persecution. Emily encourages the reluctant Amir to appear in court in support of the imam, in an unofficial capacity that gets mentioned in The New York Times. The case becomes dinner conversation when he hosts Jory, a colleague from work, and her husband, Isaac, who is Emily's Jewish art dealer. In all, the dinner <b>table</b> <b>assembly</b> includes an ex-Muslim, an African-American, a Jew and a WASP dining over the topic of religious faith. The conversation touches upon [...] "Islamic and Judaic tradition, the Quran and the Talmud, racial profiling and September 11 and the Taliban and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Benjamin Netanyahu" [...] as tensions mount. When Amir admits he felt a [...] "blush of pride" [...] on September 11th, and holds secret animosity toward Israel, his friends are disgusted. Jory and Amir leave the apartment to get a bottle of champagne. It is revealed that Isaac and Emily have had an affair in the past, and that he is secretly in love with her. Jory and Amir return just as Isaac is about to kiss Emily. It is revealed that Jory has been selected as partner in the law firm over Amir, in part because of his presence at the imam's trial, and in a rage he calls her [...] "nigger". Jory and Isaac depart, the status of their relationship uncertain after Isaac's infidelity has been revealed. Emily confesses her affair with Isaac and Amir beats her. Abe stumbles into the apartment and finds him standing over her. The play jumps ahead a period of time. Amir is packing his belongings and preparing to leave the apartment. Emily brings Abe over for legal advice. He was questioned by the FBI after his friend expressed a Jihadist sentiment at a Starbucks. Amir warns Abe to be more cautious, but Abe flies into a fit of rage, saying that the West has [...] "disgraced" [...] Islam, but that they will take it all back one day. He storms out. Amir tries to reconcile with Emily, but she leaves.|$|E

40|$|The {{software}} of robotic assistants {{needs to}} be verified, to ensure its safety and functional correctness. Testing in simulation allows {{a high degree of}} realism in the verification. However, generating tests that cover both interesting foreseen and unforeseen scenarios in human-robot interaction (HRI) tasks, while executing most of the code, remains a challenge. We propose the use of belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents in the test environment, to increase the level of realism and human-like stimulation of simulated robots. Artificial intelligence, such as agent theory, can be exploited for more intelligent test generation. An automated testbench was implemented for a simulation in Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo, of a cooperative <b>table</b> <b>assembly</b> task between a humanoid robot and a person. Requirements were verified for this task, and some unexpected design issues were discovered, leading to possible code improvements. Our results highlight the practicality of BDI agents to automatically generate valid and human-like tests to get high code coverage, compared to hand-written directed tests, pseudorandom generation, and other variants of model-based test generation. Also, BDI agents allow the coverage of combined behaviours of the HRI system with more ease than writing temporal logic properties for model checking...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{accompany}} the increasing variety of costumers' demands, manufacturers tend to produce different models of the same product on an assembly line by introducing group assembly (GA) design concepts that improve the flexibility of assembly systems. Generally, when the demand {{for a set of}} similar products is relatively low and the set-up time is significant, the beneficial effects of the task repeatability of the straight line configuration are difficult to achieve. As a consequence, the fixed-point assembly philosophy is often preferred. This paper addresses the application of a mixed-model assembly balancing problem to an assembly-to-order environment in the case of low production rates and large number of tasks. The aim of this work is to propose an alternative design procedure for the balancing of semi-automated and mixed-model assembly systems under low product demand effects by the application of multi-turn circular transfers, such as a multi-stations rotating table. This layout configuration permits a job enlargement for human operators and, at the same time, provides an increment in task repeatability through the work-pieces assembling by increasing the number of the turns of the transfer. Finally, the developed heuristic procedure is tested on a simple rotating <b>table</b> <b>assembly</b> cell, a partial representation of a complete assembly system of domestic air compressors...|$|E

Při měření dochází k výraznému zkreslení snímaných veličin vlivy okolí, což způsobuje chyby při vyhodnocování daných veličin. Tento problém je řešen pomocí speciálního vybavení zkonstruovaného na KTO. The {{contribution}} is aimed to cutting force measuring at machine tools realised by dynamometers. Measured values are distorted by noise from external influences. The distorsion might cause errors in measured values analysis. This problem is solved using {{a specially designed}} equipment that was designed at the Departement of Machining Technology. The first figure shows the chosen profile and its shape. The second figure represents the main dimensions of the measuring table and gives some information about parts of the measuring table. The 3 -D CAD model of the table is in the figure 3. The parts used for the table are in the figure 4. The fifth figure shows the process of <b>table</b> <b>assembly.</b> A part of frame is showed up left. Mounted wheels and full frame is up right. The whole table with unfinished shielding is down left. The finished table is down right. The measuring system placed into the measuring table is in the figure 6 (The piezoelectric dynamometer KISTLER {{is placed in the}} workspace of CNC milling machine MCV 750 A). An example of unshielded measured data is in the figure 7. The left graph shows full behaviour of measured force which was obtained by a weight. The right graph shows the scaled part of measured data. This part was chosen from stabilized section of force behaviour. An example of shielded measured data is in the figure 8. The left graph shows full behaviour of measured force. The right graph shows the scaled part of measured data. This part was chosen from stabilized section of force behaviour. The table one displays the need values for evaluation of measured data. Minimal value of the force is in the second column. Maximal value is in the next column. Mean value of the force is in the fourth column. Difference between maximal and minimal value is in the next column. The last column contains the maximal difference from mean value represented in percents. The main aim of experiment was successfully done. The difference from mean value was reduced by 14 %. This reduction leads to increase of accuracy of measuring and evaluating the data...|$|E

[...] Recognizing that {{the most important factor in}} reducing assembly costs was the minimization of the number of separate parts in a product, he introduced three simple criteria {{which could be used}} to determine theoretically whether any of the parts in the product could be eliminated or combined with other parts. These criteria, together with <b>tables</b> relating <b>assembly</b> time to various design factors influencing part grasping, orientation and insertion, could be used to estimate total assembly time and to rate the quality of a product design from an assembly viewpoint.
