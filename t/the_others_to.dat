5|$|Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) {{talks to}} <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> {{try to get}} a sense of Shane's actions. He later speaks to Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) about Shane's erratic behavior, his {{suspicion}} that Shane had killed Otis to escape a walker horde, and his fear Shane may kill someone else soon. As Beth's condition worsen, Lori asks Daryl (Norman Reedus) to drive into town to check on Rick, but Daryl refuses, saying his days of searching for someone are over. Lori opts to go alone, but en route, her car hits a walker and is overturned.|$|E
5|$|The group {{agrees that}} Randall is an {{imminent}} threat, and Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) believes {{he should be}} executed but waits until sunset. Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn) finds most of the group agree with Rick's decision, and attempts {{to change their minds}} by appealing to their humanity, civilization and morality. Most agree with Rick's choice for various reasons, but Shane (Jon Bernthal) agrees to support Dale should he be able to convince <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> change their minds.|$|E
5|$|The {{group who}} {{had watched the}} {{departure}} of the trains {{from the top of the}} chimney near the Liverpool tunnel, meanwhile, had been forgotten in the confusion, and were unable to get down from their vantage point. Eventually at around 8.00pm John Harrison, a teacher of gymnastics and swordsmanship, lowered himself down the rope hand-over-hand, and coaxed <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> follow him down in the same manner. The angry group then set out in search of the worker who had been supposed to bring them down.|$|E

5|$|The museum {{intended}} to keep {{a few of the}} animals and sell <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> finance its operations, but Mildred Compton returned from a visit to the 1973 National Carousel Roundtable convinced that it should instead restore all of them and recreate the working carousel in its planned new building. But no space had been allocated to allow the display of such a large exhibit, requiring the plans to be adjusted. Columns required in the original layout were removed to allow the carousel's installation on the fifth floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear guard}} is {{consumed}} by the Angels, and they trap the survivors at the highest point of the cave, right underneath the hull of the Byzantium.

5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's {{injuries}} were severe, and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> kill him to end his pain. When {{he was able to}} travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for {{much of the rest of}} the year.|$|E

This leads to an interesting situation where each wants to dare, but only if <b>the</b> <b>other</b> might chicken out.|$|R
5|$|After news of {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached the Indies in early August 1945, {{followed}} by the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August, {{it was evident that}} Japanese control was weakening. Sudirman led a break out from the camp in Bogor. Although his fellow internees wanted to attack the Japanese soldiers, Sudirman convinced them against it. After ordering <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> their hometowns, Sudirman made his way to Jakarta and met with President Sukarno, who asked him to lead resistance against Japanese forces in the city. Unfamiliar with Jakarta, Sudirman refused, instead offering to lead forces in Kroya. He left for his former command on 19August 1945. At the same time, Allied forces {{were in the process of}} retaking the Indonesian archipelago for the Netherlands. The first British forces arrived on 8September 1945.|$|E
5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger than <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> indicate {{the entrance to the}} main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with a hammer representing industry and a female figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E
5|$|At that point, {{the party}} reunites with Zola, who {{supplies}} a Mechat {{for them to}} pursue Nene. As the party goes after Nene in the Mechat, Nene initiates an ancient machine that splits the world into two hemispheres, with thousands of isolated cubes floating between the halves. The party follows Nene to the Primitive Cube {{at the core of}} the transformation. The party journeys through the cube eventually defeating General Szabo and ultimately engaging Nene. As the party weakens Nene, it is revealed that Zola was working for Nene all along, and she was the voice that told <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> swallow the spheres. When Zola was too weak to defend herself, Nene had given her a shadow and sent her to Jibral as a spy. Zola betrays and kills Nene choosing her friends over him.|$|E
50|$|Two {{systems are}} before the world;... One looks to {{increasing}} {{the necessity of}} commerce; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> increasing <b>the</b> power to maintain it. One looks to underworking the Hindoo, and sinking {{the rest of the}} world <b>to</b> his level; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> raising <b>the</b> standard of man throughout the world to our level. One looks to pauperism, ignorance, depopulation, and barbarism; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>to</b> increasing wealth, comfort, intelligence, combination of action, and civilization. One looks towards universal war; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> towards universal peace. One is the English system; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> we may be proud to call the American system, for it is the only one ever devised the tendency of which was that of elevating while equalizing the condition of man throughout the world.|$|R

After heated discussion, the crew decide the {{creature}} {{must be in the}} air ducts. Dallas enters the ducts, intending to force the alien into the airlock, but it ambushes him. Lambert implores <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> abandon ship and escape in its small shuttle. Now in command, Ripley explains that the shuttle will not support four people and pushes to continue with Dallas' plan of flushing out the alien.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{they meet}} a rabbit named Cowslip, who invites {{them to join}} his warren. At first Hazel's group are {{relieved}} to finally {{be able to sleep}} and feed well â€“ all except for Fiver who senses only death there. When Bigwig is nearly killed in a snare, the group realize that the new warren is managed by a farmer who protects and feeds the rabbits, but also harvests a number of them for their meat and skins. The residents of the new warren are simply using Hazel and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> increase their own odds of survival. Fiver {{and the rest of the}} group work together to rescue Bigwig from a snare, then continue on their journey, along with a rabbit from the new warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after his doe is killed in a snare.|$|E
5|$|Flying at Benalla was {{hampered}} by bad weather, and the runway was unusable from September to November 1941, necessitating the detachment of over 250 personnel to Essendon, home of No.3 EFTS, {{to continue their}} training. In October 1941, six airmen of No.11 EFTS were court-martialled for mutiny. Their main grievance was having to undertake guard duty at night and attend parades at 7:15am {{in addition to their}} regular ground support work. One of the men was found guilty of incitement and the other five for failing to report their knowledge of the matter to the commanding officer. The former was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> between five and six months detention; all were discharged from the Air Force. On 11December 1941, one of the school's Tiger Moths made a crash landing in a field and struck four people on the ground, killing two and injuring the others; the two pilots were uninjured. The outbreak of war in the Pacific saw slit trenches being dug at the base.|$|E

5|$|Giles' dream {{begins with}} Giles {{swinging}} a watch {{in front of}} Buffy. They are in Giles' apartment, which has been stripped of furniture but for a chair and a bed. She laughs, and Giles' dream cuts to a family scene with Buffy and his girlfriend Olivia at a fairground. Quicker than <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> understand that something is wrong, he confronts Spike, who is posing for a photo-shoot in his crypt. In The Bronze, he meets Anya failing as a stand-up comic, and Willow and Xander (with a bloody chest wound), who warn him of their attacker. He breaks into song, giving {{suggestions on how to}} deal with what hunts them, but when the sound system breaks down, he crawls backstage to trace a wiring fault. He begins to realize his pursuer is the First Slayer, just as she scalps him.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen had {{continued}} their journey to Norway while Scharnhorst was immobilized. At 14:45, the ships {{were attacked by}} five Whirlwind fighter-bombersâ€”German fighters beat them back. Several more air attacks followed {{over the next two}} hours, though without success for the British. At 16:17, five British destroyers attempted to torpedo the German ships, but heavy fire from Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen mauled one and forced <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> turn away. Near Terschelling, Gneisenau struck a mine that did minor damage to the hull, though the explosive shock damaged one of her three turbines. Her captain ordered the ship to stop while temporary repairs were conducted, which lasted for about 30minutes. By 03:50 on 13February, the ship had reached Helgoland.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Eliminators incarcerate the fairies at the Abracatraz Prison and put Timmy's {{friends and}} family in the same cell with Timmy's godparents and Jorgen.

Timmy's friends, enemies, family, and the fairies defeat Eliminators with a combined magical attack and have a reunion with Timmy, which is interrupted when The Darkness tries to inhale him. The second wand produces no effect, and Timmy realizes he has no other choice, so he sacrifices himself into The Darkness, after sharing a kiss with his long-term crush Trixie, leaving <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> mourn.|$|E

5|$|New Multitudes is a Woody Guthrie tribute album {{performed}} by Jay Farrar, Will Johnson, Anders Parker, and Jim James {{to commemorate the}} 100th anniversary of Guthrie's birth, released through Rounder Records on February 28, 2012. The project was initiated by Woody's daughter Nora Guthrie to have Farrar add music to her father's lyricsâ€”specifically, his earliest songwriting years in Los Angeles. Over {{the course of several}} years, he invited <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> collaborate and recorded at a variety of locations across the United States. Each artist wrote music to lyrics that inspired him and presented it to the collaborators for recording. The result is an album with diverse musical genres that has garnered positive reviews from critics for its varied styles and instrumentation. The quartet promoted the album with a small promotional tour that took them to record stores, radio programs, theaters, and folk festivals. The group has plans for releasing a second volume.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May {{the final}} order was received, {{although}} due to shipping losses {{it was not}} possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
