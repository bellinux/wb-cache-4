50|$|In {{national}} {{rather than}} international racing, sports car {{competition in the}} 1950s and early 1960s tended to reflect what was locally popular, with the cars that were successful locally often influencing each nation's approach <b>to</b> <b>competing</b> <b>on</b> the international stage.|$|R
5|$|Athletes will {{sometimes}} become citizens {{of a different}} nation so {{they are able to}} compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>on</b> the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E

5|$|Chambers {{was cleared}} <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>on</b> 10 June 2006, {{although}} his return {{was dependent on}} an agreement to repay prize money he won while using banned substances.

5|$|The 1943 Alabama Crimson Tide {{football}} team was {{to represent the}} University of Alabama in the 1943 college football season; however, the season was canceled due {{to the effects of}} World War II. In February 1943, the Army instituted a policy that prohibited their cadets from participation in intercollegiate athletics. Unsure if a season would occur, head coach Frank Thomas proceeded through spring practice as if it would be played. By summer, only two Alabama players were available <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>on</b> the squad {{as a result of the}} Army prohibition on its trainees competing in intercollegiate athletics, and on August 23, 1943, the University announced its decision to cancel the 1943 season. The cancellation marked only the third time since the inaugural 1892 season that Alabama did not field a {{football team}}.|$|E
50|$|Differentiation {{primarily}} affects performance through reducing directness of competition: As the product becomes more different, categorization becomes {{more difficult and}} hence draws fewer comparisons with its competition. A successful product differentiation strategy will move your product from <b>competing</b> based primarily <b>on</b> price <b>to</b> <b>competing</b> <b>on</b> non-price factors (such as product characteristics, distribution strategy, or promotional variables).|$|R

5|$|The faction {{was created}} to feud with wrestlers {{who had been a}} part of the {{original}} Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion in the 1990s. WWE revived ECW as a third brand in 2006, and hired several former ECW wrestlers â€“ the ECW Originals â€“ <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>on</b> the brand. In early 2007, the New Breed was created when Vince McMahon, the WWE chairman, touted Burke and Cor Von as the epitome of the new ECW, while insulting the ECW Originals.

5|$|After Shelton Benjamin won a {{match against}} Super Crazy on the December 4, 2006, edition of Raw, Haas {{came out to}} {{celebrate}} his win with a bewildered Benjamin. Haas and Benjamin announced the return of The World's Greatest Tag Team on the December 11, 2006 edition of Raw, and they defeated The Highlanders in their return match. They then started a feud with Cryme Tyme. They continued <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>on</b> Raw through the start of 2007, facing teams including John Cena and Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair and Carlito. In mid-2007, The World's Greatest Tag Team feuded briefly with The Hardys in storyline; at the One Night Stand pay-per-view on June 3, 2007, they challenged The Hardys for the WWE World Tag Team Championship in a ladder match but were unsuccessful. The team broke up once again when Benjamin moved to the ECW brand on November 20, 2007.|$|E
5|$|By August, the {{prospect}} of Alabama fielding a football team for the 1943 season was in doubt. On August 17, coach Thomas spoke to a civic group in Birmingham and stated {{he did not think}} the school would field a team in 1943 due to the unwillingness of the Army to change their policy that prohibited their cadets from participating in intercollegiate athletics. On August 23, 1943, the University Physical Education and Athletics Committee officially canceled the 1943 season. The decision was made at that time because only two Alabama players were available <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>on</b> the squad. As the season was canceled, coach Thomas spent his time leading war bond drives and serving as president of the Tuscaloosa Exchange Club during the time the season was originally scheduled. The cancellation marked only the third time since 1892 that Alabama did not field a football team. The only other seasons the Crimson Tide did not field teams were in 1898 due to University policy that prohibited athletic teams from traveling off campus to compete and again in 1918 due to the effects of World War I.|$|E
50|$|After winning {{his first}} Grand Slam title, Sock {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>competing</b> <b>on</b> the Challenger Tour.

5|$|During the Jeopardy! round, {{except in}} {{response}} to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response {{in the form of a}} question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>on</b> a future show.|$|E
5|$|In late August, at the 2006 U.S. National Championships, Liukin {{successfully}} defended her all-around, {{beam and}} bars titles, becoming a two-time senior national champion. She {{was named to}} the U.S. team for the 2006 World Gymnastics Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, and was expected by many to be a strong contender for the all-around title. However, because of an ankle injury sustained in training before the competition began, she was only able <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>on</b> one event, the uneven bars. In spite of her injury, in the qualification round, Liukin's bars set earned a 16.2, the highest score of any competitor on any apparatus in the meet. Her bars routine in team finals scored a 15.7 and helped the U.S. team win the silver medal. Liukin also qualified for the event finals on bars, where she took a small step on her dismount and finished with a 16.05, earning a silver medal behind Britain's Beth Tweddle.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan then won {{his third}} Irish Masters title, by {{defeating}} Matthew Stevens 10â€“8. He then missed the China Open on medical grounds; {{for which he}} was criticised by Anthony Hamilton, who said that O'Sullivan had a duty to promote the sport overseas. In the World Championship, O'Sullivan lost to Peter Ebdon in the quarter-final. From 2â€“8 down, Ebdon began a comeback and eventually won 13â€“11, by playing in an exceptionally determined and dogged style, with many observers accusing him of deliberate slow play to disrupt O'Sullivan's fast game. After the match, O'Sullivan indicated to the press that he was unlikely to compete in the following season, and would perhaps even retire from the sport altogether. O'Sullivan participated in the Premier League. After finishing third in the table after the league stage, O'Sullivan defeated Hendry 5â€“0 in the semi-finals, and Williams 6â€“0 in the final. In September 2005, he announced that he would play a truncated 2005/2006 season, spending some time playing eight-ball pool in the United States, having been chosen <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>on</b> the elite International Pool Tour.|$|E
