5|$|From its foundation, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery could {{administer}} estates, {{due to its}} {{jurisdiction over}} trusts. While the main burden in the 16th century fell on the ecclesiastical courts, their powers over administrators and executors was limited, regularly necessitating <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery's involvement. Before the Statute of Wills, many people used feoffees to dispose of their land, something that fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Lord Chancellor anyway. In addition, in relation to the discovery and accounting of assets, the process used by <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery was far superior to the ecclesiastical one; as a result, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery was regularly used by beneficiaries. The common law courts also had jurisdiction over some estates matters, but their remedies for problems were far more limited.|$|E
