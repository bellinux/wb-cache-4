5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help confirm the identify of the mushroom: a drop of dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution will turn <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> pale red whereas nitric acid (HNO3) on <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> produces orange-yellow; a solution of Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) applied to the flesh results in a pale grey color.|$|E
5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic in using <b>the</b> <b>tubes,</b> issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not {{accepted in the}} United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of vacuum tubes was heavily waning {{in the face of}} the rise of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines. Kates went on to a distinguished career in Canadian engineering, but did not return to working on vacuum tubes or computer games.|$|E

30|$|From the Eq.  4, we {{know the}} {{resonance}} frequency of <b>the</b> quarter-wavelength <b>tube</b> merely depends {{on the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> <b>The</b> longer <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>the</b> lower frequency.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a Z-shaped tube with open ends, filled with a liquid, and set {{on top of a}} spinning table.

5|$|Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a {{kind and}} loving boy living in poverty with his parents (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) and four {{bedridden}} grandparents. They all rely on his father for income, employed at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting the caps on <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> However, Mr. Bucket eventually loses his job because the factory replaced him with a machine that puts the caps on <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> Down the street is Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory, which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) worked for Wonka before the termination.|$|E
5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) of T.tabacinus are {{club-shaped}} {{and measure}} 23.5–37.0 by 8.5–13.0μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} inner surface of <b>the</b> <b>tubes)</b> are 45.0–60.0 by 6.5–12.5μm, lanceolate (lance-shaped) to narrowly fusoid-ventricose (enlarged {{in the middle and}} somewhat spindle-shaped). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the outer edges of <b>the</b> <b>tubes)</b> are absent. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) form the reticulations on the stem; they are usually club-shaped and measure 21.0–40.5 by 6.5–10.5μm.|$|E
5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> A1 and A2, through which water is streaming {{back and forth as}} shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction as}} the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through <b>the</b> <b>tubes,</b> both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tube</b> foot rows are on {{the oral}} side of the rays. Each ray has two <b>tube</b> foot rows. <b>The</b> <b>tube</b> foot rows are {{attached}} to the rays by ambulacral grooves. <b>The</b> <b>Tube</b> Foot Rows use a chemical adhesive to stick to surfaces instead of suction. <b>The</b> <b>tube</b> foot rows help the sea star stick to its prey, and to bring the prey to its mouth. <b>The</b> <b>tube</b> foot rows also aid in gas exchange. <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> foot rows are sensitive to chemicals enabling the sea star to detect chemical trails left by possible food. <b>The</b> <b>tube</b> foot rows also excrete waste ammonia through diffusion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{experiment}} uses {{a simple}} barometer {{to measure the}} pressure of air, filling it with mercury up until 75% of <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> Any air bubbles in <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> must be removed by inverting several times. After that, a clean mercury is filled once again until <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is completely full. The barometer is then placed inverted on the dish full of mercury. This causes the mercury in <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> to fall down until the difference between mercury {{on the surface and}} in <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is about 760 mm. [...] Even when <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is shaken or tilted, the difference between the surface and in <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is not affected due to the influence of atmospheric pressure.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Sondhauss <b>tube</b> {{operates}} {{in a way}} that is basically similar to the Rijke tube: Initially, air moves towards the hot, closed end of <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> where it's heated, so that the pressure at that end increases. The hot, higher-pressure air then flows from the closed end towards the cooler, open end of <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> <b>The</b> air transfers its heat to <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> and cools. <b>The</b> air surges slightly beyond the open end of <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> briefly compressing <b>the</b> atmosphere; the compression propagates through the atmosphere as a sound wave. The atmosphere then pushes the air back into <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> and <b>the</b> cycle repeats. Unlike <b>the</b> Rijke <b>tube,</b> <b>the</b> Sondhauss <b>tube</b> does not require a steady flow of air through it, and whereas <b>the</b> Rijke <b>tube</b> acts as a half-wave resonator, <b>the</b> Sondhauss <b>tube</b> acts as a quarter-wave resonator.|$|R
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive to olive-brown. The smooth spores are {{somewhat}} oblong to slightly ventricose (fattened in the middle), and measure 10–14 by 4–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} faces of <b>the</b> <b>tubes)</b> are fuse-shaped and ventricose, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14µm.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Navigation aids: [...] <b>The</b> <b>tube</b> {{will include}} a series of {{circumferential}} reflective stripes applied to the inner circumference of <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> located on <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> {{to be used for}} optical pod navigation, and in particular, awareness of the last [...] of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> so pod braking may be safely effected.|$|R
5000|$|Look at {{figure 1}} and {{consider}} gas molecules close to X3 (at the hot end) which {{move in and}} out of <b>the</b> pulse <b>tube.</b> Molecules flow into <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> when <b>the</b> pressure in <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is low (it is sucked into <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> via X3 coming from the orifice and the buffer). At the moment of entering <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> it has <b>the</b> temperature TH [...] Later in the cycle the same mass of gas is pushed out from <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> again when <b>the</b> pressure inside <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is high. As a consequence its temperature will be higher than TH. In the heat exchanger X3 it releases heat and cools down to the ambient temperature TH.|$|R
50|$|Tube Pullers- Used {{to break}} the seal and pull {{expanded}} tubes from a tube sheet. A spear or expanding collet is inserted and engaged into <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> inner diameter. A ram or gun applies force to exert an extracting force on <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> <b>The</b> power to pull <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is generated manually or through an hydraulic pump. The hydraulic pump can be manually, electrically or pneumatically driven. The pulling force required will vary with <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> size and wall, the depth of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> sheet and tube material.|$|R
5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The larvae move around inside <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E
5|$|Interaction between {{nanotubes}} {{or between}} a nanotube and another material may quench or increase PL. No PL is observed in multi-walled carbon nanotubes. PL from double-wall carbon nanotubes strongly {{depends on the}} preparation method: CVD grown DWCNTs show emission both from inner and outer shells. However, DWCNTs produced by encapsulating fullerenes into SWCNTs and annealing show PL only from the outer shells. Isolated SWCNTs lying on the substrate show extremely weak PL which has been detected in few studies only. Detachment of <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> from the substrate drastically increases PL.|$|E
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E

The hyphal {{tissue in the}} hymenophore is inamyloid and bilateral, meaning it diverges downward from the flesh {{toward the edge of}} the hymenophore, away from a central strand. <b>The</b> <b>tubes</b> have scattered cystidia on the walls (pleurocystidia) and abundant cystidia on the edges (cheilocystidia). The hyphae in the cap cuticle are arranged as an ixotrichodermium–long and typically multi-celled, with erect hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Remote afterloading systems provide {{protection}} from radiation exposure to healthcare professionals by securing the radiation source in a shielded safe. Once the applicators are correctly positioned in the patient, they {{are connected to}} an ‘afterloader’ machine (containing the radioactive sources) {{through a series of}} connecting guide tubes. The treatment plan is sent to the afterloader, which then controls the delivery of the sources along the guide tubes into the pre-specified positions within the applicator. This process is only engaged once staff are removed from the treatment room. The sources remain in place for a pre-specified length of time, again following the treatment plan, following which they are returned along <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> to the afterloader.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{gyrotron}} a {{hot filament}} in an electron gun {{at one end}} of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> emits an annular-shaped (hollow tubular) beam of electrons, which is accelerated by a high-voltage anode and then travels through a large tubular resonant cavity structure in a strong axial magnetic field, usually created by a superconducting magnet around <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> <b>The</b> field causes the electrons to move helically in tight circles around the magnetic field lines as they travel lengthwise through <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> At <b>the</b> position in <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> where <b>the</b> magnetic field reaches its maximum the electrons radiate electromagnetic waves in a transverse direction (perpendicular to the axis of <b>the</b> <b>tube)</b> at their cyclotron resonance frequency. The millimeter radiation forms standing waves in <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> which acts as an open-ended resonant cavity, and is formed into a beam, which radiates through a window in the side of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> into a waveguide. The spent electron beam is absorbed by a collector electrode at the end of <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, as mentioned, the {{connection}} {{depends on the}} magnetic field through <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> since <b>the</b> holonomy along a non-contractible curve encircling <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is <b>the</b> magnetic flux through <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> in <b>the</b> proper units. This can be detected quantum-mechanically with a double-slit electron diffraction experiment on an electron wave traveling around <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> <b>The</b> holonomy corresponds to an extra phase shift, {{which leads to a}} shift in the diffraction pattern.|$|R
5000|$|Microtubing is {{inserted}} {{directly into the}} supply tubing, usually without any fittings. The flow is regulated by the inside diameter of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> and <b>the</b> length of tubing used. The smaller the diameter and <b>the</b> longer <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> <b>the</b> greater the friction loss, thus reducing the pressure and flow.

5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or {{dark brown}} {{in color and}} {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like {{the skin of the}} cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the spore print is pale yellow. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have {{dimensions}} of 8–10 by 5–6µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped, two- to four-spored, and measure 24–30 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the inner walls of <b>the</b> <b>tubes)</b> are light yellow brown in color, club shaped, infrequent, and measure 25–38 by 7.2µm; the cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10µm.

5|$|The {{function}} of the Mark 37 director (pictured) was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows on the front), an optical rangefinder (<b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director pictured, the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna {{on the left is}} for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft. The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target.|$|E
50|$|Tube Cutters- Tube Cutters {{are used}} to {{internally}} cut from the inside {{to the outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> behind <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> sheet on one end.
