5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> satellites' low density and their surfaces lying {{close to the edge}} of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|All six Category5s in October and November {{reached their}} intensities {{in the western}} Caribbean, a region that Atlantic hurricanes {{strongly}} gravitate toward late in the season. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> climatology of the area, which sometimes has a high-altitude anticyclone that promotes rapid intensification late in the season, as well as warm waters.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived.

5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Lexical {{differences}} between dialects are often considerable. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which {{had served as}} names for a deceased person.

5|$|The outer {{electron}} configuration of darmstadtium is calculated to be 6d87s2, which obeys the Aufbau principle {{and does not}} follow platinum's outer {{electron configuration}} of 5d96s1. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relativistic stabilization of the 7s2 electron pair over the whole seventh period, so {{that none of the}} elements from 104 to 112 are expected to have electron configurations violating the Aufbau principle. The atomic radius of darmstadtium is expected to be around 132pm.|$|E
5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E

5|$|After hydrogen, helium is {{the second}} lightest and second most {{abundant}} element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, {{which is more than}} 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E

5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
5|$|The South Atlantic High and the South Pacific High both {{influence}} {{the pattern of}} winds in Argentina. Owing to the greater high of the Andes at latitudes north of 40oS, much of Argentina is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. The South Atlantic High transports moisture from the Atlantic Ocean to Argentina. This occurs throughout the year due to the atmospheric pressure being lower on land than in the ocean. Much of the north and central {{parts of the country}} are affected by the South Atlantic High, with a strong influence in the eastern parts than in the west. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern parts being more frequently affected by the South Atlantic High, causing precipitation to decrease westwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{route through}} the station will be busier from December 2014 to 2018 as Thameslink trains serving London Bridge will be {{diverted}} via Herne Hill– an additional four trains per hour in both directions. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> redevelopment of London Bridge that will temporarily close it to Bedford-Brighton trains. The additional trains will not call at Herne Hill; they will run fast between London Blackfriars and East Croydon. It {{would not be}} possible for the 12-car peak trains to call at Herne Hill as the platforms are too short and it would not be viable to use selective door operation as the carriages not on the platforms would foul the junctions.|$|E

The increasing intake during the luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and fatty foods, which occurs naturally and is enhanced during the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher metabolic demand during this phase.

5|$|While RR Telescopii, also {{designated}} Nova Telescopii 1948, {{is often}} called a slow nova, it is now classified as a symbiotic nova system composed of an M5III pulsating red giant and a white dwarf; between 1944 and 1948 it brightened by about 7 magnitudes before being noticed at apparent magnitude 6.0 in mid-1948. It has since faded slowly to about apparent magnitude 12. QS Telescopii is a binary system composed of a white dwarf and main sequence donor star, {{in this case the}} two are close enough to be tidally locked, facing one another. Known as polars, material from the donor star does not form an accretion disk around the white dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of the white dwarf's strong magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of red-billed tropicbird numbers is difficult {{due to the}} remote locations of nesting sites and vast areas of sea they might be found. This bird {{is considered to be}} a least-concern species according to the IUCN. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the range, declination, and numbers of this species, although small, do not meet the criteria required to be considered a vulnerable species. The range of this species is believed to be , with an estimated 3,300 to 13,000 mature individuals. In the western Atlantic, a more precise number was given for the population there in 2000; about 4,000 to 5,000 pairs. The population is declining, mainly due to human exploitation of the bird's environment and predation by invasive species, such as rats. These predators have the potential to drive populations of the red-billed tropicbird into serious decline. It is estimated that this bird experienced a population bottleneck about 450 to 750 years ago, likely due to exploitation by humans. This has resulted in low genetic diversity in this tropicbird, which makes the likelihood of it adapting to sudden environmental changes low. In Mexico and Brazil, it is considered to be threatened.|$|E
