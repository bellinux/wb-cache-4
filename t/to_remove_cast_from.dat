25|$|The {{explanation}} originally {{put forward}} by Ludwig Borchardt, and later expanded upon by other early 20th-century Egyptologists including Junker and Reisner, was that the reserve head served as a ritualistic substitute for the real head of the deceased, in case it was damaged. Another suggestion {{put forward by}} Egyptologist Nicholas Millet was that they served as sculptors' prototypes for making further statues and reliefs of the deceased. Moulds were then taken from the reserve heads in plaster, and the gouges that appear {{on many of the}} heads, the seeming mutilation to the ears and the excess plaster that appears on {{at least one of the}} heads can be explained as the type of damage that would be expected by trying <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> tight-fitting plaster <b>casts</b> <b>from</b> a reserve head.|$|R
50|$|A {{seasoned}} pan has a stick-resistant coating {{created by}} polymerized oils and fats. Seasoning {{is a process}} by which a layer of animal fat or vegetable oil is applied and cooked onto cast-iron or carbon steel cookware. New cookware should be vigorously washed in hot water with a strong detergent <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> any <b>casting</b> oils <b>from</b> the cookware's surface. A light coat of oil is applied and the cookware is placed upside down in an oven above a large pan (to drain for an hour), the pan can now be removed, then the oven set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) and baked for 30 minutes. Some cookware comes pre-seasoned from the factory. A proper cast iron seasoning protects the cookware from rusting, provides a non-stick surface for cooking, and prevents food from interacting with the iron of the pan. However, frequent use of acidic foods such as tomato sauce can remove the seasoning faster and the cookware {{will need to be}} re-seasoned frequently. This can be lessened if initial season is better at polymerizing than standard fats/oils. Enamel-coated cast-iron pans do not need seasoning, as the enamel coating prevents rust in most instances. It is recommended to maintain the seasoning frequently to keep the food from sticking to the iron.|$|R

Egyptologist Roland Tefnin suggested that the heads were ritually mutilated to prevent them from harming the living. Tefnin proposed that the reserved heads were created by a master sculptor, and upon the subject's death the reserve head received a ritualized mutilation to ensure that it could not harm the deceased in the afterlife. He lists the damage at the back of the head, the removal of the ears, the depiction of the deceased with no hair or very short cropped hair and in some cases the carving of a line in the neck representing ritual decapitation as examples. There are problems with this theory however, in that while there was a well-known practice of cutting certain hieroglyphic figures (such as those representing various animals) in tombs to render them harmless to the deceased, this practice never extended to images of the tomb owner. The function of images of the deceased throughout the history of funerary arts in Ancient Egypt was to act as an alternate receptacles for their soul, and [...] "killing" [...] them would be contrary to this purpose. This type of mutilation is not seen in statues placed in later tombs.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} a method of color evaluation which can be used by the customer when reviewing color proofs. The method being proposed here incorporates the use of color compensating (CC) filters when evaluating proofs where an overall color correction is necessary. The color balance among pictures that are to appear in close proximity to each other is a major consideration in publication printing as well as certain aspects of commercial printing. There is a need for an effective means of obtaining good reproductions of individual subjects while maintaining a visual consistency between them. In such cases a deliberate departure from normal color balance for a particular image may be desired. By using CC filtration, the customer is able to evaluate a proof and specify the changes in color balance by physical means. However, once a filter is specified as giving the desired visual effect, it must be quantified as to how much and what kind of changes on film are necessary to achieve the correct result. This study attempted to determine if it was possible to quantify filter selections by means of dry dot etching. Manipulations in color balance on film were made to three levels of dot change in an increasing direction and three levels of change in a decreasing direction. These six levels (A, B, C, -A, -B, -C) were made in the cyan printer of one separation, the magenta of another, and the yellow printer of a third. This gave a total of eighteen samples being produced. The dot size changes were accomplished by dry dot etching overall with the assistance of the Kodak Dry Dot Etching System. A panel of judges was used to determine whether or not there is a correlation between CC filtration and the amount of dot change made to a separation in order to achieve the desired visual match between the reference proof and the sample proof. The judges were given the reference proof and one sample at a time to view. The panel attempted to make a visual match in one of two ways: to choose a filter that would allow the reference proof to match the altered proof, or to choose a filter <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the color <b>cast</b> <b>from</b> the altered proof in order to match the reference proof. The evaluation procedure was followed for all eighteen samples. The correlation coefficients were calculated for each of the three colors changed. The correlation proved to be quite high thereby substantiating the objectives of the filter evaluation method. However upon calculating and plotting the standard deviations of the judges 2 ̆ 7 results, the filter evaluation method proved to be useful when correcting overall color balance only within a certain amount of dot change. The objective of this method was to apply the filter evaluation technique in order to minimize the trial and error approach involved in making color corrections. When applied, this method could result in less waste of labor and materials which in turn results in higher productivity. In the end the separation/correction procedure becomes more cost effective...|$|R

The location, date, and time at which the photograph was taken are also needed by the algorithm. The appearance of the aerial image at a new sun angle is synthesized by compensating for the direct sunlight component in the original image, and then relighting the image with sunlight from the new sun position. Techniques <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>cast</b> shadows are also described.

40|$|Shadow {{detection}} and removal has had {{great interest in}} computer vision especially in outdoor environments. It is an important task for visual tracking, object recognition, and many other important applications. One of the fundamental challenges for accurate tracking is achieving invariance to shadows.

5000|$|Lost-wax casting (also called [...] "investment casting", [...] "precision casting", or cire perdue in French) is {{the process}} by which a {{duplicate}} metal sculpture (often silver, gold, brass or bronze) is <b>cast</b> <b>from</b> an original sculpture. Dependent on the sculptor's skills, intricate works can be achieved by this method. The oldest known examples of this technique are the objects discovered in the Cave of the Treasure (Nahal Mishmar) hoard in southern Israel, and which belong to the Chalcolithic period (4500-3500 BC). Conservative estimates of age from carbon-14 dating date the items to c. 3700 BC, making them more than 5700 years old. Though the process today varies from foundry to foundry, the steps used in casting small bronze sculptures are fairly standardized. (In modern industrial use, the process is called investment casting.) Variations of the process include: [...] "lost mould", which recognizes that materials other than wax can be used (such as: tallow, resin, tar, and textile); and [...] "waste wax process" [...] (or [...] "waste mould casting"), because the mould is destroyed <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the <b>cast</b> item. [...] Lost-wax casting was widespread in Europe until the 18th century, when a piece-moulding process came to predominate.|$|R

We pose the problem in the RGB color space, and we can carry out the same analysis in other Cartesian spaces as well. It is data-driven and adapts to the changing shadow conditions. In other words, accuracy of our method is not limited by the preset values. Furthermore, it does not assume any 3 D models for the target objects or tracking of the cast shadows between frames. Our results show that the detection performance is superior than the benchmark method...|$|R
