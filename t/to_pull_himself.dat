5|$|The event {{opened with}} a tag team match between America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) and the team of Alex Shelley and Michael Shane, who were {{accompanied}} by Traci. The duration of the bout was 11 minutes and 47 seconds. At one point, Storm lifted up Shane, so Harris could dive off the top rope and bash {{him in the chest}} with his forearm. Later, Storm was thrown out of the ring but held on to the top rope. He attempted <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> back in, however, Shelley dropkicked him from inside the ring, knocking him to the outside. AMW won the match after Storm pinned Shelley following a kick to the chin.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{made his}} debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, {{coming off the}} bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against Tooting & Mitcham he once again {{appeared}} as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer {{to his home in}} Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in Lambeth, a hoist rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.|$|E
5|$|Garista, the {{strategist}} for the Niren Corps, attempts to dissuade Niren {{but to no}} avail. The investigation in the fortress {{turns out to be}} more dangerous as the aer begins to turn the fortress into a living weapon to attack the knights. The knights make their way {{into the center of the}} fortress, where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel, and causing the fortress to begin to crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him crumbles. Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> to safety. Leaving his blastia with Yuri, Niren has the knights leave without him.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} found Richard much {{the worse for}} wear, and Trenchard {{certainly}} no better. Richard forgot his purpose, forgot that Blake waited {{for him at the}} Saracen's Head. And now Trenchard seemed <b>to</b> be <b>pulling</b> <b>himself</b> together.|$|R
2500|$|Muawiya and his {{governors}} {{maintained an}} open table {{for people to}} come in and eat. Once an Arab seated {{at the end of the}} room did not hesitate <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> a plate which had been placed in front of Muawiya. So Muawiyah said [...] "You plunder very far!" [...] The Arab replied, [...] "After a year of drought, it is necessary to be well placed in order to find pasture!" ...|$|R
50|$|After {{weeks of}} hand-dredging the river (Woods Creek) and a failed {{practice}} attempt using a jet ski for the getaway, {{he changed his}} approach and created a cable pulley system <b>to</b> quickly <b>pull</b> <b>himself,</b> and large bags of cash, upstream in the river using a connected canvas-wrapped inner tube.|$|R
5|$|Rhys {{gives his}} mother her ring {{back and she}} realises that he still loves Vanessa. Rhys {{receives}} a letter from his father, Eddie (Ned Manning), but refuses to open it. Eddie calls the house, but Rhys is short with him. While Rhys is choosing whether to see his father or not, Elaine gives him all the letters he ever wrote to him and tells him to read them first. Rhys later decides to see his father. During Sonya and Toadie's wedding reception, a gas bottle explodes destroying the marquee. Rhys is initially trapped inside, but he manages <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> out. He suffers some minor injuries and broken ribs. Elaine comes to see him {{at the hospital and}} she tells him that she supports his decision to see his father. Rhys discharges himself, against Karl's wishes. He then collapses in the car park and dies from an undetected blood clot.|$|E
5|$|The player plays as Nero {{throughout}} most of the game. He is equipped with the Red Queen sword, Blue Rose revolver, and the powers of his Devil Bringer. The Red Queen features an Exceed Gauge that can be charged up, allowing for subsequent attacks that are more powerful than regular slashes, until the gauge empties. Nero also has the powers of his Devil Bringer, and can use it <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> towards enemies or vice versa. The Devil Bringer may also be used for context-sensitive throw attacks, leading to high damage and various effects depending on the enemy. Nero's Devil Bringer also gains new abilities {{during the course of the}} game, such as being able to detect secret missions or caches of Red Orbs. Nero eventually gains the ability to use Devil Trigger after getting the katana known as Yamato, which increases his Devil Bringer's power, thus changing his Devil Bringer attacks into more powerful versions with different animations.|$|E
25|$|Rescue {{involves}} {{bringing the}} person's {{mouth and nose}} above the water surface. A drowning person may cling to the rescuer and try <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> out of the water, submerging the rescuer in the process. Rescuers should avoid endangering themselves unnecessarily and where possible should provide assistance from a safe position, such as a boat, or by providing flotation or a means of towing from a distance.|$|E
50|$|There {{were usually}} several (even 20) editions of each work. Kasper Niesiecki {{summarizes}} him in following words: A great boast and {{honor of the}} philosophical and theological sciences; {{in which he was}} so excellent that he used <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> after <b>himself</b> opinions of others.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Longdon, with Vanderbank's covert aid, {{had begun}} to appear <b>to</b> have <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> together, {{dropping}} back on his sofa and attending in a manner to his tea. It might have been {{with the notion of}} showing himself at ease that he turned, on this, a benevolent smile to the girl. [...] "But what, my dear, is the objection--?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then it {{occurred}} to him that he was speaking more familiarly than an Englishman would probably expect a yacht-hand <b>to</b> do, and, <b>pulling</b> <b>himself</b> up abruptly, he commenced to lay out the table and pour the coffee.|$|R
25|$|When the XF-11 {{finally came}} to a halt after {{destroying}} three houses, the fuel tanks exploded, setting fire to the aircraft and a nearby home at 808 North Whittier Drive, owned by Lt Col. Charles E. Meyer. Hughes managed <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> out of the flaming wreckage but lay beside the aircraft until he was rescued by Marine Master Sgt. William L. Durkin, who {{happened to be in the}} area visiting friends. Hughes sustained significant injuries in the crash, including a crushed collar bone, multiple cracked ribs, crushed chest with collapsed left lung, shifting his heart to the right side of the chest cavity, and numerous third-degree burns. An oft-told story said that Hughes sent a check to the Marine weekly for the remainder of his life as a sign of gratitude. However, Durkin's daughter denied that he received any money from his rescue of Hughes.|$|E
25|$|With about {{a minute}} left in the round, Chávez hit Taylor {{squarely}} with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Chávez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Chávez back ahead of him. Suddenly Chávez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Chávez' desperate final flurry. Chávez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Chávez with only two seconds to go in the bout.|$|E
25|$|DmC: Devil May Cry is an action-adventure hack and slash video game. Players take on {{the role}} of Dante as he uses his powers and {{weaponry}} to fight against enemies and navigate the treacherous Limbo. Like previous games in the series, Dante can perform combos by attacking with his sword, Rebellion, and shooting with his twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory. New to the series are modifiers to Dante's moveset, known as Angel Mode and Devil Mode, activated by holding down one of the trigger buttons. When in Angel mode, Dante's sword attacks change to the Osiris, a speedy scythe type weapon, whilst Devil mode uses the slower but more powerful axe, Arbiter. These modes also alter Dante's mobility. Using Angel mode allows Dante <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> towards enemies and various points in each level, whilst Devil mode lets Dante pull enemies and objects towards him. Dante is also able to dash across large gaps in Angel mode. All of these moves can be used in conjunction with each other to perform massive combos, which are ranked based on the damage the player makes. When enough power has been gathered, Dante can activate Devil Trigger mode, which slows down time around him and levitates enemies into the air, allowing him to perform much stronger attacks. Like previous games, Dante can collect various types of souls which can be used to recover health, purchase items and upgrade Dante's moveset.|$|E
60|$|He clung crying <b>to</b> the chain, <b>pulling</b> <b>himself</b> up {{from the}} burning of the cone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred and glowed, and as he {{struggled}} the cone dropped, and a rush of hot suffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame.|$|R
50|$|Reno {{retired and}} focused on his art. Pike hadn't {{forgotten}} his vision though. He attempted to kill Warblade and managed to disperse Warblade's molecules with an explosion that also killed Reno's girlfriend, Jules. Reno was able <b>to</b> literally <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> back together and wanted revenge. He tracked Pike to Sarajevo, where they fought again. This time Warblade won and he killed Pike and added the final insult to the dying Pike: even if Pike had killed Warblade, he would have failed his quest, because the WildC.A.T.s had been disbanded for months.|$|R
50|$|As Exodus and Xavier duel telepathically, Exodus forces Xavier to {{face his}} {{greatest}} failures: Legion, his relationship with Cyclops, the devastation of Genosha by Cassandra Nova, and the deaths of Banshee, Thunderbird, and Sophie Cuckoo, among others. As Xavier is about to succumb <b>to</b> Exodus, Xavier <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> together and proclaims {{that he has had}} enough, seemingly throwing back Exodus' attack with a fierce psionic assault.|$|R
500|$|Dynamite Headdy is an action-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Treasure {{and published by}} Sega for the Sega Genesis in 1994. The game follows a puppet named Headdy {{in his efforts to}} stop an evil puppet king from taking over his world. Headdy can throw his head at enemies to defeat them and use it <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> to various areas and move objects. The player can find a wide variety of [...] "heads" [...] which act as power-ups that provide different effects and alter gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Scar plots {{regicide}} and familicide against Simba and Mufasa by luring Simba into a vast gorge, {{where he}} triggers a wildebeest stampede. [...] Notified by Scar that Simba is in danger, Mufasa rushes to his aid and manages to place him safely on a ledge. Weakened and unable <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> {{up the steep}} slope to safety, Mufasa asks his brother for assistance. However, Scar's true nature is revealed and he betrays Mufasa, throwing him into the gorge where he is killed by the fall.|$|E
500|$|Washington lived {{an aristocratic}} lifestyle—fox hunting was a {{favorite}} leisure activity. He also enjoyed going to dances and parties, {{in addition to the}} theater, races, and cockfights. He also was known to play cards, backgammon, and billiards. Like most Virginia planters, he imported luxuries and other goods from England and paid for them by exporting his tobacco crop. [...] By 1764, these luxuries, coupled with a poor tobacco market, left Washington ₤1,800 in debt. He began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> out of debt in the mid-1760s by diversifying his previously tobacco-centric business interests into other ventures and paying more attention to his affairs, especially in the form of buying fewer imported luxuries.|$|E
60|$|The boat at {{one time}} came very near {{drifting}} {{against one of the}} great water wheels which were revolving in the stream. Gerald perceived the danger just in time, and he contrived to turn the head of the boat out towards the centre of the river, and then commanding Rollo and the Swiss boy <b>to</b> row, and <b>pulling,</b> <b>himself,</b> with all his force, he just succeeded in escaping the danger.|$|R
50|$|In college, Williams {{excelled in}} football, basketball, and {{baseball}} and gained {{the reputation of}} being an outstanding athlete. However, in 1910, he fell from a scaffold while painting a house, injured his knees, and was told that he {{would never be able to}} walk again. Williams' persistence, a trait that enabled him to complete several visionary projects during his lifetime, allowed him <b>to</b> recover and <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> through this rough time. That same year, Williams became the director of physical training at Hampton Institute.|$|R
50|$|They {{are left}} to tread water disconsolately. The group resorts to {{removing}} and using their bathing suits to make a rope. After a couple of attempts they manage to get {{one end of the}} rope wrapped around a railing. Instead of having the lightest person climb up, Zach attempts <b>to</b> climb. He <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> up and his fingers brush the gunwale but the makeshift rope rips apart as he is too heavy. The group are now mostly naked and have only a partial rope.|$|R
500|$|Just Cause 2 {{includes}} a grappling hook enabling players to tether objects together. In a high-speed vehicle chase a player {{can use the}} grappling hook to attach the pursuit vehicle to the ground, forcing it to stop and often damaging it by flipping. Players can also tether two enemies together. The grappling hook allows a player <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself,</b> hold onto objects such as walls or helicopters and pull enemies towards Rico. The player has a parachute, which is always ready to be deployed {{even if it was}} already deployed moments earlier. This can be combined with the grappling hook as quick transport, with players [...] "slingshooting" [...] themselves into the air.|$|E
500|$|Presley and Linda Thompson {{split in}} November 1976, {{and he took}} {{up with a new}} girlfriend, Ginger Alden. He {{proposed}} to Alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later, though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again. Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977, [...] "Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> through his abbreviated concerts." [...] In Alexandria, Louisiana, the singer was on stage for less than an hour and [...] "was impossible to understand". Presley failed to appear in Baton Rouge; he was unable to get out of his hotel bed, {{and the rest of the}} tour was cancelled. Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, he stuck to most touring commitments. In Rapid City, South Dakota, [...] "he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk", according to Presley historian Samuel Roy, and unable to [...] "perform any significant movement." [...] Guralnick relates that fans [...] "were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books." [...] A cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how Presley would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his own past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded Smith of Howard Hughes. [...] "Way Down", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, came out on June 6. On the next tour, CBS filmed two concerts for a TV Special, Elvis in Concert, to be aired in October. On the first of these, captured in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, [...] "is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project." [...] He did better on the second night, two days later in Rapid City: [...] "He looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too", though his appearance was still a [...] "face framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks." [...] His final concert was held in Indianapolis, Indiana at Market Square Arena, on June 26.|$|E
2500|$|Uemura had {{developed}} a [...] "self-rescue" [...] device, bamboo poles tied over his shoulders that would span any crevasse into which he fell and allow him <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> out. He planned a very light run, with only a [...] pack plus sled. He kept his gear light by planning to sleep in snow caves, so he would not need a tent. He also skimped on fuel and planned to eat cold food.|$|E
60|$|JOHNNY. [who has <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> together] You {{did it on}} purpose. I wasnt quite myself: I {{needed a}} moment <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> round: thank you.|$|R
60|$|Rather {{tired and}} dispirited in this alien place, he {{wondered}} if he wished himself back. But the moment he actually realised himself at home, and felt the tension of barrenness which it meant, felt the curious and deadly opposition of his wife's will against his own nature, the almost nauseating ache which it amounted <b>to,</b> he <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> together and rejoiced again in his new surroundings. Her will, her will, her terrible, implacable, cunning will! What was there in the female will so diabolical, he asked himself, that it could press like a flat sheet of iron against a man all the time? The female will! He realised now that he had a horror of it. It was flat and inflexible as a sheet of iron. But also it was cunning as a snake that could sing treacherous songs.|$|R
5000|$|At Brookfield Zoo on April 26, 1941, Ziggy {{suddenly}} {{turned on his}} keeper, George [...] "Slim" [...] Lewis. The elephant first struck Lewis {{to the ground with}} his trunk and pulled him beneath his head. Ziggy then tried to gore Lewis, but the keeper dodged each attack by slipping between the elephant's tusks. Eventually, Ziggy lunged so hard that his tusks became lodged in the ground for several seconds. Sensing his chance <b>to</b> escape, Lewis <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> up by grabbing onto Ziggy's ear, then punched the elephant in the eye. With Ziggy momentarily stunned, Lewis jumped into the moat around the elephant's enclosure and climbed to the other side.|$|R
2500|$|Detainees were terrorized by the {{treatment}} of fellow detainees. [...] A military doctor amputated both legs of a Saudi detainee named Abdul Rahman because of frostbite. Kurnaz watched from the neighboring cage as soldiers beat the legless man's fingers off the chain link fence when he tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> up to sit on his toilet-bucket. [...] Dragged out for interrogations with his stumps dangling, he would return with his face bloodied from beatings. Another had frostbite on one finger and a military surgeon amputated all his fingers, leaving only his thumbs. A third complained of a toothache and the dentist pulled his healthy teeth. Wounds and fractured limbs, including fingers broken during interrogations, were left untreated. Kurnaz's health suffered over the years but he [...] "tried to avoid being taken to the doctor at all costs. I wanted to keep my teeth, fingers, and legs." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 11, 1958, a U.S. Air Force Boeing B-47E-LM Stratojet from Hunter Air Force Base {{operated}} by the 375th Bombardment Squadron of the 308th Bombardment Wing near Savannah, Georgia, took off at approximately 4:34 PM and was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom and then to North Africa as part of Operation Snow Flurry. The aircraft was carrying nuclear weapons on board {{in the event of}} war with the Soviet Union breaking out. Air Force Captain Bruce Kulka, who was the navigator and bombardier, was summoned to the bomb bay area after the captain of the aircraft, Captain Earl Koehler, had encountered a fault light in the cockpit indicating that the bomb harness locking pin did not engage. As Kulka reached around the bomb <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> up, he mistakenly grabbed the emergency release pin. The Mark 6 nuclear bomb dropped {{to the floor of the}} B-47 and the weight forced the bomb bay doors open, sending the bomb [...] down to the ground below.|$|E
2500|$|His public {{appearances}} were choreographed {{to avoid the}} press covering his arrival and departure at public events, which would have shown him getting into or out of a car. When possible, his limousine was driven into a building's parking garage for his arrivals and departures. [...] On other occasions, his limo would be driven onto a ramp to avoid steps, which Roosevelt was unable to ascend. [...] When that was not practical, the steps would be covered with a ramp with railings, with Roosevelt using his arms <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> upward. When traveling by train, Roosevelt often appeared on the rear platform of the presidential railroad car. [...] When he boarded or disembarked, the private car was sometimes shunted to {{an area of the}} railroad yard away from the public for reasons of security and privacy. Track 61, a private rail siding underneath the Waldorf Astoria, was also used. When Roosevelt's trains used a ramp and the president was on a publicly known trip, he insisted on walking on the ramp no matter how difficult. In 1940 an elevator was installed.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October 1897, {{an attempt}} by a British force to take the {{strongly}} held Dargai Heights was beaten back, leaving three battalions pinned down under heavy fire from above and unable to withdraw. They were reinforced by the 1st Gordons, who were ordered to advance through the open ground and storm the heights, led by their five pipers. Findlater was wounded before reaching the hillside, with a superficial wound to his left foot and a broken right ankle. Unable <b>to</b> walk, he <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>to</b> a boulder, propped himself up, and continued to play to encourage the advance. The infantry following behind successfully reached the hillside, climbed the heights, and dispersed the defenders.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he glanced}} at his watch and got up with an {{impatient}} shrug. He had forgotten his work while he thought about the girl, and there was much to be done. For one thing, he had come up to see if the smith had tempered some boring tools; and then he must send the Metis river-jacks to float a raft of props down <b>to</b> the mine. <b>Pulling</b> <b>himself</b> together, he set about the work with characteristic energy, but as he walked through the murmuring woods he unconsciously began to sing a romantic ballad he had learned when a boy. Presently, however, he stopped and smiled. It looked as if he were getting sentimental, and one must guard against that kind of thing.|$|R
50|$|Kinnan’s {{recount of}} his bail-out of his bomber {{aircraft}} was harrowing {{even in the}} telling. After taking fire that damaged the aircraft, alighting the #4 engine and wounding the other pilot; the crew immediately began bail-out procedures. Kinnan, the only pilot at the control yoke, maintained as much control of the aircraft as possible to ensure that his crew members were all safely out. Once they were out he put the aircraft into as stable a configuration that he could to maintain altitude and attitude. But the badly damaged aircraft, on fire, lost the right wing and continued to descend. In order to bail-out, Kinnan had {{to make his way}} to the nose hatch. However, the erratic flight of the damaged B-17 required him <b>to</b> crawl and <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> along.|$|R
