5000|$|A jaw {{coupling}} {{is a type}} of general purpose power <b>transmission</b> <b>coupling</b> that also can be used in motion control (servo) applications. It is designed to transmit torque (by connecting two shafts) while damping system vibrations and accommodating misalignment, which protects other components from damage. Jaw couplings are composed of three parts: two metallic hubs and an elastomer insert called an element, but commonly referred to as a [...] "spider". The three parts press fit together with a jaw from each hub fitted alternately with the lobes of the spider. Jaw coupling torque is transmitted through the elastomer lobes in compression.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We examine parallel-plate {{magnetic}} {{photonic crystal}} (MPC) waveguides comprised of a periodic loading with two anisotropic layers and one ferrite layer on each period. It is shown that, {{at a specific}} design frequency 0, parallel-plate MPC waveguides can support a Bloch mode with zero axial group velocity similar to the “frozen mode ” regime of the prototypical 1 -D MPC structure. When the proposed 2 -D structure is illuminated with a properly polarized time–harmonic wave, near unity power <b>transmission</b> (<b>coupling)</b> into the frozen mode occurs, and field strength within the MPC becomes orders of magnitude larger than the incident field strength. The steady-state case is evaluated using both analytical tools and finite elements, while {{the finite-difference time-domain method}} is applied to evaluate the 2 -D MPC transient response.

40|$|Given a {{power grid}} and a <b>transmission</b> (<b>coupling)</b> strength, basin {{stability}} {{is a measure}} of synchronization stability for individual nodes. Earlier studies have focused on the basin stability's dependence of the position of the nodes in the network for single values of transmission strength. Basin stability grows from zero to one as transmission strength increases, but often in a complex, nonmonotonous way. In this study, we investigate the entire functional form of the basin stability's dependence on transmission strength. To be able to perform a systematic analysis, we restrict ourselves to small networks. We scan all isomorphically distinct networks with an equal number of power producers and consumers of six nodes or less. We find that the shapes of the basin stability fall into a few, rather well-defined classes, that could be characterized by the number of edges and the betweenness of the nodes, whereas other network positional quantities matter less.

40|$|In direct {{mechanical}} drive system, coupling of various driven elements is required. Majority of drive elements like gear reducers, lead screws {{and host of}} other components are driven by shaft that is supported by multiple bearings. Due to rigidity of coupling, slight misalignments will be there between a driving and driven shaft. The function of power <b>transmission</b> <b>coupling</b> is transmitting torque from driving shaft to drive shaft along with shaft misalignment. Misalignment in shaft may results into unwanted strains on shaft bearings causing to wear out. Few conventional solutions are available for misalignment problems like Oldham’s coupling and universal joint which have several limitations. These limitations can be overcome with Thompson constant velocity (CV) coupling which offers features like minimizing side loads, higher misalignment capabilities, more operating speeds, improved efficiency of transmission and many more. This paper presents review on constant velocity joints/couplings design and optimization. In this paper the research work of various researchers related to transmission couplings and constant velocity joints is reviewed...|$|E

30|$|To {{accomplish}} the 2030 UN goal {{to end the}} HIV epidemic, new HIV- 1 transmission should be controlled and the potential transmission source identified, especially in stable couples (Cousins 2016). In the famous HPTN 052 prospective research, robust evidence proved {{the efficiency of the}} treatment-as-prevention strategy (TAPS) after removing outside <b>transmission</b> <b>couples</b> (Eshleman et al. 2011). The sustained decrease in genetically-linked <b>transmission</b> in <b>couples</b> has been further proven in a newly published HPTN 052 report (Cohen et al. 2016). Considering the huge population in China, the TASP approach has great significance in public health. A national retrospective analysis using epidemic data supports the HPTN 052 conclusion (Jia et al. 2012), which is the same conclusion made in a recent study in Henan Province (Smith et al. 2015). A recent epidemiological investigation of serodiscordance in Guangxi again supported the efficiency of TASP.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the broadly {{neutralizing}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) specific human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) b 12, 2 G 12, 2 F 5, and 4 E 10 to neutralize recently transmitted viruses {{has not yet been}} explored in detail. We investigated the neutralization sensitivity of subtype B HIV- 1 variants obtained from four primary HIV infection cases and six <b>transmission</b> <b>couples</b> (four homosexual and two parenteral) to these MAbs. Sexually transmitted HIV- 1 variants isolated within the first 2 months after seroconversion were generally sensitive to 2 F 5, moderately resistant to 4 E 10 and b 12, and initially resistant but later more sensitive to 2 G 12 neutralization. In the four homosexual <b>transmission</b> <b>couples,</b> MAb neutralization sensitivity of HIV in recipients did not correlate with the MAb neutralization sensitivity of HIV from their source partners, whereas the neutralization sensitivity of donor and recipient viruses involved in parenteral transmission was more similar. For a fraction (11 %) of the HIV- 1 variants analyzed here, neutralization by 2 G 12 could not be predicted by the presence of N-linked glycosylation sites previously described to be involved in 2 G 12 binding. Resistance to 2 F 5 and 4 E 10 neutralization did also not correlate with mutations in the respective core epitopes. Overall, we observed that the neutralization resistance of recently transmitted subtype B HIV- 1 variants was relatively high.
