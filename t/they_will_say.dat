Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
500|$|... "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] is a [...] "tender" [...] pop power ballad with {{contemporary}} R, soul and lite rock influences, performed {{in an urban}} contemporary style. According to the song's official sheet music, published by Walt Disney Music Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] is set in signature common time and performed at a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute in the key of C major. The Disney Song Encyclopedia author Thomas S. Hischak believes that the song's lyrics are [...] "about following your heart to find your true self", which begin [...] "They'll try to hold you back, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> you're wrong, but they will never understand, no, the journey that you're on." [...] A writer for Barnes & Noble agreed that, thematically, the single [...] "correlates to the film's tale of an inexperienced young adventurer", Milo Thatch, and its diverse cast of supporting characters, all of whom long to follow various dreams of their own as they search for Atlantis. One of its verses reads, [...] "There's something in your soul/That won't be denied/It's the faith to dream that keeps the dream alive/So you still believe {{and you know you}} must go", encouraging listeners to follow their dreams despite others' opinions. Lasting a duration of four minutes, AllMusic cites the song's mood as both [...] "earnest" [...] and [...] "mellow"; Mýa performs it using a [...] "sweet vocal", which spans two octaves from G3 to D♭5. Based on a melody heard only briefly during the film, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] encompasses [...] "soft, contemporary beats" [...] combined with the singer's [...] "dulcet tones" [...] that recall music played in a piano lounge, contrasting with the time period in which the film itself is set. Its production, which has been described as [...] "polished", was handled by Jay Selvester, Robbie Buchanan and Ron Fair.|$|E

2500|$|Jamaican male sexual {{identity}} {{has long been}} defined in opposition to homosexuality. According to Dr. Kingsley Ragashanti Stewart, a {{professor of anthropology at}} the University of the West Indies, [...] "A lot of Jamaican men, if you call them a homosexual, ... will immediately get violent. It's the worst insult you could give to a Jamaican man." [...] Dr. Stewart believes that homophobia influences almost every aspect of life and shapes the everyday language of ghetto youth. [...] "It's like if you say, 'Come back here,' <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>say,</b> 'No, no, no don't say 'come back'.' You have to say 'come forward,' because come back is implying that you're 'coming in the back,' which is how gay men have sex." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Wikinews, Tashi Wangdi, representative to the Dalai Lama, further elaborated his perspective on these views. [...] If a person was to engage in homosexuality, [...] "a person would not be considered as following all the precepts of Buddhist principles. People don’t follow all the principles. Very few people can claim they follow all the principles. For instance, telling a lie. In any religion, if you ask if telling a lie is a sin — say Christian — <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> yes. But you find very few people who don’t at some point tell a lie. Homosexuality is one act, but you can’t say [...] not a Buddhist. Or someone who tells a lie is not a Buddhist. Or someone who kills an insect is not a Buddhist, because there’s a strong injunction against that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sharpton has run unsuccessfully for {{elected office}} on {{multiple}} occasions. Of his unsuccessful runs, {{he said that}} winning office {{may not have been}} his goal, saying in an interview: [...] "Much of the media criticism of me assumes their goals and they impose them on me. Well, those might not be my goals. So <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>say,</b> 'Well, Sharpton has not won a political office.' But that might not be my goal! Maybe I ran for political office to change the debate, or to raise the social justice question." [...] Sharpton ran for a United States Senate seat from New York in 1988, 1992, and 1994. In 1997, he ran for Mayor of New York City. During his 1992 bid, he and his wife lived in a home in Englewood, New Jersey, though he said his residence was an apartment in Brooklyn.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{a severe}} famine {{in the land}} of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, {{travelled}} south to Egypt. On the journey to Egypt, Abram instructed Sarai to identify herself only as his sister, fearing that the Egyptians would kill him in order to take his wife, saying, [...] "I know what a beautiful woman you are. When the Egyptians see you, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>say,</b> 'this is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live. Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you." [...] When brought before Pharaoh, Sarai said that Abram was her brother, and the king thereupon took her into his palace and bestowed upon the latter many presents and marks of distinction. It is possible that Sarai acquired her Egyptian handmaid Hagar during this stay. However, God afflicted Pharaoh's household with great plagues. Pharaoh then realized that Sarai was Abram's wife and demanded that they leave Egypt immediately.|$|E

2500|$|On 24 February 2012, in {{a speech}} in Nabi Sheet for the [...] "remembrance of the fallen martyrs Abbas al-Musawi, Ragheb Harb, and Imad Mughniyah," [...] Hasan Nasrallah said, [...] "I say that the American {{administration}} and the American mentality lacks nothing from Satanism. But that kind of behavior and that kind of mistreatment of holy books [...] and prophets, and the prophets' sanctities, and others' sanctities; this behavior is Israeli and let us say it is Jewish, between quotation marks, - now <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> that this is anti-Semitism - [...] the Holy Quran told us about this people: how they attacked their prophets, and how they killed their prophets, and how they affronted their prophets, and how they affronted Jesus Christ, peace be upon him, and how they affronted Mary, peace be upon her, and how they affronted Allah's great messenger Mohammad, May God exalt and bring peace upon him and his family.

But the talks must be a discussion, not an ultimatum." [...] On 4 November 2007, he declared Israel's intention {{to negotiate with the}} Palestinians about all issues, stating, [...] "Annapolis will be the jumping-off point for continued serious and in-depth negotiations, which will not avoid any issue or ignore any division that has clouded our relations with the Palestinian people for many years." [...] On 29 November 2007, he warned of the end of Israel in case a two-state solution is not eventually found for the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. [...] "If the day comes when the two-state solution collapses, and we face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights (also for the Palestinians in the territories), then, as soon as that happens, the State of Israel is finished", Olmert said {{on the last day of}} the Annapolis Conference. [...] "The Jewish organizations, which were our power base in America, will be the first to come out against us", Olmert said, [...] "because <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> they cannot support a state that does not support democracy and equal voting rights for all its residents".|$|E
2500|$|In 1863 Carson and John Dolbeer {{formed the}} Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company. Eighteen {{years later in}} 1881, as the company {{advanced}} into areas more difficult to log, Dolbeer invented the Steam Donkey Engine which revolutionized log removal, especially in hard to reach areas. At about the same time, Carson {{was involved in the}} founding of the Eel River and Eureka Railroad with John Vance. Before commencing the building of his mansion, Carson said, [...] "If I build it poorly, they would say that I am a damned miser; if I build it expensively, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> I'm a show off; guess I'll just build it to suit myself." [...] In 1884, on the eve of construction of the great home, the company was producing [...] of lumber annually. The milling operations, combined with additional investments as far away as Southern California and at least partial ownerships in schooners used to move the lumber to booming markets on the west coast and all over the globe, {{set the stage for the}} unlimited budget and access to resources the builders would have. Pacific Lumber Company purchased the company in 1950 and maintained milling operations at the original Humboldt Bay site, located bay-side below the house, well into the 1970s. Following the Carson family divestiture of remaining family holdings (including the home) in 1950, the family left the area. The building was purchased for $35,000 in 1950 by local community business leaders, and currently houses the Ingomar Club, a private club, which was named after Carson's Ingomar Theater, itself named for Carson's favorite play Ingomar the Barbarian.|$|E
