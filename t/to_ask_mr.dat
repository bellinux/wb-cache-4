2500|$|At this point, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy {{return to}} Netherfield. Shortly thereafter, Bingley proposes to Jane and is accepted. Lady Catherine, having heard rumors that Elizabeth intends to marry Darcy, visits Elizabeth and demands that she {{promise not to}} accept his proposal. Elizabeth makes no such promise and Lady Catherine leaves, outraged by Elizabeth's {{perceived}} insolence. Darcy, heartened by Elizabeth's refusal to promise that she wouldn't accept such a proposal, again proposes to Elizabeth and is accepted. He visits Longbourn <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bennet for his permission. [...] Elizabeth wants her father to understand {{that she is not}} marrying for money, and it is only after she speaks about Mr. Darcy's true worth that he is happy about the wedding.|$|E
2500|$|In 1867 Restieaux was foreman of a Guano {{excavation}} {{operation at}} McKean Island, in the Phoenix Islands (which {{is now part}} of Kiribati). Towards the end of 1867 he was a passenger on the brig Kamehameka going to Honolulu for a vacation. At this time Ben Pease was the captain of the schooner the Blossom and trading in coconut and coconut oil in the Marshall Islands. As trading was good, in late 1867 Pease sent George Bridges, his mate, to Honolulu <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> C. A. Williams, the owner of the Blossom, to supply another schooner and to engage someone to take charge of the trading station at Ponape atoll (now known as Pohnpei). Williams engaged Restieaux for the position on Ponape and sent the schooner Malolo under Captain Bridges. [...] The Malolo arrived at Mili Atoll on 1 March 1868. Instead of going to Ponape, Restieaux was put in charge of the Mili station. After nine months Williams sold his firm to Glover Dow & Co. of Shanghai. Mr. Williams wrote to Restieaux telling him he was to look to Glover Dow & Co for his pay â€“ Restieaux was never paid as the company became insolvent.|$|E
60|$|As the {{children}} had no more questions <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Temple proceeded to relate what consequences ensued from the building of Bell Franklin's wharf.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upward and On," [...] said Lewis with {{conscious}} neatness, {{and turned}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Bunting Harblow about her little boy's French.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{find that}} some foolish {{people have been}} talking in Barchester about my daughter," [...] said the archdeacon; [...] "and I wish <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Proudie--" ...|$|R
60|$|They {{decided that}} he was <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Hastings <b>to</b> stay a few days at the Grange, and {{then he looked at}} the girl {{somewhat}} diffidently.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have heard}} Miss Murdstone,' said Mr. Spenlow, turning to me. 'I beg <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Copperfield, {{if you have}} {{anything}} to say in reply?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anything {{more that}} you would like <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Holmes?" [...] said Lestrade, whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this {{remarkable}} explanation.|$|E
60|$|Lady Middleton {{could no}} longer endure such a conversation, and {{therefore}} exerted herself <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Palmer {{if there was any}} news in the paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have just}} heard that Miltoun is going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Noel <b>to</b> marry him. People are never mysterious, are they, without good reason? I {{wanted you to}} tell me--who is she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{glad to see}} you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view {{of recent}} occurrences, perhaps I ought <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Hudson <b>to</b> examine its crop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said I, [...] "I {{am going}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Miller <b>to</b> fasten this long tape about your ankles. We mean to take every {{precaution}} {{in order that}} you may not involuntarily or subconsciously move your limbs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Weldon, {{will you}} be kind enough <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ashe, the state school-land appraiser, to please come to my office as soon as convenient?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hardly {{like you}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hackit, dear--he and Mrs. Hackit {{have been so}} very kind to us; they have sent us so many things lately.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} were right <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Simcoe not to repeat his present, Hilda," [...] the General said. [...] "I {{particularly}} noticed the bouquet that you carried last night." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Master Dean {{took his}} departure, after congratulating the {{partners}} on having found such pleasant quarters, and reminding them {{for at least}} the tenth time that they had promised <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Hanson if she would take another lodger.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Eli seated himself, {{and looked}} ponderingly into the fire. [...] "You're right, cap'n," [...] said he. [...] "We'd have to ship some woman {{to take care}} of her. Of course, it wouldn't be no use <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Crumley?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{presently}} Sarah Judd {{came out}} upon the lawn <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Conant's further instructions and this gave Agatha the desired {{opportunity to examine}} her closely. The inspection must have been satisfactory, for an expression of distinct relief crossed the lovely face.|$|R
6000|$|... "If any one {{touched a}} morsel of that sacred timber {{he should be}} banished from Bragton for ever. I want you <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Twentyman {{to come to our}} wedding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you!" [...] she said. [...] "There {{is another}} thing I want <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Jordan. If you get any news of the Shasta, will you come and tell me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{rather a}} long pause for both of them, Clementina asked, [...] "Do {{you think it would}} be nice for me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gregory about things, when I wasn't suttain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I hope so, my dear man," [...] said Mrs. Beale, while Maisie {{wondered}} {{just how}} he would proceed. Before she had time <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Beale continued: [...] "That's not all she came to do, if you please. But you'll never guess the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, yes! She {{was down}} at Matching when poor mamma died. And papa persuaded her to remain afterwards. Of course I will see her." [...] Then the servant was desired <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Finn <b>to</b> come in;--and while this {{was being done}} Lady Cantrip retired.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a very}} sudden call, Miss," [...] said Netta, with a smile. [...] "Captain Wopper wrote a note to me, begging me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs</b> Stoutley <b>to</b> be so good as lend me {{to him for a}} day to help at his house-warming. Here is the letter, Miss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tio Pancho," [...] she said, with {{a charming}} smile, [...] "may I trouble you <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Merriam {{to come out}} {{for just a few}} moments that I may speak with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not now, master,' she said, not {{thinking}} his pugnacity {{in need of}} such respectable examples. 'It would be more to the purpose <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Cavendish Dusautoy's pardon for such very bad behaviour.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Appleby about Link Merwell. He didn't know Link was a criminal. He says if Link shows {{himself up}} here {{he will make}} him a {{prisoner}} and notify us." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{paused for}} a moment, and then she {{positively}} refused. [...] "I cannot bring myself <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Leslie <b>to</b> dine in this house. If she comes to dine with you, of course I shall sit at the table, but she will be sure {{to see that she}} is not welcome." ...|$|R
60|$|I promised <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Hoggarty {{once more}} for the money, and she seemed not to be disinclined. I told him so; and that day he called upon her, his wife called upon her, his {{daughter}} called upon her, and once more the Brough carriage-and-four was seen at our house.|$|R
60|$|He {{listened to}} the details with eagerness, that {{dismissed}} from her mind the sickening apprehension of his knowing of any hidden evil; then, saying he was pressed for time, begged her <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Martindale <b>to</b> let him speak to her on a matter of such importance that he must venture on disturbing her.|$|R
60|$|Having so {{favourable}} an opportunity, {{it occurred}} to me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Omer, before our conversation should be interrupted by the return of his daughter and her husband, whether he knew anything of Martha.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come for you--come for you," [...] Mrs. Church repeated, {{looking down}} at the relics of our little feast. [...] "I was obliged <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ruck's assistance. I was puzzled; I thought a long time." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{occurred}} to Mrs. Milton that if Widgery {{was the man}} for courtly devotion, Dangle was infinitely readier of resource. [...] "I suppose--" [...] she said, timidly. [...] "Perhaps if you were <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dangle--" ...|$|E
60|$|John, however, had by {{this time}} learnt enough of his own {{feelings}} to delay consent till he had written <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Evelyn whether she absolutely objected to his entertaining any future hopes of Sydney, when he should have worked his way upward, as his recent success gave him hopes of doing in time.|$|R
60|$|But Jock only {{waited for}} the {{friendly}} cover of a grand piece of instrumental music <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Evelyn if she had heard from his mother, {{and she was very}} glad to go into details with him, while he was infinitely relieved that the silence was over, and he could discuss the matter with his friends.|$|R
6000|$|One supper-time I ventured <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Mrs</b> Bowater if {{she would}} hand me down a tall, thin, dark-green volume, whose {{appearance}} had particularly taken my fancy. A simple enough request, but surprisingly received. She stiffened all over and eyed the bookcase with a singular intensity. [...] "The books there," [...] she said, [...] "are {{what they call the}} dead past burying its dead." ...|$|R
