40|$|This {{report was}} written {{to provide a}} {{detailed}} summary of a literature survey on ‘the near net shape casting process of centrifugal casting. Centrifugal casting is one potential casting method which could satisfy {{the requirements of the}} LANL program titled Near Net Shape Casting of Uranilm for Reduced Environmental, Safety and Health Impact. In this report, centrifugal casting techniques are reviewed and an assessment of the ability to achieve the near net shape and waste minimization goals of the LANL program by using these techniques is made. Based upon the literature reviewed, it is concluded that if properly modified for operation within a vacuum, vertical or horizontal centrifugation could be used <b>to</b> safely <b>cast</b> <b>uranium</b> for the production of hollow, cylindrical parts. However, for the production of components of geometries other than hollow tubes, vertical centrifugation could be combined with other casting methods such as semi-permanent mold or investment casting. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of the centrifugal <b>casting</b> technique <b>to</b> the production of multiple castings of fuel pins of small diameter and of thin fuel plates was investigated. Fuel pins measuring 0. 185 in. in diameter by 4 1 / 4 in. long of unalloyed uranium and of a uranium- 2 wt. % zirconium alloy were cast successfully in batches of sixteen pins per melt. Sixteen different metals and alloys were used as mold materials. Smaller and longer fuel pins, 0. 165 in. in diameter by 9 3 / 4 in. long, of similar compositions were cast successfully in brass and copper molds. Thirty-six pins of the same diameter and length were cast simultaneously in each <b>casting</b> run. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> centrifugally thin <b>uranium</b> plates measuring 9 in. long by 2 in. wide by 0. 04 in. thick proved to be only partially successful, but encouraging. These plates were cast into graphite molds {{at the rate of}} six plates per run. The maximum usable length of the unalloyed <b>uranium</b> plates <b>cast</b> did not exceed six inches. (auth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The tensile and yield {{strengths}} of both <b>cast</b> and wrought <b>uranium</b> discs were substantially increased by explosively impacting them {{at room temperature}} and at 375 deg F. However, the room-temperature impacting caused gross damage in the cast material and slight internal damage in the wrought material at the highest impacting pressures. Impacting at 375 deg F, which is just above the brittle-ductile transition temperature for uranium, was the most effective method for increasing the strengths with no damage <b>to</b> either the <b>cast</b> or wrought material. This impacted material retained some of its increased strength after a low temperature (425 deg C) vacuum anneal that greatly increased the elongation. A salt anneal caused a partial recrystallization in the impacted <b>cast</b> <b>uranium.</b> (auth) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1942, Frank Spedding of Iowa State College, {{an expert}} in the {{chemistry}} of rare-earth elements, agreed to set up and direct a chemical research and development program, since called the Ames Project, to accompany the Manhattan Project's existing physics program. Its purpose was to produce high purity uranium from uranium ores. Harley Wilhelm developed new methods for both reducing and <b>casting</b> <b>uranium</b> metal, making it possible <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> large ingots of the metal and reduce production costs by as much as twentyfold. About one-third, or around 2 tons, of the uranium used in the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago was provided through these procedures, now known as the Ames Process. The Ames Project produced more than 2 million pounds (1,000 tons) of uranium for the Manhattan Project until industry took over the process in 1945.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} spall {{experiments}} {{has been completed}} with thin depleted uranium targets, nominally 0. 1 mm thick. The first set of uranium spall targets was cut and ground to final thickness from electro-refined, high-purity, <b>cast</b> <b>uranium.</b> The second set was rolled to final thickness from low purity uranium. The impactors for these experiments were laser-launched 0. 05 -mm thick copper flyers, 3 mm in diameter. Laser energies were varied to yield a range of flyer impact velocities. This resulted in varying degrees of damage to the uranium spall targets, from deformation to complete spall or separation at the higher velocities. Dynamic measurements of the uranium target free surface velocities were obtained with dual velocity interferometers. Uranium targets were recovered and sectioned after testing. Free surface velocity profiles were similar for {{the two types of}} uranium, but spall strengths (estimated from the magnitude of the pull-back signal) are higher for the high-purity <b>cast</b> <b>uranium.</b> Velocity profiles and microstructural evidence of spall from the sectioned uranium targets are presented...|$|R
