At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees {{to advocate for}} political awareness, saying, [...] "To anyone who says that church {{is no place to}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> issues, you tell them there is no place better– no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues– they are moral issues, they're issues {{that have to do with}} human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kite Runner {{has been}} accused of 'hindering' Western {{understanding}} of the Taliban by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Taliban and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Taliban in an unfavourable light. Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, {{and the fact that he}} is an executioner. The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its [...] "offensive language, sexually explicit , and unsuit age group." [...] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed. Hosseini responded in an interview, [...] "They never say I am speaking about things that are untrue. Their beef is, 'Why do you have to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things and embarrass us? Don't you love your country?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{retirement}} {{he became}} active amongst ex-POWs seeking compensation for wartime imprisonment {{and began to}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> experiences. [...] In 2001 he described these {{in an interview with}} the Imperial War Museum in London, where he stated that he had obtained cigarettes for Ernst and also gave the name of Ernst's sister Susanne. He also stated that he had exchanged uniforms with a bunkmate of Ernst and entered Birkenau in the company of Ernst. Avey got details about events inside Birkenau which he sent home to his mother and sister in code. His mother sent two letters regarding this to the War Office but never received a reply. He was interviewed on BBC Radio Derby in 2003. In 2005 the Daily Mirror reported that Avey claimed to have swapped uniforms with Ernst and entered Birkenau where he witnessed prisoners being sent to the gas chambers.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{operating}} in two kebele in Ethiopia, the organization began by surveying community members about practices and informing {{the community of}} the results, focusing education efforts on individuals who would then spread what they had learned to others. On request of the United Nations, they turned to hosting [...] "community conversations" [...] encouraging people in the region to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> subjects. These community conversations, a concept created by AIDS activist Moustapha Gueye, are based on traditional African conventions whereby communities come together for several hours on a regular basis to reach consensus on matters of communal concern. Hundreds of men and women were trained to serve as facilitators at the KMG community conversations, which initially focused on AIDS education. In 2004, due to its successful implementation of the community conversation strategy, KMG was chosen by the Ethiopian government to train people to lead conversations across the country as a key component of HIV prevention in Ethiopia.|$|E

5000|$|Writing {{about the}} book in The New York Times, the critic Anthony Boucher called the book {{a study of the}} strands that shape {{complexity}} and doom and, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> strands, says [...] "it is an analysis at once compassionate and cruel giving dimension and meaning to an unusually well crafted mystery puzzle,".|$|R
6000|$|... '"The kissing {{behind the}} door, {{and all that}} sort of thing, Tom," [...] said the old gentleman. And here he gave another impudent look, which made Tom very wroth, because as you all know, gentlemen, to hear an old fellow, who ought to know better, <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things, is very unpleasant--nothing more so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we will <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things afterwards, Nora, but you won't {{refuse to}} take {{advantage}} of my old friend's offer--at least for a night or two?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no; it {{will not}} be the last. But do not <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things. And it will be so much better that I should be here when he is not here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must come}} in with me and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things," [...] Mannering said, gravely. [...] "You {{seem to be the}} sort of person I've been wanting to meet for a long time." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{dispatching}} a few plea bargains {{and lunch}} with Elizabeth Olivet, McCoy {{goes to a}} bar and meets some blue collar workers where they play darts and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their fathers. McCoy initially speaks highly of his father, a former police officer. However, after getting drunk, he reveals that his father demanded perfection from him, and would beat him and his mother for the slightest failure. He also states that he [...] "never <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things." ...|$|R
3000|$|It is {{possible}} that the reluctance to address problematic issues within the family expressed above, may be exacerbated by the lack of extended family for many immigrant families that would mediate such problems. Some Asian people may also tend to avoid <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> problems because they prefer to keep issues within the family, due to the shame associated with such behaviour: [...]...|$|R
50|$|Zeno was {{a pioneer}} in {{reproductive}} women's issues. When little was known about sexual education, Zeno promoted and developed counselors and professionals in the field. As a gynecologist, she encouraged the opening of spaces {{for the care of}} adolescents with sexual problems in hospitals, proclaiming the importance of <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> issues and having policies on sexual and reproductive health.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{have offered}} you money? That's a superstition," [...] said the Doctor. [...] "You must {{let me come}} and see you again, and we will <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things. I suppose that some of your {{children}} are girls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is nonsense," [...] said she. [...] "I shouldn't be glad {{at all to}} see him disappointed. I {{should feel}} like a traitor if I helped you. But I {{did not come to}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things. I came to ask you what you would have for dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|Though {{he still}} didn't {{understand}} {{her he was}} as nice as if he had; he didn't ask for insistence, {{and that was just}} a part of his looking after her. He simply protected her now from herself, and there was a world of practice in it. [...] "Oh, we must <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things!" ...|$|E
5000|$|From {{ownership}} on down, it's {{an approach}} the Rockies {{are proud of}} - and something they are wary about publicizing. [...] "We're nervous, {{to be honest with}} you", Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd says. [...] "It's the first time we ever <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> issues publicly. The last thing {{we want to do is}} offend anyone because of our beliefs." ...|$|R
5000|$|Green Party of Canada leader Elizabeth May {{noted that}} the PPCA seemed redundant, as the two parties shared the {{majority}} of their platforms on copyright reform, medical patents and intellectual property; but the PPCA responded that [...] "even if the Green Party had the same stance as us, ... they were not <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> issues in the last election; no party was".|$|R
6000|$|... "There a won't be any need," [...] {{the other}} replied. [...] "One hears {{a great deal}} of rot <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> affairs, but so far as I know, nothing very much out of the way goes on. There are always one or two pretty stiff fights in the gymnasium, and you get the best variety show and supper in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|Play was of {{necessity}} interrupted. Groups of people {{eating and drinking}} congregated round the tables. The men mostly discussed various phases of the game; there was so little else for idlers to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> days. No comedies or other diversions, neither cock-fighting nor bear-baiting, and abuse of my Lord Protector and his rigorous disciplinarian laws had already become stale.|$|E
60|$|The {{next few}} days he was indeed {{singularly}} busy in his steamy little hothouse, fussing about with charcoal, lumps of teak, moss, {{and all the other}} mysteries of the orchid cultivator. He considered he was having a wonderfully eventful time. In the evening he would <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> new orchids to his friends, {{and over and over again}} he reverted to his expectation of something strange.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed very}} long indeed before {{either of them}} spoke. At last he said: [...] "We must <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things again, Norah, when we are less tired and have more time.... You have been reading books.... When Caxton set up his printing-press he thrust a new power between church and disciple and father and child.... And I am tired. We must talk it over a little later." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} denial {{has its roots}} in psychoanalysis. Denial has been assumed to be {{effective}} in blocking unwanted memories. In two experiments, we report that denial has unique consequences for remembering. In two experiments, participants viewed a video of a theft and half of the participants had to deny seeing certain details in the video whereas the other half had to tell the truth. One day later, all participants were given a source monitoring recognition or recall task. In these tasks, they were instructed to indicate (1) whether they could remember <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> certain details and (2) whether they could recollect seeing those details in the video. In both experiments, we found that denial made participants forget that they <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> details while leaving memory for the video unaffected. This denial-induced forgetting was evident for both the source monitoring recognition and recall tests. Furthermore, when we asked participants after the experiment whether they could still not remember <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> details, participants who had to deny were most likely to report that they forgot this. In contrast to a widely held belief, we show that denial does not impair memory for the experienced stimuli, but that it has a unique ability to undermine memory for what was <b>talked</b> <b>about...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{report was}} the first one by the United Nations to {{determine}} that crimes against humanity were perpetrated in the DPRK. <b>Talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> crimes, the Chair of the COI stated: [...] "Unlike earlier totalitarian states and oppressive conduct, the world cannot now lament, 'if only we had known...'

5000|$|The {{exhibition}} ‘Monumenten spreken’ (Monuments speak) {{tells the}} story of the Second World War in the Zaan region. It is the story behind the 28 war memorials and resistance memorials found in the Zaan region. The monuments refer to events from the Second World War. Here you can see 28 mini-documentaries, featuring eyewitnesses <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> events.

6000|$|... "Am I {{going to}} be {{disappointed}} in you, I wonder?" [...] she asked. [...] "I don't think so. You surely wouldn't let a little affair like one election drive you out of public life? It was so obvious that you were made the victim for Horlock's growing unpopularity in the country. Haven't you realised that yourself--or perhaps you don't care to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things to an ignoramus such as I am?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ah, my dear child, {{of course}} that puzzles you, and I am afraid it must puzzle you still till we have another talk; or rather {{it seems to me}} that the best way to explain that puzzle to you would be for you and me to go a journey into the far west, and look into the matter for ourselves; and from here to the far west we will go, either in fancy or on a real {{railroad}} and steamboat, before we have another <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things," [...] Tavernake said, simply. [...] "There's a {{literature}} that's reached from before the Bible to now, full of nothing else. It's all {{as old as the}} hills. I suppose I am about the only sane man in this city who knew nothing of it; but I did know nothing of it, and she was the first woman. Now you understand. I can't hear a word against her--I won't! She may be what you say. If so, she's got to tell me so herself!" ...|$|E

50|$|The Family Law Act <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> {{issues in}} terms of parental responsibilities, {{parenting}} time and contact.

Guardians generally share parental responsibilities and parenting time with their children, unless a court provides otherwise. Someone who isn't a guardian, which might include a grandparent, step-parent or parent who isn't a guardian, can have contact with a child.|$|R
