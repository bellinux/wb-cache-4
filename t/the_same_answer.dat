5|$|During {{the evening}} of 1 May 1991, four Croatian policemen entered Borovo Selo in an {{unauthorised}} attempt to replace a Yugoslav flag in the village with a Croatian one. The attempt resulted in an armed clash. Two of the policemen were wounded and taken prisoner, {{and the other two}} fled after sustaining minor injuries (one a wounded foot and the other a grazing wound to the head). According to the Croatian Ministry of the Interior, the police had been patrolling the Dalj–Borovo Selo road {{at the time of the}} incident. Even though the officers were assigned to the Osijek police administration, the Vinkovci police administrationwhich was assigned authority over the Vukovar municipalityasked the Vukovar police station to contact Šoškoćanin about the incident. Vukovar police contacted him at 4:30a.m., but Šoškoćanin reportedly said he knew nothing. At 9:00a.m., Vinkovci police chief Josip Džaja telephoned Šoškoćanin and received <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>answer.</b> When Reihl-Kir contacted Šoškoćanin half an hour later, the latter confirmed the incident and said the police had shot at members of the local population, wounding one. Reihl-Kir failed to secure the release of the two captured officers.|$|E
5|$|Nick calls Norah, {{apologizing for}} leaving, and she agrees {{to meet him}} again. Deciding to go somewhere where no one they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play {{something}} {{he wrote in the}} studio, but then joins him in the recording room. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>answer</b> from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>answer</b> on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E

It has been known that the complexity of this problem is between PSpace and ExpTime.

25|$|The {{opposite}} of standardized testing is non-standardized testing, in which either significantly different tests {{are given to}} different test takers, or the same test is assigned under significantly different conditions (e.g., one group is permitted far less time to complete the test than the next group) or evaluated differently (e.g., <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>answer</b> is counted right for one student, but wrong for another student).|$|E
25|$|The scheme {{relies on}} two {{properties}} of entanglement. First, the entangled states are perfectly correlated {{in the sense}} that if Alice and Bob both measure whether their particles have vertical or horizontal polarizations, they always get <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>answer</b> with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarizations. This necessitates that the two distant parties have exact directionality synchronization. However, the particular results are completely random; it is impossible for Alice to predict if she (and thus Bob) will get vertical polarization or horizontal polarization. Second, any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve destroys these correlations in a way that Alice and Bob can detect.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact there}} is the other {{possibility}}, that + should be read as disjunction, This other possibility extends from the disjoint union case, where exclusive or and non-exclusive or both give <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>answer.</b> Handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory, reflecting the modern use of both Boolean rings and Boolean algebras (which are simply different aspects of one type of structure). Boole and Jevons struggled over just this issue in 1863, {{in the form of}} the correct evaluation of x + x. Jevons argued for the result x, which is correct for + as disjunction. Boole kept the result as something undefined. He argued against the result 0, which is correct for exclusive or, because he saw the equation x + x = 0 as implying x = 0, a false analogy with ordinary algebra.|$|E
50|$|There are {{generally}} three methods for performing amortized analysis: the aggregate method, the accounting method, {{and the potential}} method.

25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>answer</b> as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of this feature {{is that the}} computers which are actually performing the calculations might not be entirely trustworthy. The designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false, misleading, or erroneous results, and from using the system as an attack vector. This often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes (presumably with different owners) and checking {{that at least two}} different nodes report <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>answer</b> for a given work unit. Discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious nodes. However, {{due to the lack of}} central control over the hardware, there is no way to guarantee that nodes will not drop out of the network at random times. Some nodes (like laptops or dial-up Internet customers) may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods. These variations can be accommodated by assigning large work units (thus reducing the need for continuous network connectivity) and reassigning work units when a given node fails to report its results in expected time.|$|E

Once Watson has a small number of potential solutions, it is able to check against its database to ascertain whether the solution makes sense or not.|$|E
