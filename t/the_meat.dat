50|$|Once {{an ideal}} cooking heat is reached on the disk (usually medium to low heat works best) <b>the</b> first <b>meat</b> to be {{introduced}} is the bacon. This is placed {{at the center of}} the concave disk where the heat is concentrated. The natural fat from the bacon will prevent <b>the</b> <b>meats</b> from sticking. Beer or dark cola is added to create a broth for simmering <b>the</b> <b>meats</b> which also acts as a non stick agent. The bacon is placed away from direct heat onto the side of the disk once its cooked, and the sausage links are introduced to the remaining broth. As each piece of meat is removed from the direct heat, <b>the</b> <b>meat's</b> natural juices and the beer or cola create a broth for <b>the</b> next <b>meat</b> piece {{to be introduced}} to. Once cooked, the sausage is also set aside and the ham is added. The ham is set aside, and the chorizo is added next. The beef as well as the cook's choice of seasoning is finally added to the collective broth. Each meat is cooked for about 10 to 15 minutes. The beef is covered with a lid during the cooking process to contain its natural flavor and juices. The lid is then removed to allow the broth to reduce, and <b>the</b> <b>meats</b> can now be combined with the beef and the collective broth from <b>the</b> different <b>meats.</b> <b>The</b> onions, peppers, and tomatoes are chopped and added to the mix providing the dish with color and <b>the</b> <b>meats</b> with flavor.|$|R

5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E

5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a ventilation fan to keep <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries.

5|$|Several {{synonyms}} {{have either}} been {{classified as a}} separate species from <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> ant or even a subspecies. Iridomyrmex purpureus sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus were classified as subspecies in 1974, previously being recognised as two species. I. detectus castrae was originally described as a variant of <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> ant in 1925 (as I. d. var. castrae), but the taxon was reclassified as a subspecies in 1985; subsequently, a 1993 revision reclassified I. p. sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus at species level while I. d. castrae was synonymised, based on morphological examinations of collected material. Camponotus horni, Formica smithii and Liometopum aeneum were described as three distinct species in three different ant genera, but these classifications were short-lived, as scientists discovered that these taxa were all identical, and subsequently synonymised them with <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> ant. Camponotus horni was described by English entomologist William Forsell Kirby in 1896 from worker and queen syntypes he collected at Palm Creek in the Northern Territory. In 1930, Australian entomologist John S. Clark reviewed these specimens and synonymised the taxon with <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> ant. However, the queen was later found to be distinct from the workers and C. horni was redescribed as a species. The information provided by Clark makes it sufficient to retain {{the validity of the}} name, making Clark the new author of C. horni. Due to the uncertain taxonomic status of Clark's C. horni, a proposal to rename the species cannot be carried through. Clark's C. horni is currently a junior homonym for Kirby's C. horni.|$|E
