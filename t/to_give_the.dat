Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> deceased control over the world around him. Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.|$|E
