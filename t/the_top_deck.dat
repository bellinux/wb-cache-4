5|$|Shackleton {{hoped to}} recruit a strong {{contingent}} from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Wilson {{the post of}} chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the Board of Agriculture's Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald Skelton and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves to Scott and his as yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two Petty Officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> of a bus as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon someone was sent to find him and bring him in.|$|E
5|$|Brains pilots {{the plane}} onto <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> but is confronted by Foster {{and his two}} {{surviving}} associates. Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit, Foster intends to abandon the others, but Alan shoots and kills Foster. The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all hanging on to either the wings or undercarriage, just before Skyship One crashes {{to the ground and}} obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction. A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading them to believe he never made it off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he was caught up in a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The vintage de Havilland Tiger Moth {{appears as}} a scale model for {{sequences}} such as Alan and Tin-Tin's departure from Tracy Island and Brains' arrival on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> of Skyship One. The production team also decided to arrange a live-action location shoot in Buckinghamshire to star a full-sized biplane. Joan Hughes, an experienced pilot who had flown Supermarine Spitfires and Avro Lancasters from factories to airbases during the Second World War, was selected to fly the aircraft. Sequences that comprise live-action filming include Brains launching the Tiger Moth from a field to rescue the occupants of Skyship One, Penelope's subsequent struggle to control the aircraft, the gun battle with Foster's remaining henchmen, the near collisions with the motorway bridge and the exhaust tower, and the final crash-landing. For the later sequences, stunt dummies fixed to the Tiger Moth's wings and undercarriage represent the characters of Alan, Tin-Tin, Parker, Brains and the White Ghost agents, while Hughes doubles for Penelope in the cockpit. The location filming was based at Wycombe Air Park.|$|E
2500|$|There were no {{personal}} injuries. The fire did, however, cause severe damage to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>decks,</b> whilst <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} yacht escaped virtually undamaged. Diller described the incident as being [...] "no problem", emphasizing his relief that everyone escaped unharmed.|$|R
50|$|The SK-2 was {{a minimum}} change fighter {{derivative}} of the SK-1 {{with a normal}} protruding enclosed cockpit, normal light alloy wing skinning, enlarged fin and rudder, and two 12.7mm BS machine-guns in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>decking</b> of <b>the</b> forward fuselage. Flown in October 1940 by G.M. Shiyanov, but no production was authorised.|$|R

25|$|It was {{withdrawn}} from passenger service in 1925, and was converted into snowbroom No. 022 in 1927, by removing <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck,</b> fitting brushes under the platforms {{and increasing the}} power of the motors. It last saw active service in this state in April 1952.|$|E

25|$|Imported cedar {{wood was}} used to {{construct}} and carve the pulpit, designed to be imposing at a height of four metres (over 13 feet), with three decks. Only <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> remains today, but a drawing of the original {{can be seen in}} the church pamphlet.|$|E
25|$|Whydah {{was then}} fitted with 10 {{additional}} cannon by its new captain, and 150 members of Bellamy's crew were detailed to man the vessel. They razeed the ship by clearing <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> of the pilot's cabin, removing the slave barricade, and {{getting rid of}} other features that made her top heavy.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{one hour}} after {{the attacks on the}} London Underground, a fourth bomb was detonated on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> of a number 30 {{double-decker}} bus, a Dennis Trident 2 (fleet number 17758, registration LX03BUF, two years in service at the time) operated by Stagecoach London and travelling its route from Marble Arch to Hackney Wick.|$|E

50|$|The F 5 was a low-wing tandem two-seat {{monoplane}} which {{retained the}} fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage {{of the earlier}} Fieseler F 4 but introduced a new two-spar cantilever wing. It had a fixed conventional landing gear with a tail-skid and the tandem open-cockpit were fitted with dual-controls. Behind the rear seat was a large luggage locker, <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>decking</b> at <b>the</b> rear could be removed to carry a spare propeller or skis.|$|R

25|$|The {{machinery}} of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> and forecastle was integrated within the ship, concealing it and releasing {{nearly all the}} exposed deck space for passengers. As such {{it was the only}} ocean liner to have a regulation-sized open air tennis court on board. The air conditioner units were concealed along with the kennels inside the third, dummy, funnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{forward section}} of the {{fuselage}} was divided into three levels. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> housed the pilots and wireless station, the middle the engine compartment and the lower the bombardiers, fuel tanks and payload. It has to be noted that this configuration {{would have made the}} aircraft top heavy when, after expending its fuel and weapon payload, it eventually landed.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Mott MacDonald. The firm designed an early iteration of the bridge in 1982, with a two lane dual carriageway on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck,</b> and a light railway on the lower deck. The bridge was redesigned beginning in 1989 {{to account for the}} three lane dual highway and the heavier airport railway. The designers were inspired by the Forth Bridge in Scotland and the Severn Bridge in England.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower is}} located at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of a steep sloping, west-facing cliff. It has seven floors {{including}} a windowless underground floor and <b>the</b> walled <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> where a Seetakt radar was located. The land-side entrance is on the third level.|$|R
50|$|A {{technique}} generally used {{to bring}} a predetermined card to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of a <b>deck,</b> or the second card from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> Depth-perception plays a key role, since it is obvious where card placement happens otherwise. One of such techniques {{is known as the}} Marlo tilt.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship has}} 10 {{restaurants}} and eateries: Reflections Dining Room; Windjammer Café (buffet style); Izumi (Japanese); Giovanni's Table Family Style Italian Restaurant; Chops Grille Steakhouse; Rita's Cantina (Mexican); Park Cafe; Chef's Table; Latte'tudes coffee & snack bar; and 24-hour room service. On <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>decks</b> are other services and amenities available to guests: the Day Spa and Fitness Center, Beauty Salon, Solarium (indoor, adults-only, pool area), half court basketball, rock-climbing wall, nine-hole miniature golf course, jogging track, three pools, and three whirlpools.|$|R
25|$|First {{evaluation}} of the orbital insertion showed that the orbiter had reached its first milestone at Mars. The orbit was later adjusted by four more main engine firings to the desired 259km × 11,560km near-polar (86 degree inclination) orbit with a period of 7.5 hours. Near periapsis <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> is pointed down towards the Martian surface and near apoapsis the high gain antenna will be pointed towards Earth for uplink and downlink.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ships}} had separated, as Stockholm crew members were {{beginning}} to survey the damage, a miraculous discovery was made. On <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> of Stockholm, one of the crew came across Linda Morgan, who had been thrown from her bed on the Andrea Doria as the two ships collided and landed on the Stockholms deck, suffering moderate but not life-threatening injuries. Others, unfortunately, were not as lucky, as five of the Stockholms crew perished in the collision.|$|E
25|$|Normandie also {{inspired}} the architecture {{and design of}} the Normandie Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The hotel's roof sign {{is one of the}} two signs that adorned <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> of the Normandie but were removed from it during an early refitting. It also {{inspired the}} nickname 'The Normandie' given to the International Savings Society Apartments in Shanghai, one of the most fashionable residential buildings during the city's pre-revolutionary heyday and home to several stars of China's mid-20th century film industry.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Stal-8=== The Stal-8 was {{a fighter}} {{developed}} from the preceding Stal-6 experimental aircraft.The Curtiss Conqueror steam-cooled V-12 engine was replaced by an M-100A (licence-built Hispano-Suiza 12YBR), this also was closely cowled and defined the maximum sectional area of the fuselage, which transitioned smoothly from nose to tail except for the cockpit which was enlarged to improve {{the view of the}} pilot. Two 7.62mm ShKAS machine-guns were to be fitted in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>decking</b> over <b>the</b> engine, synchronised to fire through the propeller.|$|R
50|$|On older {{passenger}} ships, {{the promenade}} <b>deck</b> was simply <b>the</b> <b>top</b> outside <b>deck</b> below <b>the</b> superstructure, and was enclosed by a railing. Lifeboats are typically kept on davits accessible from the promenade.|$|R

25|$|The {{first route}} to be {{introduced}} in 1955 was the 12A from St Marychurch through Babbacombe, Torquay, Paignton and Goodrington to Broadsands. To reach Paignton's sea front at Preston the bus had to pass under a very low railway bridge. A licence for the route was only granted on condition that buses would {{come to a stop}} before passing under the bridge, the conductor would then have to instruct passengers on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> to remain in their seats and then stand {{at the top of the}} stairs to see that they did.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the bomb inside the bus meant {{the front of the}} vehicle remained mostly intact. Most of the passengers at the front of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> survived, as did those near the front of the lower deck, including the driver, but those {{at the rear of the}} bus suffered more serious injuries. The extent of the damage caused to the victims' bodies resulted in a lengthy delay in announcing the death toll from the bombing while the police determined how many bodies were present and whether the bomber was one of them. Several passers-by were also injured by the explosion and surrounding buildings were damaged by debris.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its modern}} conveniences, one problem on Pentowna was vibration. One account even {{says that it}} was so bad that ketchup from {{uncapped}} bottles would shoot up from the table in the small dining room. Because of these deficiencies and because new highways and modes of transportation meant fewer passengers, Pentowna was converted into a cargo tug in 1937. The job was given to North Vancouver Shipyards Ltd., who installed a new steel deck and towing machinery and stripped off Pentowna's upper structures. The galley was moved to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> and the life boats were raised. After a two-month layover, Pentowna went back into service as a freight ship.|$|E
2500|$|Impressed by the {{performance}} of the aircraft, the War Office ordered twelve examples on 5 November and the Admiralty ordered a further 24 on 7 November. The production aircraft, later called the Scout C, differed from their predecessors mainly in constructional detail, although the cowling was replaced by one with a small frontal opening and no stiffening ribs, <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>decking</b> in front of the cockpit had a deeper curve and the aluminium covering of the fuselage sides extended only as far as the forward centre-section struts, aft of [...] which the decking was plywood.|$|R
50|$|On 15 January 1909 {{the vessel}} arrived in Port Adelaide from Mauritius. At Darling’s Mill, the ship took on 39,862 bags of wheat and 28, 451 bags of flour. A {{large amount of}} coal (638 tons) was also loaded, with 170 tons on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>decks.</b> On <b>the</b> 31st of that month, despite a 4° list to {{starboard}} Clan Ranald left the Semaphore Anchorage, bound for South Africa with a crew of 64 people. The ship's crew consisted of four Manilamen, sixteen Calcuttamen and 34 Lascars.The ship was commanded by Captain A.S. Gladstone.|$|R
50|$|Korean armor pieces, {{from top}} to bottom, {{typically}} consisted of a helmet or a cap, a heavy main armor coat with pauldrons or shoulder and underarm protection, leg coverings (supplemented by the skirting from the main coat), groin protection, and limb protection. In terms of armament, Korean militaries employed heavy infantry equipped with swords or spears along with shields, pikemen, archers, crossbowmen, and versatile heavy cavalry capable of horse archery. Korean naval warfare saw large deployments of heavy wooden shields {{as a means of}} protecting personnel on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>decks</b> of Korean ships.|$|R
