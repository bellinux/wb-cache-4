40|$|Plasmids with {{bacteriophage}} Mu sequences receive additional Mu insertions 20 - 700 {{times less}} frequently than plasmids without Mu sequences. The Mu sites required for this <b>transposition</b> <b>immunity</b> were mapped near each end, either {{of which was}} sufficient. The left site was between 127 and 203 base pairs from the left end, and the right site was between 22 and 93 base pairs from the right end. These sequences include the innermost but not the outermost of the three binding sites for the Mu A transposition protein {{at each end of}} Mu. <b>Transposition</b> <b>immunity</b> was cis-acting and independent of its location on a target plasmid. An additional copy of an immunity site reduced transposition a factor of 10 further. <b>Transposition</b> <b>immunity</b> was seen both during full phage lytic growth, with all the bacteriophage Mu genes, and during normal cellular growth, with a mini-Mu element containing only the Mu c and ner regulatory and A and B transposition genes...|$|E
40|$|A plasmid {{containing}} transposon Tn 3 {{is immune}} to further insertions of Tn 3. This phenomenon works in cis and {{is referred to}} as <b>transposition</b> <b>immunity.</b> We have used the ability of Tn 3 to form cointegrates between two plasmids to develop a quantitative assay to detect <b>transposition</b> <b>immunity.</b> Presence of Tn 3 on both the plasmids reduces the cointegration frequency to less than 1 / 100 of parental. Using this assay, we have determined that (i) tnpR is not required for immunity, (ii) only the terminal 38 base pairs of Tn 3 need be present to confer immunity, and (iii) other parts of Tn 3 appear not to confer immunity...|$|E
40|$|The Tn 3 {{transposon}} inserts at {{a reduced}} frequency into a plasmid already containing {{a copy of}} Tn 3, a phenomenon known as <b>transposition</b> <b>immunity.</b> The cis-acting site on Tn 3 responsible for immunity was mapped by deletions from each side to be within the terminal 38 -base-pair sequence that is inversely repeated {{at the ends of}} Tn 3. Two palindromic sequences are present in the essential part of this region. Some deletions conferred only partial immunity, and others conferred negative immunity. Multiple copies of partially immune ends conferred additional immunity. No other part of Tn 3 was necessary for immunity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Transposition</b> target <b>immunity</b> is a {{phenomenon}} observed in some DNA transposons {{that are able to}} dis-tinguish the host chromosome from their own DNA sequence, thus avoid-ing self-destructive insertions. The first molecular insight into target selection and immunity mechanisms came from the study of phage Mu transposition, which uses the protein MuB as a barrier to self-insertion. MuB is an ATP-depen-dent non-specific DNA binding protein that regulates the activity of the MuA transposase and captures target DNA for transposition. However, a detailed mech-anistic understanding of MuB function-ing was hindered by the poor solubility of the MuB-ATP complexes. Here we comment on the recent discovery that MuB is an AAA+ ATPase that upon ATP binding assembles into helical filaments that coat the DNA. Remarkably, the helical parameters of the MuB filament do not match those of the bound DNA. This intriguing mismatch symmetry led us to propose a model on how MuB targets DNA for transposition, favoring DNA bending and recognition by the transposase at the filament edge. We also speculate on a different protective role of MuB during immunity, where filament stickiness could favor the condensation of the DNA into a compact state that occludes it from the transposase...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} the {{bacterial}} transposon Tn 7 to examine communication between widely separated DNA sites in the Escherichia coli chromosome. Using Tn 7 target immunity, a regulatory feature of transposition which influences target selection, we have evaluated (i) how the presence of Tn 7 sequences at one DNA site affects Tn 7 insertion into another site in the same DNA molecule and (ii) the nucleotide distances over which the two sites are able to communicate. We demonstrate that Tn 7 sequences at one chromosomal site act at a distance to inhibit insertion of Tn 7 elsewhere in that DNA {{as far away as}} 190 kb, reflecting effective long-range cis interactions. We have found that while target immunity is effective over a substantial region of the chromosome, insertion of Tn 7 into a more distant site 1. 9 Mb away in the same DNA is not inhibited; this observation provides evidence that target immunity relies on DNA spacing. We also find that within the region of the chromosome affected by target immunity, the magnitude of the immune effect is greater at close DNA sites than DNA sites farther away, suggesting that target immunity is distance dependent. We also extend the characterization of the Tn 7 end-sequences involved in <b>transposition</b> and target <b>immunity</b> and describe how Tn 7 target immunity {{can be used as a}} tool for probing bacterial chromosome structure...|$|R
40|$|Transposons are mobile genetic {{elements}} that move by transposition from one location to another within genomes. The present work {{is focused on}} the characterization of the activities mediated by the transposase protein (TnpA) of the bacterial transposon Tn 4430 belonging to the Tn 3 family. TnpA catalyzes replicative transposition of Tn 4430 and target immunity that prevents multiple insertions of the transposon into the same DNA molecule. Very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that control the <b>transposition</b> and target <b>immunity</b> reactions catalyzed by TnpA of the Tn 3 family. In this study, we have achieved decisive steps toward the understanding of the replicative transposition mechanism by developing in vitro reactions with TnpA reproducing specific steps of the transposition process. Additional observations have also revealed an unexpected link between the mechanism of DNA targeting by Tn 4430 and DNA replication, suggesting a mechanism for recruiting replication machinery during the replicative transposition. This work also provides important findings toward the understanding of target immunity. We first showed that formation of a specific complex between TnpA and the immunizing transposon is necessary to generate immunity. In addition, the biochemical assays revealed that TnpA mutants affected in their immunity function had promiscuous activities when compared to wild type TnpA, suggesting that the activity of the protein is normally tightly regulated. Finally, we were interested in the biological significance of target immunity. We tested the involvement of this process in avoiding intra-molecular replicative transposition leading to deleterious events within the DNA molecule. The results showed that the immunity mutants exhibited a higher intra-molecular transposition frequency than wild type TnpA, which was in accordance with the hypothesis.

40|$|A plasmid {{containing}} the transposon gamma delta sequence was immune to further insertion of gamma delta (<b>transposition</b> <b>immunity).</b> Plasmids carrying a fragment containing either 0. 2 kilobase pairs of the gamma end or 0. 4 kilobase pairs {{of the delta}} end of the gamma delta sequence were immune, {{and other parts of}} the gamma delta sequence did not confer immunity. The terminal 38 -base-pair (bp) sequence of the delta end of the gamma delta was sufficient to confer immunity, the 38 -bp sequence of the gamma end conferred only moderate immunity, and the terminal 35 -bp sequence, which was completely identical at both the gamma and delta ends, was insufficient to confer immunity...|$|E
40|$|Novel Tn 1 / 3 {{derivatives}} {{that contained}} either two left- or two right-hand {{ends of the}} transposon were constructed in a small plasmid. Both transposed at reasonable frequencies to give normal transposition products, suggesting that only the 38 -bp inverted repeats of Tn 3 are essential for transposition. Plasmids containing transposon derivatives with only one end (either left or right) undergo transposase-dependent transposition between replicons at much lower frequencies, resulting in co-integrate molecules {{in which there is}} no substantial duplication of transposon DNA and that appear to be simple fusions of the two plasmids. Both the right and left halves of the transposon are separately able to confer <b>transposition</b> <b>immunity</b> to the plasmid, this immunity being inseparably linked to transposition proficiency and specificity...|$|E
40|$|The {{ends of the}} {{bacterial}} transposon gamma delta contain adjacent binding {{sites for}} gamma delta transposase and integration host factor (IHF). IHF+ and IHF- strains were {{used in conjunction with}} gamma delta transposon ends containing or lacking the site for IHF binding to determine the role that IHF plays in various gamma delta-mediated transposition events. IHF was not essential for the transposition of gamma delta and seemed to decrease its frequency of transposition about threefold. IHF played no role in determining the distribution of gamma delta inserts into a target replicon, nor did it significantly alter the frequency of simple transpositions. The only clear role discerned for IHF and the terminal IHF-binding sites was in <b>transposition</b> <b>immunity.</b> IHF stimulated the immunity of those plasmids that contain an end of gamma delta, provided the end included the terminal IHF-binding site. For both ends, the degree of stimulation of immunity was similar to the stimulation of binding of transposase by IHF...|$|E
40|$|The Tn 10 {{transposition}} reaction {{has been}} reconstituted in vitro on short linear substrate fragments encoding transposon ends. This permits the direct detection of protein-DNA complexes formed during transposition by gel retardation analysis. We demonstrate that a stable synaptic complex containing transposase {{and a pair}} of transposon ends forms rapidly and efficiently, prior and prerequisite to the double-strand cleavages involved in transposon excision. These observations extend the general analogies between the Tn 10 and Mu transposition reactions, and also reveal {{significant differences between the two}} cases. The speed and simplicity of synaptic complex formation in the Tn 10 /IS 10 reaction is suitable for a modular insertion sequence. In contrast, the relative slowness and complexity of this process in the Mu is necessary to permit <b>transposition</b> <b>immunity</b> and control of transposition by Mu repressor protein, two features specifically important for a temperate bacteriophage. Further dissection of the reaction leads to a tentative working model for events preceding the first double-strand cleavage...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the conditions under}} which self-regulated rates of transposition can evolve in populations of transposable elements infecting sexually reproducing hosts. Models of the evolution of both cis-acting regulation (<b>transposition</b> <b>immunity)</b> and trans-acting regulation (transposition repression) are analyzed. The potential selective advantage to regulation is assumed to be derived from the deleterious effects of mutations associated with the insertion of newly replicated elements. It is shown that both types of regulation can easily evolve in hosts with low rates of genetic recombination per generation, such as bacteria or bacterial plasmids. Conditions are much more restrictive in organisms with relatively free recombination. In haploids, the main selective force promoting regulation is the induction of lethal or sterile mutations by transposition; in diploids, a sufficiently high frequency of dominant lethal or sterile mutations associated with transpositions is required. Data from Drosophila and maize suggest that this requirement can sometimes be met. Coupling of regulatory effects across different families of elements would also aid the evolution of regulation. The selective advantages of restricting transposition to the germ line and of excising elements from somatic cells are discussed...|$|E
40|$|ESBLs) are {{spreading}} worldwide. The {{aim of this}} work {{was to investigate the}} replicons involved in the emergence and spread of ESBLs in relation to ESBL type. Methods: A collection of 125 TEM, SHV and CTX-M ESBL-producing E. coli strains was analysed. The replicons carrying the ESBLs and the total plasmid content of the strains have been characterized by PCR replicon typing in relation to the type of ESBL. The ESBL replicons were then compared with the replicon content of E. coli strains carrying TEM- 1 or inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) b-lactamases. Results: IncF plasmids were the most frequently carried replicons in our collection, but none carried TEM ESBL. Of TEM ESBLs, 67 % were carried on IncA/C replicons except for TEM- 52 genes, which were carried preferentially on IncI 1 replicons. Although CTX-M enzymes can be carried by various replicons, the great majority of genes encoding CTX-M- 14 and CTX-M- 15 ESBLs were carried by IncF replicons, as were TEM- 1 and IRT b-lactamases. Conclusions: Resistance genes borne by the narrow host-range IncF replicon spread readily as this replicon is well adapted to E. coli. This is observed for blaTEM- 1 and blaCTX-M- 15 and, to a lesser extent, for blaCTX-M- 14. <b>Transposition</b> <b>immunity</b> seems {{to play an important role}} in the diffusion process...|$|E
40|$|Transduction with phage {{derived from}} a 2 -year-old lysate of λ cam 105 (λ::Tn 9) gave rise to chloramphenicol-resistant (Cmr) transductants {{harboring}} a plasmid (pλCM 1) formed from λ cam 105 by a Tn 9 -mediated adjacent deletion to position 36. 07 kilobases in the N cistron of λ. The pλCM element can replicate as a plasmid, insert into the bacterial genome, or reproduce lytically as a phage on cells that provide N function. The feasibility of obtaining high titers in encapsidated form and the ease of synchronous introduction into and recovery from bacterial populations make pλCM very suitable for quantitative studies of recombination involving transposable elements. Replicon fusions between pλCM 1 and RSF 1596 (pMB 8 ::Tn 3 Δ 596) occur by duplication of either IS 1 (at low rate {{in the absence of}} TnpA activity) or Tn 3 Δ 596 (in the presence of TnpA activity). At 24 or 32 °C, the rate of increase of TnpA-mediated fusions per pλCM is about 2 % per cell doubling. RSF 103 contains the deleted Tn 1 ΔAp (which lacks intact beta-lactamase and TnpR resolvase coding sequences) adjacent to a streptomycin resistance (Smr) determinant. We observed that Tn 1 ΔAp mediates insertions of external RSF 103 sequences into the R 388 plasmid. R 388 ::Tn 1 ΔAp plasmids show <b>transposition</b> <b>immunity</b> in cells lacking TnpR activity. Using the pλCM system, we isolated adjacent transpositions of the RSF 103 Smr determinant. The resulting pλCM-Sm cosmids contain Smr genetic material flanked by direct repeats of Tn 1 ΔAp, and all are deleted for some RSF 103 or pλCM sequences. The pλCM-Sm constructs will fuse into R 388 by duplication of a single Tn 1 ΔAp element. In the presence of tnpR+ (but not tnpR) Tn 1 or Tn 3 elements, all Tn 1 ΔAp-mediated complex replicons break down completely and rapidly to simple Tn 1 ΔAp inserts. The equilibrium for resolution is at least 105 : 1, and resolution is more than 90 % complete after 40 min of exposure to a tnpR+ cytoplasm. In the absence of TnpR, Rec, and Red activities, Tn 1 ΔAp-mediated complex replicons yield simple Tn 1 ΔAp inserts at a lower rate. The presence of intact RSF 103 replication determinants between direct Tn 1 ΔAp repeats appears to accelerate this precise TnpR- and Rec-independent breakdown...|$|E
