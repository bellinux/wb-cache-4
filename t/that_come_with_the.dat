500|$|Due to the {{different}} architecture of ARM-based devices compared to x86 devices, Windows RT has software compatibility limitations.

500|$|The Committee's {{report was}} {{discussed}} in Parliament from 16 to 18 January 2012. Setting out {{the position of}} the Workers' Party, Chen Show Mao said that the basic monthly salary of an MP should be $11,000, the pay of an MX9-grade director in the Management Executive Scheme of the Civil Service. A minister should be paid five times this sum ($55,000), and the Prime Minister nine times ($99,000). NCMP Gerald Giam said that ministers should obtain an average annual bonus of three months of their base salaries, and in any case no more than five months' bonus. Two-thirds of the bonus should be made up of the national bonus, and the remaining third based on the individual's performance, which should be determined according to key performance indicators fixed for each ministry {{at the start of a}} new government's term. Moreover, only a portion of bonuses should be paid at the end of each year. Payment of the remainder should be deferred till the end of the government's term. If the minister's performance is poor, some of the withheld bonus should be clawed back. The WP's proposal was criticized by a number of PAP MPs. Minister of State for Health Amy Khor expressed the view that [...] "olitical service is much more than public service. Civil servants are not subject to the votes of citizens nor do they need to carry the ground in policymaking. ...

500|$|Soon I Will Be Invincible takes characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} {{associated with}} the comic book format and re-casts them using the novel's prose format. This use of superhero fiction in an alternate format was compared to other similar, successful attempts, like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films, Brad Bird's The Incredibles, and the TV serial No Heroics. Several reviewers contrasted the novel's elements of realism with Alan Moore's Watchmen and Rick Veitch's Bratpack which portrayed a darker side of more realistic superheroes. Novels cited as being similar included Donald Barthelme's Snow White, Robert Coover's Stepmother, and the works of Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem. The novel format allowed for more character development, which Grossman took advantage of by portraying them as [...] "real, human characters, {{with all of the}} foibles <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> territory" [...] in what one reviewer called a [...] "hybridization of character and genre". Grossman described it as [...] "a book about real people who happen to be [...] or supervillains" [...] and that if it were a comic, it would be [...] "page after page of thought balloons". Compared to comic stories, the reviewer for the Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote [...] "The common denominator for most superhero comic books is that they don't make fun of themselves - the believability of their stories is never called into question. They take the heroes seriously. Not so in literature. When a novel appears with comic books as its focus, its author will undoubtedly believe that his or her theme is far more important - far more serious - than the comic books that inspired them. ... tries to do it all, combining humor and comic-book adventure with a literary sense of character. ...The result is a postmodern, inventive, comic-book plot with literary aspirations, and its only problem is that it isn't entirely successful as either humor or as straight adventure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among the {{vegetables}} <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hamburger, the first {{described in the}} literature on its history is the onion, usually finely sliced in rings. Thus, the hamburger came to continue the long American tradition of sandwiches featuring some kind of plant product, whether that be lettuce (as {{in the case of the}} BLT sandwich), sauerkraut (as on the reuben), coleslaw, or pickles. It is possible that after the creation of the hamburger by uniting the steak with the bread, vegetables were included to give the finished product a more [...] "natural" [...] appearance and taste. All of these condiments were incorporated into the classical image of the hamburger during its golden age, the 1940s. In some cases, the hamburger is prepared differently and distinctly to add regional flavor, as in the case of Tex-Mex style burgers, which are served with a side of chili con carne.|$|E
2500|$|Determining {{whether or}} not a tea is wild is a {{challenging}} task, made more difficult through the inconsistent and unclear terminology and labeling in Chinese. Terms like yěshēng ( [...] ; literally [...] "wild" [...] or [...] "uncultivated"), qiáomù ( [...] ; literally [...] "tall tree"), yěshēng qiáomù ( [...] ; literally [...] "uncultivated trees"), and gǔshù are found on the labels of cakes of both wild and [...] "wild arbor" [...] variety, and on blended cakes, which contain leaves from tea plants of various cultivations. These inconsistent and often misleading labels can easily confuse uninitiated tea buyers regardless of their grasp of the Chinese language. As well, the lack of specific information about tea leaf sources in the printed wrappers and identifiers <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pu'er cake makes identification of the tea a difficult task. Pu'er journals and similar annual guides such as The Profound World of Chi Tse, Pu-erh Yearbook, and Pu-erh Teapot Magazine contain credible sources for leaf information. Tea factories are generally honest about their leaf sources, but someone without access to tea factory or other information is often {{at the mercy of the}} middlemen or an unscrupulous vendor. Many pu'er aficionados seek out and maintain relationships with vendors who they feel they can trust to help mitigate the issue of finding the [...] "truth" [...] of the leaves.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Latin Empire, the harbour {{appears in}} several sources under the name Kontoskelion, causing {{confusion}} among modern scholars. According to the Patria, this denomination is a patronymic referring to a certain Agallianos, a Byzantine tourmarches (senior army officer) nicknamed Kontoskeles because of his short legs, but the German scholar Albrecht Berger rejects this as a mistake by the Patria [...] authors, due to the different etymology of the two words: [...] "Kontoskalion" [...] means [...] "short step or wharf". Some authors, like Raymond Janin, have proposed that the name Kontoskelion (...) could refer to another harbour placed 150 m west of the Julian/Sophia harbour, nearer to the Vlanga area, but this interpretation should be disregarded, since it is certain that the Kontoskalion was the only port in use on the Marmara Sea until the 15th century. In that period, the harbour maintained its important function: during the Palaiologos dynasty, Emperor Michael VIII (r. 1259–1282) protected it with an ashlar wall and a chain, while his successor Andronikos II (r. 1282–1328) made the harbour deeper and closed its entrance with iron gates, protecting the ships from the storms <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Lodos. The harbour was attested in an encomium of Emperor John VIII (r. 1425–1448) written in 1427. From it we know that John VIII ordered repairs to the harbour, employing paid workers (among them were also clergymen and monks), and not servants. At {{the end of the}}se works, the basin could host 300 galleys. In some versions of the map of Florentine traveller Cristoforo Buondelmonti (who visited Constantinople in 1421), the basin is shown flanked by its arsenal, and in the account of the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur, who saw it in 1437, the harbour was still active. It remained so until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.|$|E

2500|$|Fletcher and Hurd {{state that}} unions may also face issues of {{resistance}} by pre-existing [...] "staff," [...] {{who may be}} hesitant or even suspicious at {{the adoption of the}} organizing model. Dealing with resistant staff would be a major disadvantage of using the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, to which the staff are both accustomed and familiar with. Fletcher and Hurd assert that, {{based on the fact that}} unions employing the organizing model have to reassign tasks and take time to train people, [...] "...following the organizing model creates more work than sticking to the servicing model." [...] Richard Hurd argues that the organizing model can, at times, create [...] "...continual warfare..." [...] between the workers and the employer, which is a disadvantage because there is a trend of workers [...] "...preferring stability rather than on-going class struggle." [...] If this is really the mindset of the workers, then it would be hard to actually maintain the organizing model for long periods of time. Fred Glass says that [...] "...an organizing model of unionism requires an organizing model of labor communications" [...] because the organizing model requires an effective way to share information with workers quickly and efficiently. Bob Carter, in regard to the organizing model [...] in British unions, is concerned with the method of implementation and whether or not workers consent to switching from servicing to organizing. Carter says that [...] "A model which is premised on debate and involvement cannot be successfully introduced without discussion..."
