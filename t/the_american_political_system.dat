25|$|The Democratic Republican Party (or the Democratic Party) and the Whig Party (which {{had been}} pretty well {{destroyed}} after the 1852 elections) {{had been the}} major political parties in the United States. Corbett had been a Whig and follower of Henry Clay but when the Republican Party was founded on July 6, 1854, in Jackson, Michigan, {{he was one of}} its early and enthusiastic supporters. The Republican Party was founded as the anti-slavery party in opposition to the pro-slavery Democratic Party {{in one of the few}} fundamental reorganizations of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|When he was Professor of Law and Police at the College of William & Mary, Tucker used William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England as {{his primary}} text. While Tucker {{considered}} Blackstone the best treatise {{to use for}} learning the common law, he thought it had some important weaknesses as a teaching tool for American law. None of the editions of Blackstone published in the United States actually discussed new legal developments there; they just reprinted Blackstone's discussions of English law. Tucker also felt that Blackstone's sympathy {{with the power of}} the Crown over that of Parliament would be a poor influence for a student of American legal principles. Therefore, Tucker wrote marginalia in his copy of Blackstone and read them to his classes, and added lectures on Virginian and United States federal law and comparing <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system</b> with its British counterpart.|$|E

25|$|The {{performance}} of gold bullion is often compared to stocks as different investment vehicles. Gold is regarded {{by some as}} a store of value (without growth) whereas stocks are regarded as a return on value (i.e., growth from anticipated real price increase plus dividends). Stocks and bonds perform best in a stable political climate with strong property rights and little turmoil. The attached graph shows the value of Dow Jones Industrial Average divided by the price of an ounce of gold. Since 1800, stocks have consistently gained value in comparison to gold {{in part because of the}} stability of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system.</b> This appreciation has been cyclical with long periods of stock outperformance followed by long periods of gold outperformance. The Dow Industrials bottomed out a ratio of 1:1 with gold during 1980 (the end of the 1970s bear market) and proceeded to post gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The gold price peak of 1980 also coincided with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the threat of the global expansion of communism. The ratio peaked on January 14, 2000 a value of 41.3 and has fallen sharply since.|$|E
500|$|Sorkin's last {{produced}} {{screenplay for}} Castle Rock was The American President {{and once again}} he worked with William Goldman, {{who served as a}} creative consultant. It took Sorkin a few years to write the screenplay for The American President, which started off as a massive 385-page screenplay; it was eventually whittled down to a standard shooting script of around 120 pages. Rob Reiner directed. The film was critically acclaimed. Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times described the film as [...] "genial and entertaining if not notably inspired", and believed its most interesting aspects were the [...] "pipe dreams about <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system</b> and where it could theoretically be headed".|$|E
500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, the Court began to {{interpret}} the amendment more broadly, striking down grandfather clauses in Guinn v. United States (1915) and dismantling the white primary system in the [...] "Texas primary cases" [...] (1927–1953). Along with later measures such as the Twenty-fourth Amendment, which forbade poll taxes in federal elections, and Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections (1966), which forbade poll taxes in state elections, these decisions significantly increased black participation in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system.</b> To enforce the amendment, Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided federal oversight of elections in discriminatory jurisdictions, banned literacy tests and similar discriminatory devices, and created legal remedies for people affected by voting discrimination.|$|E

500|$|Eventually, Stanton's oppositional rhetoric took {{on racial}} overtones. Arguing {{on behalf of}} female suffrage, Stanton posited that women voters of [...] "wealth, education, and refinement" [...] were needed to offset the effect of former slaves and {{immigrants}} whose [...] "pauperism, ignorance, and degradation" [...] might negatively affect <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system.</b> She declared it to be [...] "a serious question whether we had better stand aside and see 'Sambo' walk into the kingdom [...] first." [...] Some scholars have argued that Stanton's emphasis on property ownership and education, opposition to black male suffrage, and desire to hold out for universal suffrage fragmented {{the civil rights movement}} by pitting African-American men against women and, together with Stanton's emphasis on [...] "educated suffrage," [...] in part established a basis for the literacy requirements that followed {{in the wake of the}} passage of the Fifteenth Amendment.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960s United States, natural afro-textured {{hair was}} {{transformed}} from a simple expression of style into a revolutionary political statement. It became a fundamental tool of the Black movement in America, and [...] "air came to symbolize either a continued move toward integration in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system</b> or a growing cry for Black power and nationalism." [...] Prior to this, the idealized Black person (especially Black women) [...] "had many Eurocentric features, including hairstyles." [...] However, during the movement, the Black community endeavoured to define their own ideals and beauty standards, and hair became a central icon which was [...] "promoted {{as a way of}} challenging mainstream standards regarding hair." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Squatter and the Don is Ruiz de Burton's {{most famous}} {{literary}} piece. [...] It was published anonymously under the pen name [...] "C. Loyal," [...] an abbreviated form of [...] "Ciudadano Leal," [...] or [...] "Loyal Citizen," [...] a conventional method of closing official letters in nineteenth century Mexico. [...] She used this name to symbolize her Mexican loyalties, to provide indeterminacy of her gender, and to criticize <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system.</b> [...] This novel adopts the narrative {{perspective of a}} conquered Californio population that [...] is a [...] "capable, cultured, even heroic people who were unjustly deterritorialized, economically strangled, linguistically oppressed, and politically marginalized" [...] despite the stipulations of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, in which the United States agreed to respect the rights of Mexicans and Spanish citizens who were subsumed into the United States. [...] The story of The Squatter and the Don fictionally documents the many Californio families that lost their land due to squatters and litigation. This book discusses {{the consequences of the}} Land Act of 1851 and the railroad monopoly in California, covering the time period of 1872 to 1885. The novel demonstrates how the burden of proof of land ownership fell not on the US government, nor on the squatters who settled on the land, but on the Californio landowners.|$|E

50|$|In foreign policy, the League {{has never}} had a {{particularly}} pro-United States stance, although it admires <b>the</b> <b>American</b> federal <b>political</b> <b>system.</b> <b>The</b> party's MPs opposed both the Gulf War in 1991 and the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999 in the name of pacifism, and Bossi personally met Slobodan Milošević during that war.

In March 2017 the LN signed a cooperation protocol with United Russia.|$|R
