5|$|The {{suspension}} {{order of}} Nagpal was challenged in the Allahabad High Court on 30 July 2013 through a Public interest litigation (PIL). The petition was filed by social activist Nutan Thakur at the Lucknow bench of the court. It also requested {{the court to}} direct the central government to ask the state governments to prevent harassment of those officers who have ordered action against illegal construction of religious places, and illegal mining. On 1 August, {{the court ruled that}} the suspension {{is not a matter of}} a PIL, and <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>should</b> directly approach the court. It however praised her work in preventing illegal sand mining and ordered both the central and the state government to report how they are tackling illegal mining and what security is being provided to the officers engaged in stopping it.|$|E
60|$|If the {{soldiers}} once come to mix for {{any time in}} the municipal clubs, cabals, and confederacies, an elective attraction will draw them to the lowest and most desperate part. With them will be their habits, affections, and sympathies. The military conspiracies which are to be remedied by civic confederacies, the rebellious municipalities which are to be rendered obedient by furnishing them with the means of seducing the very armies of the state that are to keep them in order,--all these chimeras of a monstrous and portentous policy must aggravate the confusion from which they have arisen. There must be blood. The want of common judgment manifested in the construction of all their descriptions of forces, and in all their kinds of civil and judicial authorities, will make it flow. Disorders may be quieted in one time and in one part. They will break out in others; because the evil is radical and intrinsic. All these schemes of mixing mutinous soldiers with seditious citizens must weaken still more and more the military connection of soldiers with their officers, as well as add military and mutinous audacity to turbulent artificers and peasants. To secure a real army, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>should</b> be first and last {{in the eye of the}} soldier,--first and last in his attention, observance, and esteem. Officers, it seems, there are to be, whose chief qualification must be temper and patience. They are to manage their troops by electioneering arts. They must bear themselves as candidates, not as commanders. But as by such means power may be occasionally in their hands, the authority by which they are to be nominated becomes of high importance.|$|E
60|$|No one who {{was alive}} {{at the time and}} {{interested}} in such matters will ever forget the first acting of Arms and the Man. It was applauded by that indescribable element in all of us which rejoices to see the genuine thing prevail against the plausible; that element which rejoices that even its enemies are alive. Apart from the problems raised in the play, the very form of it was an attractive and forcible innovation. Classic plays which were wholly heroic, comic plays which were wholly and even heartlessly ironical, were common enough. Commonest of all in this particular time was the play that began playfully, with plenty of comic business, and was gradually sobered by sentiment until it ended on a note of romance or even of pathos. A commonplace little officer, the butt of the mess, becomes by the last act as high and hopeless a lover as Dante. Or a vulgar and violent pork-butcher remembers his own youth before the curtain goes down. The first thing that Bernard Shaw did when he stepped before the footlights was to reverse this process. He resolved to build a play not on pathos, but on bathos. <b>The</b> <b>officer</b> <b>should</b> be heroic first and then everyone should laugh at him; the curtain should go up on a man remembering his youth, and he should only reveal himself as a violent pork-butcher when someone interrupted him with an order for pork. This merely technical originality is indicated in the very title of the play. The Arma Virumque of Virgil is a mounting and ascending phrase, the man is more than his weapons. The Latin line suggests a superb procession which should bring on to the stage the brazen and resounding armour, the shield and shattering axe, but end with the hero himself, taller and more terrible because unarmed. The technical effect of Shaw's scheme is like the same scene, in which a crowd should carry even more gigantic shapes of shield and helmet, but when the horns and howls were at their highest, should end with the figure of Little Tich. The name itself is meant to be a bathos; arms--and the man.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held that [...] "a police stop exceeding the time needed to handle the matter for which the stop was made violates the Constitution‚Äôs shield against unreasonable seizures." [...] Consequently, a traffic stop becomes unlawful if [...] "it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete the mission of issuing a ticket for the violation." [...] Justice Ginsburg wrote {{that the purpose of the}} initial stop in this case was to investigate why Rodriguez swerved out of his lane of traffic. Therefore, the officer's authority to continue the stop ended once he completed his investigation of that infraction. Because the dog sniff was unrelated to the investigation of the original traffic infraction, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>should</b> not have extended the stop absent [...] "independently supported reasonable suspicion" [...] for the dog sniff. The Court then remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit to determine whether the officer did, in fact, have an independent basis for conducting the dog sniff.|$|E

40|$|I {{am pleased}} to enclose the updated model law {{enforcement}} response to domestic violence cases. Dozens of dedicated professionals, including police chiefs, other law enforcement officials and domestic violence experts have put in countless hours {{over the past two}} years to revise the original protocol. Their objective was to define ‚Äúbest practices ‚Äù for law enforcement when encountering situations involving domestic violence. This protocol is the result of those concerted efforts. I appreciate their dedication and commitment to the issue. Like its predecessor, this protocol establishes a presumptive arrest policy. Under that policy, whenever an officer has probable cause to believe that a crime of domestic violence has been committed, for which arrest may not be mandated by statute (RSA 173 -B, I(a) or RSA 633 : 3 -a), <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>should</b> nonetheless arrest unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so. If an arrest is not made, the reasons for that decision should be documented in a report. The protocol also sets forth model procedures for police response.

40|$|The {{arrangement}} of government {{institutions in the}} region, especially in the rural level is very important and urgent. The dominant factors affecting participatory rural development in Bone and Jeneponto Regencies of South Sulawesi province are the aspect of leadership, quality of human resources, awareness and sensitivity, {{and the level of}} education of the officers and public awareness. Changing the culture and access to knowledge and technology, both among the officers and the society {{is the key to the}} success of participatory rural development. There are three important aspects in the effort to create the prospect of government management and participatory rural development aspects of leadership, good governance and the aspects of sensitivity and concern for the officers.

40|$|In the {{organizational}} {{structure of the}} police, the internal affairs division has the role of investigating professional misconduct attributed to police officers. When an improper conduct is detected, an investigation process is triggered. At {{the end of the}} investigation process, the complaint can be sustained or not. If the investigation discloses sufficient evidence to prove the accusation, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>should</b> suffer reprimand, suspension, termination of employment and criminal prosecution. There is room, however, for concerns regarding whether the process will be impartial, given that police officers may attempt at influencing decisions for their own benefit or, at least, try to postpone the conclusion of the investigation. In our paper, we analyze a sample of 143 investigation processes against police officers in the Internal Affairs Division of the Civil Police of the State of Bahia, Brazil. We seek to identify the factors that contribute to the investigation process are concluded or not. Our econometric results show that the position that the police officer has in the organization and his tenure on the job (which should be correlated with the extent of informal relationships developed within the organization) do influence the probability of the investigation will concluded or not. From {{the point of view of}} the individuals who are under investigation, the strategy of postponing the process is rational because once the process is concluded there is a high probability that the complaint will be sustained. Thus, results indicate that police officers seem to use formal and informal channels of influence to mitigate the threat of punishment‚Äîa conduct that is, therefore, misaligned with the public interest...|$|E
