5|$|In a dogfight, {{particularly}} when attacking Allied aircraft in a Lufbery circle, Marseille would often favour dramatically reducing the throttle and even lowering the flaps {{to reduce speed}} and shorten his <b>turn</b> <b>radius,</b> rather than the standard procedure of using full throttle throughout.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given <b>turn</b> <b>radius.</b> Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the <b>turn</b> <b>radius,</b> the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Cross Steering {{involves}} the use of a simple kinematic bar mechanism connecting the front and rear hub making the rear wheel to turn in an opposite direction as the front wheels are turned thereby performing the task of reducing the <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> of the vehicle. This paper aims to design, analyze and simulate the working of cross steering mechanism and to measure its effect on the <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> of a vehicle. The <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> of a vehicle is the size of smallest radial turn that a vehicle is capable of making. The use of this mechanism decreases the <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> considerably which in turn increases the vehicle’s maneuverability and its ability to take sharp turns. Therefore the main objective {{of this paper is to}} decrease the <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> as much as possible with minimum stresses and deflection on the cross bar. Through this paper, an optimum design of a cross steering system can be obtained. This setup can be applied on the vehicles which have high ground clearance (Lorry, buses All-terrain vehicles, Sports utility vehicles) and large <b>turning</b> <b>radius.</b> When applied on such vehicles this project has the potential to introduce a new concept for four wheel steering which is simpler and cheaper than any other technique.

5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the <b>turn</b> <b>radius.</b>|$|E
25|$|British {{air power}} in the theatre also intensified, chief amongst these being the Hawker Hurricane fighter, which forced a {{redeployment}} of Italian forces in response. Although considered to be inferior to the Hurricane in terms of speed, the C.200 had the advantage in terms of manoeuvrability, <b>turn</b> <b>radius,</b> and climb rate. According to aviation author Bill Gunston, the C.200 proved effective against the Hurricane, delivering outstanding dogfight performance without any vices.|$|E
25|$|The {{actual torque}} the rider must {{apply to the}} {{handlebars}} to maintain a steady-state turn is a complex function of bike geometry, mass distribution, rider position, tire properties, <b>turn</b> <b>radius,</b> and forward speed. At low speeds, the steering torque necessary from the rider is usually negative, that is opposite {{the direction of the}} turn, even when the steering angle is {{in the direction of the}} turn. At higher speeds, the direction of the necessary input torque often becomes positive, that is in the same direction as the turn.|$|E

25|$|The Mirage F1 used a shoulder-mounted swept wing, {{instead of}} the Delta wing of the Mirage III, which {{resulted}} in a more than 50% reduction in required runway lengths and increased internal fuel tankage for 40% greater combat range. The approach speed prior to landing is 25% less than the preceding Mirage IIIE. According to Dassault, the negative performance impact associated with the increased thickness of the Mirage F1's wing over the Mirage III's counterpart had been offset by improvements made to the propulsion system. The wing is fitted with both double-slotted trailing edge flaps and full-span leading edge slats, the latter being automatically operated to reduce the aircraft's <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> during combat.|$|E
25|$|When it {{was first}} {{introduced}} in August 1941, it quickly proved to be superior in all but <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> to the Royal Air Force (RAF) front-line fighter, the Spitfire Mk. V variant. The 190 wrested air superiority away from the RAF until {{the introduction of the}} vastly improved Spitfire Mk. IX in July 1942 restored qualitative parity. The Fw 190 made its air combat debut on the Eastern Front much later, in November/December 1942. The Fw 190 made a significant impact seeing service as a fighter and fighter-bomber. The fighter and its pilots proved just as capable as the Bf 109 in aerial combat, and in the opinion of German pilots who had flown both fighters, the Fw 190 presented increased firepower and manoeuvrability at low to medium altitude.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{losses to}} man-portable air-defense systems, MiG-21s were instrumental during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale; Cuban pilots became accustomed to flying {{up to three}} sorties a day. Both the MiG-21MF and the MiG-21bis were deployed almost exclusively in the fighter/bomber role. As interceptors they were somewhat unsuccessful due to their inability to detect low-flying South African aircraft. On November 6, 1981, a Mirage F1CZ achieved South Africa's first confirmed air-to-air kill since the Korean War when it destroyed Cuban Lieutenant Danacio Valdez's MiG-21MF with 30mm cannon fire. On 5 October 1982, Mirages escorting an English Electric Canberra on routine reconnaissance over Cahama were engaged by at least two MiG-21bis. A South African radar operator picked up the attacking MiGs {{and was able to}} alert the Mirage pilots in advance, instructing them to change course immediately. As they jettisoned their auxiliary tanks, however, they were pinpointed by the Cubans, who opened pursuit. In a vicious dogfight, SAAF Major Johann Rankin closed range and maneuvered into the MiGs' rear cones. From there, one of his two R.550 Magic missiles impacted directly behind the lead MiG and forced it down. The second aircraft, piloted by a Lieutenant Raciel Marrero Rodriguez, could not detect the Mirage's proximity until it had entered his <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> and was perforated by Rankin's autocannon. This damaged MiG-21 landed safely at Lubango.|$|E

2500|$|There is less {{agreement}} regarding {{measurements of}} the <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> and filament thickness: while the first models assigned a longitude of 25 Å, current X-ray diffraction data, backed up by cryo-electron microscopy suggests a longitude of 23.7 Å.

2500|$|On September 24, 1880 Pearce {{personally}} {{steered the}} Livadia from Govan to Greenock {{and then into}} the Firth of Clyde, reaching 12 knots. Tideman, present at the trials, wrote that the ship steered [...] "like a yawl." [...] Next day, the Livadia ran her first, unofficial, speed trial and made 15 knots. On September 26 the Livadia performed six hour long official trials presided by Russian Admiral Ivan Likhachev. She reached 14.88 knots with the engines running at 10,200 horsepowers. This time Tideman recorded somewhat wider than expected <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> under full power, but deemed it unimportant: the Livadia could still turn on a dime by disengaging one of the side propellers. On September 27 the Livadia reached her top recorded speed of 15.725 knots at 12.354 horsepower. Reports by Gulyaev and Reed compared Livadia to contemporary HMS Penelope, HMS Orion and HMS Iris which had similar displacements and engine power, and concluded that her efficiency was on par with conventional ships.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2010, ISC and the Avondale City Council {{announced}} plans for a $100 million long-term development for Phoenix Raceway. $15 million would go towards repaving the track {{for the first time}} since 1990 and building a new media center. The plans also include a reconfiguration of the track. The front stretch was widened from 52 feet to , the pit stalls were changed from asphalt to concrete, the dogleg (between Turn 2 and Turn 3) was moved outward by , tightening the <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> of the dogleg from 800 feet to 500 feet (152 m). Along with the other changes, progressive banking was added to the turns: Turns 1 and 2, which had 11 degrees of banking, changed to 10 degrees on the bottom and 11 degrees on the top. Turns 3 and 4, which had 9 degrees of banking, changed to 8 degrees on the bottom and 9 on the top. Project leader Bill Braniff, Senior Director of Construction for North American Testing Corporation (NATC), a subsidiary of Phoenix Raceway’s parent company International Speedway Corporation, said [...] "All of the changes – including the adjustment of the dog-leg – will be put in place in order to present additional opportunities for drivers to race side-by-side. We’re very confident that we’ll have multi-groove racing at Phoenix from Day 1 because of the variable banking that will be implemented.” The infield road course was also sealed off and removed from use, making Phoenix Raceway an oval-only facility. The reconfiguration project was completed by mid-August 2011, and on August 29–30, five drivers tested the new track, describing the new dogleg and backstretch as a [...] "rollercoaster" [...] as now when they enter it dips, then rises on exit and dips down going into turn 3, due to the elevation changes. [...] On October 4–5, several NASCAR Cup Series teams tested the oval which was open to the public. Seven–eight million dollars went towards connecting the track property to the Avondale water and sewer systems. Work began following the 2011 Subway Fresh Fit 500.|$|E

40|$|The Illinois agility test is a timed task {{suitable}} for wheelchair sports with multidirectional movements {{and it is}} commonly used to evaluate the agility performance of athletes. In addition to test times, tangential velocities and <b>turning</b> <b>radii</b> are parameters of high importance in the assessment of agility performance. The main objective {{of this study is to}} develop a method that allows the evaluation of the tangential velocity and <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> that are achieved during the Illinois agility test, which is usually used for training wheelchair rugby athletes. A group of nine Paralympic wheelchair rugby athletes performed three trials of the Illinois agility test using their own custom made chairs. The wheelchairs were instrumented with a 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) sensor (accelerometer/gyrometer). Linear accelerations, angular velocities and test times were recorded during the test. The investigation of obtained performance enabled identification of instantaneous radii and tangential velocities of the turning chair for each of the 11 turns of the Illinois test. To evaluate an athlete&# 039;s performance, hypotheses based on optimisation strategy of performance for the test&# 039;s turning circuit were considered as follows: (1) athletes produce a longer rc in turns 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9; (2) athletes produce a shorter rc (<b>turning</b> <b>radius)</b> in <b>turns</b> 2, 6 and 10; and (3) athletes produce a longer rc in turns 1 and 11.
