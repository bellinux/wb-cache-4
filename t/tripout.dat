5000|$|The George F. Weaton station went {{online in}} May 1958 under the {{ownership}} of Horsehead Corporation's predecessor, St. Joe Lead. Its namesake, George Frederic Weaton, was the former manager of the company's Monaca site and the man assigned to oversee {{the construction of the}} power plant. [...] Mr. Weaton died shortly after the power plant was completed, and a photograph of him turning one of the turbine throttle valves during its initial roll still hung in the main office stairwell until the plant's closure. The plant was originally intended to supply power to the zinc smelter without an interconnection to the local power grid and, as such, was black start capable. [...] One 1125 kilowatt alternating current diesel generator and one 100 kilowatt direct current diesel generator were installed for this purpose, as well as to supply power to the plant during emergency <b>tripout</b> situations. Coal was brought to the plant by barge, and was offloaded with a grab bucket barge unloader.|$|E
5000|$|I'd {{never seen}} a {{publication}} like this before. It was full of wild accusations and bawdy language and doctored photographs. It had President Johnsonâ€™s head in a toilet bowl. It had naked Slum Goddesses, truly bizarre personal ads, and a whole different slant on the anti-war movement than my hometown paper upstate. But best of all, it had the most outrageous comic strips. The continuing saga of Captain High; the psychedelic adventures of Sunshine Girl and Zoroaster the Mad Mouse; Trashman offing the pigs and scoring babes left and right. While I enjoyed many aspects of EVO, I liked the comics the most. Bill Beckman {{was one of the}} first cartoonists with his counterculture crusader Captain High, whose main mission was to get high and stay high. Beckman didn't draw very well, but EVOs readership could relate to the premise. Beckman contacted his buddy Gilbert Shelton from back at the University of Texas at Austin, who mailed in an occasional strip called Clang Honk Tweet!; Hurricane Nancy Kalish contributed a spacey, Aubrey Beardsley-style comic called Gentle's <b>Tripout.</b> Others came and went without much notice until Walter Bowart commissioned Manuel [...] "Spain" [...] Rodriguez to draw a 24-page all-comic tabloid, which he published as Zodiac Mindwarp in 1966.|$|E
40|$|Two general {{types of}} remote power {{controller}} (RPC) that combine {{the functions of}} a circuit breaker and a switch were developed for use in direct-current (dc) aerospace systems. Power-switching devices used in these designs are the relatively new gate-turnoff thyristor (GTO) and poweer metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET). The various RPC's can switch dc voltages to 1200 V and currents to 100 A. Seven different units were constructed and subjected to comprehensive laboratory and thermal vacuum testing. Two of these were dual units that switch {{both positive and negative}} voltages simultaneously. The RPC's using MOSFET's have slow turnon and turnoff times to limit voltage spiking from high di/dt. The GTO's have much faster transition times. All RPC's have programmable overload <b>tripout</b> and microsecond <b>tripout</b> for large overloads. The basic circuits developed can be used to build switchgear limited only by the ratings of the switching device used...|$|E
