40|$|We prove <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> {{property}} of classes of ordered structures with closures and given local properties. This generalises earlier results: the Nešetřil-Rödl Theorem, <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> {{property of}} partial orders and metric spaces {{as well as}} <b>the</b> author's <b>Ramsey</b> lift of bowtie-free graphs. We use this framework to give new examples of Ramsey classes. Among others, we show (and characterise) <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> property of convexly ordered S-metric spaces and prove <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> Theorem for Finite Models (i. e. structures with both functions and relations) thus providing the ultimate generalisation of Structural <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> Theorem. We also show <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> Theorem for structures with linear ordering on relations ("totally ordered structures"). All of these results are natural, easy to state, yet proofs involve most of the theory developed here. We characterise classes of structures defined by forbidden homomorphisms having a Ramsey lift and extend this to special cases of classes with closures. We apply this to prove <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> property of many Cherlin-Shelah-Shi classes.

2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{theories}} about the death of JonBenét.

2500|$|Smit {{assessed}} {{the evidence and}} concluded that an intruder had committed the crime. Smit's theory was that someone broke into the Ramseys' home through the broken basement window. The intruder subdued JonBenét using a stun gun and took her down to the basement. JonBenét was killed and a ransom note was left. Smit's theory was supported by former FBI agent John E. Douglas, who had been hired by the Ramsey family. [...] Believing that <b>the</b> <b>Ramseys</b> were innocent, Smit resigned from the investigation on September 20, 1998, {{five days after the}} grand jury convened against <b>the</b> <b>Ramseys.</b> While no longer an official investigator on the case, Smit continued to work on it until his death in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second group}} of {{theories}} is that a family member was involved in her death. Boulder police initially concentrated almost exclusively upon John and Patsy Ramsey. According to Gregg McCrary, a retired profiler with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, [...] "statistically, it is a 12-to-1 probability that it's {{a family member or}} a care giver" [...] who is involved in the death of a child. From the police's perspective, they did not see evidence of a forced entry, saw evidence of staging, such as the ransom note, and did not find <b>the</b> <b>Ramseys</b> cooperative in helping them solve the death of their daughter. <b>The</b> <b>Ramseys</b> had stated that their reluctance was due to their fear that there would not be a full investigation for intruders and that they would be hastily selected as the key suspects in the case, according to Daily Camera.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the police}} and the DA {{particularly}} said in 1998 that JonBenét's brother Burke, who was 9 {{years old at the time}} of her death, was not a suspect. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Ramseys</b> gave several televised interviews, but resisted police questioning except on their own terms. In October 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 grand jury had recommended filing charges against John and Patsy for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation and hindering the prosecution of an unidentified person who had [...] "committed ... the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death". However, the DA determined there was insufficient evidence and did not pursue an indictment. In 2002, the DA's successor took over investigation of the case from {{the police and}} primarily pursued alternative theories of a non-family intruder committing the killing. In 2003, a trace DNA taken from the victim's clothes was found to belong to an unknown male, inducing the DA in 2008 to send <b>the</b> <b>Ramseys</b> a letter of apology declaring the family [...] "completely cleared". In February 2009, the Boulder Police Department took the case back from the DA and reopened the investigation.|$|E

40|$|In the parlance of {{relational}} structures, <b>the</b> Finite <b>Ramsey</b> Theorem {{states that}} the class of all finite chains has <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> property. A classical result of J. Nešetřil and V. Rödl claims that the class of all finite posets with a linear extension has <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> property. In 2010 M. Sokić proved that the class of all finite structures consisting of several linear orders has <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> property. This {{was followed by a}} 2017 result of S. Solecki and M. Zhao that the class of all finite posets with several linear extensions has <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> property. Using <b>the</b> categorical reinterpretation of <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> property in this paper we prove a common generalization of all these results. We consider multiposets to be structures consisting of several partial orders and several linear orders. We allow partial orders to extend each other in an arbitrary but fixed way, and require that every partial order is extended by {{at least one of the}} linear orders. We then show that the class of all finite multiposets conforming to a fixed template has <b>the</b> <b>Ramsey</b> property. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1702. 0659...|$|R

2500|$|Lou Smit, {{a detective}} {{who came out}} of {{retirement}} to assist the District Attorney's office with the case in early 1997, presented the case to the Boulder police in May 1998 [...] together with other staff of the District Attorney's Office. They presented 437 items of evidence, and concluded that the evidence pointed away from <b>the</b> <b>Ramseys.</b> However, they were unable to successfully challenge the police department's steadfast belief that <b>the</b> <b>Ramseys</b> were guilty. The District Attorney's office sought {{to take control of the}} investigation. Due to the animosity between the police department and the DA's office and the pressure to obtain a conviction, Roy Romer, the governor of Colorado, interceded and named Michael Kane as special prosecutor to initiate a grand jury. Two of the lead investigators in the case who had opposing views, Lou Smit and Steve Thomas, resigned. Smit, who had worked for the DA's office, resigned because he believed that the investigation had incompetently overlooked the intruder hypothesis. Thomas, a police detective who later wrote a book about the case, initially cited health concerns when resigning, but later said he had done so because the DA's office had interfered with and failed to support the police investigation of the case.|$|E
2500|$|Burke, who {{was nine}} {{years old at the time}} of JonBenét's death, was interviewed by {{investigators}} at least three times.

In 1998, Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner said during an interview with a news reporter that Burke Ramsey was not involved in the killing of his sister. In May 1999, the Boulder County District Attorney's office reiterated that Burke Ramsey was not a suspect. The investigators had never considered him a suspect.|$|E
