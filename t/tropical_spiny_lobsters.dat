40|$|Spiny {{lobsters}} feed on a {{wide range}} of natural marine food. They prey nocturnally upon a diverse assemblage of epifaunal and infaunal organisms including molluscs (such as snails and clams), smaller crustaceans, echinoderms, polychaetes and algae (Lipicius and Cobb, 1994). Slow moving or sessile benthic marine invertebrates, which serve as main food of most spiny lobsters in the wild have also been found useful in culture trials of lobsters. Marine food items are preferred over terrestrial animal food by lobsters and among marine food sources, shellfish (particularly mussels) is preferred over finfish (Booth and Kittaka, 1994). <b>Tropical</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> have several amenable characteristics which make them suitable for aquaculture. Tropical lobsters are adaptable to captive conditions, less cannibalistic and relatively fast growing than their counterparts in the sub-tropical and temperate regions (Anon., 1994). The greatest hurdle in growing spiny lobsters is the difficulty in larval rearing and hence the culture of spiny lobster is still not commercially taken up in spite of significant advances made in recent years. However, since spiny lobsters mature and breed in captivity and as they can be grown communally; it seems likely that their commercial culture will be possible in the near future (Kittaka and Booth, 1994). The possibility of commercial culture of spiny lobsters in India has been reported (Kaleemur Rahman and Srikrishnadhas, 1994).

40|$|Of {{the various}} <b>tropical</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> {{species in the}} Indo-West Pacific region, Panulirus ornatus and P. homarus are {{emerging}} as the favoured species for aquaculture. This {{is based on a}} number of factors including market demand and pricing, availability of naturally settling seed (for on-growing), development of hatchery technology, suitability for captive growout and adaptability to a variety of production systems. Production to date is based only on naturally settled puerulus which in some areas of Vietnam and Indonesia are particularly abundant and easily caught. In Vietnam, more than 1, 500 tonnes of P. ornatus are farmed each year in sea cages, while in Indonesia lobster farming has begun in Lombok where large numbers of P. homarus seed settle each year. Further resources of seed are likely to be identified elsewhere in the archipelago. In Australia, exploitation of wild puerulus is uneconomic and the focus has been on hatchery technology which is now poised for commercialisation. Aquaculture production of lobsters is an attractive proposition worldwide, as the species are generally of high value, are in great demand and fishery production cannot be increased. Active research and development programs throughout the world have sought to develop this sector, but to date none have been successful, outside the developments referred to here. <b>Tropical</b> species of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> are likely to remain at the forefront of aquaculture production development because of the availability of wild seed, development of commercially viable hatcheries and their highly economic growout characteristics.

40|$|Development of <b>tropical</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> {{aquaculture}} {{has occurred}} in Vietnam and more recently in Indonesia based on the collection of naturally settling puerulus. Strong market demand for <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> and static fishery production has driven such development. High availability of lobster seed has been identified for exploitation particularly in some locations and fishing methods have been developed which make capture of these post-larval lobsters quite straightforward. Such pueruli availability may exist throughout the South East Asian region providing opportunity of industry expansion. A research project is supporting assessment of pueruli resources in Indonesia and providing baseline data on puerulus catch. Capture data over several years is now available which provide a comprehensive picture of spatial distribution, species composition, seasonability, inter-annual variability, catch per unit effort, pricing and total production. Methods of puerulus capture, their innovation and evolution are described. The delicate nature of pueruli has resulted in high mortality through the production chain and the processes involved in their handling and improvements recommended are discussed. In particular, a nursery phase close {{to the point of}} capture is advisable to produce robust juveniles suitable for transport to grow out locations. Management of the puerulus resources of Vietnam and Indonesia is advisable, but difficult given lack of information about the source breeding populations and effectiveness of the catching methods. Sustainability of the wild catch is of concern but may be offset by development of a hatchery supply. The lobster aquaculture industry of Vietnam has provided demonstrable benefit to coastal fishing communities and is likely to provide equivalent bene fit in Indonesia.

40|$|Interest in the {{development}} of aquaculture of the <b>tropical</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Panulirus ornatus, has increased markedly over the past 10 yr because of strong market demand and high prices. In Australia, economic conditions will necessitate that a semi-intensive approach be taken, possibly involving managed environmental conditions. Identification of optimal temperature and salinity levels will be necessary, and therefore two experiments were performed to examine these two parameters. Juvenile lobsters were grown in tanks at five temperatures (19, 22, 25, 28 and 31 C). Growth was significantly affected by temperature (P < 0. 01), and maximal growth occurred at 25 - 31 C. Examination of the temperature effect on molt increment and intermolt period indicated that 27 C was the optimal temperature, at which molt increment was greatest and intermolt period the least. Temperature also had a significant (P < 0. 01) positive effect on apparent feed intake (AFI). Juvenile lobsters were also exposed to four different salinities (20, 25, 30 and 35 ppt) over a period of 91 d. Significant differences (P < 0. 01) were apparent for both survival and growth. Lowest survival occurred at 35 ppt which may be attributable to higher cannibalism at that salinity. Growth was highest at 35 ppt and progressively less at lower salinities.

Here, we describe 13 novel polymorphic microsatellite markers developed for P. homarus, using a cross-species primer design strategy based on P. ornatus Roche 454 shot-gun generated sequencing. Microsatellite polymorphisms were assessed in 96 unrelated P. homarus individuals of a natural population, with the number of alleles per locus varying from 2 to 14, the observed and expected heterozygosity from 0. 00 to 0. 78 and from 0. 03 to 0. 79, respectively, and with only four loci (Pho-G 27, Pho-G 32, Pho-G 36, and Pho-G 58) deviating from Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic linkage disequilibrium analysis between all pairs of the loci showed significant departure from the null hypothesis between loci Pho-G 22 - Pho-G 30, and Pho-G 30 - Pho-G 35.

40|$|The <b>tropical</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Panulirus ornatus, is {{a commercially}} {{important}} Palinurid marine lobster species of high market value with wild populations {{distributed throughout the}} tropical and sub-tropical Indo-Pacific region. As wild populations of P. ornatus has been over-exploited, so there is interest {{in the development of}} this lobster aquaculture to meet current and rising market demand for supply. However, a major challenge for closed-life cycle production of Palinurid lobsters is the development of a commercially viable hatchery technology. There is minimum knowledge of larval nutrition, and in particular, the lipid requirements. The current study focused on investigations into the growth pattern and ontogenetic changes of lipid composition for early–mid stage P. ornatus (stages I–VI) under controlled laboratory conditions. Body wet weight (WW), dry weight (DW) and total body length (TBL) increased exponentially with the number of stages. There were large increases in WW, DW and TBL between stages I and VI, with increases of 4092 %, 3864 % and 504 %, respectively. The greatest increase in DW and WW was noted between stages III to IV while the greatest specific growth rate (SGR) was noted during stages I to II. The lipid class profile of phyllosoma was dominated by phospholipids (PL) for all early stages (I–V) despite the high triacylglyceride (TG) content of Artemia; which was the primary food source. The newly hatched phyllosoma contained higher percentages of total saturated fatty acids (SFA), 20 : 5 n 3 (EPA), 22 : 6 n 3 (DHA) and total highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) compared to that found in all other stages. From stages II to V, the total lipid, lipid class and fatty acid profile of phyllosoma resembled those of their diet with the exception of 20 : 4 n 6 (ARA). The increase in ARA concentration during phyllosoma development (stages II–V) suggested that mid-stage phyllosoma (IV and V) had a higher requirement compared to that noted in early-stage (II and III) phyllosoma. It was noted that early-stage (II and III) phyllosoma preferentially sequestered and accumulated a higher proportion of EPA and DHA compared to that present in their diets. These data indicate that early–mid stage P. ornatus phyllosoma have an ability to preferentially sequester, store or modify their dietary lipid composition to support normal growth and development. These results provide important morphometric date useful in the evaluation of larval feed and culture conditions as well as, providing baseline larval lipid nutrition data required for the development of artificial diets for P. ornatus phyllosoma...|$|R

As a foundation study in this area, the chemical composition of early-mid stage P. ornatus phyllosoma (Stages I-VI) receiving a novel formulated diet was analysed immediately prior and post-ecdysis to provide insight into the crude nutritional trends during the larval development cycle. From the onset of moulting, cyclical patterns were evident in the proximate composition of phyllosoma, resulting in substantial restructuring between the pre- and post-moult stages of the moult cycle. Proportions of protein, lipid and ash were high at the premoult stage, reflecting growth and nutrient accumulation over the intermoult period, and reduced at the post-moult stage, reflecting the large uptake of water to facilitate subsequent growth. Polar lipid was the dominant lipid class, accounting for >. 90 % of the total lipid content. Conversely, triacylglycerol concentrations were low (<. 5 %), despite being the principal lipid class available in the formulated diet. Likewise, despite receiving high concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3) (9. 2 and 7. 6 % of the dietary lipid source, respectively), levels of these fatty acids were comparatively low in phyllosoma (3. 4 and 4. 7 %, respectively). In contrast, there is selective deposition of these fatty acids in wild caught phyllosoma. This finding suggests a poor assimilation of triacylglycerols by captive larvae and highlights the importance of future investigations into alternative sources of EPA and DHA.

Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study was to assess the effects of two protein pre-digestion treatments: acid denaturation and enzyme hydrolysis, on a regular fishmeal ingredient in a novel formulated diet for early-mid stage P. ornatus phyllosoma (Stages III-VIII). Three iso-nitrogenous, iso-lipidic and iso-energetic diets were formulated with 100 % of protein originating from intact fishmeal (IFM), acid-denatured fishmeal (DFM) or enzyme hydrolysed fishmeal (HFM) and fed to early-mid stage phyllosoma for a period of 35 -days. Growth performance metrics were all significantly higher in phyllosoma receiving the HFM treatment compared to the DFM and IFM treatments. Phyllosoma fed the HFM diet also had the most advanced development stages, with a significantly greater proportion of individuals reaching Stage VII (2). No significant differences were detectable in either the protein-bound or FAA composition of phyllosoma across all treatments, suggesting that the superior growth performance of the HFM fed phyllosoma was the result of an increased abundance of intermediate, shorter chain dietary peptides. The present study suggests that enzyme hydrolysed fishmeal is a superior protein ingredient for artificial diets and most closely resembles the requisite dietary protein format for P. ornatus phyllosoma...|$|R
