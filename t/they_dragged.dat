5|$|The crowd {{traveled}} {{the distance from}} Paris to Versailles in about six hours. Among their makeshift weaponry <b>they</b> <b>dragged</b> along several cannons taken from the Hôtel de Ville. Boisterous and energetic, they recruited (or impressed into service) more and more followers as they surged out of Paris in the autumn rain. In their ambiguous but always aggressive poissard slang, they chattered enthusiastically about bringing the king back home. Less affectionately, they spoke of the queen, Marie Antoinette, and many had no restraint in calling for her death.|$|E
25|$|On 5 March, about 7000-8000 people {{broke into}} the Dimapur Central Jail. <b>They</b> <b>dragged</b> the accused out, while parading him naked, pelted him with stones and beat him. <b>They</b> <b>dragged</b> the accused to a clock tower about 7km away, by tying a rope to his waist from a motorcycle. The accused died on the way. The body was {{displayed}} from the clock tower's railings, until the police came and took it down. The Superintendent of Police Meren Jamir later said that the mob was led {{by a group of}} a few hundred school and college girls in uniforms, which prevented the police from using more force. Jamir said that the initial crowd was small and they had been repelled by baton charges. But, later the mob returned with larger numbers. Even though 8 companies of security forces were present at the jail, they failed to stop the mob. The police later said that there was at least one former inmate of the prison, who knew the interior layout of the jail.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of hours, the gunmen hunted {{door-to-door}} for foreigners. <b>They</b> <b>dragged</b> people from their hiding places, beating some who did not cooperate, and shooting others {{as they tried to}} run away. Some foreigners had their hands bound behind their backs, and some had their mouths taped. The gunmen affixed bombs to some of the captives. Some foreigners were helped by local Algerians, who helped them hide.|$|E

25|$|Another way the Mongols used {{deception}} and terror was by tying tree branches or leaves behind their horses. <b>They</b> <b>dragged</b> the foliage drag behind {{them in a}} systematic fashion to create dust storms behind hills to appear to the enemy as a much larger army, thereby forcing the enemy to surrender. Because each Mongol soldier {{had more than one}} horse, they would let prisoners and civilians ride their horses for a while before the conflict, also to fake numerical superiority.|$|E
25|$|In May 1958, {{the flag}} of China, the Wǔ Xīng Hóngqí, at a postage stamp {{convention}} was pulled down and damaged, but as Japan did not recognize the PRC at the time, the law was not applied. In February 2011, Japanese ultra-rightists held a protest over the Kuril islands dispute outside of the Russian embassy in Tokyo, during which <b>they</b> <b>dragged</b> a Russian flag on the ground; Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov stated that his ministry had asked the Japanese government to launch a criminal case over the incident.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of Friday, December 30, 2005 police raided the camp and clashes ensued in the {{presence}} of TV cameras and the press. <b>They</b> <b>dragged</b> the refugees across the street, pulled women from their hair and pushed the elderly carrying newborn babies. Refugees were put in public transit busses to be transferred to central security force camps in different locations in Egypt in addition to taking some of them to State security intelligence offices.

25|$|Lusitanias severe {{starboard}} list {{complicated the}} launch of her lifeboats. Ten minutes after the torpedoing, when she had slowed enough to start putting boats in the water, the lifeboats on the starboard side swung out too far to step aboard safely. While it was still possible to board the lifeboats on the port side, lowering them presented a different problem. As was typical for the period, the hull plates of Lusitania were riveted, and as the lifeboats were lowered <b>they</b> <b>dragged</b> on the inch high rivets, which threatened to seriously damage the boats before they landed in the water.|$|E
25|$|Steam trams {{relied upon}} their weight and {{adhesion}} for propulsion {{and as the}} town streets were badly paved, dirt, stones, manure and water got into the rail grooves. Water boys and track cleaners were employed {{to clean out the}} rail grooves with long iron bars, which <b>they</b> <b>dragged</b> along the rails, it being essential to ensure the wheel flanges ran fully in the grooves, to allow the wheel tread to grip the track. The specification of performance was strict, the vehicle had to be silent, had to emit no smoke and was required to have no exposed parts which could provide a safety hazard to pedestrians and horses. In Nottingham, only one steam tram was operated and being considerably heavier than a horse-drawn car, it, no doubt, caused considerable damage to the track.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June 2001, a Beechcraft B300C Super King Air 350, {{registration}} F-GOAE, {{departed from}} Le Mans-Arnage Airport (LME), France, to Santiago De Compostela Airport (SCQ), Spain, on a cargo flight according to instrument flight rules. Near the destination airport, the meteorological conditions {{were reported to}} be good, and the crew requested a visual approach to runway 17, even though the active runway was 35. Once cleared to land, the aircraft encountered a fog patch and from this moment it began a high ate descent (2000 to 3000ft/min). A minute after entering an unexpected and unforeseen fog patch, the aircraft struck some trees in level flight and with an airspeed of 148 kt. The wings and engines detached from the fuselage, and <b>they</b> <b>dragged</b> along a scrubland area until {{they came to a}} stop. The crew suffered minor injuries and the aircraft was completely destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into {{the wounds of}} an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, <b>they</b> <b>dragged</b> all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|E
25|$|The {{retribution}} began immediately. Hugh Despenser {{the elder}} {{had been captured}} at Bristol, and despite some attempts by Isabella to protect him, was promptly executed by his Lancastrian enemies– his body was hacked to pieces and fed to the local dogs. The remainder of the former regime were brought to Isabella. Edmund Fitzalan, a key supporter of Edward II and who had received many of Mortimer's confiscated lands in 1322, was executed on 17 November. Hugh Despenser the younger was sentenced to be brutally executed on 24 November, and a huge crowd gathered in anticipation at seeing him die. <b>They</b> <b>dragged</b> him from his horse, stripped him, and scrawled Biblical verses against corruption and arrogance on his skin. He was then dragged into the city, presented to Queen Isabella, Roger Mortimer, and the Lancastrians. Despenser was then condemned to hang as a thief, be castrated, and then to be drawn and quartered as a traitor, his quarters to be dispersed throughout England. Simon of Reading, one of the Despensers' supporters, was hanged next to him, on charges of insulting Isabella. Once {{the core of the}} Despenser regime had been executed, Isabella and Mortimer began to show restraint. Lesser nobles were pardoned and the clerks {{at the heart of the}} government, mostly appointed by the Despensers and Stapleton, were confirmed in office. All that was left now was the question of Edward II, still officially Isabella's legal husband and lawful king.|$|E
25|$|With {{the close}} of Aurangzeb's (1707) reign began a period of disorder. The Marathas, who had incursions in south Gujarat for about half a century sent an {{expedition}} against Ahmedabad upon hearing death of Mughal emperor. Under the command of Balaji Vishwanath, the Marathas won over Mughal army in the Panch Mahals, plundered as far as Vatva within five miles of the city, and were only bought off by the payment of £21,000 (Rs. 2,10,000). In the city the next years were marked by riots and disturbance. In 1709 an order came from the new Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah I (1707-1712), that in the public prayers, among the attributes of the Khalif Ali, the Shia epithet wasi or heir should be introduced. This order caused great discontent among the Ahmedabad Sunnis. They warned the reader {{not to use the}} word wasi again, and, as he persisted in obeying orders, on the next occasion <b>they</b> <b>dragged</b> him from the pulpit and stabbed him to death. Three or four years later (1713-1714) another disturbance broke out, this time between the Hindus and Muslims. A Hindu insisting on burning the Holi near some Muslim houses, the Muslims retaliated by killing a cow. On this the Hindus seized a lad the son of a butcher and killed him. Then the Muslims especially the Afghans rose, sacked, and burned shops. They attacked a rich jeweller, Kapurchand, who defended his ward, pol, with matchlock men and killed several of the rioters. For three or four days work was at a standstill. Next year (1715) in the city the riots were renewed, shops were plundered and much mischief done, and outside (1716), the Kolis and Kathis grew so bold and presumptuous as {{to put a stop to}} trade.|$|E

500|$|The {{evolution}} of tetrapods began about 400 {{million years ago}} in the Devonian Period with the earliest tetrapods evolved from lobe-finned fishes. Tetrapods are categorized as a biological superclass, Tetrapoda, which includes all living and extinct amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. [...] While most species today are terrestrial, little evidence supports the idea that any of the earliest tetrapods could move about on land, as their limbs could not have held their midsections off the ground and the known trackways do not indicate <b>they</b> <b>dragged</b> their bellies around. Presumably, the tracks were made by animals walking along the bottoms of shallow bodies of water. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.|$|E
500|$|Acoustic {{perturbations}} {{of initial}} density {{fluctuations in the}} universe made some regions of space hotter and denser than others. These differences in temperature and density are called anisotropies. Photons diffused from the hot, overdense regions of plasma to the cold, underdense ones: <b>they</b> <b>dragged</b> along the protons and electrons: the photons pushed electrons along, and these, in turn, pulled on protons by the Coulomb force. This caused the temperatures and densities of the hot and cold regions to be averaged and the universe became less anisotropic (characteristically various) [...] and more isotropic (characteristically uniform). This reduction in anisotropy is the damping of diffusion damping. Diffusion damping thus damps temperature and density anisotropies in the early universe. With baryonic matter (protons and electrons) escaping the dense areas along with the photons; the temperature and density inequalities were adiabatically damped. That {{is to say the}} ratios of photons to baryons remained constant during the damping process.|$|E

500|$|The mission had {{previously}} been attempted over the night of 11/12 September 1942, but had to be cancelled after the MTB arrived {{off the coast of}} France. The raiding party had been unable to locate their target because of the dark and foggy conditions. On 12 September 1942, their MTB left Portsmouth at 20:12 and reached the coast off Barfleur at about 22:00. Moving at a reduced speed to avoid detection and avoid the offshore mine fields, they reached their intended position offshore just after midnight on 13 September 1942. Observing the coastline, in the dark they incorrectly identified a valley which they believed was St Honorine, but was actually Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, about one mile to the right of their intended target. At around 00:20 hours the landing party headed toward the beach in a small collapsible flat bottomed boat known as a Goatley boat. After reaching the shore they realised they were too close to some houses to leave their boat where it was. <b>They</b> <b>dragged</b> the boat [...] east away from the houses and above the high water mark. Captain Lord Howard guarded the boat {{while the rest of the}} SSRF checked to area to ensure it was safe and they had not been observed landing.|$|E
500|$|Lonsdale Force's sector {{covered the}} {{southern}} end of the eastern perimeter, and Cain was one of three Majors defending this sector of the line. [...] As the battle progressed he became determined to destroy as much enemy armour as possible and sited himself in a laundry's garden, much to the chagrin of the Dutch owner. [...] Over the coming days Cain was everywhere, dealing with armour and snipers and encouraging his men. On the afternoon of Thursday 21st two tanks approached Cain's position. Guided by a colleague in a building above him, Cain waited in a trench until the first tank—actually a StuG III self-propelled gun (SPG)—was close enough to engage. The SPG fired at the building, killing Cain's colleague and showering him with masonry but despite this, Cain kept his position. [...] Staff Sergeant Richard Long of the Glider Pilot Regiment remembered that through the clouds of dust, Cain fired round after round from his PIAT until the SPG was disabled, but whilst engaging the second tank a round exploded in the PIAT with a bright flash and Cain was thrown backwards. Cain recalled thinking he was blind and [...] "shouting like a hooligan. I shouted to somebody to get onto the PIAT because there was another tank behind. I blubbered and yelled and used some very colourful language. <b>They</b> <b>dragged</b> me off to the aid post." [...] The British brought forward one of the Light Regiment's 75mm guns which blew the tank apart.|$|E
500|$|Rossbach also {{highlighted}} the extraordinary talents {{of two of}} Frederick's officers, the artillery colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller and his cavalry general, Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz. Both men possessed the much coveted coup d'œil militaire, {{the ability to see}} at a glance what must be done to tactical advantage. This attribute allowed them to use the artillery and cavalry to full potential., Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften , Band 22 (1885), S. 127–128. Frederick himself called this [...] "he perfection of that art to learn at one just and determined view the benefits and disadvantages of a country where posts are to be placed and how to act upon the annoyance of the enemy. This is, in a word, the true meaning of a coup d'œil, without which an officer may commit errors of the greatest consequence.", T. Egerton, Military Library, 1824. On the morning of the battle Frederick had passed over two senior generals and placed Seydlitz in command of the whole of his cavalry, much to those men's annoyance and to Seydlitz' satisfaction. Seydlitz had spent the interim of the peace (1748–1756) training the cavalry to perform at optimum speed and force. The other outstanding officer, Colonel Moller, had invested the interim in developing a highly mobile artillery force. [...] His artillery engineers were trained similarly to hussars, to ride to a battle and fight dismounted; {{in the case of the}} artillery, <b>they</b> <b>dragged</b> their guns around the battlefield as needed. This was not yet the flying artillery that Frederick developed later, but it was similar in structure and function. Later developments refined the training and usage.|$|E
