5|$|Little {{was born}} on 19 July 1895 at Hawthorn, a suburb of Melbourne, to Canadian James Little, a seller of medical and {{surgical}} books, and his Victorian-born wife Susan. His family heritage was Scottish, and he was educated at Camberwell Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne, {{where he was a}} swimming medallist. He entered his father's business as a <b>travelling</b> <b>salesman,</b> and was living with his family at Windsor when World War I broke out in August 1914.|$|E
5|$|After calling at Balestrand, Kommandøren {{proceeded}} to Leikanger, where the soldiers on board disembarked. While Kommandøren was docked at Leikanger, {{the village was}} attacked by a German aircraft. The aircraft dropped 11 bombs in three series on the area, before strafing people and cars on the ground. Amongst the targets were the soldiers unloaded by Kommandøren, the troops being on the march to nearby Hermansverk. The attack killed a <b>travelling</b> <b>salesman</b> from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, restaurateur Isak Roksvåg from Kommandøren and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen. While {{on the way to}} hospital in Lærdal with Kommandøren, Captain Johannessen died from his wounds.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} thesis became, after our pre-study, {{to find out}} if WAP can support <b>travelling</b> <b>salesmen</b> in a mobile environment and how such a WAP service should be design in an user-friendly and functional way. We studied theories around the subject WAP-technology and made an empirical study. A pre-study was carried out with visionaries in Internet and mobile technology to find a potential early-using WAP technology target group. Afterwards a WAP service based on an Intranet was developed. The application was used during the qualitative interviews with the <b>travelling</b> <b>salesmen</b> in whom they took part and formed an opinion about the WAP service. The <b>travelling</b> <b>salesmen</b> also gave their opinion regarding user-friendliness and functionality. The result of the investigation shows that WAP can support <b>travelling</b> <b>salesmen</b> in their work...|$|R

In the present, Will investigates the truth behind his father’s tales and travels to Spectre. He meets an older Jenny, who explains that Edward rescued the town from bankruptcy and rebuilt it with help from his friends from Calloway Circus. Will suggests that Jenny {{had an affair with}} his father, but she reveals while she loved Edward, he remained loyal to Sandra. Will returns home but learns Edward has had a stroke and stays with him at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 16 or 17, Cadron met a <b>travelling</b> <b>salesman</b> named Jean-Marie Jetté, {{possibly}} {{while at}} a family gathering, and married him on October 7, 1811 at the Church of Lavaltrie. Jean-Marie was the brother of Paul Jetté, Cadron's uncle by marriage, {{and at the time}} the two met he was in his thirties. After the wedding, Rosalie Cadron took her husband's name and was known as Rosalie Cadron-Jetté. Jean-Marie moved into Cadron-Jetté's parents' house with her, and undertook a new career as a farmer. In 1811, that house, along with the surrounding land and outbuildings, was donated to Cadron-Jetté and Jean-Marie by Cadron-Jetté's parents, on the condition that the parents be allowed to live there until their death, and that Cadron-Jetté and Jean-Marie assume the care of Cadron-Jetté's sister Sophie until her age of majority.|$|E
5|$|Strangeways Brewery {{was founded}} in 1778 by two grain merchants, Thomas Caister and Thomas Fry, just north {{of what is now}} Manchester city centre. Their {{principal}} customers were the cotton workers of Manchester, then a burgeoning mill town. Henry Boddington, born in 1813 in Thame, Oxfordshire, joined the brewery in 1832 as a <b>travelling</b> <b>salesman</b> when the brewery was in the possession of Hole, Potter and Harrison. Like most Manchester breweries at the time, it was a modestly sized operation. Boddington had become a partner by 1848, alongside John and James Harrison, and by this time the company went under the name John Harrison & Co. In January 1853, Boddington borrowed money to become its sole owner. Between Boddington's takeover until 1877, the brewery's output increased tenfold from 10,000 to 100,000 barrels a year, making it not only Manchester's largest brewery but {{one of the largest in}} the North of England, with over 100 tied houses. By 1883 Henry Boddington & Co. was a limited liability company. Henry Boddington's estate was valued at almost £150,000 when he died in 1886.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an Object-Oriented framework written in Java designed to implement Ant Colony Systems. Thanks to Object-Oriented methodology the proposed framework can be reused and adapted to implement Ant Colony Systems {{able to solve}} specific problems such as the <b>Travel</b> <b>Salesman</b> Problem, the Multicasting Problem in a Network, the Steiner Problem on Networks and so on. In {{the first part of}} this paper we introduce the framework showing how it has been designed and what are the base abstract classes the composed it. In the second part we describe how we adapted the framework to solve the <b>Travel</b> <b>Salesman</b> Problem showing how we specialized the base classes and what are the results we found. Finally in the third part we further specialize the framework to solve the Multicasting Problem in a Network, seen as an instance of the Steiner Problem on a Network. We describe how the Steiner problem can be solved by using an Ant Colony System and how the classes for the <b>Travel</b> <b>Salesman</b> Problem can be adapted to solve it, showing, at the end, the results we found. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{available}} evidence {{on the history of}} <b>travelling</b> <b>salesmen</b> in France and offers more general hypotheses about the role of this profession in the «Great Transformation». Based on literary evidence as well as diverse archival material, it examines the emergence of a profession of its own from the mid- 18 th century and its expansion and recognition as an emblem of modernity from the 1830 s {{to the beginning of the}} 20 th century. It advocates a more systematic study of <b>travelling</b> <b>salesmen</b> and their position in the Industrial Revolution, the birth of large, integrated firms, the middle class and changes in the embeddedness of commer-cial transactions...|$|R
5|$|Terry-Thomas {{made his}} {{professional}} stage début on 11 April 1930 at a social evening organised by the Union of Electric Railwayman's Dining Club in South Kensington. He {{was billed as}} Thos Stevens, but only appeared as a minor turn. His performance brought heckles from the drunken audience, but earned him a commission of 30shillings. After this, he played a few minor roles in Gilbert and Sullivan productions by the Edgware Operatic Society at the Scala Theatre. In 1933, he left Smithfield Market to work briefly with a friend at an electrical shop before he became <b>travelling</b> <b>salesman</b> of electrical equipment. He enjoyed the job and relished being able to dress up in elaborate clothing {{in order to make}} his pitch. In his spare time, he began playing the ukulele with a local jazz band called the Rhythm Maniacs. He took up dancing and formed a partnership with a sister of Jessie Matthews. The act starred in local exhibitions and at minor venues, and they earned well from it. News soon travelled of the couple's talent, and they were engaged as ballroom dancers at a hall in Cricklewood. He found the dance-style too restrictive and he left the act to try other aspects of entertainment.|$|E

25|$|By using dynamic {{programming}} {{on a tree}} decomposition or branch-decomposition of a planar graph, many NP-hard optimization problems may be solved in time exponential in √n or √nnbsp&lognbsp&n. For instance, bounds of this form are known for finding maximum independent sets, Steiner trees, and Hamiltonian cycles, and for solving the <b>travelling</b> <b>salesman</b> problem on planar graphs. Similar methods involving separator theorems for geometric graphs {{may be used to}} solve Euclidean <b>travelling</b> <b>salesman</b> problem and Steiner tree construction problems in time bounds of the same form.|$|E
