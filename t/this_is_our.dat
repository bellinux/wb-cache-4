5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

25|$|All bloody {{principles}} and practices we do utterly deny, with all outward wars, and strife, and fightings with outward weapons, for any end, or under any pretence whatsoever, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> {{testimony to the}} whole world. That spirit of Christ by which we are guided is not changeable, so as once to command us from a thing as evil and again to move unto it; and we do certainly know, and so testify to the world, {{that the spirit of}} Christ, which leads us into all Truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of this world.|$|E

500|$|In his {{theatrical}} debut, Gyllenhaal starred on the London {{stage in}} Kenneth Lonergan's revival of <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Our</b> Youth at the Garrick Theatre in 2002. Gyllenhaal said, [...] "Every actor I {{look up to}} has done theatre work, so I knew I had {{to give it a}} try." [...] The play, which had been a critical sensation on Broadway, ran for eight weeks in London's West End. Gyllenhaal received favorable critical reviews and an Evening Standard Theatre Award in the category [...] "Outstanding Newcomer".|$|E
500|$|Manson {{confirmed}} {{during his}} {{appearance at the}} 2010 Revolver Golden Gods Awards in April that the band had recorded 13 songs, and also {{expressed an interest in}} releasing the record in a different way from previous ones. Fred Sablan – guitarist for Twiggy's side-project Goon Moon – joined the band in July, and in October Twiggy described the upcoming album as being [...] "almost done", saying: [...] "It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone always says that, but I think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> best work so far. It's kind of like a little more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals, without sounding too pretentious." [...] Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal".|$|E

500|$|The album artwork was {{designed}} by John Lorenzi, who contributed to the covers on Megadeth's two previous albums, Endgame and United Abominations (2007). The title was revealed as 13, with Mustaine commenting [...] "I started playing guitar at 13 and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> 13th record and I was born on the 13th. As soon as I said I {{was going to call}} it '13', I started noticing 13 everywhere. They never used to have 13th floors in hotels but now they have them again." [...] One day later, the band revealed that the title would be rendered as [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] instead of 13. Drover stated in a subsequent interview that [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] had originally been the working title for the album. The cover artwork and track list for the album were revealed on September 7, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the video, Beyoncé said: [...] "We all see the {{headlines}} and we think what can I really do to help?... World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity {{for all of us to}} work together to make a difference. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E
500|$|The cinematographer for Loves of a Blonde was Miroslav Ondříček, like Forman a {{graduate}} of the national Czech film school. [...] Ondříček and Forman had met at Czechoslovakia's Barrandov Studios in the early 1960s when Ondříček was just learning to shoot feature films and Forman was struggling to create his own early projects. Ondříček was in full accord with Forman's reliance on non-professional actors, adopting a cinéma-vérité style compatible with orthodox socialist realism. Ondříček was schooled in documentary filmmaking and, as a result, he insisted on performing all photographic tasks, like focus, lighting and composing, personally. while refusing access to the set by all film editors, saying: [...] "The editor can only edit what I am filming. He can't use a master shot if he doesn't have it. He can't make a close-up if he doesn't have it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> [...] job." [...] Critics have often admired Ondříček's success in sustaining low-contrast lighting throughout the film, rendering [...] "a sweetly mysterious softness, as if a principle of compassion existed in the world alongside its cruelty".|$|E

500|$|Amy Odell of New York {{magazine}} {{praised the}} video and noted that [...] "the crazy twitchy behavior she exhibited in 'Telephone' returns to much delight, but with a wardrobe that's pure housewife instead of cold-blooded drag-queen murderer." [...] Odell also praised the playsuits in the video, which according to here were [...] "a classier, more mature version of 'tards." [...] In another review, Odell concluded [...] "It {{would be easy to}} credit the look of Beyoncé's new video to Lady Gaga's influence." [...] Francesca Stabile of The Village Voice gave a positive review for the video, writing, [...] "The retro-glam outfits, the oversized martini glass, the rolling around on the bed sobbing with eye makeup running down her face... <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> favorite Bey video ever. No one else can make doing household chores (dusting Grammys!) simultaneously look this good and this sad." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised Knowles' [...] "strong look" [...] completed by lumberjack shirt, bandana and denim hotpants in the video further comparing it with Amy Winehouse's. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone magazine described the video as a [...] "Douglas Sirk film through the eyes of David LaChapelle" [...] and noted that several scenes looked like Knowles was being photographed for Vogue magazine on the set of The Brady Bunch. He concluded that [...] "If Beyoncé was lobbying for a temptress role on Mad Men, 'Why Don't You Love Me,'... would make the perfect audition reel." ...|$|E
500|$|After touring {{in support}} of One by One, Dave Grohl was {{uncertain}} {{on what to do}} next with the Foo Fighters. He felt that rushing to do another record would not be creatively rewarding. Grohl considered a possible film score, and began writing acoustic songs, eventually amassing a full album's worth of songs. Grohl, not wanting to make a solo album and accepting the drift from his usual style, brought the songs to the Foo Fighters – [...] "who's to say what we should sound like?". Bassist Nate Mendel replied that the songs' uncharacteristic sound was [...] "why [...] should go on the record." [...] Grohl decided against an acoustic record, saying [...] "I have to have loud rock music in my life somewhere", and decided to make a double album, with [...] "one CD that's all the really heavy rock shit" [...] and another [...] "that's really beautiful, acoustic-based, lower dynamic stuff", which Grohl described as [...] "the bottle and the hangover", and also with the rock record being [...] "my Jack and Coke record" [...] with songs that [...] "I realise I cannot live without that", and the acoustic being [...] "my Sapphire-and-Martini-with-Kylie record". Grohl also stated a decisive moment in making a double album was uploading demos to his computer and realizing he had five hours of music, adding that [...] "we've been a band for 10 years now, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> fifth record, and I thought it would be boring to just keep making album after album and making videos and playing festivals, so I wanted to do something special." ...|$|E
