5|$|The Bearded Man {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees the Bearded Man in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see the Bearded Man flee. Doggett pursues the Bearded Man while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with the Bearded Man who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. The Bearded Man falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that it does not matter as long as the case is solved.|$|E
5|$|The case {{attracted}} commentary by two contemporary writers. John of Salisbury, who was {{a secretary}} for Theobald, added information about Osbert {{in a letter to}} Alexander III on unrelated business. In the section of the letter, John pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about Osbert, he had failed to secure other clergy willing to swear that he was innocent. Another contemporary, Gilbert Foliot, who was Bishop of Hereford, wrote to the pope <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that although Osbert's accuser had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal, this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Dark Gaia then attacks Sonic and Chip, but Chip protects Sonic {{and calls}} {{all of the}} Gaia temples {{together}} to form the Gaia Colossus and fight Dark Gaia. The Gaia Colussus seemingly destroys Dark Gaia, but Dark Gaia is not finished with them or the Earth yet, and consumes the entire world in darkness, becoming Perfect Dark Gaia in the process. Chip then gives the restored Chaos Emeralds to Sonic, allowing him to turn into Super Sonic and destroy it; Dark Gaia then sinks back into the planet, but the battle takes its toll on Super Sonic. Chip saves Sonic by throwing him to the surface, before returning himself {{to the inside of}} the planet; he leaves behind his necklace and some parting words. Sonic places the necklace on his hand as a bracelet <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of their adventure together before speeding off with Tails, flying alongside him on the coastline in the Tornado plane.|$|E
60|$|He rushed off again, puffing {{and blowing}} his 'ardest, {{in such a}} hurry that he forgot to give George the money for the tickets. However, George {{borrowed}} a pencil of Mrs. Mitchell in the train, and put down on paper 'ow much they cost, and Mrs. Mitchell said if George didn't like <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>'im</b> she would.|$|R

"When Joe Gubbins started {{digging up}} ’is garden {{people began to}} think they were all bewitched, and I went round to see Henery Walker to tell ’im wot a fine chance ’e’d got, and <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>’im</b> that I’d put another ninepence on ’im the night before.

5|$|Todd was {{initially}} a short-term villain, but his popularity {{with the audience}} and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison, like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past. While keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion. They took steps to redeem him and made him {{an integral part of}} OLTL canvas, despite Howarth's objections to a redemption storyline. With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc, the writers borrowed from nineteenth-century melodrama and Gothic traditions, and literature such as Frankenstein. Todd became the product of an affair between his father, Victor Lord, and his mother, Irene Manning, which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters, including his sisters, Tina and Victoria Lord. An important aspect of the character became his appearance, most notably the scar on his right cheek, which emerged as synonymous with him and served <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of his past misdeeds against Marty. Music and the use of humor were also key to Todd's development. Although he formed many relationships (including with his wives, Blair Cramer and Téa Delgado), and fathered children, a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy.|$|E
5|$|As the Enterprise arrives, {{the crew}} members explore the offerings of Farpoint Station and {{establish}} relations with their Bandi host, Groppler Zorn (Michael Bell). The crew becomes suspicious when items they desire seem to appear out of nowhere moments later, and are unable to identify the power source that feeds the station. Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), an empath, senses a being with powerful yet despairing emotions nearby, and the crew discover a strange labyrinth beneath the station, but Zorn does not offer an explanation. As the Enterprise crew continues its explorations, a large unknown alien craft enters orbit and begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement near Farpoint Station, and abducts Zorn. Before Picard orders the ship's phasers to be fired at the craft, Q appears <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of humanity's trial and prompts Picard to send an away team to the alien craft. The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint and {{they are able to}} free Zorn. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature, and Picard is able to deduce the mystery of Farpoint Station. He confirms with the apologetic Zorn that the Bandi found a similar lifeform injured on their planet and, while attempting to care for it, they also exploited its ability to synthesize matter to create Farpoint Station. The creature now in orbit is trying to help free its mate by attacking those who hold it captive.|$|E
25|$|After Lai Min's {{string of}} incidents, the Shu {{government}} specially appointed him as General Who Behaves Cautiously (執慎將軍). The {{name of his}} position was meant <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> {{to be mindful of}} his speech and conduct. He died sometime between 258 and 263 at the age of 97 (by East Asian age reckoning).|$|E

25|$|A disciple named Vakkali, {{who later}} became an arahant, was so obsessed by the Buddha's {{physical}} presence that the Buddha {{is said to have}} felt impelled to tell him to desist, and <b>to</b> have <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> that he should know the Buddha through the Dhamma and not through physical appearances.|$|R
60|$|The {{first part}} of the Jew's caution would have availed little, for when Mariano was roused he recked little of his own life; but the {{reference}} <b>to</b> others <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> of Angela and his father, so that he made up his mind to be a very model of forbearance whatever should happen.|$|R
25|$|During the {{leadership}} election, Lamont clashed angrily in private with Nigel Lawson who preferred Michael Heseltine as Thatcher's successor, phoning Lawson up <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of his caustic remarks made about Heseltine's economic policies. Lamont eventually slammed {{the phone down}} on Lawson in temper, though he later wrote to Lawson to offer an apology.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco stormed back, driving 70 {{yards in}} seven plays on a drive that {{consumed}} only 2:24 {{and ended with}} Garcia's 26-yard touchdown pass to Owens. Owens added a 2-point conversion catch on the next play, cutting the 49ers deficit to 38–22. After the play, an iconic scene of defensive lineman Michael Strahan walking over to Owens and pointing to the scoreboard <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of the deficit they still faced would be a highlight of the game.|$|E
25|$|Hnæf and his unnamed nephew, said {{also to be}} Hildeburh's son, {{are placed}} on a funeral pyre. After this most of the Danish warriors leave, but Hengest and {{probably}} some of the Danes stay throughout winter. Eventually a figure {{referred to as the}} son of Hunlaf places a sword on Hengest's lap <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of his loyalties. Other Danes also return, and probably together they wreak havoc on the Frisians and slay king Finn. The Danes take the unnamed Frisian queen back to what appear to be her own people in Denmark, identifying the Frisian queen as probably Danish.|$|E
5000|$|The Emperor {{continues}} to oversee his failing realm, where his subjects angrily protest their suspension in limbo {{between life and}} death. Harlequin appeals <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>reminding</b> <b>him</b> of his innocent childhood. The Drummer urges the Emperor to maintain his resolve, but the Emperor's memories turn his thoughts from {{his plans for the}} annihilation of all. Instead he gazes into a covered mirror and asks: [...] "What do men look like? Am I still a man or just the adding machine of God?" ...|$|R
60|$|The prior, {{despatched}} by the King, as we {{have seen}} in the last chapter, had by this time made way through the crowd, and laying hold on Douglas's rein, in a manner that made it impossible for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> advance, <b>reminded</b> <b>him</b> that the Prince was the son of his sovereign; and the husband of his daughter.|$|R
50|$|O'Malley meets her {{daughter}} Melissa (Carol Lynley). He is immediately attracted <b>to</b> Missy, who <b>reminds</b> <b>him</b> of Belle {{when they were}} lovers years ago. Breckenridge, meanwhile, hires O'Malley to drive his herd to Texas.|$|R
25|$|Wakka {{lost his}} younger brother Chappu to Sin {{a year before the}} events of Final Fantasy X, and he never fully {{recovered}} from it. He forms a close brotherly relationship with Tidus, partially fueled by his resemblance to Chappu, though Lulu constantly has <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that Tidus is not Chappu. As a devout follower of Yevon's teachings, Wakka believes that anyone who does not believe in Yevon, like the Al Bhed, are evil heathens, and is staunchly against the use of machina. However, he begins to question both his faith by the time Yevon's true colors are exposed to the world. Near the game's ending, Wakka denounces his prior beliefs entirely.|$|E
25|$|Following Sun Quan's {{death in}} May 252, the Grand Tutor Zhuge Ke, {{who had been}} {{appointed}} regent for Sun Quan's youngest son and successor, Sun Liang, proposed to the imperial court to move the nobles away from areas with a heavy military presence. He thus relocated Sun Fen from Wuchang to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi). However, Sun Fen turned furious {{when he heard about}} it and refused to move out of Wuchang. Zhuge Ke wrote a long letter to Sun Fen to warn him about the perils of not knowing his place and <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of the downfall of his fourth brother, Sun Ba, the Prince of Lu.|$|E
25|$|Regina confronts Hook at {{the docks}} <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> about what {{happened}} back in the Enchanted Forest, but Hook chokes her, saying times have changed. At Granny’s, Mary Margaret, David, and Henry choose to spend their last hours alive, while Emma reveals her plan to Regina {{that she wants to}} sacrifice herself of the darkness inside. Gold then hands over Excalibur to Emma and arranges for Belle to escape town and live her life. Regina and Robin then confront Zelena again, only to have Regina use Merlin's Wand to conjure up a magic tornado to send Zelena to Oz, with Zelena vowing to return. Emma prepares her plan to confront Hook, who appears at her house, but he has the upper hand after he transforms into Henry, fooling her into handing over Excalibur, which leaves her defenseless.|$|E

5000|$|Chapter 2: The {{following}} morning, the Buddha {{tells his}} story to the gathered disciples. He begins the story by telling of his previous life, in which the future Buddha {{was living in the}} heavenly realms surrounded by divine pleasures. In this previous life, he was known as the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva is enjoying the immense pleasures of his heavenly life, but due to his past aspirations, one day the musical instruments of the heavenly palace call out <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>reminding</b> <b>him</b> of his prior commitment to attain awakening.|$|R
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives {{the rest of the money}} to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E
25|$|Its story {{focuses on}} the trials of a young cop named Charlie, played by Geoffrey Kennedy, who at the {{beginning}} receives a phone call summoning him for what is presumably his first job. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of him standing next to his older brother Brian, played by Brian Krause, {{who is also a}} cop. The film then begins playing the song “Spore” as Charlie joins his brother and a third cop as they enter a residence where they find a dead girl and arrest two thugs, one played by Todd La Torre, as they return to the scene with a bag full of money. The second thug lunges at Brian when he pilfers some of the cash but Charlie restrains him. Later, the chief of police, played by R.J. Adams, is seen looking through a window as the second thug is telling a detective to just ask Charlie about what Brian did during the bust. The chief summons Brian and Charlie to his office where he demands the former to come clean with them but Brian is defiant, forcing the chief <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that his brother saw the whole thing. Charlie denies this at first but when the chief threatens to take punitive action against him as well and picks up the phone, he tells them where his brother hid the money, forcing Brian to surrender his badge and gun. Enraged at his brother for rolling on him, Brian physically assaults Charlie later in the police station's parking garage and then makes a quick getaway in a pickup truck driven by La Torre. While recovering at the hospital, Charlie finds solace with a kind and beautiful nurse named Cathy, played by Cathy Baron, {{and the two of them}} later get married. However, the film then rolls into the song “Midnight Lullaby” as Cathy is seen screaming and crying in agony as she dies during childbirth, leaving Charlie to raise their child alone.|$|E
500|$|A Widener curator's {{compilation}} of [...] "fanciful oral history" [...] recited by student tour guides includes [...] "Flowers mysteriously appear every morning outside the Widener Room" [...] and [...] "Harry {{used to have}} carnations dyed crimson <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of Harvard, and so his mother kept up the tradition" [...] in the flowers displayed in the Memorial Rooms.|$|E
50|$|Filled with abhorrence for the {{strength}} and prominence of the White supremacy of his childhood town, the Colonel does all he can to undo the workings of Mr. William Fetters. The Colonel imagines building a library for the Black residence and fixing up White schools. However, Laura convinces <b>him</b> not <b>to,</b> <b>reminding</b> <b>him</b> of the violence that would come from the White residents because of their dedication to preventing Black people by any means possible from moving up in society, including restricting Blacks' ability to educate themselves. As Laura predicted, the plans of the Colonel to reconstruct Clarendon are met with strong opposition. People who {{were a part of}} the White supremacy and majority show the Colonel great defiance and hostility.|$|R

60|$|Sir Piercie Shafton, whose brain seldom {{admitted}} {{more than}} one idea at a time, had hitherto pushed forward without very distinctly considering where he was going. But {{the sight of the}} Monastery so near <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>reminded,</b> <b>him</b> that he was still on dangerous ground, and that he must necessarily provide for his safety by choosing some settled plan of escape. The situation of his guide and deliverer also occurred to him, for he was far from being either selfish or ungrateful. He listened, and discovered that the Miller's daughter was sobbing and weeping bitterly as she rested her head on his shoulder.|$|R
500|$|As {{the crowd}} departs, the stump starts cackling {{and makes the}} charlatan confess. The stump cackles again, {{demanding}} the king never hurt a wizard again, and build a statue of Babbitty on the stump <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of his foolishness. The king agrees and heads back to the palace. Afterwards, a [...] "stout old rabbit" [...] with a wand in its teeth hops out from a hole beneath the stump and leaves the kingdom.|$|E
500|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Molotov's power began to decline. A clear sign of Molotov's {{precarious}} position was {{his inability to}} prevent the arrest in December 1948 for [...] "treason" [...] of his Jewish wife, Polina Zhemchuzhina, whom Stalin had long distrusted. Molotov never stopped loving his wife, and it is said he ordered his maids to make dinner for two every evening <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> that, in his own words, [...] "she suffered because of me".|$|E
500|$|Consumed by sport, Wills, to his father's chagrin, {{fell behind}} academically.

Suffering from homesickness, he decorated his study with objects <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>him</b> of Lexington, including Aboriginal weapons.
