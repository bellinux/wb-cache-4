25|$|Development resumed, {{to improve}} {{emissions}} durability and ready the engine for more stringent 1975 standards. The fuel injection was redesigned for better air distribution.

The device {{is compatible with the}} PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP GO, but the AV cable packaged with it requires an adapter to plug into the PSP GO's port. Instead of component RCA plugs, the PSP's YPbPr AV signal is carried through a D-sub 9 cable that screws into <b>the</b> <b>converter</b> box, which then converts the signal from analog to digital and upscales it to 720p through HDMI. Lenkeng also released a variant of the LKV-8000 with a button allowing the user to toggle between 720p and 1080p. To overcome the problems of PSP games being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black boarder, the LKV-8000 featured a Zoom button on the connector itself. This allowed players to fill screen natively, without any need to use the television's zoom function. A few other Chinese companies have also released clones of this upscaler under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay in full screen.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{suitability}} of three topologies for DC/DC converters in a DC wind farm grid is investigated from an energy efficiency and energy production cost point of view. The three selected topologies are <b>the</b> fullbridge <b>converter,</b> <b>the</b> single active bridge <b>converter</b> and <b>the</b> series parallel resonant <b>converter.</b> <b>The</b> losses are calculated for all three topologies {{as a function of}} the wind speed considering the losses in the semiconductor components and in the transformer. To obtain the average losses, the losses for each converter are integrated over the wind distribution for different average wind speeds. It is found that <b>the</b> resonant <b>converter</b> has <b>the</b> lowest losses of the three types for the DC wind farm application with power losses of about 2. 0 - 2. 5 % of the input power and <b>the</b> fullbridge <b>converter</b> has slightly higher losses with 2. 3 - 3. 5 % losses depending on the position in the wind turbine grid. The single active bridge converter has considerably higher losses than the other two topologies with 3. 5 - 5. 0 % losses. It is shown that the variable operating conditions create problems for all three converters, and as mentioned the single active bridge converter is most affected by the wide range of operation conditions. When comparing <b>the</b> resonant <b>converter</b> and <b>the</b> fullbridge <b>converter,</b> <b>the</b> fullbridge <b>converter</b> has a smaller transformer as well as lower peak current and peak voltage, but also a higher number of diode modules in the output bridge. Comparing the contribution to the energy production cost for <b>the</b> <b>converters,</b> <b>the</b> topology with the lowest contribution varies between the positions in the wind turbine grid. For some positions, the cost of the higher losses for <b>the</b> fullbridge <b>converter</b> are compensated by lower investment cost for <b>the</b> fullbridge <b>converter</b> compared to <b>the</b> resonant <b>converter.</b> Considering <b>the</b> resonant capacitor, the higher peak voltage and the variable frequency control for <b>the</b> resonant <b>converter,</b> <b>the</b> fullbridge <b>converter</b> is here found to be the most suitable choice for the wind farm application.

40|$|The ac-side {{terminal}} voltages of parallel-connected converters are different if the line reactive drops of <b>the</b> individual <b>converters</b> are different.
