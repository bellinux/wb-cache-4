500|$|The Great Silence has {{influenced}} {{the works of}} Quentin Tarantino. Describing the film as his favorite [...] "snow Western", he has paid homage to it in Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight. Robert Richardson, the cinematographer for The Hateful Eight, noted that he and Tarantino studied The Great Silences photography to get {{an understanding of the}} intimacy Tarantino wanted to achieve in the film. Upon being asked what his favorite Western films where, he responded with [...] "I do love The Great Silence, because Quentin <b>turned</b> <b>me</b> on to it and I love the cinematic nature of that, in the snow. But I'm going with Peckinpah if I've got to pick one".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Sonny and Cher's {{music had}} ceased to chart. According to Berman, [...] "the heavy, loud sound of groups like Jefferson Airplane and Cream made the folk-rock music of Sonny and Cher seem too bland." [...] Cher later commented, [...] "I loved the new sound of Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, the electric-guitar {{oriented}} bands. Left to myself, I would have changed with the times because the music really <b>turned</b> <b>me</b> on. But Son didn't like it—and that was that." [...] Their monogamous lifestyle during the period of the sexual revolution and the anti-drug position they adopted {{at the height of the}} drug culture eventually made the duo lose their popular appeal among American youths. According to Bego, [...] "in spite of their revolutionary unisex clothes, Sonny and Cher were quite 'square' when it came to sex and drugs." [...] In an attempt to recapture their young audience, the duo produced and starred in the film Good Times (1967), which was commercially unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|Jagger and Richards {{shared an}} admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter, which {{influenced}} Brian Jones, of whom Richards says, [...] "He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's {{all the same}} shit, man, {{and you can do}} it.'" [...] Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, [...] was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair. [...] "Keith and Brian <b>turned</b> <b>me</b> on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four." [...] Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R artists, said it [...] "seemed the most real thing" [...] he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the [...] "most powerful music [...] ever heard... the most expressive."

[...] "Miss Me" [...] has Lil Wayne rapping jokes, including a crude punch line about sucking [...] "the brown" [...] off his penis and subsequently groaning, [...] "Ewwww, that's nasty."

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967 Cooney took {{a leave of absence}} from WNDT and, funded by Carnegie Corporation, {{traveled}} the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. [...] She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled [...] "The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education". [...] The report, which Gikow called [...] "a schematic for the show Sesame Street would become", described what the new show would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW). [...] Cooney later stated that her undergraduate training in Education helped her research and write the study, and that it, along with her Emmy, provided her with credibility in the eyes of both the experts she interviewed and the new show's funding sources. [...] Davis credited Cooney's motivation to be involved with the project with her journalism skills, learned early in her career, and her idealism, which drove her to want to, as she put it, [...] "make a difference". [...] She later told an interviewer, [...] "I could do a thousand documentaries on poverty and poor people that would be watched by a handful of the convinced, but I was never really going to have an influence on my times". [...] She later told Davis, [...] "Preschoolers were not necessarily my thing. [...] It was using television in a constructive way that <b>turned</b> <b>me</b> on".|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} some {{months in the}} United States, Stan began working on the track in October 2013 at the two-weeks inaugural international songwriting FonoCamp in 2013, held in Azuga, Romania, where she met various Romanian and international artists. [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] was written by Lee Anna James, Naz Tokio, Sebastian Jacome and Alexandru Cotoi, while being solely produced by Jacome and Cotoi. When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This might sound like a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes to just let go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, so I do hope it has helped them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan. Florin Grozea of newspaper Adevărul felt the line [...] "I won't spend another day with you inside my head... How could you be so cruel? <b>Turned</b> <b>me</b> into a liar."

The failure of the mission marked {{a turning point in}} his political world-view from largely apolitical to strongly Reaganite, which was further reinforced by the September 11 attacks. Bannon has stated that, [...] "I wasn’t political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter f---ed things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer. Still am. But what <b>turned</b> <b>me</b> against the whole establishment was coming back from running companies in Asia in 2008 and seeing that Bush had f---ed up as badly as Carter.

2500|$|In early October 1978, Vaughan and Double Trouble {{earned a}} {{frequent}} residency performing {{at one of}} Austin's most popular nightspots, the Rome Inn. During a performance, Edi Johnson, an accountant at Manor Downs, noticed Vaughan. She remembered: [...] "I'm not an authority on music—it's whatever <b>turned</b> <b>me</b> on—but this did." [...] She recommended him to Manor Downs owner Frances Carr and general manager Chesley Millikin, who was interested in managing artists, and saw Vaughan's musical potential. After Barton quit Double Trouble in mid-November 1979, Millikin signed Vaughan to a management contract. Vaughan also hired Robert [...] "Cutter" [...] Brandenburg as road manager, whom he had met in 1969. Addressing him as Stevie Ray, Brandenburg convinced Vaughan to use his middle name on stage.|$|E
2500|$|Meeting Schumpeter at {{this point}} {{completely}} changed the direction of Georgescu's life and career. Schumpeter warmly welcomed Georgescu to Harvard, and soon {{introduced him to the}} now famous 'circle', {{one of the most remarkable}} groups of economists ever working at the same institution, including Wassily Leontief, Oskar Lange, Fritz Machlup and Nicholas Kaldor, among others. Georgescu was now situated in a stimulating intellectual environment with weekly evening gatherings and informal academic discussions, where Schumpeter himself presided as the 'ringmaster' of the circle. In Schumpeter, Georgescu had found a competent and sympathetic mentor.

2500|$|Years later, in his autobiography, Brando remarked: [...] "Tony Quinn, whom I admired professionally {{and liked}} personally, played my brother, {{but he was}} {{extremely}} cold to me while we shot that picture.

[...] Brando related that, to create on-screen tension between the two, [...] "Gadg" [...] (Kazan) had told Quinn—who {{had taken over the}} role of Stanley Kowalski on Broadway after Brando had finished—that Brando had been unimpressed with his work. After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him. It was only many years later, after comparing notes, that Brando and Quinn realized the deception.|$|E
