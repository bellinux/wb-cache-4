Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from Darrell's negligent care.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the plot}} of the game are two main {{characters}}, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral. The two characters are childhood friends, and while both are born of differing social classes; Ramza a noble and Delita a commoner, both disregarded this fact and grew up together believing in justice and honor, as taught by Ramza's father Balbanes. However, as the story progresses, the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoint on life; Delita seeks <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> upper class to achieve his dreams, while Ramza believes in justice and honor regardless of name and class.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings that are designed <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> Steam storefront and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam {{is unlikely to be}} granted.|$|E

5|$|If Wilde's {{period at}} the helm of the {{magazine}} was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, one can also argue that it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor is forced to learn <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> literary marketplace on his own terms.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{traffic in}} the mid-1980s changed the politician's interests, and in 1988 Parliament voted {{to build a new}} main airport at Hurum, located {{on the same side of}} Oslo as Fornebu, but further away. However, new weather data showed that Hurum was unsuitable, and the {{location}} was discarded. There were accusations that the data was fabricated <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> political decision. In 1992, parliament made a final vote that started construction of a new airport at Gardermoen and mandated the closure of Fornebu.|$|E

5|$|Iridion began {{development}} as a shooter for the Game Boy Color; when Shin'en decided to drop development and shift their focus to the Game Boy Advance, Iridion was the first game by the developer {{to appear on the}} system. Though billed as a 3D game, Shin'en used realtime encoding and resizing <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> size of 2D sprites instead of creating a true 3D environment. More room on the game cartridge was available for graphics due to the game's use of the GAX Sound Engine, which allowed real-time decoding of song data in a small file size.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} are fully aware of Veridian's nature, and often try <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> system {{in order to stop}} bad things from happening to them (and sometimes to mitigate the evil effects of some of Veridian's projects). They are also all susceptible to the potential rewards the company can offer despite the consequences of their actions, such as the company's attempt to hire Lem's mother, or the company's introduction of scented light bulbs with known flaws. Much of the comedy of the show comes from {{the characters}}' navigation of these morally ambiguous areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominance}} of the emperor {{was based on the}} consolidation of certain powers from several republican offices, including the inviolability of the tribunes of the people and the authority of the censors <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> hierarchy of Roman society. The emperor also made himself the central religious authority as Pontifex Maximus, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders. While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate, the emperor's powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate.|$|E
5000|$|Weight Shift: In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>manipulating</b> <b>the</b> brakes, a paraglider pilot {{must also}} lean {{in order to}} steer properly. Such weight shifting {{can also be used}} for more limited steering when brake use is unavailable, such as when under [...] "big ears" [...] (see below). More advanced control techniques may also involve weight shifting.|$|R

5|$|Bonded by Blood {{commenced}} {{the recording}} of its first full-length, Feed the Beast, in January 2008 at J Street studios in Sacramento, California with producer Michael Rosen. At first, the recording sessions were going well, but when the band finish off Rosen began <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> songs in ways that musicians were not enjoying it. The band then decided to re-record the album in the same studio where they recorded the Extinguish the Weak EP. Earache released Feed the Beast on May 9 in the United Kingdom and June 24 in the United States. Bonded by Blood supported the album with the Thrashing Like a Maniac tour. They toured the United States between June and July along with Fueled by Fire and Merciless Death, and in Europe between September and October with Gama Bomb headlining.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic period Motul de San Jos√© {{was located}} between two {{mutually}} hostile powers, the great city of Tikal {{to the north}} and the breakaway kingdom of Petexbat√∫n to the southwest, which had become a vassal of Tikal's implacable enemy Calakmul. In Mesoamerica, such border states as Motul de San Jos√© became centres of political activity as they tried <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage. This {{seems to be the case}} at Motul de San Jos√© with its rich ceramic tradition being a testament to the politically motivated banqueting that took place in the city. In the 8th century, although Motul de San Jos√© was the capital of the Ik polity, the aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within the political hierarchy of the state while remaining subordinate to the ruling lord of the capital city.|$|E
5|$|Later in that year, the {{collaboration}} between monarch and premier, {{coupled with the}} fact that TƒÉtƒÉrescu had successfully attracted nationalist votes from the Iron Guard, led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter, the National Peasants' Party (the main democratic opposition group), and the National Liberal Party-BrƒÉtianu ‚Äî the pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> votes in elections. (A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR, which had decided to back the National Peasants' Party prior to the elections, eventually supported the electoral pact.) TƒÉtƒÉrescu's own alliance policy rose the anger of his opponents inside the PNL, as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist Romanian Front and German Party.|$|E

5|$|SpaceChem was ported to the iPad in October 2011, using touch {{controls}} {{instead of}} mouse and keyboard <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> visual program. An Android port {{was released in}} July 2012. Both mobile platforms include most of the full game excluding the defense puzzles. The sandbox mode was added {{at the request of}} a player who was trying to explore SpaceChem computational abilities. Alongside the sandbox mode, Zactronics offered a contest for the most interesting sandbox creation. This same user was able to demonstrate a brainfuck interpreter within SpaceChem, claiming that the visual programming language was Turing complete. Barth has mentioned the possibility of a sequel in an interview with IndieGamer.|$|E
5|$|The main protagonist is Aeron, {{a former}} soldier from {{the kingdom of}} Athos. Three {{years prior to the}} start of the game, a wounded Aeron was given shelter by Elena, an Elyrian.

They are accompanied on their journey to the Thirteen Towers by Mavda, a woman of the Vestra tribe who is the current guardian of the Towers. Her tribe have the ability <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> chains of fate, and gives Aeron the Oraclos Chain weapon to both aid him in his quest and maintain a connection with Elena.|$|E
5|$|The project {{suffered}} a setback on 12 March 1969, when the rotor on prototype #3 (s/n 66-8828) struck the fuselage and caused the aircraft to crash, killing the pilot, David A. Beil. The accident occurred {{on a test}} flight where the pilot was <b>to</b> <b>manipulate</b> <b>the</b> controls to excite 0.5P oscillations (or half-P hop) in the rotor; 0.5P is a vibration that happens once per two main rotor revolutions, where P is the rotor's rotational speed. The accident investigation noted that safety mechanisms on the controls had apparently been disabled for the flight. The investigation concluded that the pilot-induced oscillations {{had set up a}} resonant vibration that exceeded the rotor system's ability to compensate. After the investigation, the rotor and control systems were modified to prevent the same problem from occurring again.|$|E
