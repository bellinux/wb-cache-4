25|$|Intertidal organisms, {{especially}} those in the high intertidal, must cope with a large range of temperatures. While they are underwater, temperatures may only vary by a few degrees over the year. However, at low tide, temperatures may dip to below freezing or may become scaldingly hot, leading to a temperature range that may approach 30°C (86°F) during a period of a few hours. Many mobile organisms, such as snails and crabs, avoid temperature fluctuations by crawling around and searching for food at high tide and hiding in cool, moist refuges (crevices or burrows) at low tide. Besides simply living at lower tide heights, non-motile organisms may be more dependent on coping mechanisms. For example, high intertidal organisms have a stronger stress response, a physiological response of making proteins that help recovery from <b>temperature</b> <b>stress</b> just as the immune response aids in the recovery from infection.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{species can}} rapidly change colour through {{mechanisms}} that translocate pigment and reorient reflective plates within chromatophores. This process, {{often used as}} a type of camouflage, is called physiological colour change or metachrosis. Cephalopods such as the octopus have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this, whereas vertebrates such as chameleons generate a similar effect by cell signalling. Such signals can be hormones or neurotransmitters and may be initiated by changes in mood, <b>temperature,</b> <b>stress</b> or visible changes in the local environment. [...] Chromatophores are studied by scientists to understand human disease and as a tool in drug discovery.|$|E

If these stresses exceed the tensile strength of the slab, it may be considered that cracking occurs in the slab.

Approach: Here, the simultaneous DC and <b>temperature</b> <b>stresses</b> degradation was investigated to see the changes of nonlinear coefficient (&# 945;) in Zn-Bi-Ti oxide low-voltage varistor ceramics sintered at various sintering temperatures (1140 - 1260 °C) and two sintering duration times of 45 and 90 min.
