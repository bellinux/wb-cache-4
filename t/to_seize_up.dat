40|$|Military {{doctrine}} prescribes {{a rational}} approach to decision making. By contrast, academics {{point at the}} intuitive approach that commanders actually apply. Experienced decision makers are able <b>to</b> quickly <b>seize</b> <b>up</b> a situation, and they can, based on their intuition, reach an appropriate decision. However, intuitive decision making {{can also lead to}} suboptimal decisions as compared to decisions based on rational models. The drawback of rational decision making is that is a time-consuming and cumbersome process. This paper presents an explorative study that investigated if the quality of intuitive decision making can be improved by a newly developed technique of perspective-taking. The question is whether this form of intuitive decision making can reach effectiveness levels of rational decision making, but with a considerable time reduction. Military officers, in one of three conditions (rational, intuitive, intuitive and perspective-taking), were asked to make two complex, division level decisions. The results suggest that intuitive decisions are suboptimal compared to rational decisions, but intuitive decisions followed by perspectivetaking have similar quality to rational decisions, and are realised in a much shorter time. 1...|$|R

Nevertheless, Lane Fox was, on the orders of the divisional commander, Major-General Thomas, immediately replaced as Commanding Officer of 43 Recce (1 October 1944).|$|R

Shortly afterwards, just as it was growing dark, we came to the first line of fortifications, which consisted of a triple stone wall pierced by a gateway, so narrow that a man could hardly squeeze through it. We passed this without question, being accompanied by Wambe's soldiers. Then, came a belt of land three hundred paces or more in width, very rocky and broken, and having no huts upon it. Here in hollows in this belt the cattle were kraaled in case of danger. On the further side were more fortifications and another small gateway shaped like a V, and just beyond and through it I saw the koppie we had planned <b>to</b> <b>seize</b> looming <b>up</b> against the line of mountains behind.|$|R
50|$|About 55,000 American seamen served {{aboard the}} privateers. They quickly sold their prizes, {{dividing}} their profits with the financier (persons or company) {{and the state}} (colony). Long Island Sound became a hornets' nest of privateering activity during the American Revolution (1775-1783), as most transports to and from New York went through the Sound. New London, Connecticut was a chief privateering port for the American colonies, leading to the British Navy blockading it in 1778-1779. Chief financiers of privateering included Thomas & Nathaniel Shaw of New London and John McCurdy of Lyme. In the months before the British raid on New London and Groton, a New London privateer took Hannah in what {{is regarded as the}} largest prize taken by any American privateer during the war. Retribution was likely part of Gov. Clinton's (NY) motivation for Arnold's Raid, as the Hannah had carried many of his most cherished items.American privateers are thought <b>to</b> have <b>seized</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 300 British ships during the war. The British ship Jack was captured and turned into an American privateer, only to be captured again by the British in the naval battle off Halifax, Nova Scotia. American privateers not only fought naval battles but also raided numerous communities in British colonies, such as the Raid on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (1782).|$|R

5000|$|York {{was cast}} as the first Darrin Stephens in the 1960s sitcom, Bewitched, as Samantha's (Elizabeth Montgomery) mortal husband. The show was a huge success and York was {{nominated}} for an Emmy Award in 1968. Because of his back injury, which sometimes caused him <b>to</b> <b>seize</b> <b>up</b> in debilitating pain, the scripts for some of his later episodes on Bewitched were written around his being in bed or on the couch for the entire episode. York suffered little to no pain {{for the first two}} seasons, but after the third season, the pain worsened considerably, frequently causing shooting delays and York requiring assistance to walk around. In spite of his suffering, York maintained a professional presence on camera. While filming the fifth season-episode Daddy Does His Thing, York fell ill: [...] "I was too sick to go on. I had a temperature of 105, full of strong antibiotics, for almost 10 days. I went to work that day but I was sick. I lay in my dressing room after being in make-up, waiting to be called on the set. They knew I was feeling pretty rotten, and they tried to give me time to rest. I kept having chills. This was the middle of the summer and I was wearing a sheepskin jacket and I was chilling. I was shaking all over. Then, while sitting on a scaffolding with Maurice Evans, being lit for a special effects scene: They were setting an inky - that's a little tiny spotlight {{that was supposed to be}} just flickering over my eyes.

He started to help me down and that's the last thing I remember until I woke up on the floor. That's about all I remember of the incident...and I'd managed to bite a very large hole in the side of my tongue before they could pry my teeth apart." ...|$|E
40|$|At {{the start}} of the {{subprime}} crisis 2007, highly rated structured finance products started to appear much riskier than traditional investments carrying similar ratings. Subsequently, investors lost confidence in the ratings and the novel products themselves, leading markets for the products <b>to</b> <b>seize</b> <b>up</b> and thus to severe adverse consequences for the global financial system. This paper examines and compares the risk properties of one-layer (i. e., ABS) and two-layer (i. e., ABS-CDO) securitizations within a simulation analysis that generates asset values by a model with both macro-economic and idiosyncratic risk. The setup also allows for correlated default rates between different ABS asset pools. The results show that the process of (re-) securitization 1) substitutes diversifiable idiosyncratic risks by non-diversifiable systematic risk, and 2) magnifies the impact of errors/changes in estimates of the underlying collateral pool assets’ risk characteristics, making second-generation securitization tranches much more sensitive to stress scenarios...|$|E

That was followed by Operation Bluecoat, the advance east of Caen as the Falaise pocket formed. Transferred to XXX Corps, the division liberated Brussels. It led the XXX Corps attack in Operation Market Garden, the ground forces' advance to relieve airborne troops aiming <b>to</b> <b>seize</b> the bridges <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Arnhem, capturing Nijmegen bridge in conjunction with American paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division. The Tac HQ reached Arnhem but was not able <b>to</b> <b>seize</b> the bridge because German anti tank guns were entrenched on the North side and the British airborne had surrendered or were too far away to help. During the Ardennes offensive, it was sent in bitterly cold weather, which forced the tanks to start their engines every hour to prevent diesel fuel freezing, to the Meuse as a reserve in case the Germans broke through the American lines; some German tanks breaking through were stopped. It endured hard fighting in Operation Veritable, the advance towards the Rhine through the Reichswald, and again in the advance through Germany. The division existed until 12 June 1945, more than two months after Victory in Europe Day, when it was reorganised as an infantry division, the Guards Division, after almost exactly four years as an armoured division.|$|R
