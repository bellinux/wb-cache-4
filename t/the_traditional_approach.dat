Belushi became the most successful male comedy star in the world until his 1982 death; Bacon also became a star, and he, Matheson, and Allen are {{among those who have}} had lengthy acting careers.

It was the first robotic fish capable of outperforming real carangiform fish in terms of average maximum velocity (measured in body lengths/ second) and endurance, the duration that top speed is maintained. This build attained swimming speeds of 11.6BL/s (i.e. 3.7m/s). The first build, iSplash-I (2014) was the first robotic platform to apply a full-body length carangiform swimming motion which was found to increase swimming speed by 27% over <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>approach</b> of a posterior confined waveform.|$|E

Parametric linkage analysis is <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>approach,</b> whereby {{the probability that a}} gene important for a disease is linked to a genetic marker is studied through the LOD score, which assesses the probability that a given pedigree, where the disease and the marker are cosegregating, is due to the existence of linkage (with a given linkage value) or to chance. Non-parametric linkage analysis, in turn, studies the probability of an allele being identical by descent with itself.|$|E

Our approach is highly asynchronous and fully distributed that makes it suitable for extreme-level scaling.

It accomplishes adaptive mesh restructuring in just 1 global collective call as compared to O(d) calls in <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>approaches.</b> A new distributed load balancer has been developed that led to an improvement in performance by 18 %.

25|$|Faced with a {{shortage}} of infantry replacements during the enemy's counteroffensive, General Eisenhower offered black soldiers in service units an opportunity to volunteer for duty with the infantry. More than 4,500 responded, many taking reductions in grade to meet specified requirements. The 6th Army Group formed these men into provisional companies, while the 12th Army Group employed them as an additional platoon in existing rifle companies. The excellent record established by these volunteers, particularly those serving as platoons, presaged major postwar changes in <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>approach</b> to employing Negro troops.|$|E
25|$|For example, if {{the given}} {{manifold}} is a -sphere, then one can picture the tangent space {{at a point}} as the plane that touches the sphere at that point and is perpendicular to the sphere’s radius through the point. More generally, if a given manifold is thought of as an embedded submanifold of Euclidean space, then one can picture a tangent space in this literal fashion. This was <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>approach</b> toward defining parallel transport and was used by Dirac. More strictly, this defines an affine tangent space, which is distinct from the space of tangent vectors described by modern terminology.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{factors that}} influence male involvement in reproductive health in western Kenya. Qualitative study design was used. From December 2008 to February 2009, data were collected via in-depth interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) at three provinces of western Kenya.

25|$|The {{distinction}} {{on whether}} an uprising is an insurgency or a belligerency {{has not been}} as clearly codified as many other areas covered by the internationally accepted laws of war for two reasons. The first is that international law traditionally does not encroach on matters that are solely the internal affairs of a sovereign state, but recent developments such as the responsibility to protect, are starting to undermine <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>approach.</b> The second is that at the Hague Conference of 1899, there was disagreement between the Great Powers who considered francs-tireurs to be unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture, and smaller states, which maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants. The dispute resulted in a compromise wording being included in the Hague Conventions known as the Martens Clause from the diplomat who drafted the clause.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} hone {{the manner in}} which things, media and big data are interconnected, it is first {{necessary}} to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that s in media approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>approach</b> of using specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead tap into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations. The ultimate aim is, of course, to serve or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with the consumer's mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring the messages (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various data-mining activities.|$|E

This essay has defined {{with the use}} of cases to demonstrate the successful attempts to depart from <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>approach</b> set by the Hughes and the High Trees cases. The parameters of this doctrine seem presently not to be clearly defined. These consequences have caused the parameters of promissory estoppel to be no longer an established and well-settled area, which may interpret a huge problem to the development of contract law. The threats to the limitations of promissory estoppel, manifested from the continuing evolution of promissory estoppel, may pose turbulence in contract law and open the flood gate to litigation. Therefore, the application of the modern promissory estoppel replaces the traditionally limitations set in the landmark cases. This equitable doctrine which originally acts as an exception to the doctrine of accord and satisfaction with subject to limitations now appears as an open and unlimited doctrine.|$|E
