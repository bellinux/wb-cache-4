25|$|Five {{independent}} {{witnesses were}} called to testify {{on behalf of the}} defense as to Collins' whereabouts on the dates Karen Sue Beineman had disappeared and her body had been found. Four of these witnesses were employees of a motorcycle sales firm which Collins had visited on the afternoon of Beineman's disappearance. Each testified on August 6. The timing of these four witnesses' recollections as to when Collins had actually entered the motorcycle shop varied slightly, although consensus among three of these men was that he had entered the premises as they were eating lunch, which they typically did anytime between one and two p.m. Upon cross-examination, the <b>time</b> <b>factor</b> of these witnesses as to when they had actually seen Collins expanded to between noon and two p.m. Two of these employees had signed statements affirming the time Collins had entered their premises was approximately two p.m., although one of these witnesses stated he had been repeatedly harassed by an Ann Arbor Police Sergeant as to the actual time he had seen Collins.|$|E

LucasArts, pleased with earlier collaborations with the company, decided to use Factor 5's engine for its new game.

Rogue Squadron and Factor 5 production manager Brett Tosti stated, [...] "That whole scene was actually the genesis for Rogue Squadron because everybody said, 'Why don't you do a whole game like that?' So we did." [...] Factor 5 initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to the fans' favorite action sequences from the Star Wars films. This proposal was rejected, however. At that time, LucasFilm was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films.|$|E

However, the most demanding part of the project was the construction, transport and installation of the armoured turrets and the armament itself. Two companies had been previously contracted for the construction of other fortifications in Sweden, Swedish AB Bofors-Gullspång and French Compagnie des Forges de Châtillon, offers from both companies existed already in 1901, {{but it was not until}} after tests conducted in December 1902 that the Swedish company was contracted and given royal approval on 26 May 1903.

500|$|Despite the {{cancellation}} of the PC version {{at the same time}} as the Xbox 360 release as a result of Microsoft's decision, Remedy's Oskari Häkkinen stated that [...] "PC gaming is part of Remedy's heritage" [...] and that the developers still wanted to release a PC version of the game. Remedy continued pressing Microsoft to allow the creation of a PC version, eventually gaining it in mid-2011; Häkkinen attributed Microsoft's agreement partially to their repeated requests, but as well as Remedy's good standing with Microsoft, and the <b>time</b> <b>factor,</b> having the PC version be available ahead of American Nightmare. Development of the PC version began in earnest, with a small team from Remedy working with Finnish independent developer Nitro Games. Instead of starting from the scrapped PC version, the team worked from the Xbox 360 code and added in new features to take advantage of more powerful elements on modern PC machines. Core to the PC version was to make sure that the game played well using typical keyboard and mouse controls in addition to a controller, and to assure the graphics exceeded the limitations of the Xbox 360; Matias Myllyrinne, Remedy's CEO, stated that these elements were important, as [...] "If this is not tuned to perfection, all the visuals are lost and the emotional touchstones are missed". The PC version was completed in about five months, and the game formally announced to the public in December 2011.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} examines {{the importance of}} <b>time</b> <b>factors</b> as predictors of success in language learning. <b>Time</b> <b>factors</b> are periods of time which students spend on language learning. The research addresses four main questions: (1) {{what is the nature}} of the relationship between language learning and time; (2) what is the relative importance of <b>time</b> <b>factors</b> to language learning; (3) to what extent can <b>time</b> <b>factors</b> predict success in language learning; and (4) what do students spend most time on? A group of 118 students of French and EFL at the Universities of Sussex and Brighton completed a questionnaire during the period March to May 1995. This questionnaire collected data on the periods of time students spent on language learning and on student proficiency levels, using self-report instruments. This data was triangulated with similar data collected from 23 interviewees, and 6 case-study students. The results of a correlational analysis indicated that total hours of study and active residence was the best predictor of student proficiency, and that there seemed to be a logarithmic relationship between this predictor and proficiency. The best multiple regression model accounted for 67 % of variance in proficiency levels. Students of French spent most time on classwork and homework, whereas the EFL students spent most time chatting to non-native speakers and listening to the radio...|$|R

2500|$|The {{first look}} of the film was {{supposed}} to be released along with Dharma Productions' We Are Family on 3 September. Later the trailer was withdrawn from We Are Family. The official reason given for the postponement of the trailer was the <b>time</b> <b>factor</b> as the producers felt {{that there was a lot}} of time before the release of Guzaarish, and hence it was decided Guzaarish's first promotional trailer would feature in theaters a month later with Siddharth Anand's Anjaana Anjaani. However the real story was that there were some concerns over a sequence showing Aishwarya Rai puffing away frantically at a cigarette in the trailer. While smoking is not entirely prohibited in Indian films, it is certainly seen to be injurious to health, especially since the one smoking on screen is a global icon playing a nurse. Sources close to the film revealed, [...] "Aishwarya is not really smoking in Guzaarish.

40|$|The present paper proposes an {{evolutionary}} credibility model {{that describes the}} joint dynamics of mortality through time in several populations. Instead of modeling the mortality rate levels, the time series of population-specific mortality rate changes, or mortality improvement rates are considered and {{expressed in terms of}} correlated <b>time</b> <b>factors,</b> up to an error term. Dynamic random effects ensure the necessary smoothing across time, as well as the learning effect. They also serve to stabilize successive mortality projection outputs, avoiding dramatic changes from one year to the next. Statistical inference is based on maximum likelihood, properly recognizing the random, hidden nature of underlying <b>time</b> <b>factors.</b> Empirical illustrations demonstrate the practical interest of the approach proposed in the present paper...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{one-dimensional}} parabolic potential barrier V (x) = V 0 − mγ 2 x 2 / 2, {{as a model of}} an unstable system in quantum mechanics. The timeindependent Schrödinger equation for this model is set up as the eigenvalue problem in Gel’fand triplet and its exact solutions are expressed by generalized eigenfunctions belonging to complex energy eigenvalues V 0 ∓ iΓn whose imaginary parts are quantized as Γn = (n + 1 / 2) ℏγ. Under the assumption that <b>time</b> <b>factors</b> of an unstable system are square integrable, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of them. This assumption leads to the separation of the domain of the time evolution, namely all the <b>time</b> <b>factors</b> belonging to the complex energy eigenvalues V 0 − iΓn exist on the future part and all those belonging to the complex energy eigenvalues V 0 + iΓn exist on the past part. In this model the physical energy distributions worked out from these <b>time</b> <b>factors</b> are found to be the Breit-Wigner resonance formulas.
