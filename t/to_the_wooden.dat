5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E

50|$|Wooden flute player Jean-Michel Veillon {{was one of}} <b>the</b> first musicians <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> flute <b>to</b> play Breton music.

Veillon has recorded and performed in a duo with Breton guitarist Yvon Riou and has also continued to record as a soloist.

25|$|The {{line was}} opened in 1911 {{to serve the}} Mont Park Asylum complex, with the {{construction}} expense met by the government Health Department. Electrification on the line was commissioned on 14 September 1928, five years after that on the main line. Steel stanchions were used to support the overhead wiring, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> posts then used on single lines of railway in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|On 18 November 1987, {{the station}} {{was the scene of}} a devastating fire that killed 31 people. The cause was {{attributed}} to a lit match falling into the space under the escalator, setting fire to the grease and rubbish present there, then <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> parts of the escalator. The then-unknown fire phenomenon of the trench effect made the fire develop upwards and finally caused it to explode into the station.|$|E

25|$|The adze is {{depicted}} in ancient Egyptian art from the Old Kingdom onward. Originally the adze blades were made of stone, but already in the Predynastic Period copper adzes had all but replaced those made of flint.

25|$|The {{origins of}} Hadaka Matsuri date back 500 years when worshippers competed to receive paper talismans called Go-o thrown by the priest. These paper talismans were tokens of the {{completion}} of New Year ascetic training by the priests.

However, as paper is easily destroyed, the talismans were changed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> ofuda that we know today.|$|E

25|$|A {{flexible}} flyer or steel runner sled is a steerable wooden sled {{with thin}} metal runners whereby a rider may sit upright on the sled or lie on their stomach, allowing {{the possibility to}} descend a snowy slope feet-first or head-first. To steer the sled, the rider may either push on the wooden cross piece with their hands or feet, or pull on the rope attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> cross-piece. The flexible flyer was invented in 1889 by Philadelphia resident Samuel Leeds Allen. U.S. patent #408,681 was issued to Allen on August 13, 1889.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the name is obscure. It may derive from the Latin virga meaning a rod, perhaps {{referring}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> jacks that rest {{on the ends of}} the keys, but this is unproven. Another possibility is that the name derives from the word virgin, as it was most commonly played by young women, or from its sound, which is like a young girl's voice (vox virginalis). A further view is that the name derives from the Virgin Mary as it was used by nuns to accompany hymns in honour of the Virgin.|$|E
25|$|The Reggiane Re.2000 is an Italian all metal, low-wing {{monoplane}} fighter aircraft. It {{holds the}} distinction of being the first aircraft to be designed by Reggiane to employ aluminum stressed skin construction, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wooden</b> or mixed wood and metal structures that had been traditionally used in contemporary Italian aircraft such as the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 (which had been previously produced by Reggiane under license). The stressed skin fuselage was highly streamlined, save for the protrusions of the hard-rivetted finish. The majority of the aircraft's exterior, including the tail, was metal-coated; however, the control surfaces had fabric coverings.|$|E
