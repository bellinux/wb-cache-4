50|$|On Day 59, Josh {{was called}} to the Captains Quarters, where he {{was taken out of}} the house to see his parents. They told him of the sudden death of his only sibling, Toby. Josh spent the night outside of the house, where he made the {{decision}} to stay with his family and not return to the house.On Day 60, housemates were informed of the situation, and said their goodbyes {{in the early hours of}} Day 60. Out of respect for Josh and his family, Big Brother turned the cameras off for these goodbyes. As a result of Josh leaving, voting lines for eviction were closed—with any votes cast prior being invalidated—and the funds donated to the Salvation Army; a choice by Josh and his family. Also, the weekly challenge was ended prematurely and live feeds from the official website were paused. The upcoming eviction was also canceled, instead replaced with Josh's return to say thank you to the public for their support which was followed by <b>the</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>used</b> 'highlights' show.|$|E

30|$|The new European Directive 2013 / 59 /EURATOM {{requires}} that patients are {{informed about the}} risk associated with ionising radiation and that detailed information on patient exposure {{is included in the}} radiological report.

Here we propose a new mammography dose index consistent with the average glandular dose (AGD).|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This case {{highlights}} the clinical usefulness of three-dimensional (3 D) echocardiography. The diagnosis of inter-ventricular septal defect associated with aortic regurgitation has been {{performed in a}} 50 -year-old man using 3 D echocardiography. This advanced echocardiography could accurately reproduce the anatomy of the defect and provide further insights in the mechanisms of aortic regurgitation showing an unusual non-coronary cusp prolapse. <b>The</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>use</b> of 3 D echocardiography in clinics might allow a better characterization of cardiac anatomy, especially of aortic valve disorders...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Campylobacter spp. are {{important}} causative agents of gastrointestinal infections in humans. The most frequently isolated strains of this bacterial genus are Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. To date, genetic methods for bacterial identification {{have not been}} used in Bulgaria. We optimized the multiplex PSR assay to identify Campylobacter spp. and differentiate C. jejuni from C. coli in clinical isolates. We also compared this method with <b>the</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>used</b> biochemical methods...|$|E
40|$|Two {{magnetic}} macroporous cellulose cation exchangers (Iontosorb MG CM 100 and Iontosorb MG SHP 100) {{were used}} for one-step isolation of lysozyme from native, undiluted hen egg white. Highly purified lysozyme (purity > 96 %) with specific activity {{similar to that of}} commercial lysozyme preparations was obtained in both cases. Carboxymethyl-based cation exchanger exhibited substantially higher capacity for lysozyme; maximum adsorption capacity was 138 mg/mL. The lysozyme-depleted egg white can be used {{in the same way as}} <b>the</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>used</b> egg white because no dilution of this material was necessary during the purification process...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} non-radioactive {{technique}} based on O-cresolpthalein complexone assay {{was developed to}} study in vitro non-radioactive calcium (40 Ca) deposition by isolated matrix vesicles. Using this technique, the effect of various phosphoester substrates including ATP, AMP and β-GP on in vitro MV-calcification was studied. O-cresolpthalein complexone assay with non-radioactive calcium demonstrated that AMP or β-GP were more effective in promoting calcium deposition by isolated MVs than ATP. The application of this non-radioactive technique, which is highly sensitive and simple, would offer a useful alternative approach to <b>the</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>used</b> radiometric biomineralization assay which employs radioactive 45 Ca...|$|E

40|$|We propose {{statistical}} methods for comparing phenomics data {{generated by the}} Biolog Phenotype Microarray (PM) platform for high-throughput phenotyping. Instead of <b>the</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>used</b> visual inspection of data with no sound inferential basis, we develop two approaches. The first approach is based on quantifying the distance between mean or median curves from two treatments and then applying a permutation test; we also consider a permutation test applied to areas under mean curves. The second approach employs functional principal component analysis. Properties of the proposed methods are investigated on both simulated data and data sets from the PM platform. ...|$|E
40|$|Besides <b>the</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>used</b> {{broad-band}} x-ray spectrometer (Dante or SXS), ablative shock-wave {{method is}} often used to diagnose the radiation fields of laser-driven Hohlraums. The x-ray ablation process of Aluminum and Titanium is studied numerically with a 1 -D radiation hydrodynamic code RDMG [F. Tinggui et al., Chin. J. Comput. Phys. 16, 199 (1999) ], based on which a new scaling relation of the equivalent radiation temperature with the ablative shock velocity in Aluminum plates is proposed, and a novel method is developed for determining simultaneously the radiation temperature and the M-band (2 - 4 keV) fraction in laser-driven gold Hohlraums...|$|E
40|$|Using German {{establishment}} data, {{we examine}} the relationship between delayed compensation, training, and hiring of older workers. Both those establishments that delay compensation and those with greater human capital requirements are less likely to hire older workers. We demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>used</b> control for the age of existing workers is endogenous and that instrumenting provides stronger evidence for the role of delayed compensation. Specifically, delayed compensation is simultaneously a negative determinant of hiring older workers but a positive determinant of employing older workers and, thus, more clearly associated with “employing older workers but not hiring them. ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} the synthesis and characterization of biotinylated analogue of N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and its use {{as a tool to}} study AEA transport and trafficking through biochemical and morphological techniques. In particular biotinylated AEA (b-AEA, for which we propose the common name MM 22) is suitable to design highly sensitive and simple methods for the non-radioactive detection and quantitation of AEA from complex samples, which would offer a useful alternative approach to <b>the</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>used</b> radiometric assays.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{generalized}} {{version of the}} tight-binding approach to determine the electronic coupling parameter in charge (hole) transport phenomena in organic materials. The main novelty {{of this approach is}} that the “embedding effects” of the environment either a solvent or a crystal packing can be explicitly included in the calculation by considering an embedded dimer. One of the main features shown by the application of the method to both model systems and oligoacene crystals is that <b>the</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>used</b> “energy splitting in a dimer” approximation gives reasonable results even if the transfer units are not equivalent by symmetry but the embedding effects are properly taken into account...|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>routinely</b> <b>used</b> MRI {{sequences}} are two-dimensional (2 D), fast spin-echo (FSE) sequences (proton-density (PD)-weighted, T 1 —weighted sequences, and T 2 - and T 1 —weighted sequences {{with and}} without fat suppression). When comparing with spin-echo (SE) sequences, FSE sequences facilitate the examination in a shorter overall time without statistically significant differences in meniscal tear detection rate [19]. By using high-magnetic field strength with dedicated coils, and parallel imaging techniques, the scan time may be decreased even more. Some particular types of meniscal tears have been proven to be better evaluated on specific sequences (e.g. coronal T 2 -weighted images showed a 96  % diagnostic accuracy compared with 85  % accuracy of PD-weighted coronal images for diagnosis of medial meniscal roots tears) [15].|$|E
