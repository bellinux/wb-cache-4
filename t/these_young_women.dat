500|$|Many of {{the younger}} captives were adopted into the Indian tribes or French Canadian society. Thirty six Deerfield captives, mostly {{children}} and teenagers {{at the time of}} the raid, remained permanently. Those who stayed were not compelled by force, but rather by newly formed religious ties and family bonds. [...] Captive experience was largely dictated by gender as well as age. Young women most easily and readily assimilated into Indian and French Canadian societies. Nine girls remained as opposed to only five boys. These choices reflect the larger frontier pattern of incorporation of young women into Indian and Canadian society. <b>These</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> remained, not because of compulsion, fascination with the outdoor adventure, or the strangeness of life in a foreign society, but because they transitioned into established lives in new communities and formed bonds of family, religion, and language. [...] In fact, more than half of young female captives who remained settled in Montreal where [...] "the lives of these former Deerfield residents differed very little in their broad outlines from their former neighbors." [...] Whether in New France or in Deerfield these women generally were part of frontier agricultural communities where they tended to marry in their early twenties and have six or seven children. [...] Other female captives remained in Native communities such as Kahnawake. These women remained because of bonds of religion and family. While European males castigated the [...] "slavery" [...] of Indian women, captive women from this time commonly chose to remain in Native society rather than return to colonial English settlements.|$|E

2500|$|After marrying George Thomas, Dyer {{trained as}} a nurse. From contact with a midwife, Ellen Dane, she learned of an easier way to earn a living—using her own home to provide lodgings for young women who had {{conceived}} illegitimately and then farming off the babies for adoption or allowing them to die of neglect and malnutrition. (Ellen Dane was forced to decamp to the US, shortly after meeting Amelia, to escape {{the attention of the}} authorities.) Unmarried mothers in Victorian Britain often struggled to gain an income, since the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act had removed any financial obligation from the fathers of illegitimate children, whilst bringing up their children in a society where single parenthood and illegitimacy were stigmatised. This led to the practice of baby farming in which individuals acted as adoption or fostering agents, in return for regular payments or a single, up-front fee from the babies’ mothers. Many businesses were set up to take in <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and care for them until they gave birth. The mothers subsequently left their unwanted babies to be looked after as [...] "nurse children".|$|E

2500|$|... {{place in}} Cambodia, {{a country in}} desperate need after {{essentially}} all of its educated class were destroyed by the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s. In June 2005, the Harpswell Foundation completed a four-room school building {{in the village of}} Tramung Chrum, about 50 miles from Phnom Penh. In July 2006, the Foundation completed a dormitory and leadership center for college women in Phnom Penh, which allows outstanding women to attend college. This dormitory serves all the colleges in Phnom Penh {{and is one of the}} first dormitories for women in Cambodia. Not having a safe place to live while attending college has been the major obstacle preventing young women from outside Phnom Penh (over 90% of the population) to receive a college education. Colleges in Cambodia do not provide housing for their students. Male students can live in the Buddhist temples, but female students cannot. The dormitory and leadership center houses 36 women, who have been selected on the basis of their intelligence, ambition, and leadership potential. In addition to providing free housing, food, and medical care, the facility gives <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> free classes in English and computer skills; readings and discussion of current events in Cambodia and the world to develop their critical thinking skills; and a weekly leadership seminar. In 2010, the Harpswell Foundation completed a second dormitory and leadership center for college women in Phnom Penh, housing 48 young women. The new facility has a large conference room, called the Hall of Great Women, where we hold national conferences on the theme of women's empowerment. In 2017, Harpswell launched a new program in leadership for young professional women from all ten countries of Southeast Asia: Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei. The program consists of an intense, two week summer program in Penang Malaysia, with lectures and workshops in critical thinking, civic engagement, Southeast Asian geography and society, technology and communication, and gender issues. The program will have a total of 25 participants each year and will develop a strong alumnae association.|$|E

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer in women, and for those younger than 50 years of age, it {{is the leading cause of}} death in the United States (1). However, the {{survival}} rate for <b>these</b> <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> with breast cancer has improved continuously over the past two decades, primarily because of the widespread introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapies (2).

From the per-spective of cancer control, younger breast cancer survivors are an important target population for interventions that focus on phys-ical and psychological symptom relief, cancer prevention, and risk reduction. To identify potential opportunities for cancer prevention and control interventions in this population, we undertook a systematic review of the literature focused on potentially mutable outcomes.
