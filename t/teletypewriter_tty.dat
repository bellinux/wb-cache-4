2500|$|Title IV of the ADA {{amended the}} {{landmark}} Communications Act of 1934 primarily by adding section [...] This section requires that all telecommunications {{companies in the}} U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments. When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, {{it led to the}} installation of public <b>teletypewriter</b> (<b>TTY)</b> machines and other TDD (telecommunications devices for the deaf). Title IV also led to the creation, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, of what were then called dual-party relay services and now are known as Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS), such as STS relay. Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are Video Relay Service (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.|$|E

50|$|A {{telecommunications}} {{device for}} the deaf (TDD) is a teleprinter, an electronic device for text communication over a telephone line, that is designed for use by persons with hearing or speech difficulties. Other names for the device include <b>teletypewriter</b> (<b>TTY),</b> textphone (common in Europe), and minicom (United Kingdom).|$|E
25|$|In Nashville, Tennessee, Sandy Cohen {{manages the}} Library Services for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (LSDHH). The program {{was created in}} 1979 in {{response}} to information accessibility issues for the Deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a <b>teletypewriter</b> or <b>TTY,</b> but today, the program has expanded to serving {{the entire state of}} Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, Deaf culture, and information for family members of Deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.|$|R
50|$|In 1924, the CCITT {{introduced}} the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) code {{as an international}} standard, {{which was based on}} the Western Union code with some minor changes. The US standardized on a version of ITA2 called the American <b>Teletypewriter</b> code (US <b>TTY)</b> which was the basis for 5-bit teletypewriter codes until the debut of 7-bit ASCII in 1963.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, Paul Taylor {{combined}} Western Union Teletype machines with modems to create <b>teletypewriters,</b> known as <b>TTYs.</b> He distributed these early, non-portable devices to {{the homes of}} many in the deaf community in St. Louis, Missouri. He worked with others to establish a local telephone wake-up service. In the early 1970s, these small successes in St. Louis evolved into the nation’s first local telephone relay system for the deaf.|$|R
50|$|Early user {{terminals}} {{connected to}} computers were electromechanical teleprinters/teletypewriters (<b>TeleTYpewriter,</b> <b>TTY),</b> {{such as the}} Teletype Model 33 ASR, originally used for telegraphy or the Friden Flexowriter. Later printing terminals such as the DECwriter LA30 were developed. However printing terminals were limited by {{the speed at which}} paper could be printed, and for interactive use the paper record was unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|Even in {{his high}} school days, Weitbrecht was {{interested}} in amateur radio and used radiotelegraph to communicate with fellow radio operators around the country. In 1964, this love for communication came together {{with the need to}} interact with a colleague who could not operate an amateur radio. To solve this problem, Weitbrecht created a device that used the public telephone system to achieve communication: the <b>teletypewriter</b> (<b>TTY).</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{telecommunications}} relay service, {{also known}} as TRS, relay service, or IP-relay, or Web-based relay service, is an operator service that allows people who are deaf, hard of hearing, deafblind, or have a speech disorder to place calls to standard telephone users via a keyboard or assistive device. Originally, relay services were designed to be connected through a TDD, <b>teletypewriter</b> (<b>TTY)</b> or other assistive telephone device. Services gradually have expanded to include almost any real-time text capable technology such as a personal computer, laptop, mobile phone, PDA, and many other devices. The first TTY was invented by deaf scientist Robert Weitbrecht in 1964. The first relay service was established in 1974 by Converse Communications of Connecticut.|$|E
5000|$|Don Witcraft {{wrote the}} TSS-8 scheduler, command decoder and UUO (Unimplemented User Operations) handler. John Everett wrote the disk handler, file system, <b>TTY</b> (<b>teletypewriter)</b> handler and 680-I service routine for TSS-8.Roger Pyle and John Everett wrote the PDP-8 Disk Monitor System, and John Everett adapted PAL-III to make PAL-D for DMS. Bob Bowering, author of MACRO for the PDP-6 and PDP-10, wrote an {{expanded}} version, PAL-X, for TSS-8.|$|R
25|$|SWIFT911 is a {{high speed}} {{notification}} program with the capability of delivering recorded warnings to the entire community or targeted areas, via telephone, email, text or pager. Messages can be transmitted through the Marlboro Township Police Department or Office of the Mayor and the system can contact up to four telephone numbers until reaching the designated party. Emergency and Non-emergency messages are also able to reach <b>TTY</b> (<b>teletypewriter)</b> phones used {{by those who are}} deaf or hard of hearing.|$|R
50|$|A {{teleprinter}} (<b>teletypewriter,</b> Teletype or <b>TTY)</b> is an electromechanical typewriter {{that can}} be used to send and receive typed messages from point to point and point-to-multipoint over various types of communications channels. They were adapted to provide a user interface to early mainframe computers and minicomputers, sending typed data to the computer and printing the response. Some models could also be used to create punched tape for data storage (either from typed input or from data received from a remote source) and to read back such tape for local printing or transmission.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the NASA Communications Division is to provide operational communications in support of NASA projects and mission activities. Nascom is a generic term referring collectively to a global system of circuits and switching and terminal facilities established and operated by NASA to provide longhaul operational communications support for all NASA projects. Aspects of network evolution are discussed, {{taking into account the}} integrated Nascom network. A description is presented of the present Nascom network, giving attention to the Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN), the Deep Space Network (DSN), the voice network, and the <b>Teletypewriter</b> (<b>TTY)</b> Network. Concepts and techniques for the 1980 's are also considered. It is pointed out that the Nascom Network will extend the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) forward- and return-link services to users of the TDRSS by providing ground-to-ground data communications links between the NASA Ground Terminal at White Sands, New Mexico, and major user spacecraft control centers and data capture/data processing facilities...|$|E
