50|$|The Voigt pipe {{is a type}} of {{loudspeaker}} enclosure that embodies a combination of transmission line, ported enclosure and horn characteristics. It is highly regarded by some speaker designers, as evidenced by established manufacturers such as Castle. Due to its relatively high efficiency the design is frequently employed in full-range loudspeaker designs. The concept is that the sound emitted {{from the rear of the}} loudspeaker driver is progressively reflected and absorbed along the length of the <b>tapering</b> <b>tube,</b> almost completely preventing internally reflected sound being retransmitted through the cone of the loudspeaker. The lower part of the pipe acts as a horn while the top can be visualized as an extended compression chamber. The entire pipe can also be seen as a tapered transmission line in inverted form, that is, widening rather than narrowing from top to bottom. The driver is usually positioned close to the middle of the baffle or slightly lower. Its relatively low adoption in commercial speakers can mostly be attributed to the large resulting dimensions of the speaker produced and the expense of manufacturing a rigid <b>tapering</b> <b>tube.</b> The Voigt pipe was designed in 1934 by Paul G. A. H. Voigt and is also referred to as a tapered quarter-wave pipe (TQWP) or <b>tapered</b> quarter-wave <b>tube</b> (TQWT).|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades {{increasing}} focus {{has been paid to the}} impact of structures where energy, during the impact event, needs to be absorbed in a controlled manner. This has led to considerable research being carried out on energy absorbers, devices designed to dissipate energy during an impact event and hence protect the structure under consideration. Energy absorbers have found common usage in applications such as vehicles, aircraft, highway barriers and at the base of lift shafts. A type of energy absorber which has received relatively limited attention in the open literature is the <b>tapered</b> rectangular <b>tube.</b> Such a structure is essentially a tube with a rectangular cross-section in which one or more of the sides are inclined to the tube's longitudinal axis. The aim of this thesis was to analyse the impact and energy absorption response of tapered and non-tapered (straight) rectangular tubes. The energy absorption response was quantified for both axial and oblique loading, representative of the loading conditions typically encountered in impact applications. Since energy absorbers are commonly used as components in energy absorbing systems, the response of such a system was analysed which contained either straight or <b>tapered</b> rectangular <b>tubes</b> as the energy absorbing components. This system could typically be used as the front bumper system of a vehicle. Detailed finite element models, validated using experiments and existing theoretical and numerical models, were used to assess the energy absorption response and deformation modes of straight and <b>tapered</b> <b>tubes</b> under the various loading conditions. The manner in which a thin-walled tube deforms is important since it governs its energy absorption response. The results show that the energy absorption response of straight and <b>tapered</b> rectangular <b>tubes</b> can be controlled using their various geometry parameters. In particular, the wall thickness, taper angle and the number of tapered sides can be effectively used as parameters to control the amount of absorbed energy. <b>Tapered</b> rectangular <b>tubes</b> display less sensitivity to inertia effects compared with straight rectangular tubes under impact loading. This is beneficial when the higher crush loads associated with inertia effects need to be reduced. Furthermore, though the energy absorption capacity of thin-walled rectangular tubes diminishes under oblique impact loading, the capacity is more maintained for <b>tapered</b> rectangular <b>tubes</b> compared with non-tapered rectangular tubes. Overall, the results highlight the advantages of using <b>tapered</b> rectangular <b>tubes</b> for absorbing impact energy under axial and oblique loading conditions. Understanding is gained as to how the geometry parameters of such structures can be used to control the absorbed energy. The thesis uses this knowledge to develop design guidelines for the use of straight and <b>tapered</b> rectangular <b>tubes</b> in energy absorbing systems such as for crashworthiness applications. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of analysing thin-walled energy absorbers as part of an energy absorbing system, since the response of the absorbers may be different to when they are treated on their own...|$|R
50|$|The types can be {{distinguished}} by their response when gas starts to flow. In compensated flowmeters, the ball will initially jump as the gas flows through the tube before being released through the needle valve just before the outlet. No result will be observed in the non-compensated flow meter, as the gas will release before reaching the <b>tapered</b> <b>tube</b> containing the float.|$|E
50|$|A {{rotameter}} {{consists of}} a <b>tapered</b> <b>tube,</b> typically made of glass with a 'float' (a shaped weight, made either of anodized aluminum or a ceramic), inside that is pushed up by the drag force of the flow and pulled down by gravity.

40|$|Wave {{propagation}} {{in liquid}} filled vessels is often {{motivated by the}} need to understand arterial blood flow. Theoretical and experimental investigations of traveling waves in flexible tubes have been performed by many researchers. The analytical one dimensional frequency domain wave theory has a great advantage of providing accurate results without the additional computational cost involved in the modern time domain simulation models. Transition line theory allows including non uniformities of vessels by capturing them as several uniform segments. For assessing the validity of analytical and numerical models well defined in-vitro experiments are of great importance. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a frequency domain transmission line analytical model based on one-dimensional wave propagation theory and validate it against experimental data obtained for aortic analogues. The analytical model is set up by multiple sections and a formulation is derived that incorporates the multiple reflections and transmissions of propagating waves through the interfaces of these sections. The aortic analogues include straight and <b>tapered</b> <b>tubes.</b> The pressure, flow and wall distention results obtained from the analytical model are compared with experimental data in two straight <b>tubes</b> and one <b>tapered</b> one with aortic relevance. The analytical models and the experimental measurements were found to be in good agreement for both the uniform and <b>tapered</b> <b>tubes...</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} forms of wall plug, but the most common {{principle}} {{is to use a}} <b>tapered</b> <b>tube</b> of soft material, such as plastic.

Such anchors can attach one object to another in situations where screws, nails, adhesives, or other simple fasteners are either impractical or ineffective. Different types have different levels of strength and can be used on different types of surfaces.|$|E

50|$|When {{a driving}} {{pressure}} {{is applied to}} the inlet of a Thorpe tube flowmeter, the ball rises in the <b>tapered</b> <b>tube</b> until the flow rate creates an applied pressure on the ball equal to its weight.

A cylindrical tube would not permit driving pressure to decrease with flow rate, resulting in the ball rising {{to the top of the}} tube, and allowing for no variance in readings. The flow rate of a specific gas necessary to cause the float to rise to a given height is precalculated in order to calibrate a tube.|$|E

40|$|In {{real-world}} {{impact loading}} situations the structure could {{be subjected to}} both axial and off-axis loads. <b>Tapered</b> thin-walled rectangular <b>tubes</b> have been considered desirable impact energy absorbers due {{to their ability to}} withstand oblique impact loads as effectively as axial loads.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare the energy absorption response of straight and <b>tapered</b> thin-walled rectangular <b>tubes</b> under oblique impact loading, for variations in the load angle, impact velocity and tube dimensions.
