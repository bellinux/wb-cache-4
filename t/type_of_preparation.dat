40|$|Due to high {{aesthetic}} qualities, proven biocompatibility and {{prognosis for}} long term durability, porcelain veneers {{have become a}} routine restorative procedure for frontal teeth treatment. From a mechanical point of view, porcelain veneers are fragile and brittle before cementing. After fixation they gain the necessary pressure strength, and become more tensile and resistant to bending, which guarantees their clinical longevity. Besides {{the strength of the}} material, the mechanical resistance of the veneers will also depend on the preparation design, which altogether will withstand the occlusal and lateral forces during mastication. An important decision that has to be made before starting preparation is to choose one <b>of</b> the four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparations.</b> The actuality <b>of</b> the issue and more frequent use of veneers in everyday clinical practice, require vindicating and clearly define the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparations</b> that will give better performance on fixed-prosthetic works.

40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} the localization of fracture of composite veneers with three different incisal preparations. Methods and Materials: 15 extracted human permanent maxillary central incisors were divided into three groups (n= 5). Teeth from each group were prepared with different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> for producing veneers. Group 1 : feather preparation; group 2 : bevel preparation and group 3 : incisal overlap-palatal chamfer. Composite veneers were produced using light-curing technical composite In:joy (DeguDent) and bonded to the prepared maxillary central incisors using resin cement RelyX Veneer (3 M ESPE). Specimens were loaded to fracture in universal testing machine TRITECH WF 10056 (WykehamFarrance,Milan,Italy). The localization of fracture was recorded and data were statistically analyzed. Results: The most common localization of fracture in group 1 was gingival, group 2 incisal, while in group 3 in two specimens only incisal and three specimens with incisal and gingival localization. Conclusion: Preparation design {{had a significant effect}} on the fracture localization. According to the results, the preferred preparation designs is incisal overlap-palatal chamfer. The veneers with this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> exhibited better fracture resistance and superior aesthetic for the patient. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{oxytocin}} on endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded {{segments of the}} human uterine artery rings was investigated. In both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparation</b> oxytocin induced contraction of human uterine artery with similar potency and efficacy (pEC 50 values: 6. 95 ± 0. 05 vs 7. 06 ± 0. 01; maximal response values: 61 ± 4. 1 % vs 63 ± 5. 1 % for arteries with and without endothelium, respectively). In contrast, human uterine arteries, both intact and denuded of endothelium, {{did not respond to}} the addition of the selective oxytocin receptor agonist, [Thr 4, Gly 7]oxytocin (10 [*]nM– 1 [*]μM). The vasopressin receptor antagonists, [d(CH 2) 5 Tyr(Me) ]AVP (10 – 100 [*]nM) and [d(CH 2) 5,D-Ile 2,Ile 4]AVP (300 [*]nM– 3 [*]μM) produced parallel rightward shifts of the curves for oxytocin. The Schild plots constrained to a slope of unity gave the following −log KB values: [d(CH 2) 5 Tyr(Me) ] AVP vs [d(CH 2) 5,D-Ile 2,Ile 4] AVP 9. 24 vs 6. 91 and 9. 26 vs 6. 84 for human uterine artery with intact and those denuded of endothelium, respectively. In contrast, in both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparations</b> the oxytocin receptor antagonist, [d(CH 2) 5 Tyr(OMe), 2 Orn 8]vasotocin (1 [*]μM), did not significantly affect oxytocin-induced contractions. The calculated pKA values for oxytocin itself also did not differ between preparations: 6. 56 and 6. 43 for human uterine artery with and without endothelium, respectively. In both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>preparations,</b> the receptor reserve (KA/EC 50) was close to unity (intact vs denuded: 3. 9 vs 3. 0). It is concluded that, in human uterine artery, oxytocin induces contractions that are not modulated by the endothelium. It is likely that oxytocin acts as a partial agonist on human uterine artery, regardless of the endothelial condition. On the basis of differential antagonists affinity and affinity of oxytocin itself, it is probable that receptors involved in oxytocin-induced contraction in human uterine arteries belong to the V 1 A vasopressin receptors...|$|R
