5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, brown creeper is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E
5|$|The {{local council}} Filwood ward is roughly coterminous with Knowle West, but two small {{areas of the}} estate lie in the {{neighbouring}} Knowle ward.

5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> the father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and {{that the most important}} aspect of the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Eiland-Hall, a 34-year-old {{computer}} science student in Panama City, Florida, saw the discussion on Fark using the Gottfried joke on Beck {{and created a}} website, GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com, intending it as a parody of Beck's style of political commentary. He chose not <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> the WHOIS service and decided to remain anonymous. Eiland-Hall used the domain name registrar Namecheap for his site. It was launched on September 1, 2009, and received over 120,000 page views during its first 24 hours. The website asserted {{that it did not}} believe the charges were true. Eiland-Hall wrote on the site that those furthering the meme were asserting Beck used a similar strategy to promote his opinions and increase his viewership.|$|E
5|$|Newark is New Jersey's {{largest and}} second-most racially diverse city (after {{neighboring}} Jersey City). It {{is divided into}} five political wards, which are often used by residents to identify their place of habitation. In recent years, residents have begun <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South Wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August 2001 Totti won {{his first}} Supercoppa Italiana, scoring and {{assisting}} in the 3–0 win against Fiorentina. Totti was named the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year for both 2000 and 2001, and won the Serie A Footballer of the Year Award {{for the first time}} in his career in 2000. He received his first Ballon d'Or nomination in 2000, finishing 14th in voting, and fifth the following year. Due to his performances and leadership, Totti had established himself as a hero to the Roma fans, who were also able <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> his background as a Roma native and lifelong supporter.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with.</b> Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk {{found it hard to}} piece together the relationship between the main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Jovovich {{starred in}} the horror/action film Resident Evil, {{released}} in the United States on March 15, 2002 {{and based on the}} CAPCOM video game series of the same name. She portrayed Alice, the film's heroine, who fights a legion of zombies created by the Umbrella Corporation. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise. Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, which her management deemed too dangerous, and had trained in karate, kickboxing, and combat-training. The film was commercially successful, grossing $17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining $40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide. Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in No Good Deed (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy You Stupid Man (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in Dummy (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series King of the Hill. The role of Fangora in Dummy allowed Jovovich to act in film with Oscar-winning Adrien Brody, who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it easy <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> this role because she felt Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress' own life.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> the nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half}} of the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E
5|$|Shaw wrote The Christening, {{his only}} novel, in 1975. It centres around Miles Madgwick, who {{believes}} that he is bisexual but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse, so he instead describes his most intimate thoughts in his diary. He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son, Rodney; he comes <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> Rodney's childhood innocence, and in Alice sees a symbol both {{of his mother and}} a heterosexual lover. Alice starts to tire of her husband and grow fonder of Madgwick, who experiences mixed emotions in his continued interactions with her and Rodney. One night, Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick's house and, when he takes the boy home in a taxicab, the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a pederast. When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child, the driver threatens to expose Madgwick, creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of intimacy with others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver's exposure.|$|E
