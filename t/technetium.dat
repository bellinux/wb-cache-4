5|$|Only minute {{traces of}} <b>technetium</b> occur {{naturally}} in the Earth's crust. This is because technetium-98's half-life is only 4.2millionyears. More {{than a thousand}} of such periods have passed since {{the formation of the}} Earth, so the probability for the survival of even one atom of primordial <b>technetium</b> is effectively zero. However, small amounts exist as spontaneous fission products in uranium ores. A kilogram of uranium contains an estimated 1nanogram (10−9g) of <b>technetium.</b> Some red giant stars with the spectral types S-, M-, and N contain a spectral absorption line indicating the presence of <b>technetium.</b> These red-giants are known informally as <b>technetium</b> stars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Technetium</b> (99mTc) pintumomab and <b>technetium</b> (99mTc) nofetumomab merpentan are radiolabeled antibodies, merpentan being a {{chelator}} {{that links}} the antibody nofetumomab to the radioisotope technetium-99m.|$|E
5|$|<b>Technetium</b> {{is located}} in the seventh group of the {{periodic}} table, between rhenium and manganese. As predicted by the periodic law, its chemical properties are between those two elements. Of the two, <b>technetium</b> more closely resembles rhenium, particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form covalent bonds. Unlike manganese, <b>technetium</b> does not readily form cations (ions with a net positive charge). <b>Technetium</b> exhibits nine oxidation states from −1 to +7, with +4, +5, and +7 being the most common. <b>Technetium</b> dissolves in aqua regia, nitric acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid, but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any concentration.|$|E
5|$|One {{short-lived}} gamma ray-emitting {{nuclear isomer}} of technetium—technetium-99m—is used in nuclear medicine {{for a wide}} variety of diagnostic tests. The ground state of this nuclide, technetium-99, is used as a gamma-ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived <b>technetium</b> isotopes produced commercially are by-products of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because no isotope of <b>technetium</b> has a half-life longer than 4.2million years (technetium-98), the 1952 detection of <b>technetium</b> in red giants, which are billions of years old, helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|<b>Technetium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive; none are stable. Nearly all <b>technetium</b> is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts {{are found in}} the Earth's crust. Naturally occurring <b>technetium</b> is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.|$|E
5|$|<b>Technetium</b> plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. <b>Technetium</b> is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of <b>technetium</b> (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E
5|$|The metal form is {{slightly}} paramagnetic, meaning its magnetic dipoles align with external magnetic fields, but will assume random orientations once {{the field is}} removed. Pure, metallic, single-crystal <b>technetium</b> becomes a type-II superconductor at temperatures below 7.46K. Below this temperature, <b>technetium</b> has a very high magnetic penetration depth, greater than any other element except niobium.|$|E
5|$|Metallic <b>technetium</b> slowly tarnishes in {{moist air}} and, in powder form, burns in oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Related by {{periodic}} trends, rhenium has {{a similar}} chemistry to that of technetium; work done to label rhenium onto target compounds can often be translated to <b>technetium.</b> This is useful for radiopharmacy, where {{it is difficult to}} work with <b>technetium</b> – especially the 99m isotope used in medicine – due to its expense and short half-life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Technetium</b> can {{catalyse}} {{the destruction}} of hydrazine by nitric acid, and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies. This caused {{a problem in the}} separation of plutonium from uranium in nuclear fuel processing, where hydrazine is used as a protective reductant to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state. The problem was exacerbated by the mutually-enhanced solvent extraction of <b>technetium</b> and zirconium at the previous stage, and required a process modification.|$|E
5|$|As noted, the {{radioactive}} nature of <b>technetium</b> (3MBq/L at the concentrations required) makes this corrosion protection impractical {{in almost all}} situations. Nevertheless, corrosion protection by pertechnetate ions was proposed (but never adopted) for use in boiling water reactors.|$|E
5|$|Emilio Gino Segrè (1 February 1905 – 22 April 1989) was an Italian-American {{physicist}} and Nobel laureate, {{who discovered the}} elements <b>technetium</b> and astatine, and the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Like rhenium and palladium, <b>technetium</b> {{can serve}} as a catalyst. In {{processes}} such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Technetium</b> and rhenium {{are known}} to form {{volatile}} heptoxides M2O7 (M = Tc, Re), so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide Bh2O7. The oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid, HBhO4.|$|E
5|$|Technetium-99 (99Tc) {{is a major}} {{product of}} the fission of {{uranium-235}} (235U), making it {{the most common and}} most readily available isotope of <b>technetium.</b> One gram of technetium-99 produces 6.2×108disintegrations a second (that is, 0.62GBq/g).|$|E
5|$|The longer-lived isotope, technetium-95m with a {{half-life}} of 61days, {{is used as}} a {{radioactive tracer}} to study the movement of <b>technetium</b> in the environment and in plant and animal systems.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{decay mode}} before the most {{abundant}} isotope, 102Ru, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay product before 102Ru is <b>technetium</b> and the primary decay product after is rhodium.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} disposal method, transmutation, {{has been}} demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. In this process, the <b>technetium</b> (technetium-99 as a metal target) is bombarded with neutrons to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure <b>technetium</b> target is needed; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium {{are present in the}} target, they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{the fifth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 7 in the periodic table, below manganese, <b>technetium</b> and rhenium. All {{the members of the}} group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. <b>Technetium</b> also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter permanganate, pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).|$|E
5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans can show the exact location and extent of the lesion. <b>Technetium</b> bone scans can detect regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, four {{predicted}} {{elements were}} still {{missing from the}} periodic table: 43 (<b>technetium)</b> and 61 (promethium) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making elements 75 (rhenium) and 72 (hafnium) the last two unknown non-radioactive elements. Since rhenium was discovered in 1908, hafnium was the last element with stable isotopes to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the first}} report on {{attempted}} isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs <b>technetium</b> and rhenium for comparison) and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent actinides, the group 5 elements, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, it was {{confirmed}} that although relativistic effects are important, bohrium behaves {{like a typical}} group 7 element. A team at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) conducted a chemistry reaction using six atoms of 267Bh produced in the reaction between 249Bk and 22Ne ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O2 mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, <b>technetium</b> (as 108Tc) and rhenium (as 169Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7. The adsorption enthalpies of the oxychlorides of <b>technetium,</b> rhenium, and bohrium were measured in this experiment, agreeing very well with the theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group 7 of TcO3Cl > ReO3Cl > BhO3Cl.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum-98 is {{the most}} {{abundant}} isotope, comprising 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150ns. All unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium, <b>technetium,</b> and ruthenium.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum-99, which decays to form technetium-99m, can {{be formed}} by the neutron {{activation}} of molybdenum-98. When needed, other <b>technetium</b> isotopes are not produced in significant quantities by fission, but are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes (for example, technetium-97 {{can be made by}} neutron irradiation of ruthenium-96).|$|E
5|$|Promethium (formerly prometheum) is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pm and atomic number 61. All of its isotopes are radioactive; {{it is one}} of only two such elements that are followed in the periodic table by elements with stable forms, a distinction shared with <b>technetium.</b> Chemically, promethium is a lanthanide, which forms salts when combined with other elements. Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3.|$|E
5|$|Since that discovery, {{there have}} been many {{searches}} in terrestrial materials for natural sources of <b>technetium.</b> In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the Belgian Congo in extremely small quantities (about 0.2ng/kg); there it originates as a spontaneous fission product of uranium-238. The Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium-99 were produced and have since decayed into ruthenium-99.|$|E
5|$|<b>Technetium</b> {{also has}} {{numerous}} nuclear isomers, which are isotopes {{with one or}} more excited nucleons. Technetium-97m (97mTc; 'm' stands for metastability) is the most stable, with a half-life of 91days (0.0965MeV). This is followed by technetium-95m (half-life: 61days, 0.03MeV), and technetium-99m (half-life: 6.01 hours, 0.142MeV). Technetium-99m emits only gamma rays and decays to technetium-99.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{astronomer}} Paul W. Merrill in California {{detected the}} spectral signature of <b>technetium</b> (specifically wavelengths of 403.1nm, 423.8nm, 426.2nm, and 429.7nm) in light from S-type red giants. The stars were {{near the end}} of their lives, yet were rich in this short-lived element, indicating that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions. This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars. More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s-process.|$|E
5|$|Niobium {{becomes a}} {{superconductor}} at cryogenic temperatures. At atmospheric pressure, {{it has the}} highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors at 9.2K.Sn Coated Multicell Accelerating Cavity|first = M.|last = Peiniger|author2=Piel, H. |journal = Nuclear Science|date= 1985|volume= 32|issue = 5|doi = 10.1109/TNS.1985.4334443|pages = 3610–3612|bibcode = 1985ITNS...32.3610P }} Niobium has the greatest magnetic penetration depth of any element. In addition, {{it is one of}} the three elemental Type II superconductors, along with vanadium and <b>technetium.</b> The superconductive properties are strongly dependent on the purity of the niobium metal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Technetium,</b> with {{atomic number}} (denoted Z) 43, is the lowest-numbered {{element in the}} {{periodic}} table of which all isotopes are radioactive. The second-lightest exclusively radioactive element, promethium, has an atomic number of 61. Atomic nuclei with an odd number of protons are less stable than those with even numbers, even when {{the total number of}} nucleons (protons + neutrons) is even, and odd numbered elements have fewer stable isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The Chalk River reactor {{was shut}} down for {{maintenance}} in August 2009, and reopened in August 2010. The Petten reactor had a 6-month scheduled maintenance shutdown on Friday, February 19, 2010, and reopened September 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply has left a gap, leaving some practitioners to revert to techniques not used for 20 years. Somewhat allaying this issue is an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate <b>technetium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 1938, Segrè paid {{a summer}} visit to California {{to study the}} {{short-lived}} isotopes of <b>technetium,</b> which did not survive being mailed to Italy. While Segrè was en route, Benito Mussolini's fascist government passed racial laws barring Jews from university positions. As a Jew, Segrè was now rendered an indefinite émigré. The Czechoslovakian crisis prompted Segrè to send for Elfriede and Claudio, as he now feared that war in Europe was inevitable. In November 1938 and February 1939 they made quick trips to Mexico to exchange their tourist visas for immigration visa. Both Segrè and Elfriede held grave fears for the fate of their parents in Italy and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium {{is one of}} the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. Rhenium has the third-highest melting point and second-highest boiling point of any element at 5903K. Rhenium resembles manganese and <b>technetium</b> chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and refinement of molybdenum and copper ores. Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (<b>Technetium,</b> the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E
5|$|After marrying, Segrè {{sought a}} stable job and became {{professor}} of physics {{and director of the}} Physics Institute at the University of Palermo. He found the equipment there primitive and the library bereft of modern physics literature, but his colleagues at Palermo included the mathematicians Michele Cipolla and Michele De Franchis, the mineralogist Carlo Perrier and the botanist Luigi Montemartini. In 1936 he paid a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, where he met Edwin McMillan, Donald Cooksey, Franz Kurie, Philip Abelson and Robert Oppenheimer. Segrè was intrigued by the radioactive scrap metal that had once been part of the laboratory's cyclotron. In Palermo, this was found to contain a number of radioactive isotopes. In February 1937, Lawrence sent him a molybdenum strip that was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. Segrè enlisted Perrier's help to subject the strip to careful chemical and theoretical analysis, {{and they were able to}} prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element. In 1947 they named it <b>technetium,</b> as it was the first artificially synthesized chemical element.|$|E
