50|$|LY-2140023 was {{identified}} using the analogous peptide prodrug approach used previously for <b>talaglumetad,</b> the prodrug of eglumetad. Synthesis {{was the result}} of preparation of LY-389795 followed by oxidation to LY-404,039 and coupling with L-methionine. LY-2140023 uses a human peptide transporter and hydrolytic pathways to deliver LY-404,039 to systemic circulation in humans. It is rapidly absorbed and hydrolyzed to produce active LY-404,039 (~70% conversion), increasing its estimated bioavailability to 49%. In humans, use of LY-2140023 resulted in significantly higher plasma levels of LY-404,039 compared with oral administration of LY-404039. LY-2140023 appears to be an inactive prodrug, as K values for the drug {{have been found to be}} greater than 100 ÂµM.|$|E
