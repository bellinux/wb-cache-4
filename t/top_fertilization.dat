Winter cereal residues and some annual winter grasses, as dedicated energy crops, are currently being grown in Spain and harvested as bales to be burned for electricity production in biomass power plants. Previous studies of our group analyzed GHG emissions and energy balances of winter cereals for electricity production by means of Life Cycle Assessment. We selected highly productive genotypes of three annual winter cereals (rye, triticale and oat) and compared them with Spanish electricity produced using natural gas. This paper compares effects {{of the use of}} different crop management practices for rye growing in the assessment of energy balances and GHG emissions. We analyzed the effects of six different management practices consisting of two different sowing doses (suboptimal and normal) combined with three <b>top</b> <b>fertilization</b> doses (zero, 30 and 80 kgN ha- 1). We made a characterization analysis of biomasses to estimate the nitrogen uptake of the crops in order to compare it with the nitrogen provided by the fertilizers. This comparison evaluates if lower fertilization doses are sustainable for the soil nitrogen stocks. Our results suggest that there is trade-off between soil nitrogen and emission savings. The use of zero or low <b>top</b> <b>fertilization</b> doses (30 kg N ha- 1) improves GHG emissions and energy balances even with a yield reduction. Nevertheless the use of these doses imply an annual lose in soil nitrogen stocks for the majority all of our trials. Using suboptimal sowing doses resulted in yield decreases that did not compensate the lower input consumed.

We used 36 calves with average age and average weight of 10. 5 months and 180 kg, respectively, as test-animals. The grazing system used was continuous with variable stocking rate. The block design was completely randomized with three replicates (paddock). Average weight gain was similar for the levels evaluated (0. 925; 0. 969 and 1. 045 kg day- 1, respectively). Stocking rate and live weight gain per hectare showed a linear relation with nitrogen levels. The efficiency of animal production was 2. 040 and 1. 766 kg of weight gain per kg of nitrogen used for the dose of 150 and 300 of N, respectively. The stocking rate and live weight gain per hectare of beef calves increased with the nitrogen levels, from 0 to 300 kg of N ha- 1.

This studyobjectified to evaluate the response of off-season grain sorghum crop to doses and sources of nitrogen applied as topdressing. Treatments consisted of the combination of two nitrogen sources (urea and ammonium sulfate) and fivenitrogen doses (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 kg. ha- 1) applied at the panicle initiation stage (EC 2). A randomized blocks designwas used in a 2 x 5 factorial scheme, with four replications. Plant height, culm diameter, grain number per panicle, plantdry matter, harvest index, weight of 100 grains and grain yield were evaluated. Ammonium sulfate increased plantheight. The hybrid evaluated showed a linear relation of plant dry matter and nitrogen top dressing. The ammoniumsulfate caused higher increase in dry matter yield compared to urea. A quadratic relationship between nitrogen topdressing and grain yield was observed, obtaining 3389. 4 kg. ha- 1 with 65. 10 kg. ha- 1 of top dress nitrogen...|$|R
40|$|Besides {{increasing}} productivity, nitrogen fertilization {{may have}} positives effects on seed physiological quality. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of different forms and levels of urea in <b>top</b> dressing <b>fertilization</b> on the physiological quality of wheat seed genotypes. Seeds of three wheat genotypes (BRS 208, BRS Pardela and IWT 04008) were evaluated for four levels of nitrogen fertilization (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg. ha- 1) in three forms of urea (conventional urea, urea with urease inhibitor and protected urea). The nitrogen fertilization was applied during tillering, 20 days after emergence. The seed nitrogen content, 1000 seed mass, germination and vigor (germination first count, cold test, seedling emergence in the field, dry weight of seedlings, accelerated aging and electrical conductivity) were evaluated. The IWT 04008 line and the cultivar BRS Pardela had seeds with a higher physiological quality than those of the cultivar BRS 208. The forms of urea and levels of nitrogen in topdressing did not affect seed physiological quality of the different wheat genotypes...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work evaluates {{the development of}} roots and shoots in wheat grown after sugarbeet and as continuous crop, with and without mineral fertilization. The root and shoot development was evaluated {{in the course of}} the growth cycle at the beginning and at the end of tillering, at flowering, at milky ripeness and at full maturity. The length of roots was measured following the Newman method, on soil auger samples taken in the space between rows down to 0. 8 m depth. Data showed a different development both of shoots and roots and a different root distribution along the soil profile. In the sugarbeet-wheat rotation a greater yield was observed for both shoots and roots. In particular, a greater root development was observed in deeper layers during the whole growth cycle and reduced persistence during maturity in the <b>top</b> layers. Also <b>fertilization</b> had positive effects on the development of the whole plant; the effect on roots was evident with a greater development of shallow roots and a reduction on the deeper ones, especially after flowering. Also the shoot/root ratio was influenced by the examined factors...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{inscriptions}} on bones or tortoise shells in the Shang Dynasty {{about three}} thousand years ago, {{the use of}} human excreta may already have begun in China. During the Warring States Period (475 - 221 BC), the use of farm manure became quite popular when cropping system changed from crop / fallow rotation to crop/crop rotation. In many articles written by famous persons in early Qin Dynasty (221 - 207 BC), there were words about “using excreta to field”. In “Lao Jie ” written by Han Feizi, he wrote “in order to increase fertility of soil, human excreta must be used. ” During Qin and Han Dynasty(221 - 220 AC), there was inscription about the link of toilet and pigsty in one place, also about the compost using human excreta. The method of using human excreta included basal <b>fertilization,</b> <b>top</b> application, and seed coating. In Ming and Qing Dynasty (1368 - 1911), Xu Guangqi described the method to cook human waste with human hair and cattle dung with cattle bone. He also described the distillation method for human excreta just as distillation method for wine. A formula for making compound fertilizer included black bean, hemp seed, pigeon waste, human excreta, manure from goats, dogs etc. He suggested that th...|$|R

The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine the}} effect of various cultivation methods and nitrogen fertilization on the content of macroelements (N, P, K, Mg, Ca) in grain of winter wheat. A field experiment with cultivation of winter wheat var. Rysa was carried out in the years 2003 - 2004 at the Olsztyn University of Warmia and Mazury (UMW), in the Experimental Station in Tomaszkowo. The experiment was conducted with the method of split-plot randomised blocks, in 4 replications, on heavy brown soil ranked in the good wheat complex. The first experimental factor were methods of plant cultivation: 1. Control plot – without cultivation, 2. Harrowing at the tillering stage; 3. Harrowing at the tillering stage (2 – fold); 4. Protection with Aminopielik D 450 SL herbicide; 5. Harrowing (1 -fold) + protection with Aminopielik D 450 SL herbicide. The second experimental factor were variants of <b>top</b> dressing nitrogen <b>fertilization</b> (135 kg N ha- 1) : a) control plot – without nitrogen; b) fertilization with: 70 kg N ha- 1 after re-vegetation – ammonium nitrate, 65 kg N ha- 1 at the full stage of shooting – pelleted carbamide; c) 70 kg N ha- 1 after re-vegetation – ammonium nitrate, 25 kg N ha- 1 at the beginning of shooting stage and 40 kg N ha- 1 {{at the end of the}} shooting stage – pelleted carbamide; d) as in plot "c", yet with foliar application of the second dose of nitrogen (25 kg N ha- 1) with carbamide concentration of 18. 1 % (8. 33 % N). The content of macroelements in grain of winter wheat was significantly differentiated between the particular experimental years, except for nitrogen. Significant changes were also observed in contents of phosphorus and magnesium as affected by the cultivation methods applied. Variants of nitrogen fertilization exerted a significant effect only on the concentrations of nitrogen and potassium...|$|R

On the other hand, subsoil acidity is considered a constraint {{to the development of}} deep plant roots. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, NO 3 - and SO 4 2 - leaching in the soil profile as affected by liming and <b>top</b> dressing nitrogen <b>fertilization</b> in cotton, grown with straw cover {{on the soil}} surface. Cotton plants (Gossypium hirsutum) were grown for 60 days in PVC columns filled with a Distroferric Red Latosol (sand loam Rhodic Oxisol) with liming applied over the straw on the soil surface, incorporated liming 0 - 20 cm deep, or without liming. Nitrogen was applied at rates of 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg ha - 1 as ammonium sulfate. The PVC columns were set up in layers of 0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30 and 30 - 30 cm, totaling 15. 71 dm 3. The ammonium sulfate application caused intense leaching of SO 4 2 - in the soil, irrespective of the lime application method. Liming increased the concentration of NO 3 in the 0 - 20 cm soil layer, whereas the correction of the soil acidity did not affect the NO 3 - concentration in the 30 - 50 cm soil layer. The influence of ammonium sulfate on Ca 2 + leaching below 20 cm was only observed in the soil with incorporated lime. Nitrogen application resulted in extensive Mg 2 + leaching from the soil, regardless of the lime application method. In the soil layer below 30 cm, SO 4 2 - presented a higher correlation than NO 3 - in the formation of ionic pairs with Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +...|$|R
40|$|Crop-available zinc is {{affected}} by P-Zn interactions in soils. Orthophosphate (OP) additions may decrease or have no effect, while pyrophosphate (PP) may increase or {{have no effect on}} Zn solubility. Mechanisms involved in the interactions are not well understood and need to be quantified on agricultural soils subjected to P <b>fertilization.</b> <b>Top</b> and sub-samples from three Quebec agricultural soils were equilibrated with OP or PP solutions, then with Zn solutions, and finally with solutions containing neither P nor Zn. The first equilibration evaluated P sorption effects on soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), the second equilibration evaluated Zn sorption (Zn$ sb{ rm s}$) after P sorption, and the third Zn desorption (Zn$ sb{ rm D}$) as related to added P. Subsequently, Zn fractions were extracted sequentially with KNO$ sb 3 $ (Zn$ sb{ rm KNO 3 }$), NaOH (Zn$ sb{ rm NaOH}$) solutions and concentrated HNO$ sb 3 $ + H$ sb 2 $O$ sb 2 $ (Zn$ sb{ rm HNO 3 }$). Autoclaved soils were used for OP and PP comparisons, and non-autoclaved soils were used for OP determinations. Autoclaving reduced dithionite-citrate extractable Fe and Al materials. In both autoclaved and non-autoclaved soils, one mmole sorbed P as PP or OP resulted in increases in CEC from 0. 52 - 1. 24 mmole (+). Comparison between OP and PP in the autoclaved soils indicated that the increased CEC per mmole sorbed was greater with sorbed OP than with PP, while at the same rate of P addition, the absolute increased CEC was more with sorbed PP than with OP due to greater P sorption as PP compared to OP. Both sorbed OP or PP in autoclaved soils and sorbed OP in non-autoclaved soils increased specific Zn sorption in association with oxide materials. The effect was more significant with PP than with OP, as indicated by the observations: (1) P sorption increased Zn sorption but reduced Zn desorption, (2) P sorption reduced KNO$ sb 3 $- but increased NaOH- and HNO$ sb 3 $-extractable Zn, and (3) P sorption increased the difference between Zn sorbed and Zn extracted with KNO$ sb 3 $. These effects were more significant in coarser than finer textured soils. Results suggested that Zn fertilizers should be separated from P fertilizers to avoid enhanced Zn sorption and reduced Zn desorption...|$|R
