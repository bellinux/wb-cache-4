25|$|French Canadians had {{continued}} to farm as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had.</b> By the 1850s, soil nutrients were becoming exhausted. Their farming methods were outdated. About this time the textile industry in New England experienced a boom. With living conditions so harsh, and {{work very hard to}} find even in the largest city, Montreal, emigration seemed the only option for many. As the first wave moved out in 1850's, word of mouth soon began to move larger crowds by the late 1870s. Mill owners hired these French immigrants to staff their mills more cheaply than American and Irish-born workers, who were themselves displaced.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{conquest of}} Transcaucasia in the 19th century split the Azerbaijani {{language}} community across two states, the other being Iran. The Soviet Union promoted {{development of the}} language, but set it back considerably with two successive script changes – from the Persian to Latin {{and then to the}} Cyrillic script – while Iranian Azerbaijanis continued to use the Persian as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had.</b> Despite the wide use of Azerbaijani in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, it did not become the official language of Azerbaijan until 1956. After achieving independence from the Soviet Union 1991, the new Republic of Azerbaijan decided to switch back to the Latin script.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{operated}} {{parochial schools}} primarily {{to maintain their}} religious faith; often they offered only an hour of German language instruction a week, but <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> extensive coverage of religion. Most German Catholic children by 1910 attended schools taught entirely in English. In the 199x–1930 era, German Catholics generally voted for the Liberal ticket (rather than the Provincial Rights and Conservative tickets), seeing Liberals as more willing to protect religious minorities. Occasionally they voted for Conservatives or independent candidates who offered greater support for public funding of parochial schools. Nazi Germany made a systematic effort to proselytize among Saskatchewan's Germans in the 1930s. Fewer that 1% endorsed their message, but some did migrate back to Germany before anti-Nazi sentiment became overwhelming in 1939.|$|E

500|$|The {{plans for}} {{decoration}} {{and construction of}} the house were dictated by Mamie Eisenhower. At one point, Eisenhower told the contractor [...] "For God's sakes, just give her what she wants and send me the bill." [...] His main concern was personally mixing the paint to recolor the barn, which had a red coat he thought was hideous, so he painted it a light gray-green. Mamie, meanwhile, was delighted {{in being able to}} use everything <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> in storage, and decorated more for sentimentality than for aesthetics.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles police stated Hartman's {{death was}} caused by a [...] "domestic discord" [...] between the couple. A friend stated that Brynn {{allegedly}} [...] "had trouble controlling her anger [...] She got attention by losing her temper". A neighbour of the Hartmans told a CNN reporter that the couple had been experiencing marital problems: [...] "It's been building, but I didn't think it would lead to this", and actor Steve Guttenberg said they had been [...] "a very happy couple, and <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> the appearance of being well-balanced." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} new album, Blink-182 created {{an entirely new}} logo, a [...] "smiley face" [...] with Xs for each eye and five arrows {{on the left side}} of its face. According to Barker, the Blink-182 logo {{originated}} at his clothing line, Famous Stars and Straps. Barker wanted to brand an icon for the band: [...] "It just had to be a cool kind of happy face but I wanted arrows. You know, like The Jam were my favorite band, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> arrows in their logos and stuff. It was just kind of inspired by pop-art." [...] Hoppus seconded this sentiment: [...] "He spearheaded all the artwork for the record. There were smiley-face stickers and posters all over Los Angeles, and that was his idea." [...] Barker invited his tattoo artist, Mister Cartoon, to create artwork for the record, and his good friend Estevan Oriol to handle photography. [...] "His style, incorporated into Blink's, didn’t make us too gangster: it just gave us a bit of an edge. It was cool to feel like Blink had a dangerous side", Barker later remembered.|$|E

500|$|Oliver {{initially}} had a [...] "friendly rivalry" [...] with sister Penny. Catherwood believes <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> [...] "a {{really good}} relationship". She characterised the siblings' relationship as [...] "one of constant rivalry but ultimately unconditional support", and noted, [...] "Everything always comes more easily to Oliver than Penny – {{she has spent}} her life playing catch up". When Penny considered giving her career up over a patient she was romantically involved with, {{in order to protect}} her, Oliver ruined the romance. Their relationship remained unaffected by this: Catherwood revealed, [...] "Well they are brother and sister, so you forgive your family for enormous amounts. So it doesn't affect their relationship, if anything he is there as soon as she breaks down he's there to catch her, full of apologies and support." [...] She said the situation would bring them closer together, because it is a typical scenario siblings go through. When Catherwood quit the series, Penny was killed whilst attempting to rescue a patient from a train crash. Her death was not shown on-screen: a conscious decision made by the production team to fully focus on Oliver's story. Series producer Myar Craig Brown revealed that the big focus would be on the effect it had on Oliver. Forced {{to come to terms with}} her death, he faced an [...] "emotional rollercoaster of feeling that he was second best to her".|$|E

Despite the Powell family having to budget their income, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> enough money for books and their home included a room known as the 'library'. Powell was heavily influenced by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche; he initially adopted Nietzsche's concept of God is dead but became religious again later on in life.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{official}} single released from Send Away the Tigers was [...] "Your Love Alone Is Not Enough", which features Cardigans vocalist Nina Persson {{and according to}} the band <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a duet in mind, seeing that the lyrics have a question/reply style to it. [...] According to singer Bradfield the title was the last line of a suicide note left by the friend of someone close to the group. The second single, [...] "Autumnsong", and a third, [...] "Indian Summer", were released in August. ″Indian Summer″ peaked at number 22, making it the first Manics single not to chart in the Top 20 since 1994's She Is Suffering. The album sleeve features a quotation from Wyndham Lewis: [...] "When a man is young, he is usually a revolutionary of some kind. So here I am, speaking of my revolution".|$|E

The part that {{was hard for me}} was {{actually}} doing the mask,where they put all that plaster on your face and you have to lie there still for a long time. Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Saskatchewan the German {{settlers}} came {{directly from}} Russia, or, after 1914 from the Dakotas. They came not as large groups but {{as part of}} a chain of family members, where the first immigrants would find suitable locations and send for the others. They formed compact German-speaking communities built around their Catholic or Lutheran churches, and continuing old-world customs. They were farmers who grew wheat and sugar beets. Arrivals from Russia, Bukovina, and Romanian Dobruja established their villages in a 40-mile-wide tract east of Regina. [...] The Germans operated parochial schools primarily to maintain their religious faith; often they offered only an hour of German language instruction a week, but <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> extensive coverage of religion.
