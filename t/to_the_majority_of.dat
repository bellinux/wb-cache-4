Rare cases of hybridization with little blue herons Egretta caerulea, little egrets Egretta garzetta and snowy egrets Egretta thula have been recorded.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for this is the {{extensive}} freeway system in the city, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways but no three-digit interstates.|$|E

5|$|According to some sources, the Poles resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} because, before the war, Poles had a privileged position. Then, {{in the space}} of a few days, Jews and other minorities from within Poland occupied positions in the Soviet occupation government—such as teachers, civil servants and engineers—that they allegedly had trouble achieving under the Polish government. What <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E

5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter.

5|$|Like the House of the Lake, most {{houses in}} the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped floor plans (such as {{trapezoidal}} designs), as opposed to square or rectangular designs. The narrow and irregular street grid is unlike that of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the {{houses in the}} Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E

Introduced in Phantasia, it is a real-time fighting system similar to a brawler, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> RPGs at the time of Phantasias release, which primarily used turn-based battle systems.|$|E
