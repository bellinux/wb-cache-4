25|$|A {{number of}} Green groups {{are pushing for}} the re-introduction of {{electric}} golf carts, replacing the current petrol powered golf carts. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> faced with some resistance of the management company and residents as there are other green priorities including upgrading of the buses to Euro standards.|$|E

25|$|An Advanced Laser Warning Countermeasure System (ALWCS) for {{the fire}} control system has been developed. This {{consists}} of a laser warning system, Infra-Red (IR) jammer and aerosol smoke grenade system. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> developed jointly with Elbit Systems Limited of Israel. The ALWCS has been integrated on Arjun MBT and trials have been carried out.|$|E
25|$|No other musical {{instruments}} are used in this dance except the ankle-bells. This dance is performed by men only, during temple festivals. Stories and episodes centering on Murugan and Valli are depicted in the songs.

25|$|Inter-American Development Bank {{also has}} a long history of working in the water {{resources}} management sector with Nicaragua. One project underway is contributing to the preservation and sustainable development of a particular subwatershed of Lake Managua's southern watershed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> carried out through the execution of infrastructure works and by strengthening the environmental management capacity of participating municipal governments. This is a US$13 million project.|$|E

25|$|A second Metro {{line from}} Laajasalo via Kamppi to Pasila {{north of the}} city centre, and {{possibly}} onwards to Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, is also in the planning stages. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> taken into consideration in city plans and has been discussed by the city assembly, but does not look likely to be seriously planned before the mid-2030s at the earliest. To prepare for this eventuality, a platform level for a crossing line was already excavated during the original construction of the Kamppi station.|$|E
25|$|Aston University is also {{carrying}} out groundbreaking {{research in the}} field of micro-technologies, including a micro-robotic drill for use in surgery, which is able to drill a hole so small into the shell of an egg, that the membrane remains intact. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> developed for use in operations on the inner ear. A project to use fibre optics instead of electric sensors in aircraft fuel tanks is also being undertaken, cutting substantially the risk of sparks setting off an explosion.|$|E
25|$|The Science Archive Operation Group {{receives}} and redistributes ESO and Hubble Space Telescope {{data and}} provides archival support. About 12terabytes of public data are distributed per year through the ESO archive {{in response to}} about 10,000 web requests. Additionally, more than 2,000 CDs and DVDs of proprietary data are sent out annually to principal investigators for service-mode observations. The archive is about 65TB, with an input rate of about 15TB per year; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> increased {{by a factor of}} 10 or so due to the survey telescopes' data-production rate.|$|E

25|$|Glossop {{has been}} {{included}} as {{pilot in the}} Liveability scheme, and has drawn up the Glossop Vision masterplan for the improvement and gentrification of the town. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> partially funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. It aims to open up access to the Glossop Brook, to coordinate developments in Glossop town centre, to enhance the built environment and to link the town to its wider setting. As such, the mills have become a retail development with housing, trees are to be planted along the A57 and the market square has been pedestrianised.|$|E
25|$|Ridership {{has been}} rising, and {{user-friendly}} features {{that have grown}} up through custom and practice help this. For instance, passengers open the doors by pressing a green strip on the central pole (in PCC trams) or an illuminated button (on Flexity trams), and drivers usually {{make a point of}} waiting for latecomers. However, overcrowding at rush hours and at weekend is common. The rate of detected fare-dodging is 4.15%, despite periodic enforcement campaigns, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> addressed by the installation of ticket barriers in all metro stations. From 2013, the obligation to check out of as well as into the system is being progressively introduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{x-system}} {{has become}} as popular as the h-system, but {{it has long been}} perceived as being contrary to the Fundamento de Esperanto. However, in its 2007 decision, the Akademio de Esperanto has issued a general permission for the use of surrogate systems for the representation of the diacritical letters of Esperanto, under the condition that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> done only when the circumstances do not permit the use of proper diacritics, and when due to a special need the h-system fixed in the Fundamento is not convenient. This provision covers situations such as using the x-system as a technical solution (to store data in plain ASCII) yet still displaying proper Unicode characters to the end user.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} contribution to Nova Scotia's provincial economy is through spin-offs and royalties relating to off-shore petroleum exploration and development. Mostly concentrated on the continental shelf of the province's Atlantic coast {{in the vicinity of}} Sable Island, exploration activities began in the 1960s and resulted in the first commercial production field for oil beginning in the 1980s. Natural gas was also discovered in the 1980s during exploration work, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> commercially recovered, beginning in the late 1990s. Initial optimism in Nova Scotia about the potential of off-shore resources appears to have diminished with the lack of new discoveries, although exploration work continues and is moving farther off-shore into waters on the continental margin.|$|E
25|$|Stagecoach East London are {{currently}} refurbishing their Routemasters for route 15H {{with some of}} the modern features added during the Marshall refurbishments replaced by replicas of the original equipment. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> done by Hants & Dorset Trim, and involves a full overhaul and repaint inside and out, the return of gold lettering, black registration plates and fitting of modern LED indicators on the front and LED indicators and lights on the rear. These have been made to appear similar to the round lights that were originally fitted. The refurbishment also sees the removal of the yellow hand rails, and the return of steel with white coating rails, also a nod to the original design. The first of was delivered back to Stagecoach East London in January 2016.|$|E
25|$|For various {{geologic}} reasons, modelled differently {{by different}} geologists, {{the zone of}} compression in the Aegean became one of extension: the region widened and dome-like or ovoid massifs were uncovered, or exhumed, from the subduction zones and rose by isostasy. In {{the case of the}} Menderes Massif, which is , the reasons are better known due to geologic research in central Turkey. Anatolia is a triangular block created by the intersection in central Turkey of the North and East Anatolian faults. As the northward-pressing Arabian Plate pushes against this wedge the latter slips to the west but the broad end opens along fault lines like the rays of a fan, extending the massif to the north-northeast and south. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> called a bivergent (diverges in two places) model.|$|E
