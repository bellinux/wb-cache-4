As Portugal had indicated its willingness to accept a Rhodesian diplomat, Dupont said, the Rhodesian government was acting perfectly within its rights.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a {{shortened}} version of cricket which only lasted for one day.

A national Sunday League was formed in 1969. The first One-Day International match was played on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day</b> of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in 1971, to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} positive end expiratory pressure and physiotherapy intervention during Phase I of cardiac rehabilitation {{on the behavior of}} pulmonary function and inspiratory muscle strength in postoperative cardiac surgery. METHODS: A prospective randomized study, in which 24 patients were divided in 2 groups: a group that performed respiratory exercises with positive airway expiratory pressure associated with physiotherapy intervention (GEP, n = 8) and a group that received only the physiotherapy intervention (GPI, n = 16). Pulmonary function was evaluated by spirometry on the preoperative and on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> postoperative days; inspiratory muscle strength was measured by maximal inspiratory pressure on the same days. RESULTS: Spirometric variables were significantly reduced from the preoperative to <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> postoperative <b>day</b> for <b>the</b> GPI, while the GEP had a significant reduction only for vital capacity (P <. 05). When the treatments were compared, smaller values were observed in the GPI for peak flow on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> postoperative <b>day.</b> Significant reductions of maximal inspiratory pressure from preoperative to the first postoperative day were found in both groups. However, the reduction in maximal inspiratory pressure from the preoperative to <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> postoperative <b>day</b> was significant only in the GPI (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cardiac surgery produces a reduction in inspiratory muscle strength, pulmonary volume, and flow. The association of positive expiratory pressure with physiotherapy intervention was more efficient in minimizing these changes, in comparison to the physiotherapy intervention alone. However, in both groups, the pulmonary volumes were not completely reestablished by <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> postoperative <b>day,</b> and it was necessary to continue the treatment after hospital convalescence...|$|R

5|$|The Third Test of the 1948 Ashes {{series was}} one of five Tests in a cricket series between teams {{representing}} Australia and England.

The match was drawn after {{the whole of the}} fourth day and the first half of <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day</b> was washed out due to rain; England had the upper hand before the weather intervened. The draw maintained Australia's 2–0 lead in the series, which was established through victories in the first two Tests. As Australia were the holders of The Ashes, the draw meant that England could do no better than level the series 2–2 by winning the last two Tests, and thus Australia retained The Ashes.|$|E

Royal Marines from 40 Commando under Dutton's overall command, along with United States Navy SEALs, secured oil fields on the Al-Faw Peninsula to prevent them from being burned in the first days of the ground operation, after which 40 Commando and others from 3 Commando Brigade moved up the peninsula and took the port city of Umm Qasr, where they encountered resistance into <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day</b> of the ground campaign.|$|E

5|$|The second {{theory is}} simply that the battle {{occurred}} because the Persians finally moved to attack the Athenians. Although this theory has the Persians moving to the strategic offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the tactical offensive, and attacked them. Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply {{that there was some}} kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day</b> which ultimately triggered the battle. It is also possible that both theories are correct: when the Persians sent the cavalry by ship to attack Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} five years, Rambola {{was adopted}} by Narharidas, a Vaishnava ascetic of Ramananda's monastic order who is {{believed}} to be the fourth disciple of Ramananda, or alternately, the disciple of Anantacharya.

Tulsidas narrates the dialogue that took place during the first meeting with his guru in a passage in the Vinayapatrika. When he was seven years old, his Upanayana ("sacred thread ceremony") was performed by Narharidas on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day</b> of the bright half of the month of Magha (January–February) at Ayodhya, a pilgrimage-site related to Rama.

5|$|Dhoni {{returned}} to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India. In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, Kohli was India's top-scorer in both innings.

Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>day,</b> helping his team draw the Test match. Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket {{at the conclusion of}} this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney. Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain. He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and India hung in for another draw. Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of {{respiratory}} physiotherapy (walking, cough and kinesiotherapy) on lung function in patients during the postoperative period of upper abdominal surgery. Methods: A total of 30 patients (14 female and 16 male; mean age of 53 years) were evaluated clinically and by pulmonary function tests, measurements of respiratory muscle strength and arterial oxygen saturation. Patients were randomly included in Group A (walking and coughing) or Group B (walking, coughing and kinesiotherapy – diaphragmatic exercises during sustained and non-sustained inhaling). Rresults: Compared to preoperative values, the forced expiratory volume during the first second decreased 24 % in Group A and 31 % in Group B during the first postoperative day; a 7 and a 14 % (non significant) decrease was maintained in <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> postoperative <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> forced vital capacity decreased by 27 % (Group A) and by 33 % (Group B) in the first postoperative day; a 12 % (non significant) decrease in Group A, and a 20 % decrease in Group B was maintained in <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> postoperative <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> maximum inspiratory pressure decreased 16 % in the first postoperative day (Groups A and B); a 4 % (non significant) drop was maintained in <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> postoperative <b>day</b> (both groups).
