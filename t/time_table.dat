Kesler {{registered}} five points in the seven games, but was playing with the discomfort steaming from a blocked shot {{in his first game}} back against Dallas. He was given a CT scan for his peace of mind. The results of the scan revealed a fracture in his foot. Though no <b>time</b> <b>table</b> for his return was given, the expectation was that he would be out of the line-up for four-to-six weeks. Late in the month, Kevin Bieksa suffered a groin injury in a game versus the Nashville Predators. He missed the next two games as Vancouver finished the month with back-to-back losses. After being reunited with Burrows, the Sedin twins registered a combined 18 points in the final six games of February, while Kassian tallied only three assists in the 11 games after his demotion.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMastering long {{division}} algorithm {{requires a}} good understanding of the meaning of division, knowledge of the <b>times</b> <b>tables,</b> subtraction skills and also the ability to estimate because it comprises several important principles. Using “Big Number Times Tables” (BNTT) can make the teaching and learning of long division algorithm much easier. BNTT needs children to only memorizing <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> up to table 9. Instead of doing trial and error as they normally do, children are guided to build the <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> systematically and they can build their own <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> with bigger number. Results of the early research show that majority children chose to use big number <b>times</b> <b>table</b> to solve problems because they make less error. Since BNTT guides children to build <b>times</b> <b>tables</b> in a systematic way, this gives the children the confidence to proceed with all the problems given. Teachers also find this technique very helpful. Furthermore, once anyone understands the steps being taken, BNTT can be used not only with one or two digits numbers but it can be applied with any bigger number which has more than two digits...|$|R

25|$|In the vineyard, the {{antepenultimate}} {{event is}} the harvest {{in which the}} grapes are removed from the vine and transported to the winery to begin the wine making process. In the Northern Hemisphere this is generally between September and October while in the Southern Hemisphere it is generally between February and April. The time of harvest depends {{on a variety of}} factors-most notably the subjective determination of ripeness. As the grape ripens on the vines, sugars and pH increase as acids (such as malic acid) decrease. Tannins and other phenolics also develop which can affect the flavors and aromas in the resulting wine. The threat of detrimental weather and vine diseases (such as grey rot) can also {{play a role in the}} <b>time</b> <b>table.</b> The balance of all these factors contributes to when a winemaker or vineyard manager decides that it is time to harvest.|$|E

Unlike in many battles in Eastern Front in Karelian Isthmus Red Army was unable to trap any large Finnish units not even a single battalion. Finnish forces had managed to retreat. At the same time more and more Finnish reserves were coming to VKT-defense line with terrain much more favorable for defenders than for armored Red Army units.

25|$|Both CR and WR competed {{to acquire}} the rake, with WR even announcing a <b>time</b> <b>table</b> for {{operating}} the air-conditioned rake. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced that the rake would be transferred to CR on 16 March 2016. However, at a height of 4.335 metres the rake exceeds the maximum clearance height of 4.270 metres for EMU coaches on the Central Line. In particular, the rake cannot clear the some low height British-era bridges between CST and Kurla. Then Central Railway general manager Sunil Kumar Sood insisted that CR was conduct trials and operate the rake on the Harbour Line. After acquiring the rake, CR conducted tests, safety and mobility checks, and trial runs {{under the supervision of}} the RDSO. However, following Sood's retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate the rake in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate the rake due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer the rake to WR. The rake was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that rake would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could rectified.|$|E
25|$|Preparations for {{a mission}} started {{a month in}} advance with the {{selection}} of the primary and back-up astronaut; they would practice together for the mission. For three days prior to launch, the astronaut went through a special diet to minimize his need for defecating during the flight. On the morning of the trip he typically ate a steak breakfast. After having sensors applied to his body and being dressed in the pressure suit, he started breathing pure oxygen to prepare him for the atmosphere of the spacecraft. He arrived at the launch pad, took the elevator up the launch tower and entered the spacecraft two hours before launch. Once the astronaut was secured inside, the hatch was bolted, the launch area evacuated and the mobile tower rolled back. After this, the launch vehicle was filled with liquid oxygen. The entire procedure of preparing for launch and launching the spacecraft followed a <b>time</b> <b>table</b> called the countdown. It started a day in advance with a pre-count, in which all systems of the launch vehicle and spacecraft were checked. After that followed a 15-hour hold, during which pyrotechnics were installed. Then came the main countdown which for orbital flights started 6½ hours before launch (T – 390 min), counted backwards to launch (T = 0) and then forward until orbital insertion (T + 5 min).|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1921, with {{an article}} {{serialized}} in The Freeman, an Irish cultural journal, Cowell popularized the term tone cluster. While {{he did not}} coin the phrase, as is often claimed, {{he appears to have}} been the first to use it with its current meaning. During the 1920s and 1930s, Cowell toured widely through North America and Europe, playing his own experimental works, many built around tone clusters. In addition to The Tides of Manaunaun, Dynamic Motion, and its five [...] "encores"—What's This (1917), Amiable Conversation (1917), Advertisement (1917), Antinomy (1917, rev. 1959; frequently misspelled [...] "Antimony"), and <b>Time</b> <b>Table</b> (1917)—these include The Voice of Lir (1920), Exultation (1921), The Harp of Life (1924), Snows of Fujiyama (1924), Lilt of the Reel (1930), and Deep Color (1938). Tiger (1930) has a chord of 53 notes, probably the largest ever written for a single instrument until 1969. Along with Ives, Cowell wrote some of the first large-ensemble pieces to make extensive use of clusters. The Birth of Motion ( [...] 1920), his earliest such effort, combines orchestral clusters with glissando. [...] "Tone Cluster," [...] the second movement of Cowell's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1928, prem. 1978), employs a wide variety of clusters for the piano and each instrumental group (...) [...] From a quarter-century later, his Symphony No. 11 (1953) features a sliding chromatic cluster played by muted violins.|$|E
