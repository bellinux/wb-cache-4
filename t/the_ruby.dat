5000|$|With an {{endowment}} from <b>the</b> {{estate of}} <b>Ruby</b> Mercer, <b>the</b> Opera Canada Awards (<b>The</b> <b>Rubies)</b> {{were established in}} 2000. <b>The</b> <b>Rubies</b> recognise and honour outstanding individual achievements on stage and behind the scenes.

50|$|The red {{colouring}} of <b>the</b> <b>rubies</b> {{is due to}} colour-generating {{metallic oxides}} engrained in the crystalline structures. As <b>the</b> <b>rubies</b> from Mogok have formed in marble surroundings with a low content of iron, they display a particularly intense luminosity, which sets off the natural carmine red of <b>the</b> <b>rubies.</b> <b>The</b> best specimens are of “pigeon-blood” colour and therefore especially rare and precious. Most of <b>the</b> raw <b>rubies</b> are cut in Mogok since the market for cut rubies is much bigger. It is therefore quite unusual for an uncut <b>ruby</b> like <b>the</b> Prince of Burma to leave the country.|$|R

5|$|MT 287 {{begins at}} a T-intersection with MT 41 {{in the town}} of Twin Bridges. MT 41 heads west along Fourth Street to cross the Beaverhead River and north along Main Street. MT 287 heads south on Main Street and veers {{southeast}} out of the town. The two-lane highway parallels an inactive Montana Rail Link line through the valley of <b>the</b> <b>Ruby</b> River between <b>the</b> <b>Ruby</b> Range to the southwest and the Tobacco Root Mountains to the northeast. MT 287 follows Main Street through the town of Sheridan, where the route passes the H.D. Rossiter Building, Christ Episcopal Church and Rectory, and the William O'Brien House. The highway passes by the Robbers Roost and to the west of St. Mary of the Assumption Church in the hamlet of Laurin before reaching {{the southern end of the}} rail line in the unincorporated village of Alder, through which the highway follows Main Street and meets the northern end of Upper Ruby Road, which is designated Secondary Highway 357 (S-357).|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of the members, Lorelei, disappears. After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, an entirely new region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to come back with him. Once more, the protagonist must thwart the Team Rocket's plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, <b>the</b> <b>Ruby</b> and the Sapphire, {{and put them in the}} main {{computer}} at One Island. After that, the player can communicate, battle, trade, etc., with Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E

He {{led the league in}} assists in his rookie season, and {{remained}} with the team through 1882, when it folded due to poor attendance. Irwin spent three seasons with the Providence Grays, and was captain and starting shortstop of the 1884 Providence team that became world champions. The 1884 Grays featured star pitchers Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney; the two hurlers did not get along well, and Sweeney left the team {{in the middle of the}} season. The club folded after a fourth-place finish in 1885.|$|E

The dog weighed less than , and had been disqualified from the Westminster Kennel Club the previous year on account of its weight. The average price was lower than that paid by Bismarck.

On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that became known as the Humboldt River. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} items and treasures located {{throughout}} the game. Many of these treasures are obtained by defeating enemies and include the following: gold; golden water jugs, necklaces, scales of justice, harps, mirrors, and crowns which increase the player's score; hourglasses which refill the Hourglass Timer; hearts which refill the life meter; gauntlets which temporarily double Wonder Boy's attack power; helmets which temporarily provide additional protection from enemy attacks; Wing Boots which allow Wonder Boy {{to fly over}} obstacles; Revival Potions; and magic mantles which make Wonder Boy temporarily invisible. Other special items hidden in the game which the player must find include letters, the flute, various charms, the bell, and <b>the</b> <b>ruby.</b>|$|E
50|$|As Professor Knowby {{attempts}} {{to escape the}} cabin, he is killed by <b>the</b> younger <b>Ruby</b> of year 1982, who then retrieves the Necronomicon. Henrietta murders Tanya, and battles Ash, but is ultimately defeated once more. Ash reunites with Ruby and Kelly to confront <b>the</b> younger <b>Ruby.</b> <b>The</b> present <b>Ruby</b> warns her younger self that following Baal {{is not the right}} path and cautions her to build a better future. <b>The</b> young <b>Ruby</b> proceeds to stab the present one with the kandarian dagger, who then uses the book to knock her younger self unconscious. As <b>the</b> older <b>Ruby</b> now lays dying, she tells Ash and Kelly to take the book and return to <b>the</b> present. <b>Ruby</b> tells Kelly to build her own life for herself and to forge her own path.

5|$|Within 90 {{minutes of}} the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic {{evidence}} quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives {{parked in front of the}} building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and angry about its handling of <b>the</b> <b>Ruby</b> Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.|$|E
5|$|After the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI received over {{a thousand}} calls a day for months {{in response to the}} offer of a $1million reward for information leading to the identity of the Unabomber. Many letters claiming to be from the Unabomber were also sent to the UNABOM Task Force, and thousands of suspect leads were reviewed. While the FBI was occupied with new leads, David Kaczynski hired private investigator Susan Swanson in Chicago to investigate Ted's activities discreetly. The Kaczynski brothers had become estranged in 1990, and David had not seen Ted for ten years. David later hired Washington, D.C., attorney Tony Bisceglie to organize evidence acquired by Swanson, and make contact with the FBI, given the likely difficulty in attracting the FBI's attention. He wanted to protect his brother from the danger of an FBI raid, such as <b>the</b> <b>Ruby</b> Ridge or the Waco Siege, since he assumed Ted would not take kindly to being contacted by the FBI and would be likely to react violently.|$|E
5|$|In Alder, MT 287 {{leaves the}} valley of <b>the</b> <b>Ruby</b> River and heads east through Alder Gulch, a narrow valley along which the highway ascends the more {{moderate}} mountains between the Tobacco Root Mountains {{to the north and}} the Gravelly Range to the south. The length of the valley is filled with tailings, or small hills of mining waste left behind by gold dredge placer mining over decades of mining. The highway passes through the village of Nevada City, the site of the Finney House and the Dr. Don L. Byam House. MT 287 follows the Alder Gulch Short Line Railroad, an isolated narrow-gauge railway, until the route reaches Virginia City. The highway enters the town on Nevada Street but mainly follows Wallace Street through the Virginia City Historic District, a National Historic Landmark preserving buildings of Montana's second territorial capital. MT 287 leaves Virginia City and ascends to its highest point along Daylight Creek. The highway descends into {{the valley of}} the Madison River along Eightmile Creek. MT 287 meets the northern end of S-249 (Varney Road) where the highway curves north on arriving at the Madison River. The highway enters the town of Ennis along Bauer Lane and curves east onto West Main Street before reaching its eastern terminus at US 287, which heads north and east along Main Street.|$|E

5|$|The action quickly {{revealed}} {{a breakdown in}} discipline amongst Benbow's captains. He had intended that the 64-gun HMS Defiance under Captain Richard Kirkby would lead the line of battle, but Kirkby was not maintaining his station. Benbow {{decided to take the}} lead himself, and the Breda pulled ahead, followed by the 50-gun HMS Ruby under Captain George Walton. The two maintained contact with the French throughout the night, but the other five ships refused to close. The chase ensued until 24 August, with only Benbow, Walton, and Samuel Vincent aboard HMS Falmouth making active efforts to bring the French to battle. At times, they bore the brunt of the fire of the entire squadron. <b>The</b> <b>Ruby</b> was disabled on 23 August, and Benbow ordered her to retire to Port Royal. The French resumed the action {{at two in the morning}} on 24 August, the entire squadron closing on the Breda from astern and pounding her. Benbow himself was hit by a chain-shot that broke his leg and he was carried below.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ruby</b> Ranch Member is {{the most}} {{widespread}} and distinctive member of the Cedar Mountain. It was named for exposures on <b>the</b> <b>Ruby</b> Ranch located southeast of Green River, Utah. The member is composed of maroon mudstones with irregular spheres of carbonate nodules. The nodules formed in ancient soils that developed in the mud deposited on the flood plain in a strongly seasonal, semiarid climate. Evaporation of groundwater {{during the dry season}} concentrated calcium carbonate and other minerals in the upper parts of the soil horizon. Radiometric dates place the upper portions of <b>the</b> <b>Ruby</b> Ranch in the late Aptian. Exhumed river channels in <b>the</b> <b>Ruby</b> Ranch indicate that stream flow during the Aptian was towards the northeast, the direction of the encrouching Western Interior Seaway.|$|E
