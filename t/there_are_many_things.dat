25|$|Each {{science has}} its own unique sets of {{laboratory}} equipment. In the atmosphere, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime {{was one of the}} first atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the rain gauge, the anemometer, and the hygrometer. Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable. Even Aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.|$|E

500|$|Hans Lundgren {{was born}} on 3 November 1957 in Spånga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (née Tjerneld), a {{language}} teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spånga {{until the age of}} 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Ångermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and vented his frustration on his wife and eldest son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a [...] "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, [...] "I still love my father, no matter what happened. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with." [...] He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.|$|E

2500|$|In the 6th century, Pseudo-Dionysius {{claims that}} {{a version of}} the omnipotence paradox {{constituted}} the dispute between St. Paul and Elymas the Magician mentioned in Acts 13:8, but it is phrased in terms of a debate {{as to whether or not}} God can [...] "deny himself" [...] ala 2 Tim 2:13. In the 11th century, St. Anselm argues that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> that God cannot do, but that nonetheless he counts as omnipotent.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to a question about astrology he explained: [...] "Under my definition, a scientific theory is a proposed explanation which focuses or points to physical, observable data and logical inferences. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> throughout the history of science which we now think to be incorrect which nonetheless… would fit that definition. Yes, astrology is in fact one, and so is the ether theory of the propagation of light, and… many other theories as well." ...|$|E

Despite his longevity, he [...] "still doesn't know how to communicate", being [...] "locked up in his own brain" [...] in the words of Oeming.|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{was always}} {{critical}} of the Soviet Union and he does now accept that Mao's regime in China was responsible for 'a huge death toll, {{in the tens of}} millions'. However, back in 1960s, Chomsky was considerably less {{critical of the}} communist movements in Asia, noting what he considered to be grassroots elements within both Chinese and Vietnamese communism. In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, [...] "I don't feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable." [...] Chomsky continued: [...] "There are even better examples than China. But I do think that China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which {{a good deal of the}} collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step." [...] He said of Vietnam: [...] "Although there appears to be a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels, still major planning is highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities." ...|$|E
