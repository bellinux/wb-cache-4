40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{expression}} “mediazione linguistica” (ML) [LinguisticMediation], used in the current name of the degree-course class number 3 (recently renumbered as L- 12) in Italy. The analysis carried out shows that the introduction of such an expression is based neither on normative grounds, nor on other official Italian institutional documents. Furthermore, the label {{does not seem to}} have been accepted or adopted by professionals, and contrasts with the definitions of the European Council Common European Framework for Languages, the only official document in which the expression “ML” has been defined and institutionally adopted. The inappropriate use of this label has opened up the way to a variety of often arbitrary interpretations of the expression by many Italian degree courses, and ML often tends to be confused with Cultural Mediation. Moreover, the conceptualization of the linguistic mediator as a lower-level professional in comparison to <b>translators</b> <b>or</b> <b>interpreters</b> seems to be utterly unjustified and unsatisfactory. Italian universities should therefore consider the origin and the meaning of the expression ML with more care and precision, and it would be highly desirable to use it as little as possible in the names of different degree courses or curricula.

40|$|When {{families}} {{migrate to}} a new country their children often learn the local language faster than their parents. This can lead to their taking on a role as <b>translators</b> <b>or</b> <b>interpreters</b> for the family. That may occur in many settings, but schools {{are one of the}} most common locations for child language brokering (CLB). As part of a wider study we sought to identify what might be the special characteristics of schools as CLB sites. In a doctor's surgery or a lawyer's office children act unequivocally as brokers on behalf of their family. They do not purport to be detached or independent in the sense that a professional interpreter would aspire to be, but are seen to be working actively to support the family's interests and are partly trusted by their parents for that reason. Language brokering at school is a different situation in which the interests of parents and child may not always be aligned in the same way. When representing school perspectives to their parents and family perspectives to their teachers, children may have complex motives for transparency and for concealment. We explored these issues through an online survey and a series of episodic interviews. The participants were teachers who had used CLBs in their schools and young adults who had acted as CLBs during their own school career. We will conclude the presentation by illustrating how the implications of the findings for good practice in schools have been disseminated through web-based guidance...|$|R

Conversely, if the task is complicated, translation and interpretation comes into play. As one manager (FM) explained, technical work like presenting new technology to local workers and clients typically does not involve complicated negotiation and thus minimum language proficiency usually suffices. Conversely, detailed communication requires a <b>translator</b> <b>or</b> <b>interpreter,</b> usually local Chinese employees or Japanese employees who are proficient in Mandarin and hired locally. However, language specialists per se are few—they might initially be hired for communication purposes but they are trained to acquire other work skills.

Overall, many expatriates are compelled to use language(s) other than Japanese with varied levels of sophistication. This raises a set of questions posed by one former expatriate (BF 1): [...]...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo study {{different}} languages to be professional <b>translator</b> <b>or</b> <b>interpreter</b> is a challenging mission.

This refers to verifying the hypothesis to implement corpora as training electronic platforms in translation and interpreting studies (TIS).

40|$|When {{families}} {{migrate to}} a new country their children often learn the local language faster than their parents. In particular, the children’s attendance at school expedites learning the new language, and in turn they often become <b>translators</b> <b>or</b> <b>interpreters</b> for their family. Schools {{are one of the}} most common settings for this activity. As part of a wider study examining teachers and child language brokers experiences of brokering in school we sought answers to the following questions: What are the special characteristics of schools as sites for child language brokering (CLB) ? To what degree are CLBs used in routine contacts with parents (their own & those of others), in more sensitive discussions about vulnerable pupils (e. g. about special educational needs) and in discussions when crucial matters are being resolved (e. g. planning for subject choices during their secondary school career) ? There is general acceptance of the principle that children should not be asked to translate for their parents or others when very serious or sensitive matters are being discussed, but do those who are directly involved abide by that principle? This paper will report data that is relevant to these questions from an online survey and a series of episodic interviews with teachers who had used CLBs in their schools and young adults who had acted as CLBs during their own school career. The ways in which these questions are resolved in UK schools have to be understood in the context of national traditions of pastoral care in education. The participants’ observations reflect underlying assumptions about the nature of childhood and emerging development that they themselves had or perceived in others...|$|R
40|$|There {{are people}} who believe that skill in {{translation}} cannot be learned and, especially, cannot be taught. Behind this attitude is the assumption that some people are born with a gift of being good <b>translators</b> <b>or</b> <b>interpreters,</b> whereas others simply do not have the knack; in other words, skill in translation is a talent: either you’ve got it or you haven’t. Furthermore, theoretically we are used to come across terms such as Source text (ST) & Target text (TT). So, with these terms in mind, the translation process can be broken down into two types of activity: understanding a ST and formulating a TT. These two types of process do not occur successively, but simultaneously; in fact, one may not even realize that one has imperfectly understood the ST until one comes up against a problem in formulating or evaluating a TT. In such a case, one may {{need to go back to}} square one, so as to reinterpret and reconstruct the ST in the light of one’s new understanding of it. In this way, ST interpretation and TT formulation go hand in hand. So for the purposes of discussion, it is useful to think of them as different, mutually separable, processes. Translation equivalence is defined as a measure of semantic similarity between ST and TT. If we compare a number of TTs with their STs we shall discover that the degree of semantic similarity between the two texts involved in the translating process may vary. In other words the equivalence between ST and TT may be based on the reproduction of different parts of the ST contents. Accordingly, several types of translation equivalence can be distinguished...|$|R

After this introductory discussion, we want to deal with terminology: “wiretap” and “interpreting” maybe is not the best terminological combination. Referring to “wire”-tap is rather obsolete in 2016 and “interpreting” is a too limited term to define what these professionals/experts do when interpreting/translating/transcribing/summarizing tapped materials. Next, we want to explore what is the situation in the Netherlands confronted to the situation in Belgium. In the Netherlands, research has been done, training and certification for LiTE (Linguistic Tap Experts) or FoTE (Forensic Tap experts) has been set up and further recent investigation has been published on the “Darknet” (these are different ways to avoid interception through technology and ICT). In Belgium we still have a long(er) way to go, starting from training and certification of LITs (Legal Interpreters and Translators) and a National Register of Sworn Interpreters and Translators.

This thesis also reviews Defense-and Navy-identified, mission-critical, foreign language proficiency and cultural awareness skills and the Manpower requirements and billets requiring such skills. Navy linguists, concentrated in the Cryptologic Technician Interpretive (CTI) rating, require up to two years of foreign language and technical training, a Top Secret security clearance and eligibility for Sensitive Compartmented Information. CTIs increasingly perform foreign language duties outside of their core intelligence analyst competencies, such as <b>translator</b> <b>or</b> <b>interpreter,</b> which could be filled by Sailors who are native speakers. However, security clearance requirements of the CTI rating typically exclude Sailors who possess the native foreign language skills and cultural background.

40|$|Even though student translators {{and student}} interpreters {{are quite a}} {{homogenous}} group of advanced language learners – they share the same curriculum {{for the first three}} years of their four-year training in Flemish Colleges – many teachers claim they are poles apart in terms of personality characteristics. The same clichés apply to professional interpreters and translators. Interpreters are considered more outgoing and self-assured while translators bear the stamp of perfectionism and introversion. With this paper we aim to investigate these assumptions empirically. Although the translator profession as well as the interpreter profession requires adequate advanced linguistic skills, a number of non-linguistic skills (such as heuristic skills for the translator and interpreting strategies for the interpreter) also prove necessary when aiming for good job performance. Both linguistic and non-linguistic skills are an important part of translator and interpreting training programmes, yet students’ decisions to enter <b>translator</b> <b>or</b> <b>interpreter</b> training seems to be informed by individual difference variables underlying the development of these non-linguistic skills rather than by their linguistic command. Although individual difference variables (ID variables) between learners have received a lot of attention over the past two decades in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) Research, their relevance for translator and interpreter training remains underexplored, with the exception of some recent studies focussing on ID variables in interpreters and translators (e. g. Jiménez Ivars and Pinazo Calatayud 2001; Schweda Nicholson 2005; Hubscher-Davidson 2009; Bontempo and Napier 2011; Rosiers, Eyckmans and Bauwens 2011).

40|$|At a nexus between {{translation}} studies and didactics, {{the teaching of}} sight translation within the parameters of a foreign language course has as its primary aim to improve the communication skills of foreign language learners {{in general and of}} French learners at the University of Pretoria in particular. Contrary to the communication process in their first and second languages, students who try to speak a foreign language such as French are unable to express their thoughts freely. To compensate for their insufficient language knowledge and intuition, they tend to rely on their other languages as a reference for all communication. Although this natural reflex is part of the learning process, students' attempts to transfer words, phrases, and rules directly from one language to another can be detrimental to language performance. The problem does not lie in the fact that they translate mentally before speaking, but that they tend to translate literally. This is a highly inefficient communication strategy that results in a non-idiomatic, imperfect reflection of students’ actual knowledge of language. Unlike the above-mentioned mental transcoding and the so-called pedagogical translation generally practiced in the language class, the interpretive translation approach focuses on the reexpression of the meaning of the original text. This professional translation approach should be applied to all translation, including translation in the language class. Although the purpose is not to train professional <b>translators</b> <b>or</b> <b>interpreters,</b> students still need to learn to translate intelligently, whether verbally or mentally, without literally reproducing their reference languages. Since students are even more tempted than professionals to rely on the source language due to their limited language knowledge, they should explicitly learn to look for alternative means of expression available to them instead of transcoding this language. Sight translation is a very economical technique to teach this approach in language classes, as students learn to translate in their own words, using all their communication skills. Students learn how best to convey the meaning of the source text with the limited vocabulary and grammar skills at their disposal. When speaking, they also focus on the meaning of their utterances and use compensatory strategies when faced with a language problem, instead of copying from their reference languages or avoiding the problem altogether by switching to another language. In the space of little more than a year, the majority of the forty-four students who participated in the empirical research learned to communicate in a natural and authentic manner without undue interference from their other languages (mainly English). Those who have mastered the approach increasingly use efficient strategies to overcome language shortcomings, thus abandoning formal transfer to the benefit of their oral expression. In addition, a small number of talented students were identified to engage in further specialised translation and interpretation training. In conclusion, sight translation teaching in the classroom proved to be a highly beneficial method to improve translation and communication skills among French foreign language learners in the multicultural environment of the University of Pretoria.
