40|$|The Multivariate {{analysis}} of variance (MANOVA) {{is often used to}} model responses from more than one response variable on a single factor or a set of factors of interest. The existing statistical methods for MANOVA modelling generally assume that the set of responses, and by extension the model error term have a Gaussian distribution. However, in many real life situations, the vector of responses are not normally distributed, thereby rendering some of the existing methods inefficient, especially under small sample size situations. This study therefore, investigates, through Monte-Carlo studies, the behaviours of three of the existing techniques for performing MANOVA tests when normality assumption on the error term is violated. Two <b>truncated</b> <b>test</b> statistics for MANOVA testing on data with non-normal responses were developed from the existing test methods. The Monte-Carlo results showed that the original Royâ€™s test method and the two proposed <b>truncated</b> <b>test</b> statistics are relatively more efficient for MANOVA testing on data with inherent non-Gaussian responses under small sample sizes situations...|$|E

The test {{is intended for}} checking the ratio MTBFl /MTBFs exceeds or equals a prescribed value, versus one that it {{is less than the}} prescribed value, by means of long term tests with large average sample number in the earlier system. Our proposed system focus on improving test by using low average sample number in short term which is having the advantage of economy in time requirement and cost. It produces optimum <b>truncated</b> <b>test</b> called binomial Sequential Probability Ratio Test. Criteria are proposed for determining the characteristics of <b>truncated</b> <b>test</b> followed with the discretizing effect of truncation on error probabilities with a view to optimization of its parameters. The search algorithm for truncation apex used in this system achieves closeness to the optimum which depends on successful choice of the initial approximation, search boundaries and on the search step. The enhanced reliability of modern technological systems, combined with the reduced time quotas allotted for creating new system is capable of yielding a highly efficacious test which increases reliability and feasibility of decisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{channelized}} receiver {{which is}} optimal {{for the detection}} of unknown non-coherent frequency-hopped waveforms bases its decision on a fixed-length block of input data. In this paper we present a sequential method of interception according to which whenever a new data element is collected, a decision is made as to the presence or non-presence of a frequencyhopped waveform. If that decision was indeterminate, another data element is collected. An optimal sequential test is derived, under the assumption that the waveform signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is known. It is shown that this sequential test requires less data, on average, than the fixed length method to make a decision with the same reliability. Also derived is a truncated sequential method where a decision is forced, if still indeterminate, after some set amount of data is collected. The <b>truncated</b> <b>test</b> is shown to improve the number of samples needed for a decision when the input signal-to-noise ratio defers greatly from that assumed in the derivation of the test. Furthermore it is shown, that the <b>truncated</b> <b>test</b> yields a limited degree of robustness when the input S/N defers slightly from that assumed. A detailed analysis of the performance of these tests is conducted from which a method for finding an optimal truncation point follows. Numerical results which are based on this analysis as well as on simulation of the interceptor's performance are presented to prove the claims made above...|$|E

30|$|An S-lay crane barge, named CNOOC 201, {{has been}} built for pipe laying in {{deepwater}} oil/gas fields in the South China Sea. It is due to be commissioned {{by the end of}} the year 2010. A special lifting system is developed to meet the challenge that installing deepwater risers from an S-lay barge is difficult and has not been achieved. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the model test on such an innovative system, which has to be done before field application. By applying the similarity theory, the movement of the S-lay barge is simulated through a six degrees-of-freedom motion platform, and a truncated model riser is utilized for the model testing. The displacement and force boundary conditions at the truncated position of the riser are obtained from the catenary governing equation and become realized by a slideway cart and a loading system designed to control the configuration of the model riser, which presents a similar configuration to a real riser in deepwater. The test results are in very good agreement with theoretical calculations, showing that the active <b>truncated</b> <b>test</b> is applicable for controlling the configuration of the deepwater riser in model testing investigation.|$|E

It begins with a definition and purpose {{for the study of}} life testing and progresses to a discussion of failure rate, an important factor in the science of life testing. It is established that there are certain items that exhibit a constant failure rate, and hence obey the exponential life distribution. It is with these items that the majority of this paper is devoted. A censored test plan of an exponential life distribution is discussed in Chapter 2 and certain important aspects of this plan are demonstrated. This includes finding the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean life, its density function, and material concerning the failure out of n items on test. Chapter 3 describes a <b>truncated</b> <b>test</b> plan for an exponential life distribution, using both finite and infinite lot sizes. This is related to the various quality levels required of the product. Single-stage plans are contrasted with multi-stage plans in this section. Chapter 4 concludes this paper with a discussion of the exponential distribution as a boundary between the increasing failure rate and decreasing failure rate distributions. It includes a description of tolerance limits and confidence limits...|$|E

40|$|Various {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for identifying geneâ€“gene interactions in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, most methods focus on individual markers as the testing unit, and the large number of such tests drastically erodes statistical power. In this study, we propose novel interaction tests of quantitative traits that are gene-based and that confer advantage in both statistical power and biological interpretation. The framework of gene-based geneâ€“gene interaction (GGG) tests combine marker-based interaction tests between all pairs of markers in two genes to produce a gene-level test for interaction between the two. The tests are based on an analytical formula we derive for the correlation between marker-based interaction tests due to linkage disequilibrium. We propose four GGG tests that extend the following P value combining methods: minimum P value, extended Simes procedure, truncated tail strength, and truncated P value product. Extensive simulations point to correct type I error rates of all tests and show that the two <b>truncated</b> <b>tests</b> are more powerful than the other tests in cases of markers involved in the underlying interaction not being directly genotyped and in cases of multiple underlying interactions. We applied our tests to pairs of genes that exhibit a proteinâ€“protein interaction to test for gene-level interactions underlying lipid levels using genotype data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.
