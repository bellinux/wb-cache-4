The word implies, in fact, supernatural or superhuman power, like Beowulf's gift from God of [...] "thirtyfold strength".

2500|$|The {{diagrams}} {{that have}} non-trivial automorphisms are An (...) , Dn (...) , and E6. In all these cases except for D4, {{there is a}} single non-trivial automorphism (Out = C2, the cyclic group of order 2), while for D4, the automorphism group is the symmetric group on three letters (S3, order 6) – this phenomenon is known as [...] "triality". It happens that all these diagram automorphisms can be realized as Euclidean symmetries of how the diagrams are conventionally drawn in the plane, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> artifact of how they are drawn, and not intrinsic structure.|$|E
2500|$|Cruz has {{repeatedly}} {{said that the}} 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran [...] "will make the Obama administration the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism". In response, Obama called Cruz's statements an example of [...] "outrageous attacks" [...] from Republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse: [...] "We've had a sitting senator, {{who also happens to}} be running for President, suggest that I'm the leading state sponsor of terrorism. Maybe <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now." [...] Former Republican Presidential Nominee Mitt Romney also criticized Cruz for his remarks, writing that although he, too, was opposed to the Iran agreement, Cruz's statement connecting Obama to terrorism was [...] "way over the line" [...] and [...] "hurts the cause".|$|E
2500|$|On Earth, {{our bodies}} react {{automatically}} to gravity, maintaining both posture and locomotion in a downward pulling world. In microgravity environments, these constant signals are absent: the otolith organs {{in the inner}} ear are sensitive to linear acceleration and no longer perceive a downwards bias; muscles are no longer required to contract to maintain posture, and pressure receptors in the feet and ankles no longer signal the direction of [...] "down". These changes can immediately result in visual-orientation illusions where the astronaut feels he has flipped 180 degrees. [...] Over half of astronauts also experience symptoms of motion sickness {{for the first three}} days of travel due to the conflict between what the body expects and what the body actually perceives. Over time however the brain adapts and although these illusions can still occur, most astronauts begin to see [...] "down" [...] as where the feet are. People returning to Earth after extended weightless periods have to readjust to the force of gravity and may have problems standing up, focusing their gaze, walking and turning. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> initial problem, as they recover these abilities quickly.|$|E

2500|$|In Sonnet 78, Shakespeare has a mock {{debate between}} {{the young man}} and himself: [...] "The mock-debate of the sonnet is: should the young man be prouder of Shakespeare's poem {{compiled}} out of rude ignorance, or of those of his more learned admirers?" [...] This question {{is followed by a}} mock answer: [...] "The mock answer is that the young man should be prouder of having taught a hitherto dumb admirer to sing, and of having advanced ignorance as high as learning, because these achievements on his part testify more impressively to his originally power than his (slighter) accomplishments with respect to his learned poets — he but mends their style and graces their arts." [...] The debate that Shakespeare presents is [...] "in a Petrarchan logical structure, with a clearly demarcated octave and sestet." [...] Shakespeare has to exhibit his present art as at least equal to that of his rivals. He accomplishes this [...] "by first resorting to a country-bumpkin, fairy-tale idiot-son role, presenting himself as a Cinderella, so to speak, raised from the cinders to the skies." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> example of some of the ignorance that Shakespeare displays in parts of the sonnet such as in the first quatrain.|$|E
