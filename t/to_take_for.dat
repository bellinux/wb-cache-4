5|$|A folk tale from Barra {{tells of}} a lonely kelpie that {{transforms}} itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put {{to work for a}} year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E

25|$|To {{believe in}} God means to accept {{life on the}} {{assumption}} that it harbors conditions in the outer world and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> granted in the common concerns of life, {{without being able to}} give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.|$|E

25|$|This {{construction}} differs {{slightly from}} the one in (Macdonald, 1979). That construction only uses the surjective morphisms n without mentioning the injective morphisms n: it constructs the homogeneous components of R separately, and equips their direct sum with a ring structure using the n. It is also observed that {{the result can be}} described as an inverse limit in the category of graded rings. That description however somewhat obscures an important property typical for a direct limit of injective morphisms, namely that every individual element (symmetric function) is already faithfully represented in some object used in the limit construction, here a ring RSd. It suffices <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> d the degree of the symmetric function, since the part in degree d of that ring is mapped isomorphically to rings with more indeterminates by n for all n'd. This implies that for studying relations between individual elements, there is no fundamental difference between symmetric polynomials and symmetric functions.|$|E
25|$|Howard Robinson is {{a philosopher}} who has {{concentrated}} his research within {{the philosophy of}} mind. Taking what has been through {{the latter part of}} the last century an unfashionable stance, he has consistently argued against those explanations of sensory experience that would reduce them to physical origins. He has never regarded the theory of sense-data as refuted, but has set out to refute in turn the objections which so many have considered to be conclusive. The version of the theory of sense-data he defends takes what is before consciousness in perception to be qualia as mental presentations that are causally linked to external entities, but which are not physical in themselves. Unlike the philosophers so far mentioned, he is therefore a dualist, one who takes both matter and mind to have real and metaphysically distinct natures. His books (particularly Matter and Sense and Perception) are characterized by the thoroughness with which he deals with the arguments of opposing philosophers, thus setting a professional example that it would be well for his opponents to follow (for there has been a tendency <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> granted that the theory of sense-data is wholly obsolescent). In one of his most recent articles he takes the physicalist to task for ignoring the fact that sensory experience can be entirely free of representational character. He cites phosphenes as a stubborn example (phosphenes are flashes of neural light that result either from sudden pressure in the brain—as induced, for example, by intense coughing, or through direct physical pressure on the retina), and points out that it is grossly counter-intuitive to argue that these are not visual experiences on a par with open-eye seeing.|$|E

500|$|In {{a recent}} book about the Bomb project, Graham Farmelo wrote that [...] "Chadwick did {{more than any other}} {{scientist}} to give Churchill the Bomb.... Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point." [...] So worried that he could not sleep, Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that [...] "a nuclear bomb was not only possible—it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. Everybody would think about them before long, and some country would put them into action". Sir Hermann Bondi suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter's prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick's interest in [...] "looking forward" [...] to the Bomb's prospects.|$|E
500|$|Vietnamese {{records show}} that when Định disobeyed the court's orders, he was {{stripped}} of his position and titles: [...] "Trương Định has refused {{to return to the}} exercise of his office, and he is accordingly removed from that function with loss of honorific titles." [...] Nguyen Thong, a former mandarin who fought alongside Định and corresponded with many other guerrilla leaders, agreed with the court records. According to Thong, Định's continued resistance resulted from local initiatives contrary to Huế's explicit instructions. Định's supporters implored him to disobey the edicts of 1862 that directed the partisans to end hostilities: [...] "Our people forced the Westerners to retreat many times, and now that the court has made peace with them, they will surely kill us.... Since the court has settled with them, who will support us?

500|$|The {{book was}} used to teach {{literary}} theory at universities beginning not long after publication and remained dominant into the mid-1960s, at which time an increasingly heterogeneous academia questioned the universal value of literature; literary theorist Terry Eagleton finds that, after the 1960s, [...] "it was no longer possible <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> granted what what literature was, how to read it, or what social functions it might serve". Steven Mailloux describes Theory of Literature as crystallizing an American movement towards intrinsic literary criticism, as dominated by New Criticism, while van Rees credits the book with popularizing a text-oriented interpretation. Grabowicz writes that its importance for both American and general literary studies is [...] "indisputable". Writing in 1987, Jeremy Hawthorn described the book as an [...] "excellent introductory study", despite extrinsic studies having become more dominant in literary criticism, while Holquist found that the book could still [...] "be usefully invoked" [...] in literary debates of the early 21stcentury. In an obituary of Wellek, Robert Thomas Jr. credited Theory of Literature with [...] "introduc European scholarship to the United States" [...] and establishing a framework for comparative literature studies in the United States.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack for Sonic R was {{composed}} by British composer Richard Jacques of Sega Europe, {{who had also}} previously worked on the soundtrack of the Sega Saturn and PC versions of Sonic 3D Blast. Work on the soundtrack began in March 1997 when Jacques travelled to Japan to meet with Sonic creator Yuji Naka to discuss the musical approach <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> the game. The first song written was [...] "Super Sonic Racing," [...] which {{would be used for}} the game's reveal in June at E3. British singer TJ Davis provided the vocals for the song, which Naka liked so much that he requested that she be featured in all the game's songs. Jacques wrote all the lyrics for the songs with the intention that they would complement the on-screen action but still be appealing to someone who had never played the game. Tracks were recorded and programmed at Sega Digital Studios, and then worked on for two weeks at Metropolis Studios in London, where a week was spent on vocals, and a week was spent on producing, mixing, and finalising the tracks. Sonic R features two separate mixes of each song in its in-game soundtrack; ones with vocals and instrumental versions, giving the player the option to disable vocals. An official soundtrack CD was released on 21 January 1998.|$|E
