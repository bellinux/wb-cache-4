I feel a deep frustration at this new roadblock, as I now have to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back and undergo treatment. The band means so much to me, and cancelling the tour has been a very sad decision. I am hopeful that in the near future we will be back on the road again playing music we love.|$|E

25|$|Before Hus left Prague, {{he decided}} to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> which gave a new {{dimension}} to his endeavors. He no longer put his trust in an indecisive King, a hostile Pope or an ineffective Council. On 18 October 1412 he appealed to Jesus Christ as the supreme judge. By appealing directly to the highest Christian authority, Christ himself, he bypassed the laws and structures of the medieval Church. For the Bohemian Reformation, this step was as significant as the 95 theses nailed {{to the door of the}} Wittenberg church by Martin Luther in 1517.|$|E
25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
25|$|Poincaré {{states that}} {{mathematics}} (analysis) and physics {{are in the}} same spirit, that the two disciplines share a common aesthetic goal and that both can liberate humanity from its simple state. In a more pragmatic way, the interdependence of physics and mathematics is similar to his proposed relationship between intuition and analysis. The language of mathematics not only permits one to express scientific advancements, but also to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back to comprehend the broader world of nature. Mathematics demonstrates the extent of the specific and limited discoveries made by physicists. On the other hand, physics has a key role for the mathematician - a creative role since it presents atypical problems ingrained in reality. In addition, physics offers solutions and reasoning - thus the development of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton within the framework of Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

25|$|For instance, in the ABA {{transfer}} system {{a group of}} say eight racers {{sign up for the}} 17-18 Intermediate class. That is more than enough to have three motos (four is the minimum). Moto #1 will have all eight racers. The first two finishers qualify for and do not race again until the Main. Moto #2 will be a second heat for the remaining six racers; again, the first two across the finish line from that group will go the Main. Finally, a third moto of the remaining four riders is run, from which the first two racers across the finish line will be taken to the Main, forming a six-man Main. The last two racers do not qualify (DNQ) and therefore do not race in the Main, do not collect any points, trophies, a chance to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in advancement to a higher amateur level or if they are professionals, prize money.|$|E
25|$|After {{experiencing}} {{a decade of}} warfare with an increasingly higher profile, the FARC needed another conference to establish a more sophisticated military plan for its future operations. The conference was held in late 1970s {{under the leadership of}} Manuel Marulanda and Jacobo Arenas, which by then were the FARC's key leaders. According to some historical reports about the FARC in the 1970s, they then decided to form a military academy similar to the ones in existing socialist countries, like those in the Soviet Union, Cuba, and also like those employed by its enemies, like the United States and the United Kingdom. The FARC identified several difficulties that made the situation increasingly complex due to the growing threat of the enemy, and decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward in a different form, through maintaining a policy of advanced military training. FARC had built a training structure in a totally different way, not directly comparable with those of orthodox military organizations, as each level of training had to end with a period of combat experience in real life warfare, before progressing to the next level.|$|E
500|$|Shave Magazine Jake Tomlinson {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars and wrote, [...] "There is a very strong sense of humor as well as {{emotional}} depth, yet the scope of the film sometimes limits these sentiments.

500|$|When two Canadian astronomers {{argued that}} they {{potentially}} discovered 234 extraterrestrial civilizations through analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database, Douglas Vakoch doubted their explanation for their findings, noting {{that it would be}} unusual for all of these stars to pulse at exactly the same frequency unless they were part a coordinated network: “If you <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back,” he said, “that would mean you have 234 independent stars that all decided to transmit the exact same way.” ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone in May 2009, Shinoda said the band {{was in the process}} of writing and recording material for the album. The album was originally scheduled for an early 2010 release, but Shinoda was concerned with [...] "the quality of the tunes" [...] and said, [...] "if we need to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back and make sure everything is top, top quality by our standards, we will". Shinoda also said that, in comparison to Minutes to Midnight, the new album would have a bigger [...] "thread of consistency" [...] and would be more experimental and [...] "hopefully more cutting-edge".|$|E
500|$|This episode got {{overwhelmingly}} positive reviews. Phoebe Reilly of Vulture wrote {{highly of}} the episode and called it [...] "the best of the season so far." [...] James Poniewoznik of Time compared the episode and the season at large to the later work of The Beatles; he noted that, [...] "after becoming known for a string of ambitious" [...] entries, they both [...] "decide to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> backward stylistically". For this reason, he enjoyed [...] "China", and opined that [...] "The China plot, which thankfully focused less on Michael's craziness than his (and his coworkers') relationship with Oscar, demonstrated how well-drawn the show has been even {{when it comes to}} its more peripheral characters." [...] He also said the episode was [...] "vintage Office." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 22, 2015, {{producer}} Malek Akkad {{expressed his}} wishes to postpone production {{for the new}} Halloween film and insists that the next iteration and the extra time {{will result in a}} better film. Malek said of Halloween Returns: [...] "Although, I have to say, and this is somewhat new news, but unfortunately things happen in Hollywood where you have issues with studios and different variables. We've had to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back and now we’re trying to re-figure this beast that is the new Halloween. So there {{is a bit of a}} delay, but this new Halloween isn't going to be quite what has been announced and what people are expecting, so we're making some changes there as well." ...|$|E
500|$|PewDiePie {{formerly}} put out videos {{with a high}} frequency, {{something he}} scaled down in 2014. By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 {{of which have been}} made private. In March 2017, PewDiePie commented that his channel was running on a daily output, stating, [...] " [...] a lot of challenges in doing daily content, it's stupid. I really shouldn't be doing it, I really should just fucking go back and upload twice a week or some shit, and then <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back, but I still really, really love the daily challenge—the daily grind—of just being like, 'hey, I'm gonna make a video today, no matter what.' And sometimes it really works, and sometimes it doesn't." ...|$|E
500|$|When she awakes, {{she asks}} Dr. Cox if the surgery works, but Cox replies [...] "you're gonna {{have to tell}} us", and they <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back; Ms. Miller {{realized}} that the surgery was a success, she no longer hears singing, and thanks Dr. Cox and the others. J.D. breaks the moment asking her who was the best singer in her head, much {{to the rest of}} the staff's (and especially Dr. Cox's) dismay. J.D. reflects in voiceover that in musicals everyone get what they want, but in reality, after having made a choice we may miss the way things were; as Elliot realizes she misses her roommate, Carla realizes she wishes she spent more time with her daughter, and Ms. Miller realizes she misses the music in her head.|$|E

The conflict between Cristina and Meredith widens when Cristina commandeers Meredith's resources for her own trial, ultimately garnering a Harper Avery nomination for Cristina. Cristina and Meredith repair their relationship when Meredith confesses that Cristina was correct, her skills have surpassed Meredith's. Cristina moves to Switzerland take up a job offer from Dr. Preston Burke, her former attending, mentor and fiancé, who was looking for a replacement at a research hospital he was running, thus leaving Alex in charge of being Meredith's [...] "person" [...] in her place, an honor he gladly accepts.|$|E
500|$|Under {{free trade}} the trader {{is the master}} and the {{producer}} the slave. Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man. [...] that protection is immoral.... Why, if protection builds up and elevates 63,000,000 [...] of people, the influence of those 63,000,000 of people elevates {{the rest of the}} world. We cannot <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in the pathway of progress without benefiting mankind everywhere. Well, they say, 'Buy where you can buy the cheapest'.... Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: 'Buy where you can pay the easiest.' And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.|$|E
500|$|Q {{performs}} her own stunts in the series. The actress {{liked to}} have her character [...] "be able to do her own thing," [...] as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted [...] "but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always got to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back and let the men shine. And in this, it's about the women who know what they're doing." [...] At some point Q set up a three-week long training period {{for the rest of}} the cast to make their fight scenes in the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.|$|E
