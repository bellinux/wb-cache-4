This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (<b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes).</b>|$|E

First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{dysfunction}} in Guillain–Barré {{syndrome is}} caused by an immune attack on the nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system and their support structures. The nerve cells have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the neuromuscular junction where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a sheath of Schwann cells that contain myelin. Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain–Barré syndrome feature different types of immune attack. The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the myelin sheath by white blood cells (<b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation {{of a group of}} blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant is mediated by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement.|$|E

Method : The design was a cross sectional study, which is conduct at Dr. Kariadi Hospital Semarang. 32 subjects are HIV-AIDS patients in within inclusion criteria: age ≥ 14 years, could reading and writing. The venous total lymphocyte count and CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> are examined. Cognitive function was tested using MoCA-Ina. Correlation test were analyzed with Spearman’s rho, cut off value total lymphocyte count with 2 x 2 tabel, cut off value CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> count with median value.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that human mesenchymal stem cells are able to inhibit <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activation; however, the discrepancy among different sources of MSCs is not well documented. In this study, we have compared the MSCs from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT), placenta (PL), and umbilical cord (UC) to determine which one displayed the most efficient immunosuppressive effects on phytohemagglutinin-induced T cell proliferation. Among them we found that hUC-MSC has the strongest effects on inhibiting T cell proliferation and is chosen to do the further study. We observed that <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> spontaneously released abundant IFN-γ. And IFN-γ secreted by <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> could induce the expression of indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) in hUC-MSCs. IDO was previously reported to induce <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in S phase. When cocultured with hUC-MSCs, <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> expression of caspase 3 was significantly increased, while Bcl 2 and CDK 4 mRNA expression decreased dramatically. Addition of 1 -methyl tryptophan (1 -MT), an IDO inhibitor, restored <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and induced resumption of the cell cycle. In addition, the changes in caspase 3, CDK 4, and Bcl 2 expression were reversed by 1 -MT.

However, it is unknown whether this bacterial-induced host cell death affects immunity.
