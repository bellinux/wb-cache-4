50|$|The {{player can}} choose from more than 30 dinosaurs to place into the park, {{including}} Brachiosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, and Velociraptor. In order to obtain these dinosaurs, the player must expand the park by cutting down the surrounding jungle area and clearing away the debris left behind. One piece of debris will contain a piece of amber, which the player must invest money into decoding. Once fully decoded, a dinosaur will be revealed and be ready for purchase. Most dinosaurs can be bought with the coins earnable ingame, but certain dinosaurs can only be purchased with special Bucks. Only one individual of each dinosaur species can be placed into the park, although smaller ones live in pairs. When the dinosaur is placed into the park, it starts out as an egg. The player must wait on <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> to pass {{in order for the}} dinosaur to hatch or spends Bucks. When the dinosaur hatches, it will begin to generate money for the player to collect. Carnivores are kept in cages, while herbivores are not confined.|$|R

They apply to workers (as generators and custodians), supervisors, and Waste Management. 2 Requirements Requirements for waste are based on type (hazardous, industrial, or universal) and amount. Under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), SLAC is an authorized large quantity hazardous waste generator and is allowed <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> quantities and <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> for on-site storage of these wastes. Wastes at SLAC are collected and stored according to requirements and then transported off-site for treatment and disposal. Note SLAC is not a treatment, storage, and disposal facility(TSDF), since such facilities require extensive permitting. Although not a TSDF, SLAC is authorized {{by the state of}} California to perform limited hazardous waste treatment under the California Tiered Permit Program, which allows treatment of permit-specified hazardous waste streams.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{plasma concentration}} ratio limits (CORALS) for HIV-protease inhibitors outside of which random plasma concentrations reflect partial compliance or noncompliance. In {{the absence of}} a gold standard for measuring compliance and to avoid complex techniques, measuring plasma concentrations may be an objective and easy way to check noncompliance. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic curves after observed ingestion were recorded in patients on steady-state indinavir 800 mg TID (n = 22), ritonavir 400 mg/saquinavir 400 mg BID (n = 22, ritonavir; n = 17, saquinavir hard-gel capsules), or nelfinavir 750 mg TID (n = 4) or 1250 mg BID (n = 4). Concentration ratios were calculated by dividing the measured concentration by the median population value at <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> sampling <b>time.</b> <b>Limits</b> were based on the minimum P(05) (5 th percentile) and maximum P(95) of these ratios found during the sampling interval. With these limits the authors determined (1) the proportion of patients falsely judged as noncompliers after observed ingestion, (2) discrimination between compliers and noncompliers, and (3) the absolute percentage of noncompliers. To judge the last two elements, two sets of random plasma samples were included: (1) samples sent in by the physician on suspicion of noncompliance (indinavir, n = 42; nelfinavir, n = 22;) or from a study population stating imperfect compliance in a questionnaire (ritonavir/saquinavir, n = 11); (2) control samples sent in routinely for monitoring therapeutic levels (indinavir, n = 41; nelfinavir, n = 201) or drawn from patients who stated perfect compliance in the questionnaire (ritonavir/saquinavir, n = 35). RESULTS: The following CORALS were found: indinavir 3. 3; nelfinavir 2. 1; ritonavir 1. 9; saquinavir 2. 3. In 31 % to 55 % of the patients suspected of noncompliance a plasma concentration ratio outside these limits was found. If a ratio was outside the limits, there was a 68 % to 88 % chance that that plasma sample belonged to a patient suspected of noncompliance, compared with the controls (all Chi-squared tests < 0. 05). Compared with observed ingestion, these chances ranged from 87 % to 92 %. CONCLUSION: By using concentration ratio limits (CORALS), plasma samples of protease inhibitors with values outside these limits are highly indicative of partial or noncompliance...|$|R
40|$|Lithospheric {{strength}} {{can be used}} {{to estimate}} the heat flow at the time when a given region was deformed, allowing us to constrain the thermal evolution of a planetary body. In this sense, the high (> 300 km) effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere deduced from the very limited deflection caused by the north polar cap of Mars indicates a low surface heat flow for this region at the present time, a finding difficult to reconcile with thermal history models. This has started a debate on the current heat flow of Mars and the implications for the thermal evolution of the planet. Here we perform refined estimates of paleo-heat flow for 22 martian regions of different periods and geological context, erived from the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere or from faulting depth beneath large thrust faults, by considering regional radioactive element abundances and realistic thermal conductivities for the crust and mantle lithosphere. For the calculations based on the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere we also consider the respective contributions of crust and mantle lithosphere to the total lithospheric strength. The obtained surface heat flows are in general lower than the equivalent radioactive heat production of Mars at <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>times,</b> suggesting a <b>limited</b> contribution from secular cooling to the heat flow during the majority of the history of Mars. This is contrary to the predictions from the majority of thermal history models, but is consistent with evidence suggesting a currently fluid core, limited secular contraction for Mars, and recent extensive volcanism. Moreover, the interior of Mars could even have been heating up during part of the thermal history of the planet...|$|R
