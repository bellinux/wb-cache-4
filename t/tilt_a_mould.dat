The final published version is available at www. springerlink. com, Doi: 10. 1007 /s 10853 - 008 - 2828 - 2. New Rheocasting (the NRC process) is a recently developed semisolid processing route. There are two versions of this route. In one, molten alloy is poured directly into <b>a</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>mould</b> and through careful temperature control during cooling a spheroidal semisolid microstructure is achieved, before the material in the mould is upended into a shot sleeve and hence forced into a die. Alternatively, the molten alloy is poured onto a cooling slope and thence into <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> before processing. The aim of the work described in this paper, and its companion, was to develop understanding of the microstructural development during {{the initial stages of}} this process i. e. in the mould before processing and with the cooling slope/mould combination. In this first paper, an analogue system based on aqueous ammonium chloride has been used to visualise what happens when an alloy is poured into <b>a</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>mould</b> with <b>a</b> chill wall. In the companion paper, the results for pouring A 356 aluminium alloy directly into <b>a</b> <b>mould,</b> and also via a cooling slope into <b>a</b> <b>mould</b> are presented...|$|R
40|$|Thixoforming, {{and related}} {{semi-solid}} processing routes for metallic alloys, require feedstock with a non-dendritic microstructure in the semi-solid state. The material then behaves in a thixotropic way in that, {{when it is}} sheared it flows and can be forced to fill a die and, when it is allowed to stand it thickens again. The New Rheocasting (the NRC process) is a recently developed semi-solid processing route. There are two versions of this route. In one, molten alloy is poured directly into <b>a</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>mould</b> and, through careful temperature control during cooling, a spheroidal semi-solid microstructure is achieved. The material in the mould is then upended into a shot sleeve and hence forced into a die.

40|$|A near-net shape-casting {{technique}} to produce as-cast aluminum-silicon alloy metal bars {{has been designed}} and used in fabrication. In this technique, molten aluminum alloy was poured from a moving tundish into the D-shaped groove of <b>a</b> <b>tilted</b> copper <b>mould.</b> The base of the mould was cooled by water spray. The copper mould was tilted at 1, 2 and 3 o. The as-cast aluminum alloy bars were tested in accordance with ASTM standards to determine their mechanical properties, namely hardness and tensile strength. The results show that decreasing the mould tilt angle increases the mechanical properties of the as-cast aluminum-silicon alloy bars...|$|R
