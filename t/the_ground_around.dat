5|$|In 907 Chester was refortified {{against the}} threat from the Vikings, and shortly {{afterwards}} the minster was founded or refounded, and Werburgh's remains were transferred there from Hanbury, probably by Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians. The collegiate church, as it was then, was restored in 1057 by Leofric, Earl of Mercia and Lady Godiva. This church was razed to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> 1090, with the secular canons evicted, and no known trace of it remains.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit is}} {{consumed}} by many bird species including the rose-crowned fruit-dove (Ptilinopus regina), wompoo fruit-dove (P. magnificus), wonga pigeon (Leucosarcia melanoleuca), topknot pigeon (Lopholaimus antarcticus), Pacific koel (Eudynamys orientalis), Australasian swamphen (Porphyrio melanotus), Australian king parrot (Alisterus scapularis), Australasian figbird (Sphecotheres vieilloti), green catbird (Ailuroedus crassirostris), regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus) and pied currawong (Strepera graculina), {{as well as}} the mammalian grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), and spectacled flying fox (Pteropus conspicillatus). It is one of several plant species used as food by the endangered Coxen's fig parrot. Many fruits drop onto <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> the tree, though others are dispersed by animals that eat them.|$|E
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E

5|$|Excavation of the {{downtown}} bus tunnel began in early 1987, and construction reached the University Street area later that year. The twin tunnel boring machines used to excavate the tunnel reached University Street in October 1987, and continued north towards Westlake station. In December, Metro agreed to pay $2.4 million to real estate developer Marathon Company for use of a city block they owned adjacent to the station for equipment staging and storage, delaying the planned construction of office buildings on the site. During excavation and construction of the University Street tunnel station, cracks and minor settling {{were found in the}} historic Seattle Tower, located nearby. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> the tower was later stabilized to prevent additional settlement, and was renovated with private funding in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} {{the food}} that one consumed and the clothes that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing was made of hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants might choose to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes that hung to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E
5|$|The former fishing {{hamlet of}} Holywell (local {{pronunciation}} ‘holly well’) was situated by the cliff on a ledge some 400 {{yards to the}} southwest of the public garden known as the Holywell Retreat. It was approached from what is now Holywell Road via the lane between the present Helen Gardens and StBede’s School {{which leads to the}} chalk pinnacle formerly known locally as ‘Gibraltar’ or the 'Sugar Loaf'. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> the pinnacle was the site of lime kilns also worked by the fishermen. The fishing hamlet at Holywell was taken over by the local water board in 1896 to exploit the springs in the cliffs. The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now even most of the foundations of the cottages have gone over the cliff.|$|E

25|$|Since 13 August, {{command of}} the British Eighth Army had passed to Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery. British Ultra had {{anticipated}} an Axis attack, and the former commander of the Eighth Army—Auchinleck—set out the basic defensive plan but had included a number of contingency plans for defensive works around Alexandria and Cairo in case Axis armour broke through. After visiting the front lines, Montgomery ordered that these contingency plans be destroyed and emphasised his intention to hold <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> Alamein at all costs.|$|E
25|$|Physicist Domokos Tar {{suggested}} the following theory for ball lightning formation {{based on his}} ball lightning observation. Lightning strikes perpendicular to the ground, and thunder follows immediately at supersonic speed {{in the form of}} shock waves that form an invisible aerodynamic turbulence ring horizontal to <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>Around</b> the ring, over and under pressure systems rotate the vortex around a circular axis in the cross section of the torus. At the same time, the ring expands concentrically parallel to the ground at low speed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} incident, on 27 July 2006, {{while on a}} routine patrol, Budd's section {{identified}} and engaged two enemy gunmen {{on the roof of}} a building in the centre of Sangin. During the ensuing fierce fire-fight, two of Budd's section were hit. One was seriously injured and collapsed in the open ground, where he remained exposed to enemy fire, with rounds striking <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> him. Budd realised that he needed to regain the initiative and that the enemy needed to be driven back so that the casualty could be evacuated.|$|E
25|$|The Federals {{launched}} several unsuccessful counterattacks late in {{the afternoon}} to regain <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> the Viniard house. Col. Heg was mortally wounded during one of these advances. Late in the day, Rosecrans deployed almost his last reserve, Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's division of McCook's corps. Marching north from Lee and Gordon's Mill, Sheridan took the brigades of Cols. Luther Bradley and Bernard Laiboldt. Bradley's brigade was in the lead and it was able to push the heavily outnumbered brigades of Robertson and Benning out of Viniard field. Bradley was wounded during the attack.|$|E
25|$|Such was the {{intensity}} and determination of the Soviet pilots they disregarded their losses and fought with a resolve which surprised German airmen. In several cases Soviet pilots rammed German machines. Do 17s of KG 2 lost one bomber to this method, while in a notable incident Wolfgang Schellmann, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG 27 was rammed and bailed out, only to be murdered by NKVD troops upon reaching <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>Around</b> 19 reported incidents of ramming, known as tarans were recorded on the 22 June 1941, but {{this may have been}} an over-dramatisation of the engagement, which involved unorthodox methods.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{monolith}} lifted by cranes was the 108t {{heavy corner}} cornice block of the Jupiter temple at Baalbek, {{followed by an}} architrave block weighing 63t, {{both of which were}} raised to a height of about 19m. The capital block of Trajan's Column, with a weight of 53.3t, was even lifted to c. 34m above the ground. As such enormous loads far exceeded the lifting capability of any single treadwheel crane, it is assumed that Roman engineers set up a four-masted lifting tower in the midst of which the stone blocks were vertically raised by the means of capstans placed on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Those who {{witnessed}} the apparition stood in the pouring rain {{for up to two}} hours reciting the Rosary, a series of traditional Catholic prayers. When the apparition began there was good light, but although it then became very dark, witnesses could still see the figures very clearly – they appeared to be the colour of a bright whitish light. The apparition did not flicker or move in any way. The witnesses reported that <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> the figures remained completely dry during the apparition although the wind was blowing from the south. Afterwards, however the ground at the gable became wet and the gable dark.|$|E
25|$|It was at {{this point}} that serious {{problems}} with calibration appeared. After considerable study, using reflectors hung from balloons and testing against the occasional aircraft, {{it became clear that the}} main problem was the levelling of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>around</b> the station. The long wavelengths used in these early radars strongly interacted with the ground, causing the beams to be reflected forward as opposed to absorbed or scattered. These reflected signals sometimes reached the targets and were returned to the receiver, along with the ones direct from the transmitter. Interference between the two caused nulls to appear in the reception pattern, which made it difficult to find the target.|$|E
