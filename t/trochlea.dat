5|$|Subfossil {{remains of}} the King Island emu show that the tibia was about 330mm (13in) long, and the femur was 180mm (7in) long. The pelvis was 280mm (11in) long, 64mm (2.5in) wide at the front, and 86mm (3in) wide at the back. The tarsometatarsus {{averaged}} 232mm (9in) in length. In males, the tibiotarsus averaged 261mm (10in), whereas it averaged 301mm (12in) in females. In contrast, the same bones measured 269mm (10.5in) and 305mm (12in) in the Kangaroo Island emu. Apart from being smaller, the King Island emu differed osteologically from the Kangaroo Island emu in the intertrochlear foramen of the tarsometatarsus usually being fully or partially abridged. The outer <b>trochlea</b> was more incurved towards the middle <b>trochlea</b> in the Kangaroo Island bird, whereas they were parallel in the King Island emu.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to these fragmentary teeth, the Maevarano Formation has also yielded a nearly complete, articulated skeleton of an immature, cat-sized mammal {{that has not yet}} been fully described. It is the most complete mammal known from the Mesozoic of Gondwana. Its skull is damaged, but its unusual dentition is preserved. The incisors (two {{on each side of the}} upper and one on each side of the lower jaw) project forwards and are separated from the three or four cheektooth in each side of the lower and upper jaws by a large diastema (gap). It shows primitive features, such as the presence of epipubic bones (in the pelvis), a septomaxilla (a small bone placed between the premaxilla and the maxilla in the upper jaw), and a deep zygomatic arch (cheekbone). On the other hand, it has derived traits like the presence of a well-developed <b>trochlea</b> on the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone), the absence of a rim at the dorsal (upper) margin of the acetabulum (the opening in the pelvis which receives the head of the femur), a small lesser trochanter of the femur (upper leg bone), reduced contact between the fibula (the smaller of the two lower leg bones) [...] and the calcaneum (heel bone), and the dentition. In a 2000 abstract, Krause identified it as a therian (a member of the group that includes marsupials, placentals, and their closest extinct relatives) more derived than the early Cretaceous Vincelestes of Argentina, but in 2006 he and colleagues instead refused to place it in any existing higher-order mammalian group and claimed that [...] "it represents a major new nontherian clade".|$|E
2500|$|As regards {{other parts}} of the skeleton, the {{proposed}} synapomorphies of pelagornithids and waterfowl are found mainly in the arm- and handbones: the ulna had a strongly [...] upper backside at its elbow end – at the handward end of which the scapulotricipital muscles attached –, a point-tipped dorsal cotyle and only a shallow depression to house the meniscus between ulna and radius; towards the elbow, the intercondylar sulcus of the ulna becomes wide and is bordered by a long winding ridge on the belly side. The radius, meanwhile, has a convex ventral border to the humeral cotyle, which prominently continues the hind edge of the knob where the biceps brachii muscle attaches; towards the upper side of the radius bone the surface becomes flat and triangular handwards of the articular surface for the ulna. The carpometacarpus of both Anseriformes and pseudotooth birds has a prominent pisiform process, which extends from the carpal <b>trochlea</b> far fingerwards along the bone's forward side. On the carpometacarpus' underside, there is a long but narrow symphysis of the distal metacarpals, with the large metacarpal bone having a mid-ridge that at its outer end curves tailwards, and the thumb joint has a well-developed knob on the hind side of its articular surface. The leg and foot bones, as is to be expected from birds not as specialized for swimming as waterfowl are, show less similarities between Anseriformes and pseudotooth birds: on the tibiotarsus there is a wide incision between the condyles and the middle condyle is narrower than the side condyle and protrudes forwards; the tarsometatarsus has a low distal vascular [...] with recessed opening on its plantar surface and a middle toe <b>trochlea</b> that is elongated, slightly oblique, projects to the underside of the foot and is pointed at the tip.|$|E
50|$|It is also notable {{that the}} {{attachment}} {{point of the}} tibiotarsal <b>trochleae</b> was flattened in Eremopezus, leaving little room for a bulky pad where the toes joined. In cursorial birds, this area is typically wide, to provide space for a large cushioning pad where the toes join, which improves balance during walking or running. The structure in E. eocaenus, by contrast, must have allowed a much better toe-flexing ability. The shallow grooves on the <b>trochleae</b> allowed for considerable sideways mobility of the toes; if the single phalanx bone known is assigned correctly to this species (it is the best match in size by far), it is very wide at the proximal end and tapers noticeably distad. The third (middle) toe was the most robust and largest. The inner toe was about {{as large as the}} outer one, and attached noticeably more proximal on the tibiotarsus. There is a single foramen on the dorsal side of the tarsometatarsus, with a plantar exit hole between the third and fourth metacarpal's distal ends (presumably for the outer toe's adductor tendon) and another (presumably for nerves and blood vessels) on the plantar surface of the tarsometatarsus. The outer sides of the outer <b>trochleae</b> have a hook at their backward end, which together with deep pits for ligaments nearby must have served to hold strong tendons. Its hallux was vestigial, as is typical for birds that move about on foot a lot; it even cannot be ruled out that the hallux was entirely missing (as in ratites).|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel, two-layered, collagen matrix seeded with chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage. It consists of a dense collagen layer which is in contact with bone and a porous matrix to support the seeded chondrocytes. The matrices were implanted in rabbit femoral <b>trochleas</b> for up to 24 weeks. The control groups received either a matrix without cells or no implant. The best histological repair was seen with cell-seeded implants. The permeability and glycosaminoglycan content of both implant groups were nearly normal, but were significantly less in tissue from empty defects. The type-II collagen content of the seeded implants was normal. For unseeded implants it was 74. 3 % of the normal and for empty defects only 20 %. The current treatments for articular injury often result in a fibrous repair which deteriorates with time. This bilayer implant allowed sustained hyaline-like repair of articular defects during the entire six-month period of observation...|$|R

40|$|The {{artiodactyl}} astragalus {{has been}} modified to exhibit two <b>trochleae,</b> creating a double pullied structure allowing for significant dorso-plantar motion, and limited mediolateral motion.

50|$|As {{regards the}} length and stoutness of the lower leg and the foot, E. eocaenus would {{probably}} have been similar to a good-sized American rhea (Rhea americana) in measurements. Its toes, however, differed vastly in shape and posture from those of this ratite (and most other birds). Above the tibiotarsal <b>trochleae</b> of the African bird, the bone was considerably wider than the ankle, among ratites being matched by some moa and the dwarf cassowary (Casuarius bennetti). Thus, towards its toes the midfoot bone must have flared outwards, resulting in an overall wide-footed appearance. It is notable that while elephant birds have toes that are only a little more flaring than those of rheas, those of fast-running long-legged birds (ratites and others, like seriemas and some Charadriiformes) generally tend to bunch together in a narrower angle, with the most extreme situation found in the ostrich. This suggests that wherever Eremopezus did walk, it indeed walked or trotted and ran only in dire need - if it could run quickly at all, which is by no means certain.|$|R

A comparative anatomic, ultrasonographic and arthroscopic study using 20 cadaveric feet from 13 non-lame adult dairy cows was performed. Arthroscopy was accomplished using a rigid arthroscope to view the synovial cavities with their synovial villi and parts of the following structures: the distal ends of the metacarpal/metatarsal III/IV bones with their <b>trochleae</b> and sagittal ridges, synovial grooves, the articular surfaces of the proximal sesamoid bones, the proximal aspects of the first phalanges, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments, the suspensory ligament and the interdigital ligaments as parts of the interosseus muscle, the cruciate sesamoidean ligaments, the communication site between the lateral and medial pouch in the palmar/plantar area, and dorsally the septum between the lateral and the medial pouch.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Anthropology. The form and function of the talocrural joint of anthropoids is frequently used to infer positional behaviors of fossil catarrhines without clear and quantitative data to support these inferences. Specifically, greater medial and posterior trochlear wedging, shallower <b>trochleae</b> and more obliquely oriented groove for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle on the talus, and a more anteriorly oriented posterior talar facet on the calcaneus, have been hypothesized to reflect a greater emphasis on vertical climbing in anthropoids. This research evaluated these features in extant anthropoids, and compared them between pairs of taxa representing different emphases on climbing in their locomotor repertoires. Although taxa vary in these features, they do not do so in predicted ways. Results suggest that these aspects of talocrural joint functional morphology are not associated with climbing in extant anthropoids, and cannot be used in isolation to predict behavior of fossil taxa. Although this research has evaluated only broad, pairwise contrasts between diverse groups of extant taxa, variation identified here provides justification for a more in depth, detailed analysis of talocrural functional morphology in anthropoids...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{assessment}} of articular cartilage integrity is of {{value for the}} detection of early degenerative joint disease in both the clinical and the research settings. It was {{the purpose of this study}} to determine the accuracy and reliability of identifying articular cartilage defects through Diffraction Enhanced Imaging (DEI), a high contrast radiographic imaging technique. DEI provides two new sources of image contrast to radiography: refraction and scatter rejection, besides the absorption of conventional radiography. DesignCadaveric tali were DEI imaged in the anterior–posterior position at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Two independent observers provided gross score evaluations (on a five point scale) of the trochlear surfaces. The DEI image of each trochlear surface was then graded (on a five point scale) by two additional independent observers who were blinded with regard to the gross evaluation of the articular surfaces. Inter-observer agreement for DEI grades was assessed with the weighted κ statistic. Correlation of diffraction enhanced image score to the gross score was assessed with Spearman correlation coefficient. ResultsThe defects of articular cartilage of talar <b>trochleae</b> could be visualized through DEI. The Spearman correlation of gross grades with DEI grades on the 165 talar regions for observers 1 and 2 were 0. 91 and 0. 91, respectively. The overall weighted κ value for inter-observer agreement was 0. 93, thus considered high agreement. ConclusionsDEI is accurate and reliable for detection of articular cartilage defects ex vivo. Even early stages of degeneration of cartilage can be visualized with this high contrast technique. Future studies will focus on the application of DEI to the identification of such lesions in vivo...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} new fossil {{specimen}} of a pelican from the Tatrot Formation of the Siwalik Hills, India. It likely represents Pelecanus sivalensis Davies, 1880, the smaller {{of the two}} previously published species from the Siwalik Group stratigraphic sequence. This complete tarsometatarsus is the first fossil bone of a pelican collected in India for over 100 years. It is from the latest Pliocene (∼ 2. 6 Ma), and is the youngest pelican fossil from the region. The new specimen exhibits a derived distoplantar 'slant' to the plantar margin of the medial crest of the hypotarsus, and a combination of features related to the morphology of the hypotarsus, the distal foramen, <b>trochleae,</b> and overall size that allow further differentiation from known tarsometatarsi of fossil and extant pelicans, including the three species of extant pelicans that occur in India (Pelecanus crispus, P. onocrotalus, and P. philippensis). It is of appropriate size for Pelecanus sivalensis, which to date has been known only by fragments of other skeletal elements of the wing, leg, and shoulder girdle. Thus, the observation that this tarsometatarsus is morphologically distinct from those of known pelicans provides further support for the distinctiveness {{of at least one}} extinct species of pelican from the Siwalik Group sediments. While the morphology of the tarsometatarsus allows for separation from other taxa known from tarsometatarsi, we found no clear shared derived states to place this taxon with any confidence in a phylogenetic context relative to any other pelican species, or even determine if {{it is part of the}} crown group of Pelecanidae. However, published molecular data are consistent with an origin of the crown clade prior to the Pleistocene, suggesting (along with one morphological character) the possibility that this species belongs to the Old World clade of pelican species...|$|R

It is classified as a simple hinge-joint, which allows for movements of flexion, extension and circumduction.

Inflammation of the trochlear region leads to a painful syndrome with swelling and exquisite point tenderness in the upper medial rim of the orbit. A vicious cycle may ensue such that inflammation causes swelling and fraying of the tendon which then increases the friction of passing through the <b>trochlea</b> which in turn adds to the inflammation.

[...] The ankle mortise, the fork-like structure of the malleoli, holds these three articulate surfaces in a steady grip, which guarantees {{the stability of the}} ankle joint. However, because the <b>trochlea</b> is wider in front than at the back (approximately 5-6 mm) the stability in the joint vary with the position of the foot: with the foot dorsiflexed (toes pulled upward) the ligaments of the joint are kept stretched, which guarantees the stability of the joint; but with the foot plantarflexed (as when standing on the toes) the narrower width of the <b>trochlea</b> causes the stability to decrease. [...] Behind the <b>trochlea</b> is a posterior process with a medial and a lateral tubercle separated by a groove for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus. , the lateral of these tubercles forms an independent bone called os trigonum or [...] "accessory talus"; it may represent the tarsale proximale intermedium. On the bone's inferior side, three articular surfaces serve for the articulation with the calcaneus, and several variously developed articular surfaces exist for the articulation with ligaments.|$|E
