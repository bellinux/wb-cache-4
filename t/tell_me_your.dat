500|$|Following {{the release}} of the trailer on 7 May 2005, the film was {{believed}} to be inspired by the 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson novel, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Upon the film release, The Hindu drew parallels between it and the 1998 novel <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Dreams by Sidney Sheldon. Shankar denied that the film was inspired by <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Dreams, claiming that he knew of the novel only after completing the script. Sify compared the character of Ambi to the protagonist of The Mask (1994), a film about a [...] "mild mannered guy changing into a one-man army, craving to see natural justice realised".|$|E
500|$|Girls' Generation {{debuted in}} 2007 {{with the single}} [...] "Into the New World" [...] and their self-titled studio album, which was later re-{{released}} as Baby Baby in 2008. The album spawned three more singles: [...] "Girls' Generation", [...] "Kissing You", and [...] "Baby Baby". In 2009, Girls' Generation released two EPs: Gee and <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Wish (Genie) (2009). Their second studio album, Oh! (2010) was later re-released as Run Devil Run (2010). Six months later, they released a third EP, Hoot (2010). The singles [...] "Oh!", [...] "Run Devil Run" [...] and [...] "Hoot" [...] all claimed the top spot on the Gaon Digital Chart.|$|E
500|$|Though Girls' Generation {{had gained}} some {{attention}} with their 2007 debut album, {{it was not}} until 2009 that the group rose to stardom. On January 7, the group released their debut extended play (EP) Gee, which has sold over 100,000 copies in South Korea. Its title track occupied the number-one position on KBS's Music Bank after a week of release and remained on the top spot for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks, becoming the longest running number-one song on Music Bank until 2012, when Psy's [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] claimed the top spot for ten consecutive weeks. It also became the best-selling single of 2009 in South Korea. The group's second EP <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Your</b> Wish (Genie) (...) and its titular lead single were released in June 2009. The EP sold a record-breaking 50,000 copies in South Korea within its first week of release and charted at number eight on the Taiwanese G-Music chart. In November 2009, S.M.

The tour visited Seoul (South Korea) in December 2009, Shanghai (China) in April 2010, and Taipei (Taiwan) in October 2010.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Your Body", Aguilera sings {{of having}} a one-night stand with a random man. In the first verse, she [...] "angrily" [...] purrs, [...] "So open the box, don't need no key, I'm unlocked". Synthesizers and [...] "stuttering" [...] drums are {{featured}} at the pre-chorus, [...] "Don't even <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> name/ All I {{need to know is}} whose place/ And let's get walking". Chris Martins of Spin commented that the lyrics actually means, [...] "The economy is in the tank, congress can't agree on anything, war and natural disasters consume us ... so, what else can we do but make love?" [...] At the second verse, she tells her lover, [...] "I am a freak, I'm disturbed/ So come on and give me your worst/ We're moving faster than slow/ If you don't know where to go/ I'll finish off on my own". The four-on-the-floor refrain has Aguilera [...] "flaunting her famous pipes" [...] on the chorus, [...] "All I wanna do is love your body/ Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it". In a track-by-track review for Lotus, Billboard critic Andrew Hampp thought that the song [...] "doesn't peak" [...] until Aguilera [...] "growls", [...] "I think you already know my name" [...] at the bridge. According to Jason Lipshutz from Billboard and Robert Cospey of Digital Spy, the lyrics of [...] "Your Body" [...] are similar to Aguilera's previous single [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002).|$|E
500|$|... "Heaven" [...] lyrically {{talks about}} the protagonist saying a final goodbye to a {{deceased}} beloved person. It contains emotional lyrics which offer comfort to the protagonist. The ballad opens with the line [...] "I fought for you the hardest, it made me the strongest, So <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>your</b> secrets — I just can't stand to see you leaving" [...] sang with emotional and touching vocals by the singer. The hook [...] "Heaven couldn't wait for you / No heaven couldn't wait for you / So go on, go home" [...] is continuously repeated. BET'a Latifah Muhammad described Beyoncé's vocal rendition as [...] "heartbreaking yet optimistic". [...] "Heaven" [...] closes with a spoken 20-second snippet outro of the Lord's Prayer (...) recited in Spanish by Melissa Vargas, the singer's brand manager. Many critics noted how the song may {{have been inspired by}} the singer's miscarriage. Clare Lobenfeld from Complex magazine concluded that the song featured Beyoncé's coping mechanisms for the loss of her child, which included using humor to hide pain. According to Spin writer Anupa Mistry, it is in line with one of the themes touched on in the parent album, motherhood. On the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] is placed before [...] "Blue", as the penultimate track. It was noted by critics that both songs were antidotes to each other– while the former discusses notions of death, the latter celebrates birth. Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle found the inclusion of those songs as the last on Beyoncé {{as a metaphor for the}} entire album [...] "Darkness always gives way to light, and heartbreak, if you hold on, is always followed by hope".|$|E
