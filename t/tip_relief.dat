40|$|The area of gear {{dynamics}} and noise, {{which is the}} most underdeveloped area of gear design, has recently been the focus of many studies. The proper kinematic and geometric design of gears, the mathematical modeling of gear systems, and the analysis of vibration excitation of gears and gear systems are essential for a good design. This work presents a state-of-the-art review of gear noise, the general area of gear design for reducing noise, and practical approaches used for machinery noise reduction along with a summary of methods available for predicting gear noise in terms of the transmission error. ^ A new method is proposed for reducing the vibration and noise of involute gears. The method is based on the use of cubic spline curves for gear tooth profile modification. The tooth profile is constrained to assume an involute shape during the loaded operation so that it ensures conjugate motion at all points along the line of action. The new profile is found to result in a more uniform static transmission error compared to the standard involute profile, thereby contributing to the improvement of the vibration and noise characteristics of the gear. The methodology is extended for the minimization of the transmission error in helical gears. Using the concept of optimal modification of the plane of action to generate the new tooth profile, the idea of a perfect plane of action of helical gears is introduced. The proposed method constitutes a general tooth correction method and makes the design, unlike other modification schemes presented in the literature, less complex, less sensitive to dynamic factors, and easier to manufacture while retaining the involute characteristics. A dynamic analysis of the gear drive with the involute tooth and the modified tooth profile (using cubic splines) is performed to establish the fact that a reduction in the transmission error reduces the gear vibration and noise due to smaller dynamic tooth loads during a meshing cycle. For this, first the tooth deformation is found and then the tooth dynamic load is determined for all reasonable speeds. A parameter study is also conducted to establish the superiority of the cubic spline (C. S.) based gear profile over the involute profile as well as those based on the use of linear and parabolic <b>tip</b> <b>reliefs.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|We use {{three large}} normal fault arrays {{in the northeastern}} Basin and Range Province, western United States, to {{document}} catchment development and relief production during fault growth. Fault slip and slip rates increase systematically along strike from zero at the fault <b>tips.</b> Catchment <b>relief</b> and across-strike range width both increase as slip accumulates but reach maximum values {{at a distance of}} 15 km from the fault tips and remain uniform along strike over much of the footwalls. Catchment outlet spacing also increases away from the fault tips but does not reach a uniform value and may vary by a factor of 5 – 6 along strike. We infer that catchments first elongate in the across-strike direction as slip accumulates and the range half-width increases. Once the half-width reaches its maximum value, continued catchment growth is possible only by along-strike capture, which increases outlet spacing but not relief. The close correspondence between catchment relief and range half-width suggests that geomorphically limited hillslope and channel gradients are achieved within the 15 km tip zone. Thus, the limiting factor in footwall development is the width of the range, which is controlled by two external agents: the geometry and spacing of the major faults, and the elevations of base level on both flanks...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the influence of both macro (<b>tip</b> <b>relief)</b> and micro (surface roughness) geometry on the generation of adverse conditions, such as high contact pressures, thin lubricant films or direct metallic asperity contact, which are known to be factors linked to the occurrence of micropitting in heavily loaded gear tooth contacts. Results are shown of a transient elastohydrodynamic (EHL) analysis of the conditions at the contact of two pairs of helical gears operating with different gear ratios. The effects of the variation of contact geometry, kinematics and tooth loading during the meshing cycle are taken into account together with both <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> and axial crowning profile modifications. The form of <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> profile adopted is shown to be highly influential in determining the peak contact pressures and thinnest oil films within the contacts. These conditions are experienced at all axial positions on the tooth flanks at the locations of the start of <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> profile modifications. If the <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> profile introduces a slope discontinuity to the gear profile then this can cause a significant stress concentration and very poor film forming behaviour. A range of <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> profiles are investigated, from linear <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> to fully parabolic forms. Further work is reported which investigates the level of direct metallic contact occurring between surface asperities in disk machine tests, which are designed to replicate heavily loaded rolling/sliding EHL contacts typical of aerospace gearing practice. The Electrical Contact Resistance (ECR) technique was implemented in these experiments to study realistic mixed lubrication conditions, and is found to be capable of identifying individual asperity contact events on a repeatable basis between two surfaces.

40|$|The glass sponge Monorhaphis chuni (Porifera: Hexactinellida) {{forms the}} largest bio-silica {{structures}} on Earth; their giant basal spicules reach sizes {{of up to}} 3 m and diameters of 8. 5 mm. Previously, it had been shown that the thickness growth proceeds by appositional layering of individual lamellae; however, the mechanism for the longitudinal growth remained unstudied. Now we show, that {{the surface of the}} spicules have towards the <b>tip</b> serrated <b>relief</b> structures that are consistent in size and form with the protrusions {{on the surface of the}} spicules. These protrusions fit into the collagen net that surrounds the spicules. The widths of the individual lamellae do not show a pronounced size tendency. The apical elongation of the spicule proceeds by piling up cone-like structural units formed from silica. As a support of the assumption that in the extracellular space silicatein(-like) molecules exist that associate with the external surface of the respective spicule immunogold electron microscopic analyses were performed. With the primmorph system from Suberites domuncula we show that silicatein(-like) molecules assemble as string- and net-like arrangements around the spicules. At their tips the silicatein(-like) molecules are initially stacked and at a later stay also organized into net-like structures. Silicatein(-like) molecules have been extracted from the giant basal spicule of Monorhaphis. Applying the SDS-PAGE technique it could be shown that silicatein molecules associate to dimers and trimers. Higher complexes (filaments) are formed from silicatein(-like) molecules, as can be visualized by electron microscopy (SEM). In the presence of ortho-silicate these filaments become covered with 30 - 60 nm long small rod-like/cuboid particles of silica. From these data we conclude that the apical elongation of the spicules of Monorhaphis proceeds by piling up cone-like silica structural units, whose synthesis is mediated by silicatein(-like) molecules...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of profile modification for reducing dynamic loads in gears with different tooth spacing errors. The simulation examined varying amplitudes of spacing error and differences {{in the span of}} teeth over which the error occurs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of transient elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) analyses of the meshing cycle of helical gears. Previous workers have analysed helical gears using a range of techniques, including thin slice models and models which take into account the effects of three-dimensional surface roughness. Previous work by the Cardiff group has investigated the effects of tooth micro-geometry (<b>tip</b> <b>relief)</b> on contact pressures and lubrication performance. The current work investigates the effect of tooth profile errors (deviations from the involute form) on elastohydrodynamic performance. The profile errors were measured on helical test gears using a Klingelnberg P 65 gear measuring machine. The gears are of 6 mm normal module, 20 º reference pressure angle, 26. 3 º base helix angle, and 44 mm face width, with the wheel having 24 teeth and the pinion 23 teeth. The gears were analysed over the meshing cycle, and the transmitted load was chosen such that the maximum Hertzian contact pressure would be 1. 6 GPa in the example shown here. The tooth load corresponding to the contact pressure of 1. 6 GPa is 60 kN with Hertzian semi dimensions a = 0. 5 mm and b = 36 mm. Profile error and <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> geometry was included in the surface geometry based on the digital profile information obtained from the Klingelnberg measurements. It should be emphasised that the profile deviations are at much lower spatial frequencies than surface roughness effects – indeed profile errors would usually be removed by the standard filtering process applied to measurements of gear surface finish. Figure 1 shows a comparison of film thickness contours for the smooth (upper) case (with <b>tip</b> <b>relief)</b> and the case including profile errors in addition to <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> (lower). The presence of the profile error features can be seen to {{have a significant effect on}} the lubricant film thickness, with the loadbearing area developing a series of grooves. Between the grooves, the loadbearing surface develops ridges which give rise to elevated contact pressures significantly above those found in the smooth result. These are plotted in Figure 2 which is a section. through the contact at x = 0, which is the meshing contact line. The effects of profile errors on lubrication performance of helical gears can be clearly seen in these results, and the paper goes on to discuss the implications of these rarely considered effects for surface longevity...|$|E
40|$|The gears in a {{transmission}} are lubricated {{to prevent their}} premature failure {{as a result of}} pitting and wear on the tooth surfaces. Furthermore, the lubricant also limits the rise in surface temperature of the gears, which could otherwise lead to failure as a result of scuffing. The purpose of this thesis was to construct a fairly realistic theoretical lubrication model for spur and helical gears, the primary output parameters of this model being film thickness and flash temperatures, which would help in the identification of areas on the gear tooth surface prone to the aforementioned modes of failure. This thesis was carried out at the Gear Technology group in Scania CV AB in collaboration with the department of machine design at KTH. Gear lubrication is tricky as it entails the determination of parameters such as loads, curvatures, and velocities; which are different along the entire surface of the gear tooth. Primarily the loads are hard to obtain as they are dynamic in nature; the load is shared between different pairs of teeth during motion. The calculation of velocities and curvatures in an area of the gear surface called the <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> can also not be done in a straightforward manner. These issues were simplified to a large extent with the assistance of a program called Helical 3 D; owing to its powerful contact analysis algorithm, values of the film thickness and flash temperatures could be determined in almost every region where contact occurred between the gear teeth. The results of the lubrication model showed a reduction in film thickness in the <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> area of the gear tooth surface; which meant that there were higher chances for the incidence of pitting and wear in this region. This was later confirmed when photographs from experimental tests illustrated a pitting line in the <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> region of the helical gear. It was also inferred from the model that the occurrence of pitting could be greatly reduced if a quadratic <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> modification were applied when compared to the existing linear modification used at Scania. Another important conclusion drawn was that thermal effects contributed to a significant decrease in the film thickness. Furthermore, the model showed higher flash temperatures close to the tip of the gear tooth surface, and photographs from experiments conducted showed the prescence of scuffing marks there...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL) solution method {{has been developed}} for helical Gears. Helical gears mesh {{with each other and}} develop contact areas under load that are approximately elliptical in shape. The contact ellipses have aspect ratios which are large and lubricant entrainment takes place in the rolling / sliding direction which is along the minor axis of the contact ellipse. The contact between helical gear teeth is therefore considered as a point contact EHL problem and the EHL analysis has been developed to include all aspects of the correct gear geometry. This includes the variation in radius of relative curvature at the contact over the meshing cycle, the introduction of tooth <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> to prevent premature tooth engagement under load, and axial profile relief to prevent edge contact at the face boundaries of the teeth. The EHL solution is first obtained as a quasi-steady state analysis at different positions in the meshing cycle and then developed into a transient analysis for the whole meshing cycle. The software developed has been used to assess the effects of geometrical modifications such as <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> and axial crowning on the EHL performance of a gear, and different forms of these profile modifications are studied. The analysis shows that the transient squeeze film effect becomes significant when the contact reaches the <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> zone. Thinning of the film thickness occurs in this region and is associated with high values of pressure which depend on the form of <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> considered. A transient EHL analysis for helical gears having faceted tooth surfaces has also been developed. Such surface features arise from the manufacturing process and can {{have a significant effect on}} the predicted transient EHL behaviour. The EHL results have been found to depend significantly on the facet spacing and thus on the manufacturing process. The important effect of surface roughness is also considered by developing a three dimensional line contact model to include real surface roughness information by considering a finite length of the nominal contact in the transverse direction of the tooth. This model is based on the use of the fast Fourier transform method to provide the repetition of the solution space along the nominal contact line between the helical teeth with the inclusion of cyclic boundary conditions at the transverse boundaries of the solution space. In helical gears the lay of tooth roughness (direction of finishing) is generally inclined to the direction in which rolling (entrainment) and sliding take place, and this is found to have a significant effect on both film thickness and pressure distribution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a global optimization method focused on planetary gear vibration reduction {{by means of}} <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> profile modifications. A nonlinear dynamic model is used to study the vibration behavior. In order to investigate the optimal radius and amplitude, Brute Force method optimization is used. One approach in optimization is straightforward and requires considerable computation power: brute force methods try to calculate all possible solutions and decide afterwards which one is the best. Results show the influence of optimal profile on planetary gear vibrations...|$|E
40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} the {{collector}} pinion has failed by spalling. Spalling was the manifestation of surface contact fatigue resulting from high contact stresses on the working flank. Analysis showed that inadequate <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> of the collector gear teeth {{could be the most}} probable reason for the failure. The material of construction, microstructure, and case and core hardness of the pinion were found to conform to specification. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the failure. In general, the load on the pinion appears to be on the higher side...|$|E
40|$|The gear/pinion of the {{collector}} mesh has failed by spalling/destructive pitting/wear. Evidences {{suggest that the}} failure was due to excessive load on the working flank of the gear/pinion teeth. Analysis shows that inadequate <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> of gear/pinion teeth would have aggravated the situation further. The material of construction, microstructure, and case and core hardness of the gear/pinion were found to conform to specification. No metallurgical abnormalities {{were responsible for the}} failure. It may be noted that a similar failure was investigated earlier in this laboratory (refer NAL Report No. MT-FA- 917 - 05 - 2005) ...|$|E
30|$|The {{function}} of gear drive is to transmit high power with compact design as {{to run with}} free of noise and vibration with least manufacturing and maintenance cost. Sankar and Nataraj have introduced circular root fillet instead of trochoidal root fillet in spur gear to increase the tooth strength (Sankar and Nataraj 2011). Many works have been done to improve the gear tooth strength out of which most of them attempted with positive profile shifting (Fredette and Brown 1997; Ciavarella and Demelio 1999). Sankar and Nataraj have launched a novel method called composite profile along with <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> in helical gear to prevent gear failure in the wind turbine generator gearbox (Sankar and Nataraj 2010). Andrzej and Jerzy have done a comparative study to evaluate root strength using ISO and AGMA standards {{and the results are}} verified using the finite element technique with model development and simulations (Andrzej and Jerzy 2006). Simon formulated a design method to find out the optimal tooth <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> and crowning for spur and helical gears (Simon 1989). Sankar et al. (2011) have formulated mathematical model to analyze the failure of shear pin in the wind turbne generator using finite element technique. Hebbal et al. (2009) have formulated a finite element model with a segment of three teeth for analysis and stress relieving features of various sizes on helical gear teeth at various locations.|$|E
30|$|A high {{pressure}} angle means that higher ratio of teeth {{are not in}} contact. However, this allows (i) the teeth to have higher load carrying capacity (ii) allows less number of teeth without undercutting (iii) tooth flank becomes more curved and hence relative sliding velocity is reduced (iv) the tooth pressure and axial pressure is increased. (v) Increase of pressure angle results in a stronger teeth, because the tooth acting as a beam is wider at the root (Sankar and Nataraj 2010). This analysis is carried out for three different pressure angles say 15 °, 20 ° and 22.5 ° for various <b>tip</b> <b>relief</b> length and amount.|$|E
