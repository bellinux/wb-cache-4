25|$|Coming {{into the}} {{afternoon}} session Bell and Cook played positively, attacking the Australian bowlers. Cook managed to post his half century and soon England {{were starting to}} think about a victory. However, Warne got Bell caught by Langer for a well composed 87. That left England on 170/2 with Paul Collingwood coming in, looking to continue <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>work.</b> There was a period where Collingwood seemed so intent on staying in, he forgot to score. England went into tea at 170/2, having scored 81 runs for 1 wicket in the session.|$|E
25|$|The new {{government}} decided {{to concentrate on}} developing agriculture, while doing little to help the industrial sector. Agriculture responded well with stricter quality-control being introduced and the passing of a Land Act to help farmers buy their farms. Also, the Irish Sugar Company and the Agricultural Credit Corporation were established to encourage growth. However, the economic depression that hit in the 1930s soon undid <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> of Cosgrave and his ministers. Industry was seen as secondary to agriculture and little was done to improve it. The loss of the industrialised north-east of Ireland had a bad effect on {{the country as a}} whole. However, the Electricity Supply Board, with the first national grid in Europe, was established to provide employment and electricity to the new state.|$|E

25|$|Whatever his disadvantages, Rivers was an unquestionably able child. Educated {{first at}} a Brighton preparatory school and then, {{from the age}} of thirteen, as a dayboy at the prestigious Tonbridge School, his {{academic}} abilities were noted from an early age. Young Rivers's talents led to him being placed a year above others of his age at school and even within this older group he was seen to excel, winning prizes for Classics and all around attainment. It is also worth noting that Rivers's younger brother Charles was also a high achiever at the school; he too was awarded with <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Work</b> prize and would go on to become a civil engineer until, after a bad bout of malaria contracted whilst in the Torres Straits with his brother, he was prompted by the elder Rivers to take up outdoor work.|$|E

The purpose was to ask the governor if Eumenius may dedicate his salary (or a large part of it) to rebuild the schools at Autun. He praises the emperors (Constantius Chlorus and his colleagues of the tetrarchy) and sets forth the steps necessary to restore the schools to their former state of efficiency, stressing that he intends to assist <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> out of his own pocket. He cites the imperial letter of Constantius granting him his position and salary at length, and it is from the address of that letter that the name of the oration's author is preserved.|$|E

However, Patel continued to chip away and ended with six for 124 off 38 overs, and Surrey were bowled out for 324, leading by 62 in what shaped {{up to be a}} close match. Before stumps, Kent lost the wicket of David Fulton for 18, but still made 37 for 1. With Key and Martin van Jaarsveld finally playing up to their potential, Key scoring 189 and van Jaarsveld 168, the Surrey bowlers were shown to be rather inadequate as Kent racked up 467 for 4 declared to set Surrey a massive 406 to win in a day.|$|E

25|$|The {{first day}} of the third test at Chandigarh was washed away by rain. This time Australia did well to score above 400 with half centuries by Ed Cowan and David Warner while Steven Smith and Mitchell Starc missing out on centuries. Starc missed it for 99 and out while Smith was out on 92. But debutant Shikhar Dhawan who had come in for Sehwag made a record 187 runs on debut and became the highest run scorer for India while playing on debut. Vijay also hit {{consecutive}} centuries and took the total to 499. The Australian team were dismissed for 223 after <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>work</b> by the bowlers and India got a target of 133 on the last day.
