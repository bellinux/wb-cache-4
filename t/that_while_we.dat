500|$|Having fallen foul of the censors {{with some}} of their earlier films, Hammer had an {{informal}} agreement to submit scripts in advance of shooting to the BBFC for comment. When the draft script for The Quatermass Xperiment was submitted, Board Secretary Arthur Watkins replied, [...] "I must warn you at this stage <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> accept this story in principle for the ‘X’ category, we could not certificate, even in that category, a film treatment in which the horrific element was so exaggerated as to be nauseating and revolting to adult audiences”. The BBFC were particularly concerned with {{the violence in the}} scenes where Carroon escapes from hospital and with how graphic the depiction of Caroon's transformation into the alien creature would be.|$|E
500|$|From the beginning, the battleships of Division Nine faced a hard task in {{adapting}} to the new methods and practices they encountered in the Grand Fleet. Any difficulties, however, that might have arisen from this transition based on national pride or rivalry were dissipated {{in large part by}} the professional example set by Admiral Rodman himself. As he would later note of his squadron's assimilation: [...] "I realized that the British fleet had had three years of actual warfare and knew the game from the ground floor up; <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> might know it theoretically, there would be a great deal to learn practically. There could not be two independent commands in one force if our work was to be harmonious, and the only logical course was to amalgamate our ships and serve under the command of the British commander-in-chief." [...] This cooperative attitude trickled down through the division, and elicited the admiration and appreciation of the British.|$|E

2500|$|Leaked {{extracts}} from an internal 10 February 2010 memo by Amnesty's Asia-Pacific director Sam Zarifi, were published by The Sunday Times. [...] In the memo Zarifi said Amnesty {{had made a}} mistake in not making it clearer they did not support Begg's views. Zarifi said Amnesty [...] "did not always sufficiently distinguish between the rights of detainees to be free from torture, and the validity of their views", adding that the organisation [...] "did not always clarify <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> champion the rights of all—including terrorism suspects, and more important, victims of terrorism—we do not champion their views”. In a subsequent letter to The Sunday Times, Zarifi said he agreed with Amnesty's actions with regard to Sahgal.|$|E
2500|$|Central to al-Kindi's {{understanding}} of metaphysics is God's absolute oneness, which he considers an attribute uniquely associated with God (and therefore not shared with anything else). By this he means <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> {{may think of}} any existent thing as being [...] "one", {{it is in fact}} both [...] "one" [...] and many". For example, he says that while a body is one, it is also composed of many different parts. A person might say [...] "I see an elephant", by which he means [...] "I see one elephant", but the term 'elephant' refers to a species of animal that contains many. Therefore, only God is absolutely one, both in being and in concept, lacking any multiplicity whatsoever. Some feel this understanding entails a very rigorous negative theology because it implies that any description which can be predicated to anything else, cannot be said about God.|$|E

2500|$|Frame asks {{where we}} can find moral {{responsibility}} and freedom in Kant's scheme. He argues that Kant believed <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> couldn't prove that man was a responsible moral agent we must nevertheless act as though this were the case. Philosophers have described these as Kant’s [...] "two worlds" [...] the world of nature (which leads to determinism), {{and the world of}} freedom (where responsibility is found). Kant himself spoke of the [...] "starry skies above" [...] and the [...] "moral law within", and although Kant did not deny the regularity of the natural world and the reality of humanity’s [...] "moral motions," [...] his philosophy could not bring these two worlds together. Frame concludes that Kant made the [...] "upper story leap" [...] to irrationalism by asserting the truth of something with no rational justification. Thus, in Immanuel Kant, Frame finds both rationalism and irrationalism.|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S. State Department's daily {{briefing}} for Friday, February 3, official spokesman Sean McCormick, {{speaking for}} the current administration, said (in part), [...] "Our response is to say <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> certainly don't agree with, support, or in some cases, we condemn the views that are aired in public that are published in media organizations around the world, we, at the same time, defend the right of those individuals to express their views. For us, freedom of expression {{is at the core}} of our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so. ... So we would urge all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding, the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue. And we would urge dialogue, not violence. And that also those that might take offense at these images that have been published, when they see similar views or images that could be perceived as anti-Semitic or anti-Catholic, that they speak out with equal vigor against those images." ...|$|E
2500|$|G. K. Chesterton, one of Dickens's {{critics in}} the early 20th century, {{expressed}} the opinion that Mr. Boffin's pretended fall into miserliness was originally intended by Dickens to be authentic, but that Dickens ran out of time and so took refuge in the awkward pretence that Boffin had been acting. Chesterton argues <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> might believe Boffin could be corrupted, we can hardly believe he could keep up such a strenuous pretence of corruption: [...] "Such a character as his—rough, simple and lumberingly unconscious—might be more easily conceived as really sinking in self-respect and honour than as keeping up, month after month, so strained and inhuman a theatrical performance. ... It might have taken years to turn Noddy Boffin into a miser; {{but it would have}} taken centuries to turn him into an actor." [...] However, Chesterton also praised the book as being a return to Dickens's youthful optimism and creative exuberance, full of characters who [...] "have that great Dickens quality of being something which is pure farce and yet which is not superficial; an unfathomable farce—a farce that goes down to the roots of the universe." ...|$|E

2500|$|No {{consensus}} exists {{whether or}} not the keywords attribute has any effect on ranking at any of the major search engines today. It is speculated that it does if the keywords used in the meta can also be found in the page copy itself. With respect to Google, thirty-seven leaders in search engine optimization concluded in April 2007 that the relevance of having keywords in the meta-attribute keywords is little to none and in September 2009 Matt Cutts of Google announced that they were no longer taking keywords into account whatsoever. [...] However, both these articles suggest that Yahoo! still makes use of the keywords meta tag in some of its rankings. [...] Yahoo! itself claims support for the keywords meta tag in conjunction with other factors for improving search rankings. In October 2009 Search Engine Round Table announced that [...] "Yahoo Drops The Meta Keywords Tag Also" [...] but later reported that the announcement made by Yahoo!'s Senior Director of Search was incorrect. In the corrected statement Yahoo! Senior Director of Search states that [...] "…What changed with Yahoo's ranking algorithms is <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>we</b> still index the meta keyword tag, the ranking importance given to meta keyword tags receives the lowest ranking signal in our system … it will actually have less effect than introducing those same words {{in the body of the}} document, or any other section." [...] In Sept 2012, Google announced that they will consider Keyword Meta tag for news publishers. Google said that this may help worthy content to get noticed. [...] The syntax of the news meta keyword has subtle difference from custom keyword meta tag; it is denoted by [...] "news_keywords", while the custom keyword meta tag is denoted by [...] "keywords".|$|E
