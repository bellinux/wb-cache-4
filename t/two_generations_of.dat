5|$|After {{the early}} deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier {{death of his}} brother Drusus (9BC), Tiberius was {{recalled}} to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus {{on the condition that}} he, in turn, adopt his nephew Germanicus. This continued the tradition of presenting at least <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> heirs. In that year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by AD 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of imperium with that of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War is a {{tactical}} role-playing {{game in which}} the player takes the roles of Sigurd and his son Seliph {{across a variety of}} story-driven missions on the continent of Jugdral. The story is divided into chapters, which are in turn divided between <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> characters. In between missions, the player units settle in a home base, where various actions such as forging new weapons, buying items, and triggering Support conversations between different characters. Castle towns within mission maps can also be visited for similar services.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required more than <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of}} a then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in {{only a small number of}} instances, but remains widely held as an answer to the difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E

25|$|On some {{islands and}} parts of the Alaskan peninsula, groups of traders had been capable of {{relatively}} peaceful coexistence with the local inhabitants. Other groups could not manage the tensions and perpetrated exactions. Hostages were taken, individuals were enslaved, families were split up, and other individuals were forced to leave their villages and settle elsewhere. In addition, eighty percent of the Aleut population was destroyed by Old World diseases, against which they had no immunity, during the first <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> Russian contact.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Church Fathers, (within <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles of Christ) {{are usually}} called the Apostolic Fathers since tradition describes them {{as having been}} taught by the twelve.

25|$|An {{intermediate}} host {{such as a}} cow or pig then ingests a sporocyst. Sporozoites are then released {{in the body and}} migrate to vessels where they undergo the first <b>two</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> asexual reproduction. These rounds result in the development of meronts. This stage lasts about 15 to 16 days after ingestion of sporocysts. Merozoites emerge from the second generation meronts and enter the mononucleate cells where they develop by endodyogeny. Subsequent <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> merozoites develop downstream in the direction of blood flow to arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins throughout the body subsequently developing into the final asexual generation in muscles.|$|R
25|$|Although Color Field is {{associated}} with Clement Greenberg, Greenberg actually preferred {{to use the term}} Post-Painterly Abstraction. In 1964, Clement Greenberg curated an influential exhibition that traveled the country called Post-painterly abstraction. The exhibition expanded the definition of color field painting. Color Field painting clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from abstract expressionism. In 2007 curator Karen Wilkin curated an exhibition called Color As Field:American Painting 1950-1975 that traveled to several museums throughout the United States. The exhibition showcased several artists representing <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> Color Field painters.|$|E
25|$|For <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> quarks, {{there are}} no CP violating phases, {{as shown by the}} {{counting}} of the previous section. Since CP violations were seen in neutral kaon decays already in 1964, the emergence of the Standard Model soon after was a clear signal of the existence of a third generation of quarks, as pointed out in 1973 by Kobayashi and Maskawa. The discovery of the bottom quark at Fermilab (by Leon Lederman's group) in 1976 therefore immediately started off the search for the missing third-generation quark, the top quark.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} of guitar-playing gradually improved; the early trovadors, being self-taught, had rather limited techniques. Later, some tapped into classical guitar techniques {{to revive the}} accompaniment of the trova. Guyún (Vincente Gonzalez Rubiera, Stgo de C. 27 October 1908Havana, 1987) studied under Severino Lopez, and developed a modern concept of harmony, {{and a way to}} apply classical technique to popular Cuban music. He became more adventurous, yet still in Cuban vein, and in 1938 stopped performing to devote himself to teaching the guitar. This bore fruit, and <b>two</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> Cuban guitarists bear witness to his influence.|$|E

Though the later approaches the problem of fiscal federalism from different perspective, it does not challenge but complements the former. The paper argues that second generation theory is an ongoing effort to build a theory in response to fiscal challenges facing a number of countries. In brief, it is aimed at explaining present-day institutional arrangements which {{can no longer be}} adequately explained by employing the first generation theory. ...|$|R
