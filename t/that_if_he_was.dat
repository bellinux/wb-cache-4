5|$|At the time, World War II {{had broken}} out and by mid-1940, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had fallen to Nazi Germany. Australia had {{declared}} war on Germany and Miller wanted to join the military, but St Kilda told him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> deployed outside Victoria, his career would be in jeopardy. As a result, Miller postponed his enlistment {{until the end of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Horton {{first entered}} junior hockey {{as a player}} for the Thorold Blackhawks. In one season with Thorold he scored 16 goals and {{registered}} 31 assists in 41 games. Prior to the 2001 OHL Draft, a 16-year-old Horton stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> drafted first overall by the Mississauga Ice Dogs, he would not report to the team. He was instead selected second overall in the draft by the Oshawa Generals. As a rookie in the OHL, Horton totaled 31 goals and 36 assists in 64 games for the Generals. During two seasons with Oshawa, Horton would score 64 goals and record 71 assists.|$|E
5|$|Citing his {{disappointment}} at failing to gain promotion, Stimson resigned {{from his post}} at Grays on 16 May 2006. He stated {{that at the time}} he had received no firm job offers from other clubs, and acknowledged that he was taking a gamble with his career, but said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to find a new job as a manager he would move into youth coaching or open his own football school. He was linked with the managerial vacancy at League Two Peterborough United, but eventually took over as manager of Stevenage Borough on 28 May, and led the club to an eighth-place finish in the Conference National in his first season in charge. Stevenage also defeated Stimson's former club Grays to reach the FA Trophy final, and beat Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 at the new Wembley Stadium in the final, giving Stimson a third consecutive Trophy win as a manager.|$|E

5000|$|He also {{indicated}} to the Queen that, in his view, {{and regardless of}} her declared reservations, such an appointment was prudent: [...] "the step … would be favourably received by the High Church party 'faction', who feel that the claims of Canon McNeile cannot be overlooked"; and, more significantly, <b>he</b> noted <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> to be [...] "overlooked" [...] at this time, the pressures might become such <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> to be [...] "passed over" [...] at this time, he might well gain an even [...] "higher preferment" [...] than the Dean of Ripon.|$|R
5|$|Contre-Admiral Leissègues' {{squadron}} was unchanged {{from the}} force that left Brest on 13 December. All ships however, especially Jupiter and Diomède, had been badly damaged by storms off the Azores in late December and repairs were incomplete {{by the time of}} Duckworth's attack, most the fleet still undergoing caulking at Santo Domingo. Recognising <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> caught at anchor he would be destroyed, Leissègues sent orders from his offices in Santo Domingo for the fleet to sail, joining them later by small boat. Trapped against the land with the wind from the west, Leissègues had no option but to form a line of battle and wait to meet the British squadron. Although his ships fought hard, they were unable to mutually support one another and were rapidly overwhelmed: three surrendered, while Diomède and Impérial were driven ashore and wrecked to prevent their capture. The only ships to escape were the two frigates and a corvette that and slipped between the French line and the land early in the battle and made sail to the west, eventually reaching France.|$|E
5|$|Nixon, {{somewhat}} dazed by {{the conversation}} with Dewey, dressed for the speech and reviewed his notes. Chotiner came into the senator's room, and told him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> forced off the ticket, Chotiner would call a huge press conference and reveal all the maneuvering that had led to Nixon's departure; Chotiner added that the resulting furor would mean nothing to {{either of the two}} men, since they would be through with politics anyway. Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. Senator and Mrs. Nixon and his staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young Republicans on the sidewalk outside, including future White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. In Cleveland, General and Mamie Eisenhower, with the general's aides, prepared to watch the speech on television in the manager's office above the Cleveland Public Auditorium, where the presidential candidate was to speak.|$|E
5|$|Sainsbury's scores dipped {{again for}} Somerset in 1888; his highest total {{for the county}} was an unbeaten 42 against the MCC. In contrast, in a match played for the MCC, Sainsbury struck his highest total for the side, scoring 180runs against Wiltshire at Lord's. Somerset were rated as {{the best of the}} second-class {{counties}} in both 1887 and 1888, but at the club's annual general meeting, a long discussion took place regarding the captaincy of the club. Sainsbury was unable to be present for the meeting, but had sent a letter advising <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> removed as captain, he did not feel he could play for the county any more. His letter was not well received at the meeting, and it was decided to replace him as captain with another player who lived closer to Taunton, and was able to play more of the county matches, as Sainsbury had missed a number during 1888. Roe was selected as his replacement, with Hewett as vice-captain. A vote of thanks was given to Sainsbury for his service to the county club.|$|E

5|$|Victoria Cross {{recipient}} Cecil Meritt {{cited the}} fact that he already held Canada's highest decoration as a reason not to be admitted to the Order of Canada. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was in 1982 offered appointment to the order as an honorary Companion; however, he refused on the grounds that, as the consort of the Queen, he was a Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment. In 1993, the Advisory Council proposed an amendment to the constitution of the Order of Canada, making the sovereign's spouse automatically a Companion, but Prince Philip again refused, stating <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to be appointed, it should be on his merits. Congruent with these arguments, he in 1988 accepted without issue a substantive induction as a Companion of the Order of Australia. In 2013, the constitution of the Order of Canada was amended in a way that permitted the substantive appointment of Royal Family members and Prince Philip accepted induction as the first extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada on 26 April 2013. Former Premier of Newfoundland Joey Smallwood declined appointment as a Companion because he felt that, as a self-proclaimed Father of Confederation, he deserved a knighthood. Smallwood was never knighted and later accepted induction as a Companion.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, Dangote {{expressed}} interest in purchasing the English football team Arsenal. He stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{able to make the}} purchase he would fire the club's long-standing manager Arsene Wenger.|$|E

There were two other incumbent state representatives interested in the speaker position, Dave Baum of La Grande and Carl Francis of Dayton.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his history}} of brutal acts and savagery, there was enough in his undoubted courage, his many fights against heavy odds, his {{occasional}} acts of mercy and charity, his conventional piety and calculated courting of publicity to ensure that Lampião entered Brazilian folk-history as a hero. One of the more dispassionate analyses of Lampião concluded <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a hero, he was an anarchist hero who forged a prominent place for himself in a society and political environment where people put their own interests above all other considerations.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to suppress the efficiency of his healing powers. For example, if an object composed of carbonadium is inserted and remains lodged within his body, his healing powers are slowed dramatically. The Muramasa blade, a katana of mystic origins that can inflict wounds that nullify superhuman healing factors, can also suppress Wolverine's powers. It has also been noted that Wolverine needs protein for his healing factor to generate tissue, meaning <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seriously injured and malnourished, his body {{might not be able}} to repair itself.|$|E

25|$|On October 26, 2008, at Cyber Sunday, Austin was {{the special}} guest referee during a match between Batista and Chris Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship. In between the match Stone Cold told a fleeing Jericho <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> counted out or disqualified, Batista {{would win the}} title. During {{the course of the}} match, Batista accidentally knocked Austin down. When Austin recovered, Randy Orton, who had come out as the third referee, knocked Austin back down, only to receive a Stone Cold Stunner when Austin recovered. Batista won the match after a Batista Bomb on Jericho.|$|E
25|$|Daniel J Quirk, a local auto dealer, {{bought the}} {{property}} in 2004 {{for use as a}} motor vehicle storage and distribution facility. Before the Great Recession hit, he publicized plans to redevelop the yard into condominiums and a living history exhibit, and cited Marina Bay, which is located at the old Victory Destroyer Plant and the Charlestown Navy Yard as examples of what he wanted to turn the yard into. In 2006, as he was trying to sell the Goliath crane, he acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to sell it, he would probably have it scrapped due to it becoming dangerous due to ongoing deterioration of the structure.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, Inglis decided <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to {{encourage}} the young men of his village {{to sign up for}} the army, he would also have to volunteer. At the age of 51, therefore, he was commissioned as a Chaplain to the Forces, 4th Class on 5 July 1915; he was attached to 1st Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry, arriving in France later in July 1915. For a short while he did duty at No. 23 General Hospital, Étaples, and then joined No. 21 Casualty Clearing Station at Corbie, near Albert. In December 1915, he was attached to the 16th Infantry Brigade, 6th Division, in the Ypres Salient.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{his support}} among {{elements}} of the party, Zuma remained a powerful political figure, retaining a high position in the ANC even after his dismissal as the country's deputy president. A panel of political analysts convened in November 2005 agreed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to be found innocent of the corruption charges brought against him, {{it would be hard}} for any other potential ANC candidate to beat Zuma in the race for the country's presidency in 2009. However, these analysts also questioned whether Zuma was indeed a left-wing candidate of the sort that many of his supporters seem to seek, and noted that the global and national economic constraints that have shaped Mbeki's presidency would be no different in the next presidential term.|$|E
25|$|Uthman had a {{reputation}} of favoring family members. One way he displayed this was he {{had a habit of}} splitting war booty among his relatives and keeping it from combatants. During the Invasion of Hamra al-Asad a Meccan spy, Muawiyah bin Al Mugheerah, the cousin of Uthman ibn Affan, had been captured. According to the Muslim scholar Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri, Uthman gave him shelter after getting permission from Muhammad, and Muhammad told him <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> caught again after 3 days he would be executed. As such, Muawiyah was given a grace period of three days and arranged a camel and provisions for his return journey to Mecca. Uthman departed with Muhammad for Hamra-al-Asad, and Muawiyah overstayed his grace. Though he fled by the time the army returned, Muhammad ordered his pursuit and execution. The orders were carried out.|$|E
25|$|Massie, who {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force on 17 August 1914, was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant in the 4th Battalion on 14 September, served with distinction during the war. His battalion embarked for Egypt in October, and he was promoted lieutenant on 1 February 1915. He took part in Australia's campaign at Gallipoli and in just his second day in the conflict was fortunate to survive a suicidal advance towards the Turkish lines, resulting from orders that were misunderstood by his battalion, when his commanding officer was killed, Massie tried to recover his body. While fighting at Gallipoli he wore a scarlet rag on his right arm so <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> shot by the Turkish marksmen it would likely be to the arm that stood out and not his left arm which he used for bowling.|$|E
