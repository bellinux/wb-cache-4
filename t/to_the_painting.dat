5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible to ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E
5|$|Much effort {{went into}} {{distinguishing}} the original glazes from those added during subsequent restorations. Previous retouches were removed and a natural resin varnish was applied. The painting's original frame, long missing, {{was located in}} 1992. It too was cleaned, restored, and reinstalled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eakins {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole {{dates from}} 1917 (the year after Eakins died), {{when the work}} was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, {{in reference to the}} 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{rejection}} by Coates, the painting remained in Eakins' possession until his death. It was exhibited just twice more during Eakins' lifetime: at the 1886 Southern Exposition in Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1887 at Chicago's Inter-State Industrial Exposition, and ignored by critics on both occasions. The painting then disappears from the historical record—there is no further reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in any records from Eakins or his {{circle of friends}} during Eakins' lifetime. Following Eakins' death, the painting was exhibited in Philadelphia and New York at memorial exhibitions in 1917.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 Colalucci {{undertook}} {{a series of}} experiments to discover the right approach {{for the restoration of}} the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, Conflict over the Body of Moses by Matteo de Lecce, which had similar physical and chemical attributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on {{a small portion of the}} Eleazar and Matthan lunette.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{about an}} hour after it was first displayed. He had forgotten a hammer and nails to hang the painting, and had left it {{leaning against the wall}} for an hour. Shortly after he returned, city aldermen, police officers and local reporters arrived at the scene, leading to a dramatic confrontation between aldermen and other students, while Nelson remained incognito nearby.|$|E

5|$|The {{striking}} {{scene has}} been used as the cover illustration for many books on topics both artistic and scientific. It has even spawned pastiches and parodies: the book cover of The Science of Discworld, by Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen, is a tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> by artist Paul Kidby, who replaces Wright's figures with the book's protagonists. Shelagh Stephenson's play An Experiment with an Air Pump, inspired by the painting, was the joint winner of the 1997 Margaret Ramsay Award and had its premiere at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 1994, {{the city}} and the ACLU reached a settlement. The ACLU agreed to drop claims against {{the city and}} Superintendent LeRoy Martin. In return, the city of Chicago agreed to pay Nelson and the ACLU $95,000 (1994, $138,000 in 2008) for damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> and to issue police {{procedures}} about what materials protected by the First Amendment may be seized. The elected officials also agreed not to appeal the district court's ruling. Left unresolved were {{the hundreds of thousands of}} dollars of legal fees owed to lawyers defending Tillman, Rush and Streeter; by September 1994, $200,000 (1994, $292,000 in 2008) in fees were owed by Tillman alone. Earlier in the year, the City Council's Finance Committee voted against paying for the aldermen's legal fees. The vote split along racial lines, 12 to 8.|$|E
5|$|Reproductive rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> were {{acquired}} by Zagreb merchant Petar Nikolić shortly after its creation, and lithographic prints were published soon thereafter. The painting {{was owned by}} the French Gallery until 1893, when it was purchased by a London buyer. In 1935, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs purchased the work {{and gave it to}} the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains. It is classified under inventory number 31–115. The museum has been closed to the public since the early 2000s, pending renovation. This has not kept Jovanović's works, including Decorating of the Bride, from being displayed at other venues, including the National Museum's foyer, which is sometimes open to the public.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of non-native species is another threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle. Red-eared sliders {{are the most}} common pet turtle and are native <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US Southeast only. They have been widely released (or escaped) and have established breeding populations in many parts of <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle range, including Canada. They are a similar species in size and habits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle, so they may be added competition, but the impact is uncertain. In the eastern United States, <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle already shares territory with yellow-bellied and Cumberland sliders (which mix readily with red-eared sliders), so there, the pet-released invasions {{are less likely to be}} a significant new threat.|$|R

5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E
25|$|Upon its {{arrival in}} Spain in September 1981, {{it was first}} {{displayed}} behind bomb-and bullet-proof glass screens at the Casón del Buen Retiro in Madrid in time to celebrate the centenary of Picasso's birth, 25 October. The exhibition was visited by almost a {{million people in the}} first year. Since that time there has never been any attempted vandalism or other security threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Swimming Hole (1884–5) {{features}} Eakins' finest {{studies of}} the nude, in his most successfully constructed outdoor picture. The figures are those {{of his friends and}} students, and include a self-portrait. Although there are photographs by Eakins which relate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> the picture's powerful pyramidal composition and sculptural conception of the individual bodies are completely distinctive pictorial resolutions. The work was painted on commission, but was refused.|$|E

50|$|During {{his time}} in Newlyn, Bramley was a {{particular}} exponent of the ‘square brush technique’, using the flat of a square brush <b>to</b> lay <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> on <b>the</b> canvas in a jigsaw pattern of brush strokes, giving a particular vibrancy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> surface. In <b>the</b> early 1890s, his palette became brighter and his handling of <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> looser and more impastoed, while his subject matter narrowed to portraits and rural genre paintings.|$|R

25|$|In December 2015, it was {{reported}} that French scientist Pascal Cotte had found a hidden portrait underneath the surface of the painting using reflective light technology. The portrait is an underlying image of a model looking off to the side. Having been given access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> by Louvre in 2004, Cotte spent ten years using layer amplification methods to study the painting. According to Cotte, the underlying image is Leonardo's original Mona Lisa.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{his works}} also contain letters and words added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> He explains: The words in the {{paintings}} are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what {{else is going on}} in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth... sometimes they become the title of the painting.|$|E

The subject has returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> and I’m {{not in the least}} proud to have predicted the return of what constitutes very foundation of pictorial art. This Élan vital constitutes the subject of Gleizes' canvas.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of these old masters dominated the future coloration of Hooke's pictures, and he applied the artistic {{lessons learned from}} his travels <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> of romantic subjects and those English themes of land and sea which became his trademarks. A Dream of Ancient Venice (RA, 1848), Bayard of Brescia (R.A., 1849), Venice (BI, 1849) and other works, won him an Associateship of the Royal Academy in 1850, and he gained full membership in 1860.

25|$|This was Edda's second {{victory of}} 1954. She {{had already been}} {{successful}} in forcing the state of Bavaria {{to return to her}} jewellery valued at 150,000 Deutschmarks which it had seized. However, the German authorities continued to pursue the case of the Cranach painting, and in January 1968 the Federal Court of Justice of Germany in Karlsruhe gave a final judgment in favour of the City of Cologne. By that point, both the state of Bavaria and the Federal Republic of Germany had laid claim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> which is now back in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum.|$|E

In June 2011, the painting was auctioned at Christie's in London and sold for £13.5 million ($20.6 million AUD).
