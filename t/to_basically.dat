5|$|By 1678, Frederick William {{had cleared}} Swedish Pomerania and {{occupied}} most of it, {{with the exception}} of Rügen which was held by Denmark–Norway. This was followed by another success against Sweden, when Frederick William cleared Prussia of Swedish forces in {{what became known as the}} Great Sleigh Drive. However, when Louis XIV of France concluded the Dutch War by the Nijmegen treaties, he marched his armies east to relieve his Swedish ally, and forced Frederick William <b>to</b> <b>basically</b> return to the status quo ante bellum by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679). Though the Scanian War resulted only in minor territorial gains, attaching a small strip of the Swedish Pomeranian right bank of the lower Oder to Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania, the war resulted in a huge gain of prestige for the elector.|$|E
5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force <b>to</b> <b>basically</b> take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that [...] "Laryngitis" [...] highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She {{wrote that the}} plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: [...] "I still heart Glee, which is clearly {{one of the best}} shows on television right now. I just think they may want to lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once." [...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain what to make of the episode, noting: [...] "Sure, there were some high points, and it was a pretty enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left me a little high and dry." [...] Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt [...] "totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural." [...] Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: [...] "It seems like the height of vanity <b>to</b> <b>basically</b> use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors before, and I think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly." ...|$|E

When asked if he had a problem with oil companies making a profit, Gilmore stated that he saw no problems with it and that he believed this was [...] "an appropriate thing to do." [...] He later confirmed his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol because it [...] "was going <b>to</b> <b>basically</b> just transfer money directly to Russia for nothing" [...] and that it must include [...] "every nation of the world in this entire project...includ China and India" [...] to meet his approval. But at the end of the debate when asked if he believed a conservative could include conservationist principles, he answered that he believed it could be a part of the platform because [...] "energy independence...is a national security issue" [...] which serves the interests of Conservatives by preserving a [...] "clean society that is also safe and secure for the nation." ...|$|E

500|$|After Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite was completed, the {{finished}} recordings {{were presented to}} Columbia Records in mid 1995. It was shelved for nearly a year, because of issues with Columbia's management, the label's extensive reorganization, and record executives' doubts regarding the album's commercial potential. The marketplace dominance of hip hop soul in 1995 was in contrast with Maxwell's monogamous themes and older soul influences, which Columbia worried would be interpreted as old-fashioned. The label's executives also feared that his romantic concept and image would not appeal to listeners. Maxwell made matters worse by refusing to allow his picture {{to be placed on}} the album's front cover; instead he preferred to have the track listing and other information he felt was more important about the album in place of his photo. Regarding the cover, Maxwell later said [...] "I wanted people to have the facts: the title, the selections {{and the fact that you}} had <b>to</b> <b>basically</b> buy it. I wanted people to come to the music and not base any opinion on the image". Columbia reached a compromise with Maxwell and used a promotional shot of him as the back cover. The album's front cover art also features a picture of a pair of golden women's shoes on the floor of a hotel room, with the bar coding prominently displayed. In the period before its release, Maxwell wrote and demoed songs for a subsequent studio album, and embarked on an African American college tour with Groove Theory and the Fugees.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Island {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", Michael was {{supposed}} to return in the season three finale, but Perrineau was filming the pilot of Demons, so was unable to return. Instead he returned in the seventh episode of season four, [...] "Ji Yeon". His return {{was meant to be}} announced during Losts slot at the 2007 Comic-Con International, however there were complaints at the Television Critics Association Press Tour when ABC's President of Entertainment Stephen McPherson commented that [...] "some big announcements" [...] would be made at the Lost panel. Some journalists felt that any announcements should be made to them at the press meeting, rather than at a fan convention. After numerous reporters asked about what would be announced, Lost producer Damon Lindelof was contacted, and he gave permission for McPherson to say Harold Perrineau would be returning to Lost. At Comic-Con, Lindelof confirmed Perrineau would be back as a cast member, not just for a flashback. Lost producer Carlton Cuse said [...] "Michael's story is for us one of the most becoming storylines on the show because here's a character who ... undertook some very extreme actions in order <b>to</b> <b>basically</b> get his son off the Island, and then when he sailed off in that boat I think everyone was very curious about what happened to him, what is his fate ... we really feel that Michael's story will be a really compelling part of the season." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed, and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are all these questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] Cuse responded [...] "We pride ourselves on having a very racially diverse cast. It's painful when any actor's storyline ends on the show. Harold is a fantastic actor whose presence added enormously to Lost". Perrineau later said he should have thought before making a racial comment, and although he felt like that, he never discussed the matter with the producers. Perrineau said that although he would be happy to return to Lost, he would have to know what the storyline would be.|$|E

[...] These can be stacked and an optimal band gap can be used for each cell in order to produce the maximum amount of power. [...] Options for how each cell is connected are available, such as serial or parallel. [...] The serial connection is desired because the output of the solar cell would just be two leads.|$|E

Having just led his party into a disastrous election campaign, Johnston decided <b>to</b> <b>basically</b> cede control of the party to Tupper, though Johnston remained the party's leader. During 1856 Tupper led Conservative attacks on the government, leading Joseph Howe to dub Tupper [...] "the wicked wasp of Cumberland." [...] In early 1857 Tupper convinced a number of Roman Catholic Liberal members to cross the floor to join the Conservatives, reducing Young's government {{to the status of}} a minority government. As a result, Young was forced to resign in February 1857, and the Conservatives formed a government with Johnston as premier. Tupper became the provincial secretary.|$|E
2500|$|The streetcars are a Czech design, and {{the first}} ten – which is all cars {{purchased}} before 2009 – {{were built in the}} Czech Republic and shipped to the USA complete.

Compared to MAX cars they are shorter and narrower, a result of having to run in mixed traffic on neighborhood streets, alongside parked automobiles. The cars are lighter than those used by MAX, allowing cheaper, less-intense track construction. Furthermore, couplers on the streetcars are hidden behind bumper skirts and only used to move disabled units back to the yard. This safety feature protects any hapless motorists who may collide with the end of a streetcar.|$|E

[...] The album was reportedly near completion in mid-2000 when producer Roy Thomas Baker convinced Rose to re-record the entire album, causing further delays. In 2004, bassist Tommy Stinson stated that the album was [...] "almost done" [...] and that it was held back by [...] "legal issues". Stinson also said delays were caused by Rose making sure every band member had a say in each song, mentioning that [...] "it's a lengthy process because you have to get eight people <b>to</b> <b>basically</b> write a song together that everyone likes." [...] Stinson also stated Rose was a perfectionist and an engineer involved on the album claimed that [...] "Axl wanted to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task.

2500|$|There {{was never}} any formal {{structure}} or hierarchy to the Dubois Brothers group, other than the Brothers were on the top, they either individually or in tandem with each other controlled a particular criminal activity or territory and often shared their army or other members. The Dubois Brothers began in the 1950s [...] with petty street crimes and eventually {{moved on to the}} four oldest brothers- Raymond, Jean-Guy, Normand and Claude- starting to convince local bar owners to give them protection funds and other extortions. Some of their petty street crimes were a series of burglaries and armed robberies in the early 1950s. [...] By the time the 1960s rolled around extortion, targeting the owners and employees of nightclubs, bars and taverns in the eastern end of the city became their specialty. Near the end of the 1960s five of the brothers were charged with murdering a waiter at a quarrel in a local bar, which ended with the waiter shot, they were later acquitted and continued their reign. Into the late 1960s to 70s, the Dubois Brothers expanded their territory into the downtown nightclubs as they challenged the Cotroni Mafia family supremacy. The Cotroni Family began to show signs of weakness around the 1970s allowing the expansion of the Dubois Brothers territory into both the east and west ends of Montreal city. This movement allowed the Brothers <b>to</b> <b>basically</b> wipe out the rival Irish gang as well and take over a lucrative drug market by out muscling a motorcycle gang. The Dubois Brothers were prospering in the 1970s and continued to expand their territory and add to their criminal lifestyle.
