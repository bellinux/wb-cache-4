5|$|Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) have a minor {{fight over}} Keith’s {{relationship}} with Harmony. Veronica is staying in Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Piz’s (Chris Lowell) dorm room. Piz comes in unexpectedly, {{and the two}} end up hanging out. However, a girl shows up and tells them that her boyfriend, Sully, has gone missing. They look in Sully’s room, but the girlfriend is hesitant to help. In criminology class, Mr. Landry (Patrick Fabian) tells Veronica that he’s applied her for an internship at the FBI. Veronica talks to Logan (Jason Dohring) about Mercer, but he still refuses to give her an alibi. Veronica and the girlfriend, Meryl, find that Sully has contacted another girl, Scarlett, but Scarlett knows that Sully has a girlfriend. Veronica visits Mercer in prison, and he tells her that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> {{who would want to}} frame him. Sully’s roommate comes back to their room, and Veronica uncovers that Meryl and Sully had a fight the previous weekend.|$|E

25|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{the number}} of kibbutzim making {{significant}} changes in their lifestyle continued to grow, while the resistance to these changes gradually decreased, {{with only a few}} dozen kibbutzim still functioning under more traditional models. It is important to note, however, that each kibbutz has undergone different processes of change. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> outside and inside the kibbutzim, who claim these changes bring the end of the kibbutz concept. Among the communities that had recently officially ceased being kibbutzim are Megiddo in the Jezreel Valley, HagGoshrim in the Upper Galilee, Beyt Nir in the Negev, etc.|$|E

25|$|Several peer based organisations {{exist for}} sex workers. The aim of these organisations {{is to support}} the health, rights and well being of sex workers and {{advocate}} on their behalf for law reform {{in order to make}} working safer. Sex work is work and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> who willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.|$|E
25|$|Consumer-generated {{advertising}} {{is a relatively}} new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, {{to take advantage of this}} new development as well. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.|$|E
25|$|A joint interim {{statement}} of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and International Association for the Study of Obesity published a guideline to harmonize {{the definition of the}} metabolic syndrome. This definition recognizes that the risk associated with a particular waist measurement will differ in different populations. Whether it is better at this time to set the level at which risk starts to increase or at which there is already substantially increased risk will be up to local decision-making groups. However, for international comparisons and to facilitate the etiology, it is critical that a commonly agreed-upon set of criteria be used worldwide, with agreed-upon cut points for different ethnic groups and sexes. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in the world of mixed ethnicity, and in those cases, pragmatic decisions will have to be made. Therefore, an international criterion of overweight (BMI≥25) may be more appropriate than ethnic specific criteria of abdominal obesity for an anthropometric component of this syndrome which results from an excess lipid storage in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver.|$|E

[...] In addition, her potential as an international superstar proved to be the primary motivation for the label's investment. Jeff Ayeroff, co-managing director of Virgin in the US stated: [...] "Janet is a world-class artist and we expect her growth to be enormous."
