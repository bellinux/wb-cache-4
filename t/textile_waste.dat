50|$|Digital {{printing}} is {{a process}} in which prints are directly applied to fabrics with printer, reducing 95% the use of water, 75% the use of energy, and minimizing <b>textile</b> <b>waste.</b> The main advantage of digital printing is the ability to do very small runs of each design (even less than 1 yard).|$|E
30|$|The {{cellulose}} conversion using alkali ultrasonication on CGT (40 %) {{was larger}} than the conversion found by Silverstein et al. [6] in cotton stalks (21 %) but it was lower than Kaur et al. [15] over cotton stalks (63 %) and Jeihanipour and Taherzadeh [14] in <b>textiles</b> <b>wastes</b> (99 %). The difference between CGT and <b>textile</b> <b>wastes</b> is associated with their composition. <b>Textile</b> <b>wastes</b> comprise small lignin content which allows an {{easy access to the}} cellulose. Alkali hydrolysis has been utilized in several types of biomass (sugarcane bagasse, sweet sorghum bagasse, corn stover, etc.) to reduce the lignin content [16]. This pretreatment is normally related with the removal of lignin because NaOH breaks the ester bonds cross-linkage in lignin and xylan [9]. This breaking augments the biomass porosity allowing an easier access of the enzymes to the cellulose. However, alkali hydrolysis normally does not produce considerable modification in the cellulose structure, and this type of modification is necessary to increase the cellulose conversion [6]. The combination of alkaline pretreatment and ultrasonication have been evaluated in sugarcane bagasse and rice straw. In sugarcane, alkali ultrasonication boosted the cellulose conversion approximately 50 % against the un-pretreated biomass and 40 % versus the pretreatment without ultrasonication [17]. The difference between the pretreated and un-pretreated biomass coincides with the results of this research (Figure 1). In rice straw, the alkali ultrasonication exhibited cellulose conversion greater than the un-pretreated biomass and the alkali pretreatment; nevertheless, the difference between the alkali pretreatment and the alkali ultrasonication was small [18]. The cellulose conversion can be enhanced by different strategies such optimizing the severity of the liquid hot water pretreatment or improving the conditions of the ligninolytic enzymes and ultrasonication pretreatment (reaction time, temperatures, etc.).|$|R

The four subreports will be the basis for the work to be performed in 2014 with the aim of creating a Voluntary Commitment and a Code of Conduct. The reports for 2013 are: • Mapping of current actors in the collection, sorting, reuse and recycling of used textiles and the management of <b>textile</b> <b>wastes</b> • Literature review of the traceability of global textile flows. • Definition and documentation of operational and best practice standards in the collection, sorting, reuse and recycling of used textiles and management of <b>textile</b> <b>wastes.</b> • Comparison with waste management of other waste streams.

50|$|The average American {{household}} produces 70 {{pounds of}} <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> every year. When you compare that number {{to the entire}} country, there is roughly 10.5 million tons of <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> being thrown away. For example, the residents of New York City discard around 193,000 tons of clothing and textiles, which equates to 6% of all the city’s garbage. In comparison, the European Union generates a total of 5.8 million tons of textiles each year. While Americans donate or recycle around 15% of their unwanted clothing, these numbers show that {{a large portion of}} textiles are ending up in landfills worldwide. As a whole, the textile industry occupies roughly 5% of all landfill space. The clothing that is discarded into landfills is often made from synthetic or inorganic materials which prevents these textiles from being able to degrade properly. While {{it is clear that the}} accumulation of waste in the world’s landfills is causing negative effects on the environment, it is not the only environmental concern that the fast fashion industry creates.|$|E

40|$|Innovative {{geotextiles}} {{formed from}} meandrically arranged ropes {{were used for}} the protection of the steep slope in the gravel pit Nieboczowy.

It was found that immediately after installation the geotextiles prevent the ground sliding. Ropes laterally arranged on the slope absorb significant amounts of water and create microdam system, which slow down a runoff. In spring the geotextiles accelerate the development of vegetation. Lush vegetation covering the entire surface of the slope supports the stabilizing effect of geotextiles. Geotextiles effectively protect the embankment against landslides and the consequences of surface erosion. Geotextiles can be successfully applied in the process of reclamation of disused gravel pits...|$|R
50|$|Two general {{approaches}} {{fall under}} this category, {{both of which}} occur during a garment's initial production. In zero-waste fashion design the designer creates a garment through the pattern cutting process, working within {{the space of the}} fabric width. This approach directly influences the design of the final garment as the pattern cutting process is a primary design step. It is difficult to design a zero-waste garment solely through sketching, although sketching can be a useful speculative tool. Zero-waste manufacture, of which zero-waste design is a component, is a holistic approach that can eliminate <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> without modifying the garment patterns.|$|E
50|$|Zero-waste fashion {{refers to}} items of {{clothing}} that generate {{little or no}} <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> in their production. It can {{be considered to be}} a part of the broader Sustainable fashion movement. It can be divided into two general approaches. Pre-consumer zero-waste fashion eliminates waste during manufacture. Post-consumer zero-waste fashion generates clothing from post-consumer garments such as second-hand clothing, eliminating waste at what would normally be the end of the product use life of a garment. Zero-waste fashion is not a new concept - early examples of zero-waste or near zero-waste garments include Kimono, Sari, Chiton and many other traditional folk costumes.|$|E

40|$|Post-consumer {{textile product}} {{is one of}} the rapid {{expanding}} markets in the world. Various kinds of textile goods are generated in every season to meet consumer demand and trends. With such a high level of consumption, it is very likely that more unwanted domestic textiles will be produced. Without proper <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> management, the unwanted textiles will eventually end up in landfills and incinerators becoming textile wastes. Overseas countries put a lot of effort in facilitating <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> management. Their commercial recyclers, NGOs and government have implemented different programmes to promote <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> management in their communities. Although Hong Kong government and NGOs have also implemented some schemes to deal with the domestic <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> problem, the effectiveness of the schemes are in doubt. Over the last decade, most of the <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> in Hong Kong is sent to the landfills, causing environmental problems and exerting a huge spatial pressure on the landfills. Nevertheless, most of the textile wastes which are recovered are being sent overseas which is very likely to be developing countries for recycling, leading to a diverted <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> problem. In addition, since there are no policy and regulations on dealing with textile wastes, {{there is a lack of}} incentive for the recyclers to treat textile wastes properly. Therefore, it is essential to raise the public’s awareness towards the <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> problem and <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> management programmes, as well as to provide sufficient supporting measures to facilitate effective <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> management in Hong Kong. There is a lack of study about domestic <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> management in Hong Kong, including the public’s behaviour and attitude towards <b>textile</b> <b>waste</b> management.
