5|$|<b>Two</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> mass {{conscription}} existed {{during the}} Han period. These were civilian conscription (gengzu 更卒) and military conscription (zhengzu 正卒).

These duties were usually fulfilled by work on construction projects.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The Itcha Range has had {{at least}} <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> names {{throughout}} its history. It was originally named the Itcha Mountains as identified in the 1930 BC Gazetteer. This form of name remained official until March 13, 1947 when it was changed to its current form, Itcha Range, {{as part of an}} official government policy. Larger mountain ranges throughout British Columbia, such as the Coast Mountains, retained their gazetted names whereas smaller ones, especially ranges of larger groupings, were subjected to renaming. In more casual speech, the Itcha Range {{is referred to as the}} Itchas. The name Itcha is indigenous in origin, coming from the local Tsilhqot'in people.|$|E
5|$|The courts {{recognise}} <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not {{referred to}} {{at all on}} the face of the will.

5|$|There is {{a long-standing}} {{practice}} of writing transliterations of the runes in Latin characters in boldface and transcribing the text into a normalized {{form of the}} language with italic type. This practice exists because the <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> rendering a runic text have to be kept distinct. By not only showing the original inscription, but also transliterating, transcribing and translating, scholars present the analysis {{in a way that}} allows the reader to follow their interpretation of the runes.

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about Silverthrone’s eruptive history. However, as at other calderas, eruptions at Silverthrone are {{explosive}} in nature, involving viscous magma, glowing avalanches of hot volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows. The source magma of this rock is classified as acidic, having high to intermediate levels of silica, as in rhyolite, dacite, and andesite. Andesitic and rhyolitic magma are commonly associated with the <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> explosive eruptions called Plinian and Peléan eruptions. Silverthrone is considerably younger than its nearest prominent neighbour Franklin Glacier Volcano to the east-southeast.|$|E
5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} fetters its discretion, it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms of fettering of discretion were recognized: fettering of discretion through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering of discretion by an unlawful delegation of authority. These <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> fettering of discretion have been said to represent two elements defining the concept of discretion in administrative law – the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion of one's personal discretion.|$|E

Election advertising sent by e-mail, micro-blog post, SMS or MMS must contain a functioning e-mail address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from the sender.|$|E

5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} {{features of}} both diseases include strong cough with {{large amounts of}} often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these player versus environment (PvE) challenges, <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> player versus player (PvP) combat exist in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. The first type, the Wolves' Den, is an arena featuring structured four-versus-four battles; players may queue into a battle with up to three teammates to challenge another four-person team. The second type, Frontlines, is a large battleground instance in which players form teams of up to 24 characters. Teams are delineated by players' allegiance {{to one of three}} Grand Companies and the team which reaches the target number of points first wins the match. Four modes are available with differing locations and rulesets, such as King of the Hill, capture the flag, and team deathmatch. Within the fiction, Frontlines is presented as an organized set of military exercises between the three nations with the ulterior goal of jockeying for dominance of regions rich in magical artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These <b>two</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E
