5|$|The possessive determiners (analogous to English my, his, etc.) {{are used}} to {{indicate}} the possessor of the noun they determine. They mark the person and number of the possessor, and are inflected <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> noun they are attached in number and case. While the English language distinguishes between masculine and feminine singular possessors (his vs. her), late Quenya generally does not.|$|E
5|$|While Riley {{was working}} on his book, he was {{unexpectedly}} invited by James B. Pond, the agent {{for many of the}} nations major performers, to join a one-hundred nights' engagement in New York City in a show that included Samuel Clemens and Dudley Warner. Riley, however, was unable <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Redpath Bureau who had to authorize any other performance under the terms of their contract. Riley believed his contract with Redpath Bureau was limiting his opportunities, and his relationship with his agent became strained.|$|E

50|$|The SCA, on appeal, {{held that}} the {{constitutional}} provision does not impose a judicially enforceable duty to bargain on employers or employees. On further appeal, however, the Constitutional court left the question open. It did point out, however, that the contrary approach could create difficulties. It came close, then, <b>to</b> <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> SCA that no duty to bargain collectively exists in South African labour law.|$|R

5|$|A {{key feature}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps program was its {{accelerated}} training curricula. Participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets {{in the last six}} months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent to that of a graduate nurse. During their first nine months of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> accelerated program.|$|E
5|$|When Burnet {{returned}} to Australia, {{he continued his}} work on virology, including the epidemiology of herpes simplex. He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named Coxiella burnetii in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.|$|E

50|$|Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) {{believed}} {{that the reason for}} this effect was {{due to the nature of}} processing that the jurors engaged in. Jurors who were high in need for cognition actively process the information. This active processing leads <b>to</b> <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> initial presentation of the data, and then participating in processing that confirms this agreement. However, people low in need for cognition do not process information, and therefore, rely on the information presented most recently for their opinion.|$|R
25|$|Subjects who {{received}} the socially desirable and mixed reports were far more likely <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> personality assessments than the subjects {{who received}} negative reports, though {{it should be noted}} that there was not a significant difference between the first two groups.|$|E
25|$|Frontier {{convenor}} Emily Lau {{said the}} requirement for new appointees <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chief executive's philosophy suggested the government was merely {{looking for a way}} to offer well-paid jobs to its supporters.

25|$|Western historians tend <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Primary Chronicle {{that these}} Scandinavians founded Kievan Rus' in the 880s and gave their {{name to the}} land.

2500|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Aristotelian {{definition of}} man as [...] "the rational animal," [...] Aquinas also held various other {{beliefs about the}} substance of man. For instance, as the essence (nature) of all men are the same, and the definition of being is [...] "an essence that exists," [...] humans that are real therefore only differ by their specific qualities. More generally speaking, all beings of the same genus have the same essence, and {{so long as they}} exist, only differ by accidents and substantial form.|$|R

25|$|Trial judges {{typically}} take {{a passive}} role during trial; however, during their charge to the jury, judges may comment upon {{the value of}} certain testimony or suggest the appropriate amount of damages in a civil case, although {{they are required to}} tell the jury that it is to make its own decision and is not bound <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> judge.|$|E
25|$|To {{express a}} possibility, the {{potential}} form must be used. For intransitive verbs, the ending is -ilefa or olefa (-lefa and -refa after /l,r/), {{which does not}} need <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> subject. Transitive potential forms are formed with -illet and -allet, which are suffixed to the normal endings of the transitive indicative forms. However, this form is only attested in Mitanni and only in the third person. The potential form is also occasionally used to express a wish.|$|E

25|$|The {{roots of}} Burmese verbs {{are almost always}} suffixed {{with at least one}} {{particle}} which conveys such information as tense, intention, politeness, mood, etc. Many of these particles also have formal/literary and colloquial equivalents. In fact, the only time in which no particle is attached to a verb is in imperative commands. However, Burmese verbs are not conjugated {{in the same way as}} most European languages; the root of the Burmese verb always remains unchanged and does not have <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> subject in person, number or gender.|$|E
25|$|In February 2014, the European Parliament {{passed a}} {{resolution}} stating that according to the parliament's assessment, the Copenhagen criteria have been fulfilled sufficiently {{for the country to}} start its negotiations for EU accession, and called for the Council of the European Union to confirm the date for start of accession negotiations straight away, as bilateral disputes must not be an obstacle for the start of talks—although they must be solved before the accession process. However, {{it remains to be seen}} whether or not the Council decides <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> parliament's opinion, at its next meeting in June 2014.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the advent}} of {{printing}} greatly reduced the potential of human error and increased the consistency and uniformity of the text, the earliest editions of the Vulgate merely reproduced the manuscripts that were readily available to the publishers. Of the hundreds of early editions, the most notable today is Mazarin edition published by Johann Gutenberg and Johann Fust in 1455, famous for its beauty and antiquity. In 1504 the first Vulgate with variant readings was published in Paris. One of the texts of the Complutensian Polyglot was an edition of the Vulgate made from ancient manuscripts and corrected <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Greek.|$|E

25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to reinterpret the {{historical}} evidence <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Rabbinic tradition (see Excursus: Rabbinic Tradition, below), however this approach to the discrepancy is problematic. The reinterpretation of the Greek, Babylonian and Persian sources that is required to support the traditional dating has been achieved only in parts and has not yet been achieved in its entirety. Similar problems face other attempts to revise secular dating (such as those of Peter James and David Rohl) and mainstream scholarship rejects such approaches. Where and how the Gregorian or Julian calendric differential gets factored in, remains another argument entirely.|$|E
25|$|Pat Johnson {{remained}} {{convinced of}} the validity of the idea, and had Whittle patent the idea in January 1930. Since the RAF was not interested in the concept they did not declare it secret, meaning that Whittle was able to retain the rights to the idea, which would have otherwise been their property. Johnson arranged a meeting with British Thomson-Houston (BTH), whose chief turbine engineer seemed <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> basic idea. However, BTH did not want to spend the ₤60,000 it would cost to develop it, and this potential brush with early success went no further.|$|E
25|$|The Turner-Ownbey long {{distance}} telepathy experiment was discovered to contain flaws. May Frances Turner positioned {{herself in the}} Duke Parapsychology Laboratory whilst Sara Ownbey claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment Turner would think of a symbol and write it down whilst Ownbey would write her guesses. The scores were highly successful and both records {{were supposed to be}} sent to J. B. Rhine; however, Ownbey sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average.|$|E
