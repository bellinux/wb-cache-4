5|$|The 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans was the 75th Grand Prix of Endurance, {{and took}} place at the Circuit de la Sarthe, Le Mans, France from 16–17 June 2007. Four classes of cars raced together, with each class having honors for its highest finishers. The faster LMP1 and LMP2 classes were for {{custom-built}} Le Mans Prototypes (LMP), and the slower GT1 and GT2 classes were for modified grand <b>tourer</b> (GT) road cars.|$|E
5|$|The Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) {{category}} was {{won by the}} Signatech Alpine driven by Nicolas Lapierre, Gustavo Menezes and Stéphane Richelmi. Lapierre {{took the lead in}} the closing stages of the race after passing No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports driver Pipo Derani which earned Menezes and Richelmi their first LMP2 class victories in the World Endurance Championship. Sam Bird and Davide Rigon in the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari took the victory in the Le Mans Grand <b>Tourer</b> Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) class with a one-lap advantage over second-placed No. 67 Ford Chip Ganassi Team drivers Andy Priaulx, Marino Franchitti and Harry Tincknell. The Le Mans Grand <b>Tourer</b> Endurance Amateur (LMGTE Am) {{category was}} led for most of the final hour by the No. 98 Aston Martin of Pedro Lamy, Paul Dalla Lana and Mathias Lauda and held it to clinch victory in the class, ahead of the No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari driven by François Perrodo, Emmanuel Collard and Rui Águas.|$|E
50|$|In Australia <b>tourers</b> {{may have}} two or four doors. The belt lines of <b>tourers</b> were often lowered in the front doors to give the car a more {{sporting}} character. and would then be named sports <b>tourers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Full-dress <b>tourers</b> are {{designed}} specifically for riding on pavement. A few examples of full-dress <b>tourers</b> are the Yamaha Royal Star Venture, the Honda Gold Wing, and Harley-Davidson Electra Glide.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{dry weight}} of 297 kg, {{considered}} [...] "on the touring end" [...] of the sport-touring spectrum, they filled the niche between lightweight sport <b>tourers</b> {{such as the}} VFR750 and full-dress <b>tourers</b> such as the Goldwing.|$|R
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard <b>Tourer,</b> had been struck by a train at a level crossing {{and he had been}} dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|HSV E Series 3 or E3 {{commenced}} {{sales in}} 2011. Model {{changes for the}} E series 3 include an option for LPI system (for an extra $5990) allowing the vehicle to run on LPG and unleaded petrol; the LPI system is not available on the ClubSport R8 <b>Tourer.</b> Cosmetic changes include a new spoiler and revised exhaust tips. HSV E Series 3 models reach 0-100kmp in 5.8 seconds.

The system allows users to access the car's computer and monitor fuel consumption, stability, g-force and vehicle dynamics. Other functions include data logging options, digital gauge displays, stopwatch, driver and racing options, along with controls for the Grange's Bi-Modal exhaust and Side Blind-Zone Alert. The HSV Enhanced Driver Interface and satellite navigation is standard across the E series 3 range.|$|E
25|$|When the Jack Benny Program began {{appearing}} {{on television in}} 1950, a 1916 Maxwell Model 25 <b>Tourer</b> {{became one of the}} production's standard props. Benny's Maxwell later became a 1923 <b>Tourer.</b> In addition to its being on the program, Benny would often make public appearances in Maxwells. He drove a Maxwell onto the stage in one of his last television specials.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{different}} injury {{rates and}} injury patterns previous personality related {{research in the}} field of downhill winter sports did not subdivide between different alpine slope users. In this study, we tried to find out whether the personality trait sensation seeking differs between skiers, snowboarders and ski <b>tourers.</b> In a cross-sectional survey 1185 persons (726 alpine skiers, 321 snowboarders and 138 ski <b>tourers</b> comparable in age and sex) were electronically questioned with the sensation seeking scale (SSS-V) comprising the four factors thrill and adventure seeking, experiences seeking, disinhibition and boredom susceptibility. Kruskal-Wallis Tests revealed a significantly higher total score of the SSS-V for snowboarders in comparison to alpine skiers and ski <b>tourers</b> (H(2) = 41. 5, p < 0. 001). Ski <b>tourers</b> and snowboarders scored significantly higher in the dimensions “thrill- and adventure-seeking” and “experience-seeking” than alpine skiers. Furthermore, snowboarders showed higher scores in “disinhibition” related to alpine skiers and ski <b>tourers</b> and “boredom susceptibility” compared to alpine skiers. Data show differences in the personality trait sensation seeking in people practising different winter sports. As snowboarders showed higher SS-scores compared to alpine skiers and ski <b>tourers</b> prevention and information programs might benefit from a selective approach focusing on special characteristics of the respective group...|$|R
