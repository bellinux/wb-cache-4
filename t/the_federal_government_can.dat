5|$|Canada is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, {{these may be}} grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made {{by the federal government}} to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.|$|E
5|$|During his {{campaign}} and presidency, President George W. Bush endorsed {{the idea of}} background checks at gun shows. Bush's position was that the gun show loophole should be closed by federal legislation since the gun show loophole was created by previous federal legislation. President Bush ordered {{an investigation by the}} U.S. Departments of Health, Education, and Justice {{in the wake of the}} Virginia Tech shootings in order to make recommendations on ways <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> prevent such tragedies. On January 8, 2008 he signed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) into law. Goals and objectives that the NIAA sought to address included: The gap in information available to NICS about such prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments.

[...] Ruff describes Stern's article as [...] "he only detailed analysis of the problem before the recent flood of cases." [...] By 1977, the Third Circuit's interpretation in Kenny had been adopted by the First, Second, Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits.

2500|$|Citing Justice Hugo Black in Torcaso v. Watkins, Justice Clark added, [...] "We repeat {{and again}} reaffirm that neither a State nor <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> <b>can</b> constitutionally force a person 'to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.' Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose {{requirements}} which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions {{based on a}} belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs." [...] Such prohibited behavior was self-evident in the Pennsylvania law requiring Bible reading (and allowing recitation of the Lord's Prayer) in its public schools. The Court recognized the value of such ideal neutrality from lessons of history when government and religion were either fully fused or cooperative with one another and religious liberty was nonexistent or seriously curtailed.|$|E

So I supported No Child Left Behind. I still do. I know there are a lot in my party that don't like it, but I like testing in our schools. I think it allows us to get better schools, better teachers; allows us to let our kids have the kind of hope that they ought to have."

2500|$|In the 1994 case Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet, Supreme Court Justice David Souter {{wrote in}} the opinion for the Court that: [...] "government should not prefer one {{religion}} to another, or religion to irreligion". Everson v. Board of Education established that [...] "neither a state nor <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> <b>can</b> pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another". This applies the Establishment Clause to the {{states as well as}} the federal government. However, several state constitutions make the protection of persons from religious discrimination conditional on their acknowledgment of the existence of a deity, making freedom of religion in those states inapplicable to atheists. These state constitutional clauses have not been tested. Civil rights cases are typically brought in federal courts, so such state provisions are mainly of symbolic importance.|$|E

2500|$|Some special areas provide {{different}} paths. After attending any of {{the above}} schools and gaining a leaving certificate like Hauptschulabschluss, Mittlere Reife (or Realschulabschuss, from a Realschule) or Abitur from a Gymnasium or a Gesamtschule, school leavers can start a career with an apprenticeship at a Berufsschule (vocational school). [...] Here the student is registered with certain bodies, e.g. associations such as the German Bar Association Deutsche Rechtsanwaltskammer GBA (board of directors). During the apprenticeship, the young person is a part-time salaried employee of the institution, bank, physician or attorney’s office. After leaving the Berufsfachschule and passing the exit examinations set by the German Bar Association or other relevant associations, the apprentice receives a certificate and is ready for a career at all levels except in positions which require a specific higher degree, such as a doctorate. In some areas, the apprenticeship scheme teaches skills that are required by law, including certain positions in a bank or those as legal assistants. The 16 states have exclusive responsibility in the field of education and professional education. The federal parliament and <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> influence the educational system only by financial aid to the states.

Yet I cannot be false to my trust, nor break my word by compromising. Still, I have resolved that no more deaths shall be upon my head. I have willed the many millions I lately received to their rightful owners. Let the stalwart sons of Eben Hale work out their own salvation. Ere you read this I shall have passed on. The Minions of Midas are all-powerful. The police are impotent. I have learned from them that other millionnaires have been likewise mulcted or persecuted--how many is not known, for when one yields to the M. of M., his mouth is thenceforth sealed. Those who have not yielded are even now reaping their scarlet harvest. The grim game is being played out. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> <b>can</b> do nothing. I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe. Society is shaken to its foundations. Principalities and powers are as brands ripe for the burning.

6000|$|The {{shores of}} Michigan are {{generally}} low, nor are harbors either numerous, or very easy of access. It would be difficult, indeed, {{to find in}} {{any other part of}} the world, so great an extent of coast that possesses so little protection for the navigator, as that of this very lake. There are a good many rivers, it is true, but usually they have bars, and are not easy of entrance. This is the reason why that very convenient glove, the Constitution, which can be made to fit any hand, has been discovered to have an extra finger in it, which points out a mode by which <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>can</b> create ports wherever nature has forgotten to perform this beneficent office. It is a little extraordinary that the fingers of so many of the great [...] "expounders" [...] turn out to be [...] "thumbs," [...] however, exhibiting clumsiness, rather than that adroit lightness which usually characterizes the dexterity of men who are in the habit of rummaging other people's pockets, for their own especial purposes. It must be somewhat up-hill work to persuade any disinterested and clear-headed man, that a political power to [...] "regulate commerce" [...] goes the length of making harbors; the one being in a great measure a moral, while the other is exclusively a physical agency; any more than it goes the length of making ware-houses, and cranes, and carts, and all the other physical implements for carrying on trade. Now, what renders all this [...] "thumbing" [...] of the Constitution so much the more absurd, is the fact, that the very generous compact interested does furnish a means, by which the poverty of ports on the great lakes may be remedied, without making any more unnecessary rents in the great national glove. Congress clearly possesses the power to create and maintain a navy, which includes the power to create all sorts of necessary physical appliances; and, among others, places of refuge for that navy, should they be actually needed. As a vessel of war requires a harbor, and usually a better harbor than a merchant-vessel, it strikes us the [...] "expounders" [...] would do well to give this thought a moment's attention. Behind it will be found the most unanswerable argument in favor of the light-houses, too.|$|E
