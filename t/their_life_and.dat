5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice <b>their</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those who get moksha (salvation) also escape from the clutches of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E
5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, {{sirenians}} congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with multiple males. Sirenians are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during <b>their</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> invest considerable parental care in their young. Dugongs generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals for one to two days. Since they congregate in turbid waters, little is known about their reproductive behavior. The males are often seen with scars, and the tusks on dugongs grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. Manatees can reach sexual maturity as early as two to five years of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate for one to two years. West Indian manatees and African manatees can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. Amazonian manatees have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|E
5|$|To create Lou Bloom's character, Gilroy {{explored}} {{the ideas of}} unemployment and capitalism. He wanted to portray Lou as someone who perpetually focuses on the precepts of capitalism, and how these thoughts not only give him sanity, but also push him over the edge. Gilroy did not give Lou a character arc, as he believed that people develop their ideals {{at a certain point}} in <b>their</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> that they stay that way regardless of what happens. This is depicted in the opening scene of the film, when Lou attacks a security guard, which informs the audience that Lou is a criminal, and not someone who lost their morality {{as a result of the}} job. Lou's backstory was purposefully left out of the script, as Gilroy felt that without one, the audience would create their own backstories for Lou, and become more engaged with the character. Gilroy remarked that Lou eventually became a vehicle for the ideas and themes that he wanted to express in the film.|$|E

Haredim and Arab citizens are underrepresented in both the Israel Defense Forces and the workforce, since both groups are exempt from the otherwise compulsory military service, and in many Haredi sects men choose to focus only on religious studies throughout <b>their</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> rely financially on support from co-religionists, the State, etc.|$|E

25|$|One {{cause of}} the change in young women's {{behavior}} was World War I which ended in November 1918. The death of large numbers of young men in the war, and the Spanish flu epidemic which struck in 1918 killing between 20–40 million people, inspired in young people a feeling that life is short and could end at any moment. Therefore, young women wanted to spend their youth enjoying <b>their</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> freedom rather than just staying at home and waiting for a man to marry them.|$|E

Together they are the seventh most frequent cancer and the ninth most frequent cause of death from cancer.

25|$|This is {{the reason}} why {{injuries}} effect an athlete so much, as if any normal person got an injury they could just work around it, but for an athlete, this causes them to be separated from their sport and could mean a loss of identity is established. Normal, everyday people have skills in all aspects of <b>their</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> have support all around them in everything they do; and as athletes are so focused on their sports, when they break out into everyday life {{they are less likely to}} achieve their further meaning in life relating to their career and future life options due to their inability to develop themselves as people in their early lives.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} Lithuanian army entered the town, {{at the end}} of October 1939, a four-day-long anti-Jewish pogrom broke out, in which one person lost <b>their</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> some 200 were wounded. As the Lithuanian {{authorities}} and police only fueled and supported the pogrom (in fact, it has been claimed that Lithuanian authorities and Fascists had instigated the mostly Polish local population to commit hate crimes against the Jews), the Jewish community asked nearby Russian military units for intervention. The violence only stopped after a group of 35 Soviet tanks briefly re-entered the city {{and put an end to}} the pogrom. This prevented further pogroms, that were expected on November 10–11, traditional day of anti-Jewish disturbances in the city.|$|E
