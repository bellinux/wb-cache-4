5|$|Popper {{eventually}} relented, after {{admitting that}} the larger dreadnought <b>type</b> <b>design</b> would also warrant {{the construction of a}} new floating dry dock, which would significantly increase the cost of the project. The design board selected the fifth design, though during refinement of the design, the secondary guns were increased in caliber from 19cm to 24cm. The 30.5cm gun was chosen because the breech of the new 28cm was unreliable. The resulting design was the last pre-dreadnought type of battleship built by the Austro-Hungarian navy.|$|E
25|$|The art {{and craft}} of {{designing}} typefaces is called <b>type</b> <b>design.</b> Designers of typefaces are called type designers and are often employed by type foundries. In digital typography, type designers are sometimes also called font developers or font designers.|$|E

25|$|The {{magazine}} holds {{a particular}} font of type; i.e., a particular <b>type</b> <b>design</b> {{in a particular}} size. If a different size or style was needed, the operator would switch to a different magazine. Many models of the Linotype machine could keep several magazines (as many as four) available at a time. In some of these, the operator could shift to a different magazine by raising or lowering the stack of magazines with a crank. Such machines would not allow mixing fonts within a single line. Others, such as the Model 9, allowed arbitrary mixing of text from up to four magazines within a single line.|$|E
25|$|Sans serif (lit. without serif) designs {{appeared}} relatively {{recently in}} the history of <b>type</b> <b>design.</b> The first, similar to slab serif designs, was shown in 1816 by William Caslon IV. Sans serif fonts are commonly but not exclusively used for display typography such as signage, headings, and other situations demanding legibility above high readability. The text on electronic media offers an exception to print: most web pages and digitized media are laid out in sans serif typefaces because serifs often detract from readability at the low resolution of displays. Many have minimal variation in stroke width, creating the impression of a minimal, simplified design.|$|E

25|$|In {{the metal}} type era, typefaces {{intended}} to be printed small contained ink traps, small indentations at the junctions of strokes that would be filled up with ink spreading out, maintaining the intended appearance of the <b>type</b> <b>design.</b> Without ink traps, the excess ink would blob and ruin the crisp edge. At larger sizes, these ink traps were not necessary, so display faces did not have them. They have also been removed from most digital fonts, as these will normally be viewed on screen or printed through inkjet printing, laser printing, offset lithography, electrophotographic printing or other processes that do not show the ink spread of letterpress. Ink traps have remained common on designs {{intended to be}} printed on low-quality, absorbent paper, especially newsprint and telephone directories.|$|E
25|$|The key patents {{having to}} do with natural gas {{liquefaction}} were in 1915 and the mid-1930s. In 1915 Godfrey Cabot patented a method for storing liquid gases at very low temperatures. It consisted of a Thermos bottle <b>type</b> <b>design</b> which included a cold inner tank within an outer tank; the tanks being separated by insulation. In 1937 Lee Twomey received patents for a process for large scale liquefaction of natural gas. The intention was to store natural gas as a liquid so it could be used for shaving peak energy loads during cold snaps. Because of large volumes it is not practical to store natural gas, as a gas, near atmospheric pressure. However, if it can be liquefied it can be stored in a volume 600 times smaller. This is a practical way to store it but the gas must be stored at −260°F (−162°C).|$|E
25|$|During a brief {{transitional}} period (c. 1950s–1990s), photographic technology, known as phototypesetting, utilized tiny high-resolution images of individual glyphs {{on a film}} strip (in {{the form of a}} film negative, with the letters as clear areas on an opaque black background). A high-intensity light source behind the film strip projected the image of each glyph through an optical system, which focused the desired letter onto the light-sensitive phototypesetting paper at a specific size and position. This photographic typesetting process permitted optical scaling, allowing designers to produce multiple sizes from a single font, although physical constraints on the reproduction system used still required design changes at different sizes; for example, ink traps and spikes to allow for spread of ink encountered in the printing stage. Manually operated photocomposition systems using fonts on filmstrips allowed fine kerning between letters without the physical effort of manual typesetting, and spawned an enlarged <b>type</b> <b>design</b> industry in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Birmingham {{has been}} a centre for the {{printing}} of books {{at least as far}} back as the 1650s, and the area's earliest notable contribution to design was in the field of typography, where it achieved international importance in the 18th Century and played a prominent role in the rise of English influence in a field previously dominated by German, Italian, French and Dutch designers. William Caslon – the designer of the Caslon typefaces and the first significant English typographer – came from nearby Cradley, and almost certainly trained as an engraver in Birmingham in the years before 1716. Most notable however was the Birmingham printer John Baskerville, who designed the Baskerville typeface in 1754. The influence of this <b>type</b> <b>design</b> across Europe would be huge as one of the key milestones in the transition from the old-style typefaces of Fournier to the modern-style type of Bodoni and Didot, and it is a font still widely used today in applications from the logo of New York's Metropolitan Opera to the branding of the Federal Government of Canada. Several of Baskerville's employees went on to become type designers themselves, most notably William Martin, whose Bulmer typeface is also still widely used.|$|E
25|$|Each matrix {{contains}} the letter form {{for a single}} character of a font of type; i.e.,a particular <b>type</b> <b>design</b> in a particular size. The letter form is engraved into {{one side of the}} matrix. For sizes up to 14 points, and in some matrices of size 16 to 24 points, the matrix has two letter forms on it, the normal and auxiliary positions. The normal position has the upright (Roman) form of a given character, and on the auxiliary, the slanted (Italic) form of that character will be used, but this can also be the boldface form or even a different font entirely. The machine operator can select which of the two will be cast by operating the auxiliary rail of the assembler, or, when setting entire lines of italics, by using the flap, which is a piece that can be turned under a portion of the first elevator column. This is the origin of the old typesetting terms upper rail for italic and lower rail for Roman characters. These terms have persisted in phototypesetting technology even though the mechanics of the auxiliary rail do not exist there. The character on a Linotype matrix, when viewed, is not inverted as a letter for conventional movable type would be, and the letter is incised below the surface rather than raised above it. This is because the matrix is not used directly to print onto the paper—rather, it is used as part of a mold from which a metal slug will be cast. The slug has its features reversed: therefore, the matrix does not.|$|E

500|$|In {{the period}} {{during and after}} his closest {{collaboration}} with Johnston, Gill had intermittently worked on sans-serif letter designs, including an almost sans-serif capital design in an alphabet for sign-painters in the 1910s, some [...] "absolutely legible-to-the-last-degree... simple block letters" [...] for Army and Navy Stores in 1925 and some capital letter signs around his home in Capel-y-ffin, Wales. [...] Gill had greatly admired Johnston's work on their Underground project, which he wrote had redeemed the sans-serif from its [...] "nineteenth-century corruption" [...] of extreme boldness. Johnston apparently had not tried to turn the alphabet (as it was then called) that he had designed into a commercial typeface project. [...] He had tried {{to get involved in}} <b>type</b> <b>design</b> before starting work on Johnston Sans, but without success since the industry at the time mostly created designs in-house. Morison similarly respected the design of the Underground system, one of the first and most lasting uses of a standard lettering style as corporate branding (Gill had designed a set of serif letters for W.H. Smith), writing that it [...] "conferred upon [...] a sanction, civic and commercial, as had not been accorded to an alphabet since the time of Charlemagne".|$|E
500|$|Lark {{works on}} Lazarus ten {{or more hours}} per day. He uses photo {{references}} and digital tools {{in the early stages}} of his art, but the layouts and drawing are done with traditional tools. He is more involved with the coloring on Lazarus than any other comic he has illustrated. The logo design was finalized by Trautmann and Lark. Lark initially did all of the lettering and inking for Lazarus, but doing so made it impossible to release new issues on a regular schedule. To give him more time to focus on drawing, some of the smaller tasks like logo and <b>type</b> <b>design</b> were given to other people. Brian Level assisted with inking on issues three through ten, when he was replaced by Tyler Boss. Beginning with issue ten, Jodi Wynne took over the lettering duties and Owen Freeman started creating the cover art. Fake advertisements found on the back covers and many of the computer screens and holographic images in the artwork are created by Trautman. Lark and Rucka often discuss whether to use sound effects in scenes or limit their use. Lark does not want to rely on them to convey information because they may become a [...] "crutch" [...] in place of including important details in the art.|$|E

40|$|Kurkjian and Zelen [1963] {{introduced}} a structural property, which was designated as Property A, of the (block) incidence matrix N {{associated with a}} class of block and direct product experiment designs. Extending this idea, Zelen and Federer [1964] introduced twn structural properties, which were designated as Property A and Property B, associated with experiment designs for two-way elimina-tion of heterogeneity, such as a k-row by b-column rectangular experiment design, and direct product designs. Property A {{is associated with the}} column (block) incidence matrix N and Property B is associated with the row incidence matrix N. These authors made use of the notation and the operations of the calculus for factorial arrangements introduced by Kurkjian and Zelen [1962]. The block designs possessing Property A will be designated as PA type des. igns in this paper. Like-wise, those two-way elimination of heterogeneity designs possessing both Property A and Property B will be designated as PAB <b>type</b> <b>designs.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present res~ts associated with PA and PAB <b>type</b> <b>designs.</b> After a presentation of notation and definitions in the second section, results by the above authors on PA and PAB·type designs are discussed.
