50|$|Edward Welch (1806-1868) was an {{architect}} born in Overton, Flintshire, in North Wales. Having been a pupil of John Oates at Halifax, West Yorkshire, he formed a partnership in 1828 with Joseph Hansom, who later invented the hansom cab and founded The Builder. Together they designed several churches in Yorkshire and Liverpool, and also {{worked on the}} Isle of Anglesey. In 1831 they won the competition to design Birmingham Town Hall. However they were obliged <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>surety</b> for the builders, which led to their bankruptcy and {{the dissolution of the}} partnership in 1834. In 1835 Welch prepared plans for Benjamin Gummow for the partial rebuilding of St Mary's Church, Ruabon.|$|E

Marlene's {{brother-in-law}} Danny (David James) asks John for a business loan; John doesn't have the money but agrees <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>surety</b> if Danny applies for a bank loan.

50|$|Lord Nicholls {{held that}} if the banks ensured that the wife had had {{independent}} advice, {{they could not be}} responsible for that advice being defective. The presumption is rebutted if there is ‘expression of… free will’. The idea of manifest disadvantage for presumed undue influence was rejected but replaced (like the milder tone in Allcard v Skinner) with a transaction that ‘calls for explanation’, or one which ‘is not readily explicable by the relationship between the parties.’ In the ordinary case it is not ‘to be regarded as a transaction which, failing proof to the contrary, is explicable only on the basis that it has been procured by the exercise of undue influence.’ That is because it is nothing out of the ordinary. You are put on inquiry whenever a wife offers <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> as <b>surety</b> for her husband’s, or a company’s debts, where the loan is only going to be for the husband’s purposes. Once on inquiry, the bank must ensure that the spouse has independent advice and a certification that they have formed a truly independent judgment.|$|R

50|$|He was {{fourteen}} {{when his father}} died and had {{to spend the next}} few years gaining control of his lordship. Cahir's foster father was Phelim Reagh MacDavitt (Mac Daibhéid). Cahir was knighted by Lord Mountjoy, and for a time seemed prepared to work amicably with the English authorities: he found a strong supporter in Sir Henry Docwra, the first Governor of Derry. His marriage to Mary Preston, daughter of the 4th Viscount Gormanston, allied him to some of the leading nobles of the Pale, including Thomas FitzWilliam, 1st Viscount FitzWilliam, who in 1608 was required <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>surety</b> for O'Doherty's good behaviour. O'Doherty and Niall Garve O'Donnell, the main rival of Red Hugh O'Donnell for the leadership of the O'Donnell dynasty, were the principal Gaelic chieftains whose support the English Crown hoped to gain through a policy of moderation and for a time this policy seemed to be working.|$|E
50|$|In 1616, Lachlan {{was one of}} six leading islanders (the others being Macleod of Harris, the Captain of Clanranald, Maclean of Duart, Maclean of Coll and Maclaine of Lochbuie) {{who were}} {{required}} by the Privy Council <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>surety</b> for themselves and each other {{to comply with a}} further list of regulations. Among his obligations, he was compelled annually to exhibit to the Council one of his principal kinsmen, was not permitted to maintain more than three gentlemen in his household, was required to keep his residence at Kilmorie in Skye, and was restricted to keeping a single birlinn (or galley); his annual household consumption of wine was also limited to a single tun. Although he was (like the other chiefs) obliged to answer for the good conduct of his clan, Lachlan named five unruly Mackinnons for whom he was not willing to be held responsible.|$|E
5000|$|However, the colonists' food {{supplies}} {{soon began to}} grow short, and in late 1587 the settlers pressed White to return to England [...] "for the better and sooner obtaining of supplies, and other necessaries." [...] Because the colony had been deposited in Roanoke rather than the Chesapeake area, supply ships from England ignorant of Fernandez's change of plan would most likely not land in Roanoke at all, and the settlement might not survive the coming winter. White was reluctant to abandon his colony, anxious that his enemies in England [...] "would not spare to slander him falsely" [...] should he leave, and worried that his [...] "stuff and goods might be spoiled {{and most of it}} pilfered away." [...] Eventually the colonists agreed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>surety</b> for White's belongings and he was prevailed upon to sail, [...] "much against his will," [...] to seek help.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} Denny Fury goes on strike, {{combined}} with unpaid fees for Peter's schooling creates {{a financial crisis}} for Fanny Fury, and causes her to first sell furniture and steal her husband's savings, and then leads her to having to borrow money at an exorbitant rate of interest from the money lender Mrs Ragner, with whom her daughter Maureen already has an account. Joe Kilkey, who is a good Catholic agrees <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>surety</b> for the loan, despite his wife's objection. It appears that Fanny's father, Anthony Mangan, had earlier helped finance Peter's schooling. Anthony Mangan has suffered a stroke and his silent, paralysed body, bound to a chair, dominates the Fury household.The conclusion of the novel has Peter leaving to become a sailor. But just before he joins his ship, two photos of Sheila fall from his pocket, confirming his mother's suspicion, and Fanny Fury violently attacks her son both verbally and physically.|$|E
5000|$|After March 1793, Adrienne met Jean-Baptiste Lacoste, a {{representative}} of the National Convention, at Brioude to whom she wrote: [...] I am informed, Monsieur, that there is a movement afoot to imprison all former nobles, in connection with the treacherous behaviour of Dumouriez. I come now to tell you that though I declared my readiness at all times <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>surety</b> for Monsieur de La Fayette, I most certainly have no intention of doing so for his enemies. Furthermore, whether I live or die is a matter of supreme indifference to Monsieur Dumouriez. You would do far better to leave me undisturbed in my retirement. When I was dragged from it, the only result was to awaken sympathy for me and to revive the memory of a great many injustices. I ask to be left with my children in the only situation I can find tolerable so long as my husband is a prisoner of the enemies of France.|$|E
5000|$|Generally speaking, where {{a person}} seeks {{equitable}} relief (such as rescission) against a third party, then under ordinary equitable principles the third party must have {{had some kind of}} notice of the facts. Otherwise as an innocent third party, it would entitled to act in good faith and rely upon its rights. However, in relation to the doctrine of undue influence the courts have taken a softer line than in other equitable doctrines. Before Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge (No 2) the position in relation to undue influence was more orthodox - it would be necessary to establish that the third party had [...] "constructive notice" [...] of the circumstances that vitiated the consent of the affected person. Instead, the House of Lords said, the preferred language should be whether the third party (i.e. the bank) had been [...] "put on inquiry", and further that [...] "a bank is put on inquiry whenever a wife offers <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>surety</b> for her husband's debts", although not for a joint loan which is understood to be used for their joint purposes.|$|E

50|$|Six months later, he {{was moved}} to Dublin, and then to London, where he arrived in February 1589 to be {{committed}} to the Tower. His wife escaped from Cork a few days later, probably on his instructions. He was examined by the privy council in March and denied all complicity in the continental intrigues of the English Catholic, Sir William Stanley. He was sent back to the Tower, but fifteen months later his wife appeared at court and Sir Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde, volunteered <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>surety</b> for him in the sum of £1000. Since no charges were proved against him, MacCarthy was set at liberty in January 1591 on condition that he not leave England nor travel more than three miles outside London without permission. The Queen's principal secretary, Lord Burghley, backed him, and he obtained protection against his creditors and permission to recover an old fine of £500 due to the Crown from Lord Barry, a neighbour and rival of his in Munster, whom he blamed for his arrest; Barry was later to accuse him of disloyalty as this suit was prosecuted. MacCarthy subsequently obtained permission to return to Ireland.|$|E
