Reliable and valid measures of screener detection performance are important for risk analysis, screener certification and competency assessment, as well as for measuring quality performance and effectiveness of training systems. In many of these applications the hit rate is used in order to measure detection performance. However, measures based on signal detection theory have gained popularity in recent years, for example in the analysis of data from <b>threat</b> <b>image</b> <b>projection</b> (TIP) or computer based training (CBT) systems. In this study, computer-based tests were used to measure detection performance for improvised explosive devices (IEDs). These tests were conducted before and after training with an individually adaptive CBT system. The following measures were calculated: pHit, d', Δm, Az, A' p(c) max. All measures correlated well, but ROC curve analysis suggests that "nonparametric" measures are more valid to measure detection performance for IEDs. More specifically, we found systematic deviations in the ROC curves that are consistent with two-state low threshold theory of R. D. Luce (1963). These results have to be further studied and the question rises if similar results could be obtained for other X-ray screening data. In any case, it is recommended to use A' in addition to d' in practical applications such as certification, <b>threat</b> <b>image</b> <b>projection</b> and CBT rather than the hit rate alone...|$|E

The novel methodology automatically determines a valid 3 D {{location in the}} passenger 3 D CT baggage image into which a fictional threat 3 D image can be inserted without violating the bag content. According to the scan orientation, the passenger bag content and the material of the inserted threat appropriate CT artefacts are generated using a Radon transform {{in order to make}} the insertion realistic. Densely cluttered 3 D CT baggage images are used to validate our method. Experimental results confirm that our method is able to reliably insert threat items in challenging 3 D images without providing any perceptible visual cue to human screeners...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{passenger}} and baggage {{security in}} airport screening system {{is one of}} the most important factors that determine air transport safety and security. It prevents objects and materials that could be used to commit an act of unlawful interference from being placed on board an aircraft. The security screening system consists of x-ray screening devices, walk-through metal detectors and specialised software. However, a key element of the security screening system is the human – the security screener (SSc). The equipment and software helps the screener to find prohibited items, but also detects and records his/her errors. The whole security control point (SCP) can be regarded as a complex socio-technical system. It's effectiveness is dependent, inter alia, on the type of x-ray devices used, a variant of SCP organisation or the technical condition of the equipment, but mainly on the quality of the security screeners’ work. Special attention is paid to the types of errors and their frequency. We analyze the quantitative relationships between types of errors and also between the frequency of errors and the frequency of virtual <b>threat</b> <b>images</b> <b>projection</b> (TIP). This last technology is a kind of intelligent support system and at the same time verifies the screener's work. The study was based on measurements under real conditions at the Katowice-Pyrzowice International Airport. In the framework of this research two basic types of errors made by SSc were identified. The results show that the number of errors is dependent from the frequency of the stimulus, represented by TIP images. As a result, it was possible to determine the recommended frequency of <b>threat</b> <b>images</b> <b>projections.</b> The study is supplemented by a comparison of the screeners’ effectiveness in laboratory conditions against real conditions, while working at the security control point...|$|R

40|$|This {{is a book}} chapter by Gale, Purdy and Wooding in Applied Vision Research Centre, ESRI. All air {{passenger}} baggage is screened at airports by means of 2 -D X-ray imaging which results in a computer display of each luggage item that is then visually searched by an operator (screener) {{for the presence of}} potential threat items (e. g. knifes, guns, improvised explosive devices [IED]). Despite improvements in screener training and available technology (e. g. image enhancement functions, <b>threat</b> <b>image</b> <b>projection,</b> 3 -D X-ray imaging) the performance of screeners is variable which leads to the potential for terrorist threat to aircraft and passengers. A new training scheme to improve performance in baggage screening is under development (EPAULETS: Enhanced Perceptual Anti-terrorism Universal Luggage Examination Training System) and some of the initial human factors issues that underlie variable screener performance are considered...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{aviation}} security, many airports apply <b>Threat</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Projection</b> (TIP) and computer-based X-ray image interpretation training (CBT). One difference between TIP and CBT X-ray images is the algorithm used to merge virtual threat items into X-ray images of passenger bags, resulting in different color nuances. In this study, we tested the influence of merging algorithms on threat object detection performance, reaction time and confidence rating of 12 airport security screeners. The image merging algorithms of the individually adaptive CBT X-Ray Tutor were used. We {{have found that the}} hit rate was higher for TIP images compared to CBT images. Accordingly, the mean of confidence ratings was increased for TIP images. The reaction times tended to be shorter for TIP images. The results of our study indicate that the CBT merging algorithm used in this study is more realistic than the tested TIP image merging algorithm...|$|E
40|$|<b>Threat</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Projection</b> (TIP) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in aviation security. In order to evaluate human security screeners in determining threats, TIP systems project images of realistic threat items into the images of the passenger baggage being scanned. In this proof of concept paper, we propose a 3 D TIP method which can be integrated within new 3 D Computed Tomography (CT) screening systems. In order to make the threat items appear as if they were genuinely located in the scanned bag, appropriate CT metal artefacts are generated in the resulting TIP images according to the scan orientation, the passenger bag content and the material of the inserted threat items. This process is performed in the projection domain using a novel methodology based on the Radon Transform. The obtained results using challenging 3 D CT baggage images are very promising in terms of plausibility and realism. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} {{relatively}} immature field of automated image analysis for X-ray cargo imagery. There is increasing demand for automated analysis methods that {{can assist in}} the inspection and selection of containers, due to the ever-growing volumes of traded cargo and the increasing concerns that customs- and security-related threats are being smuggled across borders by organised crime and terrorist networks. We split the field into the classical pipeline of image preprocessing and image understanding. Preprocessing includes: image manipulation; quality improvement; <b>Threat</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Projection</b> (TIP); and material discrimination and segmentation. Image understanding includes: Automated Threat Detection (ATD); and Automated Contents Verification (ACV). We identify several gaps in the literature {{that need to be}} addressed and propose ideas for future research. Where the current literature is sparse we borrow from the single-view, multi-view, and CT X-ray baggage domains, which have some characteristics in common with X-ray cargo.

40|$|Abstract—Surveillance {{video and}} {{protocols}} are only {{as effective as}} the people who are doing the monitoring. Threats might be overlooked because they are rare. Our experiment tested in the security domain what others have found in the medical domain: that repeating a rare event to make it less rare will make it more likely to be remembered, and hence, {{to be able to be}} reported. Results of our experiment supported the hypothesis that repeating rare events will make them more likely to be detected. We also looked at the relationship between threat detection performance and age, perceived level of attention, and recording procedure time devoted to each threat. Our specific findings concerning these factors led us to suggest actionable protocols to improve security officers ’ threat detection performance in video and live surveillance. Airport, border, urban, and other types of security screeners might benefit from these recommendations.

40|$|Due {{to severe}} {{terrorist}} attacks in recent years, aviation security issues have moved into the focus of politicians {{as well as the}} general public. Effective screening of passenger bags using state-of-the-art X-ray screening systems is essential to prevent terrorist attacks. The performance of the screening process depends critically on the security personnel, because they decide whether bags are OK or whether they might contain a prohibited item. Screening X-ray images of passenger bags for dangerous and prohibited items effectively and efficiently is a demanding object recognition task. Effectiveness of computer-based training (CBT) on X-ray detection performance was assessed using computer-based tests and on the job performance measures using <b>threat</b> <b>image</b> <b>projection</b> (TIP). It was found that adaptive CBT is a powerful tool to increase detection performance and efficiency of screeners in X-ray image interpretation. Moreover, the results of training could be generalized to the real life situation as shown in the increased detection performance in TIP not only for trained items, but also for new (untrained) items. These results illustrate that CBT is a very useful tool to increase airport security from a human factors perspective...|$|E

40|$|<b>Threat</b> <b>image</b> <b>projection</b> (TIP) is a {{technology}} of current x-ray machines that allows exposing screeners to artificial but realistic x-ray images during the routine baggage x-ray screening operation. If a screener does not detect a TIP within a specified amount of time, a feedback message appears indicating that a projected image was missed. Feedback messages are also shown when a TIP image is detected {{or in the}} case of a non-TIP alarm, i. e. when the screener indicated that there was threat but in fact no TIP was shown. TIP data is an interesting source for quality control, risk analysis and assessment of individual screener performance. In two studies we examined the conditions for using TIP data for the latter purpose. Our results strongly suggest using aggregated data in order to have a large enough data sample as the basis for statistical analysis. Second, an appropriate TIP library containing a large number of threat items, which are representative for the prohibited items to be detected is recommended. Fu rthermore, consideration should be given to image-based factors such as general threat item difficulty, viewpoint difficulty, superposition and bag complexity. Different methods to cope with these issues are discussed in order to achieve reliable, valid and standardized measurements of individual screener performance using TIP...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of aviation security {{has increased dramatically}} {{at the beginning of}} this century. One of the most important tasks is the visual inspection of passenger bags using x-ray machines. In this study, we investigated the role of image based factors on human detection of prohibited items in x-ray images. Schwaninger, Hardmeier, and Hofer (2004, 2005) have identified three image based factors: View Difficulty, Superposition and Bag Complexity. This article consists of 4 experiments which lead to the development of a statistical model that is able to predict image difficulty based on these image based factors. Experiment 1 is a replication of earlier findings confirming the {{relevance of}} image based factors as defined by Schwaninger et al. (2005) on x-ray detection performance. In Experiment 2, we found significant correlations between human ratings of image based factors and human detection performance. In Experiment 3, we introduced our image measurements and found significant correlations between them a nd human detection performance. Moreover, significant correlations were found between our image measurements and corresponding human ratings, indicating high perceptual plausibility. In Experiment 4, it was shown using multiple linear regression analysis that our image measurements can predict human performance as well as human ratings can.
