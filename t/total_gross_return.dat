40|$|This {{research}} was aimed {{to determine the}} net returns of three main crops, i. e. wheat, rice and maize in District Malakand of NWFP during the year 2000. The cropped area of sampled respondents was 270 acres each in Kharif and Rabi season. Wheat was being grown on 87 % of the cropped area during Rabi season where as in Kharif, because of more yield and cash, rice was sown on 75 % area and maize on 9 % area. From a total cost of 6095, 4073 and 4104 rupees per acre for rice, maize and wheat crops, respectively, {{with the exception of}} 12 % for rice, 2 % for maize and 1 % for wheat, the rest was spent on crop rising. For rice crop, 10 and 2 % of the total cost was found on nursery raising and marketing, respectively. The <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>returns</b> of rice, maize and wheat were 10932, 7745 and 8613 rupees, respectively. The net return is the subtraction of total cost per acre from the <b>gross</b> <b>returns</b> per acre. So the net returns of rice, maize and wheat were 4837, 3672 and 4509 rupees per acre, respectively. The study as a whole shows that rice gives more net return than wheat and maize in the study area...|$|R
40|$|There are two listed {{property}} investment {{vehicles on}} the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX), namely Listed Property Trusts (LPTs) and Listed Property Investment Companies (LPICs). Historically the proportion of New Zealand LPTs to LPICs has varied over the years due to failures and new listings. More recently a new trend has emerged that has impacted on these proportions, {{which has been the}} corporatisation of some of the LPTs. As a result the number of Trusts on the stock exchange (NZX) reduced significantly in 2010 and two other trusts have also been considered following this trend. From the literature {{it can be seen that}} there is a lack of empirical evidence that can assist stakeholders in justifying either the immense costs involved in these conversions or the decision not to convert. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine whether the LPTs performed differently to the LPICs, in order to justify the choice of adopting a company structure and in the case of conversions to justify the immense costs involved. The objectives of the study were: (1) to reveal the nature and significance of NZ’s LPVs in the NZ investment market, (2) to explore the performance characteristics NZ’s LPVs, (3) to reveal any reward-to-risk benefits for investors by investing in either LPTs or LPICs, and (4) to reveal any diversification benefits for investors by investing in either LPTs or LPICs. Evidence The study developed three new separate <b>gross</b> (<b>total)</b> <b>return</b> series indices: the overall LPV sector index, the LPT sub-sector index, and the LPIC sub-sector index. These new indices were created so that the performance characteristics of these indirect property vehicles could be examined over the study period 1994 :Q 1 to 2011 :Q 3. The effect of different market conditions on the performance of these vehicles was also assessed by analysing the performance of the LPTs and the LPICs over specified sub-periods: (1) the pre-Asian crisis, (2) the Asian crisis to pre-Global Financial Crisis, and (3) the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and post-Global Financial Crisis. Data to develop the three new indices was sourced from NZX database. Existing <b>gross</b> (<b>total)</b> <b>return</b> indices for stocks (NZX All <b>Gross</b> (<b>Total</b> <b>Return)</b> Index) and Government bonds (ANZ All Government Bond (Gross) Index) were also sourced from the NZX database and for direct property (All Property <b>Total</b> <b>Return</b> (<b>Gross)</b> Index) was sourced from the Property Council of New Zealand/Investment Property Databank (PCNZ/IPD). The risk free rate of return to compute the Sharpe measure was sourced from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) database. The results showed that LPTs and LPICs have performed differently over the seventeen year study period and the sub-periods, which suggests there is a relationship between the ownership structure and performance characteristics of New Zealand’s Listed Property Vehicles (LPVs). Historically it was found, that overall the LPICs have offered investors’ superior risk-reduction and reward-to-risk benefits compare to the LPTs. The findings, in this study, offer empirical support to the argument presented in previous studies (Korda Mentha, 2010; Grant Samuel, 2010, 2011), that a company structure is the optimal ownership structure to improve performance in a New Zealand context. The practical implications of these findings include assisting investors’ by providing empirical evidence to justify their support of future conversions and also assisting stakeholders who are deciding which ownership structure to adopt when setting up a listed property vehicle. From a theoretical viewpoint these findings also suggest that the LPICs and LPTs can be treated as separate asset classes and that further segmentation studies of the NZX Property Sector could be undertaken to better understand the nature of these collective investment vehicles...|$|R

40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the profitability of}} ‘egusi ’ melon (Citrullus lanatus Thunb. Mansf) under sole and intercropping systems in Okehi Local Government Area (LGA) of Kogi State. Primary data {{were used for the}} investigation. The primary data were obtained through the use of questionnaire in Okehi LGA. 240 farmers were purposively sampled and 120 were randomly selected for the study. Descriptive statistics and net farm income analysis were employed in the analysis of the data. The result showed that the average net farm income per hectare for sole melon, melon in 2, 3, and 4 crops mixture were N 1, 328. 69, N 915. 77, N 887. 27 and N 414. 57 respectively. The <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>return</b> per hectare for melon (from the pooled data) averaged N 12. 638. 61 while the total cost of production was N 8, 838. 74 on the average.

Based on the findings, it was recommended that farmers in the area should continue to focus more attention on sole melon production. Also the Agricultural Development Projects (ADP) in the state should intensify melon production awareness and mobilize the local industries for ‘egusi ’ melon processing and extraction of the oil for better utilization in the area...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Olive {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} worldwide trees that produces useful products having high nutritional values. It is widely grown in many parts of world. The cost of olives hand picking is estimated to be about two-thirds of the <b>total</b> <b>gross</b> <b>return</b> of olive production. Therefore, various types of olive harvesting machineries were developed in the world. Guilan Province of Iran {{is one of the}} leading regions for olives production in Iran. At the present time, almost all olives produced in Guilan province of Iran are manually harvested. Review of the reports showed that no research was performed to study the factors affecting the development of mechanized olive picking in Guilan Province, Iran. Due to the complexity of using the olive harvest machineries, identifying the factors affecting of their application is essential. Therefore, a Delphi study were conducted to identify and analysis the drivers and barriers for mechanized olive harvest in Guilan province, Iran. Materials and Methods This research was conducted using the Delphi technique in Guilan Province, Northern Iran. Delphi technique is a structured process to gather and classify the knowledge of a group of experts. Through consultation with professors and researchers in related institutions, 22 experts from the subsidiary offices of agricultural organization of Guilan Province were selected for the study. In the first round of the study, the participants were asked to answer to two open questions about the driving factors and barriers of mechanical olive harvest in Guilan Province. Nineteen items were found as driving factors and seventeen as barriers for developing the mechanical olive harvesting in Guilan Province. In the second phase of the study, the respondents were asked to answer to the all items written in the form of a five-level Likert scale, and finally, experts of panel were asked to answer to the top 10 items of driving factors and barriers in percent form. The results were analyzed using SPSS computer software and arranged in various tables.
