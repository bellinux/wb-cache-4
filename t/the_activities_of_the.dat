40|$|The {{properties}} and subcellular distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzymes {{involved with the}} synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters were investigated in skin of normal and essential fatty acid-deficient rats. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cholesterol-esterifying enzyme(s) {{is associated with the}} 12000 g and 105000 g particulate fractions. <b>The</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzyme reaction on ATP and CoA suggests that <b>the</b> esterification <b>of</b> cholesterol by rat skin is mediated by a fatty acyl-CoA–cholesterol acyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. –). On the other hand, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cholesteryl ester hydrolase (EC 3. 1. 1. 13) is localized in the 105000 g supernatant fraction. Although <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cholesterol-esterifying enzyme(s) was elevated in skin preparations from essential fatty acid-deficient rats, <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrolase was significantly decreased. These observations may explain in part <b>the</b> elevated concentrations <b>of</b> sterol esters in <b>the</b> skin <b>of</b> these animals. Prostaglandin E 2 at low concentrations exerted marked inhibitory effect on <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cholesterol-esterifying enzyme(s), whereas no effect was observed on <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrolase at similar concentrations. However, at high concentrations prostaglandin E 2 exerted moderate stimulatory effect on <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrolase. These results suggest a possible physiological role of this substance in regulating <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> sterol esters in this tissue...|$|R
