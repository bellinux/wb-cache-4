Healthier birds generally result in greater production numbers, which benefits the producer in terms of profit, and the consumer in relation to cost.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a <b>yeast</b> <b>fermentation</b> product on egg quality and laying hen performance.

However, spontaneous fermentation strengthens local characteristics of wine and offers opportunities for technological innovation. In the 1999 vintage, spontaneous and inoculated fermentations of Zametovka (Vitis vinifera) grape must were studied. Zametovka is the main red variety in production of traditional Slovene red blend wine, Cvicek. The diversity of yeast species and strains in both of the investigated fermentations was determined by molecular and traditional identification methods. The outset of alcoholic <b>fermentation,</b> <b>yeast</b> growth kinetics, and yeast population dynamics presents the main differences between the examined <b>fermentations.</b> <b>Yeast</b> population diversity was higher in the spontaneous process. Dominant yeast isolates from spontaneous fermentation were identified as Candida stellata, Hanseniaspora uvarum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae; whereas Saccharomyces bayanus, Pichia kluyveri, Pichia membranifaciens and Torulaspora delbrueckiim were found less frequently. Dominant species in the inoculated fermentation was Saccharomyces cerevisiae; other species found in smaller numbers were Candida stellata, Hanseniaspora uvarum and Debaryomyces hansenii var. hansenii. Using PFGE, {{we were able to}} distinguish among 15 different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and three different Saccharomyces bayanus strains isolated from spontaneous fermentation, whereas, in the case of inoculated fermentation, only two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were found.

40|$|Abstract Background Cellulose, {{which is}} the most {{abundant}} renewable biomass on earth, is a potential bio-resource of alternative energy. The hydrolysis of plant polysaccharides is catalyzed by microbial cellulases, including endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanases, cellobiohydrolases, cellodextrinases, and β-glucosidases. Converting cellobiose by β-glucosidases is the key factor for reducing cellobiose inhibition and enhancing the efficiency of cellulolytic enzymes for cellulosic ethanol production. Results In this study, a cDNA encoding β-glucosidase was isolated from the buffalo rumen fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum W 5 and is named NpaBGS. It has a length of 2, 331 bp with an open reading frame coding for a protein of 776 amino acid residues, corresponding to a theoretical molecular mass of 85. 1 kDa and isoelectric point of 4. 4. Two GH 3 catalytic domains were found at the N and C terminals of NpaBGS by sequence analysis. The cDNA was expressed in Pichia pastoris and after protein purification, the enzyme displayed a specific activity of 34. 5 U/mg against cellobiose as the substrate. Enzymatic assays showed that NpaBGS was active on short cello-oligosaccharides from various substrates. A weak activity in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) digestion indicated that the enzyme might also have the function of an endoglucanase. The optimal activity was detected at 40 °C and pH 5 [*]~[*] 6, showing that the enzyme prefers a weak acid condition. Moreover, its activity could be enhanced at 50 °C by adding Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + ions. Interestingly, in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) experiments using Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY 4741 or Kluyveromyces marxianus KY 3 as the <b>fermentation</b> <b>yeast,</b> NpaBGS showed advantages in cell growth, glucose production, and ethanol production over the commercial enzyme Novo 188. Moreover, we showed that the KY 3 strain engineered with the NpaNGS gene can utilize 2 % dry napiergrass as the sole carbon source to produce 3. 32 mg/ml ethanol when Celluclast 1. 5 L was added to the SSF system. Conclusion Our characterizations of the novel β-glucosidase NpaBGS revealed that it has a preference of weak acidity for optimal <b>yeast</b> <b>fermentation</b> and an optimal temperature of ~ 40 °C. Since NpaBGS performs better than Novo 188 under the living conditions of <b>fermentation</b> <b>yeasts,</b> {{it has the potential to}} be a suitable enzyme for SSF. </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{consumption}} of ethanol {{as an alternative}} fuel has been steadily rising. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used in industrial-scale ethanol production due to several advantages it offers, including a highly efficient ethanol fermentation ability and a relatively high tolerance to fermentation stress (Boulton and Quain 2006). Generally, the maximum ethanol yields of a conventional <b>yeast</b> <b>fermentation</b> process are attained at 25 – 30  °C, which is the optimal temperature for yeast growth (Hohmann and Mager 2003). However, ethanol fermentation at high temperature {{has a number of}} benefits such as reducing cooling costs, preventing bacterial contamination, and enabling simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (Abdel-Banat et al. 2010). During ethanol <b>fermentation,</b> <b>yeast</b> cells simultaneously encounter several stresses, e.g. osmotic, ethanol, and oxidative stresses (Gibson et al. 2007). To achieve the efficient ethanol fermentation at high temperature, yeast strain that tolerates to not only heat stress but also other stresses present during fermentation is therefore indispensable. Moreover, an understanding of cellular mechanisms required for protecting yeast cells {{from a wide range of}} physical and chemical stressors is essential for the improvement of multi-stress tolerance in yeast.|$|R

Inbicon has found a range of concentration at which the fermentation inhibitors only inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria, but have relatively no effect on fermentative yeast. By determining the optimal levels of <b>fermentation</b> inhibitors, <b>yeast</b> <b>fermentation</b> can be conducted under non-sterile conditions.
