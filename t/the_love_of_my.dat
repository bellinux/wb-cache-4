500|$|Recording {{began in}} August 1995 in New York City's Electric Lady Studios, where Weezer had {{recorded}} their debut album, {{but the new}} sessions were not productive. Further sessions were held in September and October, and Weezer recorded versions of [...] "Blast Off!", [...] "Longtime Sunshine", [...] "I Just Threw Out <b>the</b> <b>Love</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Dreams", [...] "Tired of Sex" [...] and [...] "Getchoo". Weezer had not yet abandoned Songs from the Black Hole, but the songs were recorded, according to Koch, with [...] "no story, no theatrics, no characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Weezer's {{second album}} became Pinkerton, {{released}} on 24 September 1996. It includes [...] "Tired of Sex", [...] "Getchoo" [...] and [...] "No Other One": songs written before Songs from the Black Hole was conceived, rewritten {{to fit the}} Black Hole concept, and finally rewritten again for Pinkerton. In June 1996, after Pinkertons completion, Weezer recorded the Songs from the Black Hole tracks [...] "I Just Threw Out <b>the</b> <b>Love</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Dreams" [...] (with Rachel Haden on vocals) and [...] "Devotion" [...] as B-sides for the singles [...] "El Scorcho" [...] and [...] "The Good Life" [...] respectively.|$|E

Many of Cuomo's demos were eventually released across the compilation albums [...] (2007), [...] (2008) and [...] (2011), {{and on the}} 2010 [...] "deluxe" [...] reissue of Pinkerton. Lyrics and sheet music were included with The Pinkerton Diaries, a book collecting Cuomo's writings from the era. In 2007, Rolling Stone included Songs from the Black Hole on its list of music's lost [...] "mythical masterpieces".|$|E
500|$|Although the {{fighting}} ceased {{and the two}} commands of troops had cleared the palace, the mob was still everywhere outside. The rank and file of both the Flanders Regiment and another regular unit present, the Montmorency Dragoons, now appeared unwilling to act against the people. Lafayette, who had earned the court's indebtedness, convinced the king to address the crowd. When the two men stepped out on a balcony an unexpected cry went up: [...] "Vive le Roi!" [...] The relieved king briefly conveyed his willingness to return to Paris, acceding [...] "to <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> good and faithful subjects". As the crowd cheered, Lafayette stoked their joy by dramatically pinning a tricolor cockade to the hat of the king's nearest bodyguard.|$|E
500|$|After {{confirming}} that Klein was directing her video, Gaga {{explained that she}} [...] "doesn't know what [...] {{going to look like}} until it's finished", and commented that [...] " [...] a very good friend of mine and I love him so much, [...] I have so much respect for him. And we've been excited to collaborate and have a fashion photographer tell us a story, the story of my music through his lens and this idea of fashion and lifestyle." [...] Gaga explained that Klein understood her [...] "I am what I wear" [...] lifestyle, making him a suitable director for the video. She added, [...] "It's all about where I'm from and love of theater and love of music and love of the lie in art, and Steven really knows and understands that, [...] So we're making a beautiful video, and I'm so excited." [...] In May 2010, Gaga told The Times about the concept of the video: [...] " [...] purity of my friendships with my gay friends, and how I've been unable to find that with a straight man in my life. It's a celebration and an admiration of gay love—it confesses my envy of the courage and bravery they require to be together. In the video I'm pining for <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> gay friends—but they just don't want me to be with them." ...|$|E

The {{relationship}} ended shortly before James met the woman he would later marry, actress Betty Grable. Forrest wrote, [...] "I've had three marriages and I never married Harry, but he was <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life. Let's face it, I still carry a torch for the so-and-so." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Christmas 1991, he {{published}} a letter urging his parishioners to shun the Camorra. The letter entitled [...] "For <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> people I will not stay silent", {{called on the}} church to resist the Camorra's rule, which he called [...] "a form of terrorism". He also denounced the Casalesi clans' business practices: [...] "Extortion that has left our region with no potential for development; kickbacks of 20 per cent on construction projects; illegal drug trafficking, which has created gangs of marginalised youth and unskilled workers at the beck and call of criminal organisations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Act Won", {{contains}} {{an excerpt from}} the Spike Lee film, Mo' Better Blues. The excerpt is from a scene where Denzel Washington and Wesley Snipes are discussing the current state of African American music (or culture in general) after a gig. The track [...] "Act Too (<b>The</b> <b>Love</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Life)", originally an interlude that evolved into a full song, features Common, whose verse is a continuation of his song [...] "I Used to Love H.E.R.", off his 1994 album Resurrection, in which Common speaks of hip hop as a woman. However, Questlove has stated that this is not [...] "I used to love H.E.R. (the daughter), rather it is a [...] "reflection on the evolution of hip hop, through our eyes." [...] Beanie Sigel made his recording debut on the track [...] "Adrenaline!", after tagging along to a weekly jam session held by the group in Philadelphia. Eve (at the time, signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath label, and known as Eve of Destruction) also made her debut on Things Fall Apart, on the track, [...] "You Got Me".|$|E

2500|$|When Homer arrives {{home to find}} Ned {{waiting for}} him, Homer {{declares}} that Ned will never take him alive. A long Parkour chase ensues, ending with the two on a beam suspended high over the ground. Homer wails that he loved Ned, but Ned counters that Homer mostly hated him. Homer scoffs {{that it was only}} because Ned holds onto his resentments. Homer jumps onto another beam, but Ned fails to land on it, gripping onto the edge of the beam. He begs Homer for help, which causes Homer to flash back to all the good times he and Ned had together; Homer finally helps Ned, but ends up tumbling {{over the edge of the}} beam himself. Shrieking, he and Ned end up landing in a pool of wet cement– which unfortunately sets before they can get out. Chief Wiggum arrives to put Homer away, but in jail, Homer has been sentenced to a short stay. On the last night of his sentence, he receives a cake from Marge to [...] "help get him through his sentence". He opens it to find a regular pink and white frosted sheet cake that simply says [...] "to <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life".

He was at the 53rd Academy Awards with Diana Ross, and Shields walked up and introduced herself; then at the after-party she asked him to dance with her. They exchanged numbers, and he [...] "was up all night, singing, spinning around my room, just so happy." [...] He also said, “We had one encounter when she got real intimate and I chickened out.

60|$|But I am {{pretty sure}} that I began right, and that if I had always kept the lofty level which I struck at the outset I {{should have the right}} to use {{authority}} in these reminiscences without a bad conscience.

I have known such passions at every period <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life, but it is mainly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loves</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> youth that I shall write, and I shall write all the more frankly because my own youth now seems to me rather more alien than that of any other person.|$|R

500|$|Yankovic {{entered the}} studio to record [...] "Jurassic Park" [...] on July 16, 1993. Backing Yankovic were Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. [...] "MacArthur Park" [...] {{contained}} an actual orchestra complete with a strings section. [...] "Jurassic Park", however, features synth strings courtesy of keyboardist Brad Buxer, who programmed the section himself. Intermixed during the interlude are various dinosaur sound effects courtesy of Sandy Berman; Berman had previously created dinosaur yells for a major theme park attraction, and loaned Yankovic the sound effects. At 3:53 in length, the song is considerably shorter than the original, which clocks in at 7:21. Largely, {{this is due to}} the fact that the middle section featured in the original—the so called [...] "After <b>the</b> <b>Loves</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Life" [...] section—is omitted from Yankovic's parody.|$|R
