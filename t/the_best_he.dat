5|$|Before Ladas ran as a three-year-old, Mat Dawson, who {{had been}} {{training}} horses, including more than twenty classic winners since the 1850s, {{was reported to have}} called Ladas <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> had ever trained. Later that season he ranked him second, slightly behind St. Simon. Henry Chaplin, the owner of Hermit, called Ladas the finest horse he had seen.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{had shown}} great {{ability as a}} {{collector}} and had done <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could with the reference books he had on ship. It was now the province of recognised expert specialists to establish which specimens were unknown, and make their considered taxonomic decisions on defining and naming new species.|$|E
5|$|Just as in Q1, the two Mercedes cars set {{the fastest}} times in Q2 as well. Verstappen {{was unable to}} {{continue}} and therefore only four of the running cars were to be eliminated. Those were Hülkenberg, the second Toro Rosso of Sainz, Pastor Maldonado and Fernando Alonso, who said his lap was likely <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> had ever driven at the circuit.|$|E

5|$|In late 1970, Vicki Cole {{indicated}} {{in an interview}} Nixon was doing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could. During the 1972 campaign, Cole served as Ohio chair of a future voters organization for the Nixon campaign. She then left politics, devoting her spare time to training and showing horses. In 1974, Cole {{declined to comment on}} the resignation of President Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she believed his resignation was necessary.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test, England {{amassed a}} big first innings score and looked likely to win, but Stan McCabe made 232 for Australia, a {{performance}} Bradman rated as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> had ever seen. With Australia forced to follow-on, Bradman fought hard to ensure McCabe's effort {{was not in}} vain, and he secured the draw with 144 not out. It was the slowest Test hundred of his career and he played a similar innings of 102 not {{out in the next}} Test as Australia struggled to another draw. Rain completely washed out the Third Test at Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|It {{was four}} years before Selänne {{returned}} to international play; he appeared in the 1996 World Championship and the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and averaged over one point per game in both tournaments as Finland finished fifth each time. At the 1998 Winter Olympics, Selänne finished with ten points in five games. He was the tournament's leading scorer on a Finnish team that he described in 2003 as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> ever played on and {{the best in the}} tournament, but lost the semifinal, 7–4 to Russia. He suffered an abdominal muscle injury that prevented him from playing in the third place game, which Finland won 3–2 over Canada; Selänne and his teammates ended the tournament as the bronze medal winners.|$|E

Hartsburg's favorite hobby is fishing.|$|R
5|$|The 1939–40 {{season was}} Bradman's most {{productive}} ever for SA: 1,448runs {{at an average}} of 144.8. He made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that he rated <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> ever played in the Sheffield Shield, as he tamed Bill O'Reilly {{at the height of his}} form. However, it was the end of an era. The outbreak of World War Two led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition.|$|E
5|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of {{paraplegic}} (spinal cord and polio) athletes in Australia, particularly Western Australia. The spectator attendance amazed leading officials such as Dr Ludwig Guttmann, {{the founder of the}} Stoke Mandeville Games. He commented that the attendance was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> had seen at any paraplegic sports event in the world. The Games highlighted the versatility of the athletes with many winning medals in different sports. It was noted that generally the standard of performance was below that of the Stoke Mandeville Games; however there were several outstanding performers including Vic Renalson, Bill Mather-Brown, Lorraine Dodd, M. Bazeley, Lynne Gilchrist and R. Scott who broke records in their events. A film of the Games was made.|$|E
5|$|By 02:15 on 30 April one CH-46 and one CH-53 were {{landing at}} the Embassy every 10 minutes. At this time, the Embassy {{indicated}} that another 19 lifts would complete the evacuation. At that time Major Kean {{estimated that there}} were still some 850 non-American evacuees and 225 Americans (including the Marines), and Ambassador Martin told Major Kean to do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could. At 03:00 Ambassador Martin ordered Major Kean to move all the remaining evacuees {{into the parking lot}} LZ which was the Marines' final perimeter. At 03:27 President Gerald Ford ordered that no more than 19 additional lifts would be allowed to complete the evacuation. At 04:30 with the 19 lift limit already exceeded, Major Kean went to the rooftop LZ and spoke over a helicopter radio with General Carey who advised that President Ford had ordered that the airlift be limited to US personnel. Major Kean was then ordered to withdraw his men into the Chancery building and withdraw to the rooftop LZ for evacuation.|$|E

5|$|In 1929–30, ill-health {{restricted}} Jackson to {{just five}} first-class matches and five innings for Balmain. Despite his health, Jackson {{had a successful}} season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand. He {{was seen as an}} automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches. His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E
5|$|Bragg {{retained}} his position, relieving or reassigning {{the generals}} who had testified against him, and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units {{that he brought}} with him from Virginia. Despite the dysfunctional command climate under Bragg, and the lack of support from the War Department and President Davis concerning Bragg's removal, Longstreet did <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could to continue to seek options in the Chattanooga Campaign. While Bragg resigned himself and his army to the siege of the Union Army of the Cumberland in Chattanooga, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a lifting of the siege by Grant. He knew this Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport, Alabama, where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in Rome, Georgia, to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis, but it was disapproved by Bragg, who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg's arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by the Union Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on Bragg's part, but also because the War Department intended for Longstreet's men to return to Lee's army and this movement was in that direction.|$|E

25|$|After {{retiring}} from playing, López remained active by coaching and instructing youth players in Caracas.

Although he had no opportunity to play at Major League Baseball, he simply took <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could find and took advantage of it. He permanently adjusted and readjusted his hitting style and pitching mechanics, came back from many injuries, but the Big Boy of Barlovento (el Muchachote de Barlovento in Spanish) persevered and won recognition as pitcher and slugger in all leagues where he played.|$|E

25|$|Simons {{had grown}} tired of small town life in Kansas in any event and {{was ready for a}} new challenge. Newspaper {{publisher}} Victor Berger, now America's first socialist Congressman, had previously promised Simons a job on his English-language daily, the Milwaukee Leader, if he had ever needed a position. In June 1913, Simons decided to take Berger up on the offer, accepting the position without great enthusiasm but feeling as though it was for the time being <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could do. Algie and May Simons would be coming home to Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|The Appomattox Campaign was {{an example}} of masterful, {{relentless}} pursuit and maneuver by Grant and Sheridan, skills that had been in short supply by previous generals, such as Meade after Gettysburg and McClellan after Antietam. Lee did <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could under the circumstances, but his supplies, soldiers, and luck finally ran out. The surrender of Lee represented the loss of only one of the Confederate field armies, but it was a psychological blow from which the South did not recover. With no chance remaining for eventual victory, all of the remaining armies capitulated by June 1865.|$|E
25|$|In Hungary, he {{took his}} only pole {{position}} of the season (on a short fuel load), and led for the first stint of the race until his retirement, when his pit-crew fitted a wheel incorrectly. After replacing the wheel, Alonso retired with a fuel pump problem. In Valencia, he finished in sixth place, describing it was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could do, after his team appealed successfully over a one-race ban suspended for the race after the pit-stop incident in Hungary. However, his fastest race lap was slower than new teammate Romain Grosjean, replacing the sacked Piquet, despite Grosjean spending most of the race towards the back.|$|E
