25|$|After {{singing the}} opening kriti, usually, the {{performer}} sings the kalpanaswaram of the raga to the beat. The performer must improvise {{a string of}} swaras in any octave {{according to the rules}} of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly, joining the swaras with a phrase selected from the kriti. The violin performs these alternately with the main performer. In very long strings of swara, the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>stick</b> to the raga, have no awkward pauses or lapses in the beat of the song, and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can follow.|$|E
25|$|All catfish, except {{members of}} Malapteruridae (electric catfish), possess a strong, hollow, bony leading spine-like ray on their dorsal and {{pectoral}} fins. As a defense, these spines may be locked into place so that <b>they</b> <b>stick</b> outwards, which can inflict severe wounds. In several species catfish can use these fin rays {{to deliver a}} stinging protein if the fish is irritated. This venom is produced by glandular cells in the epidermal tissue covering the spines. In {{members of the family}} Plotosidae, and of the genus Heteropneustes, this protein is so strong it may hospitalize humans who are unfortunate enough to receive a sting; in Plotosus lineatus, the stings may result in death.|$|E

I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so <b>they</b> <b>stick</b> 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{government}} response has been channeled through opposition prime minister Monja Roindefo, who denied that the events leading to Rajoelina's gaining of the presidency was a coup, but rather a [...] "direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions", and called on the European Union to reconsider its reaction to the events.

2500|$|Santos, {{alongside}} de Guzman, {{appeared in}} two more films, {{the first film}} was a romantic comedy My Pledge of Love. She portrayed a spunky traveller {{at the center of}} a battle between three different guys (played by de Guzman, Bobby Andrews and Onemig Bondoc). Next up was a second movie Kasal-kasalan... Sakalan that starred Santos as good-hearted but hapless bride-to-be in the midst of premarital discourse. Both films were critical and commercial failures. Her performances were received poorly, with Ana Pingol of YES! Magazine saying [...] "there is always the danger of lukewarm—or worse, negative reception from the public who once adored you. The public can be pretty conservative; <b>they</b> <b>stick</b> to what is familiar [...] to what they like or has changed into something the public has not taken to—yet".|$|E
2500|$|A {{few basic}} items of {{equipment}} {{are needed to}} collect stamps. Stamp tongs help to handle stamps safely, a magnifying glass helps in viewing fine details and an album is a convenient way to store stamps. The stamps need to {{be attached to the}} pages of the album in some way and stamp hinges are a cheap and simple way to do this. [...] Hinging stamps can damage them, thus reducing their value; today many collectors prefer more expensive hingeless mounts. Issued in various sizes, these are clear chemically neutral thin plastic holders that open to receive stamps and are gummed on the back so that <b>they</b> <b>stick</b> to album pages. [...] Another alternative is a stockbook where the stamps drop into clear pockets without the need for a mount. Stamps should be stored away from light, heat and moisture or they will be damaged.|$|E

In microgravity odors quickly permeate the environment, and NASA found in a test that the smell of cream sherry triggered the gag reflex.

These {{may be part of}} the asthenization syndrome reported by cosmonauts living in space {{over an extended period of}} time, but regarded as anecdotal by astronauts. Fatigue, listlessness, and psychosomatic worries are also part of the syndrome.

2500|$|La Russa {{noted that}} losing clubs risk their closer being under-worked, if <b>they</b> <b>stick</b> to the {{strategy}} of saving them for ninth inning situations where the team is ahead. An instance of this was Philadelphia Phillies manager Charlie Manuel, who did not call upon closer Jonathan Papelbon in high leverage situations during the 2012 season, including six games where the score was tied during the late innings, which may have cost the team seven wins by midseason. Jonah Keri suggested [...] "fear of using pitchers in anything but the most predictable circumstances, or simple inertia, closers get used far more often in easy-to-manage, up-two, bases-empty, ninth-inning situations {{than they do in}} tie games with runners on and the game actually on the line" [...] and said of Papelbon [...] "unless the Phillies start using him in situations where he’s actually needed, rather than almost exclusively in spots that nearly any pitcher with a pulse can handle successfully 85–90 percent of the time, Papelbon will remain the $200,000 Aston Martin that never leaves the garage".|$|E
2500|$|The Government of the Soviet Union {{suggested}} that the Government of the Republic of Estonia conclude a mutual assistance treaty between the two countries. The pressure from Estonian working people forced the Estonian government to accept this suggestion. On September 28, 1939, the Pact of Mutual Assistance was signed which allowed the USSR to station {{a limited number of}} Red Army units in Estonia. Economic difficulties, dissatisfaction with the Estonian government policies 'that had sabotaged fulfillment of the Pact and the Estonian government' and political orientation towards Nazi Germany led to a revolutionary situation on June 16, 1940. A note from the Soviet government to the Estonian Government {{suggested that}} <b>they</b> <b>stick</b> strictly to the Pact of Mutual Assistance. To guarantee fulfillment of the Pact additional military units entered Estonia, welcomed by the Estonian workers who demanded the resignation of the Estonian government. On June 21 under the leadership of the Estonian Communist Party political demonstrations by workers were held in Tallinn, Tartu, Narva and other cities. On the same day the fascist government was overthrown, and the People's government led by Johannes Vares was formed. On July 14–15, 1940 elections for the Riigikogu the Estonian Parliament were held. The [...] "Working People’s Union", created by an initiative of the Estonian Communist Party received with 84.1% electorate participation 92.8% of the votes. On July 21, 1940 the State Assembly adopted the declaration of the restoration of Soviet power in Estonia and proclaimed the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. On July 22 the declaration of Estonia's wish to join the USSR was adopted and the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was addressed accordingly. The request was approved by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on August 6, 1940. On July 23 the State Assembly proclaimed all land to be People's Property while banks and heavy industry were nationalized. On August 25 the State Assembly adopted the Constitution of the Estonian SSR, renamed itself the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR and approved the Council of People's Commissars of the Estonian SSR.|$|E
