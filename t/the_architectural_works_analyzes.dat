50|$|Herman Hertzberger, Arnulf Lüchinger, Rijk Rietveld, Herman Hertzberger 1959-86, Buildings and Projects, (English+German+French), The Hague 1987. First part of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2004 the Nardini family {{celebrate}} its 225th year by unveiling <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> Bolle, {{which was}} commissioned {{three years earlier}} from the architect Massimiliano Fuksas.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the university gym began May 12, 1978, and opened on October 2, 1980. <b>The</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> was accomplished entirely by UACH engineering graduates.|$|R
30|$|Consider, first, that in {{any case}} {{identifying}} <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> with <b>the</b> content of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design entails allowing that the work is completed when the design is completed, and before that any physical realisation appears.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> and <b>the</b> {{quality of}} the building's works of art meant that the {{historic}} building was declared a national monument of historic and artistic interest in 1970.|$|R
30|$|A second {{important}} {{choice is}} that among a narrow {{and a broad}} view of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work.</b> On a narrow view, the spatial boundaries of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> coincide with (or, come close to) those of an imaginary material object mereologically constituted by all and only those items that were (or should be) materially erected, modified, transported and placed, or merely left unchanged by the construction company as an effect of the architect’s instructions (and, also, by the space within); and, the properties the work constitutively possesses are limited to the intrinsic, perceivable physical properties that are grounded on the intrinsic, perceivable physical properties of those items. On a broad view, on the contrary, the spatial boundaries of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> can be much more extended than that, and also, the work can constitutively possess much more kinds of properties. For instance, {{a supporter of the}} broad view may argue that whenever a new building designed by an architect is erected, <b>the</b> authentic <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> that is thus produced is of very greater area or size: a new district or, even, a new town. 4 In this extreme sense, town X is <b>the</b> only <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> produced by all of the architects ever working in X, and at each instant of time the umpteenth and ephemeral author of X is the architect(s) that most recently architecturally modified X by creating or transforming a proper part of X.|$|R
30|$|A {{most natural}} move is perhaps {{identifying}} {{it with the}} content of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design. But this move will reveal hasty. For the content of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design often contains too little information in respect to the abstract entity the work should consist in, if at all. <b>Architectural</b> <b>works</b> are often constituted also by properties over which <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design normally remains silent, such as, environmental, geographical or social properties. In fact, if we imagine to {{have the capability to}} relocate buildings to a far way location after meticulous stone-by-stone transfer, still we must admit that some of <b>the</b> corresponding <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> would not survive the change. For example, Palazzo Sansedoni, or the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral, would not survive a relocation to Tokyo—while an anonymous block of flats probably would (Bacchini 2017). I take the reason to be that some <b>architectural</b> <b>works,</b> but not all, are to be broadly identified. By contrast, taking <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> to reside in the content of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design normally is identifying it narrowly. This is the first reason why we should abstain from always equating the abstract entity <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> may consist in with the content of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> {{started in}} late spring of 1977, as a {{spin-off}} of the T.J. Watson Research 801 processor (hence the [...] "Research" [...] in the acronym). Most of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> changes were for cost reductions, such as adding 16-bit instructions for byte-efficiency.|$|R
30|$|Although types do admit of {{more than}} one token by definition, some views of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work,</b> or of <b>the</b> work of art, as a type may contingently entail some such types to have just one token.|$|R
30|$|Dilemma 1 : Contemporary {{art museums}} define {{themselves}} through {{the architecture of}} their buildings. <b>The</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> often outshine <b>the</b> collections with the consequence that the building’s operating costs exceed the budget for exhibitions and purchase of new artworks.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of Wat Luang is Wat Phra Non (วัดพระนอน) {{near the site of}} the old city walls. Some of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> include <b>the</b> Chiang Saen-style ubosot with narrow {{openings}} to let in light instead of normal windows. Inside is a 9-metre-long plaster reclining Buddha.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Architectural</b> <b>Work</b> of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement is a {{collection}} of 17 sites designed by the Franco-Swiss architect known as Le Corbusier. These sites demonstrate how Modernism was applied to construction and show the global range of a style and an architect.|$|R
50|$|The {{use of the}} material, processing, the color, {{grain and}} texture {{determine}} the different functions of the complex; chosen materials are especially linked to local tradition (in this case, the tuff) and make <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> immediately perceptible and recognizable by the user, especially by {{the residents of the}} area.|$|R
50|$|Another {{attraction}} is <b>the</b> earthen <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> of Didi Contractor, including several homes made of adobe and bamboo.|$|R
30|$|As {{previously}} clarified, it {{is possible}} to understand an <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> as an abstract entity in two ways: as a mere abstract entity, and as an abstract entity that is also a type. While mere abstract entities do not admit of more than one and a single concrete realisation, types do. Bearing this difference in mind, let us try to identify the abstract entity that <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> might be.|$|R
50|$|The Yankee Candle Co. v. New England Candle Co., 14 F.Supp.2d 154 (1998) is a {{district}} court case from Massachusetts holding {{that an individual}} shop within a mall does not qualify as a “building” under 17 U.S.C. § 101. The case clarifies the scope of <b>the</b> <b>Architectural</b> <b>Works</b> Copyright Protection Act (AWCPA).|$|R
30|$|So, {{architecture}} {{is not a}} two-stage activity after all—at least not always. 8 I would say that modular architecture, producing modular buildings such as kit houses popular in North America {{in the first half}} of the 20 th century, or Tom Sandonato and Martin Wehmann’s kitHAUS pre-fab modules nowadays, is paradigmatically two-stage; and, also stereotypical and vernacular {{architecture is}} two-stage, as far as we find no difficulty in regarding <b>the</b> corresponding <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> as types expressed by <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design (hence normally narrow). 9 But the more we have to do with originality and inventiveness, the less architecture appears two-stage. Ironically, then, the more architects are imaginative and resourceful, the less they are to be considered as the unique authors of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> they design.|$|R
30|$|As {{a general}} principle, also those who {{categorise}} <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> as events {{need to decide}} where to lie along the broad/narrow view continuum. A minimal characterisation of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> event might consist in the mere being erected, enduring and decaying (or, being destroyed) of the material object(s) normally called ‘the building(s)’. Perhaps {{this is the most}} adequate vision of the event that the goshoden of Ise Jingu may consist in. By contrast, a broader understanding of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> event would require—for instance—to see it as “various materials being held together in specific assemblages by work of various kinds” (Rose et al. 2010 : 334) including social practises, cultural habits, political institutions, the experiencing of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> by human and perhaps even non-human beings, the conceiving of it in certain ways and the attributing to it of certain functions, significance, aesthetic value, the discourses surrounding it, and so on. And, again, one can (or better, must) combine each of these separate options with the idea that <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> is <b>the</b> event token or, as an alternative, the event as an abstract entity, somehow identified.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> {{featured}} artistic highlights (such as murals, bas-relief, sculpture) by challenging, new {{artists and}} craftsmen such as Ralph Stackpole, Robert Boardman Howard, Charles Stafford Duncan, Dorothy Wright Liebes, Diego Rivera. Rather than breaking new ground with designs, they captured {{the spirit of}} the times and refined it, adding a distinct personal flair.|$|R

3000|$|But {{how should}} we {{interpret}} the idea that <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> is really an event? Of course {{there are plenty of}} approaches in the history of architecture that have stressed how important it is for architects {{to think in terms of}} processes.

25|$|During the {{renovation}} of the Cathedral by the Conrad Schmitt Studios, the walls were faux finished to resemble stone blocks.

50|$|The {{atmosphere}} during {{night time}} was the highlight of Disney Village, but daytime was another story.

50|$|The main School of Music {{building}} {{was designed for}} the National Capital Development Commission in 1970 by architects Daryl Jackson and Evan Walker. <b>The</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> of Jackson at this time {{can be seen to}} be in parallel with those of noted U.S. architect Paul Rudolph, most notably his 1960s interpretations of Le Corbusier's later works.|$|R
50|$|İhsan Bilgin, Dean of the School of Architecture at Istanbul Bilgi University, was {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> coordination, while <b>the</b> master plan {{was carried out by}} the architects Nevzat Sayın (public library) and Emre Arolat (multi-purpose hall). Han Tümertekin joined the team for the design work on the energy museum. <b>The</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> was completed in three years. Recently, some parts of the complex are still under construction.|$|R
30|$|Understanding {{why this}} {{requirement}} holds for architecture—and {{in the first}} place what it is for an <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> to be identified broadly—is relatively simple. We judge that we can relocate an anonymous block of flats, or a kitHAUS pre-fab module, without attempting on its identity. Therefore, no environmental or geographical property is constitutive of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> that <b>the</b> anonymous block of flats, and the kitHAUS pre-fab module, are (or, are instances of). Therefore, such <b>architectural</b> <b>works</b> can be identified narrowly; and we are free to equate them with the concrete particulars, a mere abstract entity, or the type expressed by <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design, which is normally narrow.|$|R

25|$|After the {{resignation}} of Utzon, the Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, and the Government Architect, Ted Farmer, organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion. <b>The</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is also a}} {{term that}} is admiringly applied to <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>work</b> of Le Corbusier, by Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter in their book Collage City, {{suggesting}} that he assembled ideas from found objects {{of the history of}} architecture.
