Work in this version included integrating the profiles and synchronization features, including moving synchronization into the main menu and introducing a profile manager. Synchronization data will be encrypted by default. Chromium 15 [...] also expands webpage pre-rendering. Dan Bailey of Conceivably Tech stated about this version {{and the development of}} it, [...] "it is obvious that Google is plugging along and is fine-tuning its browser... Chrome isn't surrendering its perception of the most advanced browser today anytime soon." [...] As development wound up in early September 2011 Chromium 15 also gained a [...] "self-crashing" [...] feature that crashes the browser if a close command is not completed in 25 seconds, smooth scrolling when using the space bar, automatic pre- and auto-logins to Google's own web pages, <b>task</b> <b>bar</b> logos to show different profiles, greatly enhanced synchronization customization, including optional search engine synchronization and improvements to the prerendering process.|$|E

[...] One icon on the <b>task</b> <b>bar</b> shows a list of installed applications and bookmarks.

40|$|The {{effects of}} N-(2, 6 imethyl-phenyl) - 2 -(2 -oxo- 1 -pyrrolidinyl) -acetamide [DM- 9384], a cyclic {{derivative}} of GABA, were inves-tigated in the cycloheximide (CXM) -induced amnesia animal model using the passive avoidance task. Pre- and post-training and pre-retention test administration of DM- 9384 attenuated the CXM-induced amnesia {{as indicated by}} prolongation of step-down latency. Aniracetam, another cyclic derivative of GABA, also showed antiamnesic effects. Scopolamine, a muscannic ACh receptor antagonist, and the GABA antagonists, picrotoxin and bicuculline, all antagonized the antiamnesic effects of DM- 9384. CXM decreased the number of GABAA and muscannic ACh receptor binding sites. DM- 9384 not only inhibited this effect but actually increased the latter. These results suggest that DM- 9384 attenuates CXM-induced amnesia by interacting with GA-BAergic and AChergic neuronal systems and enhancing protein synthesis in the brain.

5000|$|Interlock {{is one of}} {{the direct}} parents of the Fuzion system (the other is the Hero System). The Interlock System is [...] "skill-based" [...] - {{characters}} are created by choosing skills for them, and by advancing those skills individually, rather than by choosing character class packages. The Interlock System is used primarily in the Cyberpunk 2020 and Mekton role-playing games; a variant of the Interlock System is used in Teenagers from Outer Space and the Japanese Gundam Senki RPG. Stats and skills are both rated on a scale of 0-10 with 0 representing no ability/no training and 10 representing the maximum ability possible for a human being. A typical skill roll will range from 12-20 for most tasks, so a skill 10 + stat 10 will succeed at virtually any <b>task</b> <b>barring</b> a critical mishap, while a skill 0 + stat 2 (minimum statistic level for a human character) will fail at any but the very simplest task, and even then will succeed only on a critical success.

30|$|With {{regards to}} the second {{research}} question, we hypothesized the following hierarchy and correspondences between the <b>bar</b> <b>tasks</b> (Fig.  6) and stage classifications: (H 1) The <b>bar</b> <b>tasks</b> will follow a hierarchy of increasing difficulty—B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4, B 5; (H 2) success rates on each task will be positively associated with stage classification; (H 3) B 1 would be possible for some students {{who had not yet}} constructed composite units (INS); (H 4) B 2 would be possible for students who had constructed composite units (eTNS); (H 5) B 3 and B 4 would be possible for students who could assimilate using composite units (aTNS); and (H 6) B 5 would be possible for students who had constructed iterable units (ENS). Evidence for the hierarchy was based on percent correct for each task. Additionally, the magnitude and patterns of association between student performance on each of the five <b>bar</b> <b>tasks</b> and stage classification was assessed using the gamma statistic (G). G is appropriate for assessing the association between two ordinal measures (e.g., B 1 versus stage classification; Siegel and Castellan, 1988). Hypotheses 3 through 6 were evaluated through an investigation of the associated contingency tables. Given evidence of an association between task and stage, step-like patterns in the tables were used to identify the classification for which tasks were accessible.|$|R

40|$|PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relationships between}} clinical measures of executive function and attention, and laboratory measures of anticipatory locomotor adaptations with dual tasks following a TBI. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Ten people with moderate or severe TBI were compared to 10 healthy subjects for neuropsychological measures in the clinic, as well as locomotor patterns and reading time in the laboratory for adapted Stroop <b>tasks</b> (<b>Bar</b> and Word) during unobstructed and obstructed walking. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: As previously found 1 (Vallee M, McFadyen BJ, Swaine B, Doyon J, Cantin JF, Dumas D. Effects of environmental demands on locomotion after traumatic brain injury. Archives of Physical Medicine Rehabilitation 2006; 87 : 806 [...] 813) during the locomotor activities, subjects with TBI walked slower, had higher clearance margins and took longer to read during the Stroop tasks than healthy subjects. In general, subjects with TBI also showed deficits in executive functions and attention. Significant relationships were specifically observed between scores on Trail Making B and clearance margins for subjects with TBI, but not for healthy subjects. Alternatively, significant relationships between clinical scores on Stroop and dual task Stroop reading times were obtained for healthy subjects but not for subjects with TBI. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that measures of executive functioning and attention may be associated to locomotor behaviour in complex environments following a moderate to severe TBI...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} usability of graphical icons {{in the design}} of human–computer interfaces. A simple additive model of icon acquisition time, including terms for Index of Difficulty, mode of icon array, and log 2 (number of icons) explained 95 % of the variance in mean times covering all 36 conditions over 4 laboratory experiments conducted in the study. The acquisition of icons in graphical menus was subject to Fitts’ Law. Where the dialog box only appeared on the screen when an action was initiated, the acquisition time included a choice time that was additive with the movement time. When a choice was required during the task in addition to a movement, both the number of icons and their configuration affected the choice time. Design implications are that the number of icons should be minimized in pop-up menus and that the icons should be arranged in a manner reflective of the shape of the useful field of view. Frequently used menus or icon arrays should be permanently visible to minimize performance time (e. g., by using <b>task</b> <b>bars</b> to hold common icons). Dialogue windows, especially with a larger number of icons, should be built in compact, perhaps square, configurations. If {{it is not possible to}} use the square icon configuration, it is desirable to use the horizontal configuration, which can be utilized more efficiently than the vertical configuration 1...|$|R

30|$|We {{found that}} the {{hierarchy}} of difficulty for the <b>bar</b> <b>tasks</b> supported our conceptual framework. The tasks were useful in distinguishing between students {{at each of the}} four classifications. In particular, tasks in which an unpartitioned bar was identified with a larger composite unit were only successfully assimilated by probable aTNS students, implying that these tasks {{do a good job of}} testing a student’s ability to assimilate with composite units. Furthermore, we found that partitions that would scaffold a multiplicative comparison of the two bars did not greatly reduce the difficulty of the problems, implying that students who can assimilate a task with composite units do not have difficulty making and interpreting (what is to the observer) a multiplicative comparison of the composite units. Our findings imply that the <b>bar</b> <b>tasks</b> could be a powerful addition to assessments measuring a student’s stage in constructing and coordinating units.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{various aspects}} of {{peripheral}} vision, which is known not to be as acute as vision {{at the point of}} fixation. Differences between foveal and peripheral vision are generally thought to be of a quantitative rather than a qualitative nature. However, the rate of decline in sensitivity between foveal and peripheral vision is known to be task dependent and the mechanisms underlying the differences are not yet well understood. Several experiments described here have employed a psychophysical technique referred to as 'spatial scaling'. Thresholds are determined at several eccentricities for ranges of stimuli which are magnified versions of one another. Using this methodology a parameter called the E 2 value is determined, which defines the eccentricity at which stimulus size must double in order to maintain performance equivalent to that at the fovea. Experiments of this type have evaluated the eccentricity dependencies of detection tasks (kinetic and static presentation of a differential light stimulus), resolution <b>tasks</b> (<b>bar</b> orientation discrimination in the presence of flanking stimuli, word recognition and reading performance), and relative localisation tasks (curvature detection and discrimination). Most tasks could be made equal across the visual field by appropriate magnification. E 2 values are found to vary widely dependent on the task, and possible reasons for such variations are discussed. The dependence of positional acuity thresholds on stimulus eccentricity, separation and spatial scale parameters is also examined. The relevance of each factor in producing 'Weber's law' for position can be determined from the results...|$|R

Nineteen participants performed the size-relevant version of the orthogonal task (Experiment 1 a), and seventeen participants performed the contrast-relevant version of the orthogonal task (Experiment 1 b). Participants completed both single-dimension tasks first (size and contrast, starting task counterbalanced across participants), followed by one randomly assigned orthogonal task. For all tasks, participants were instructed to fixate their eyes on a central fixation cross (positioned 12.6 degrees from the left and 9.4 degrees {{from the top of}} the screen) at the beginning of each trial, at which point a drift correction occurred. After 500 milliseconds, the stimuli appeared, and participants were free to move their eyes around the screen. The stimuli were displayed until participants made their response (Fig.  1).|$|R
30|$|There was one task {{meant to}} provide an {{opportunity}} for students to show whether they assimilated tasks with composite units or three-level units.

If the student were to utilize 7 -unit lengths to draw the bar, then they would show that they could think of 14 and 21 as made up of multiples of composite units before operating and utilize that knowledge to plan a solution strategy. That would, in fact, imply a stage higher than the ENS stage but certainly would be a decisive indication of ENS. Simply solving that problem would require assimilation with composite units, which implies at least an aTNS.|$|R

However, stacked bar graphs {{may be more effective}} for part-to-whole proportion judgments, since the whole is represented explicitly (an emergent feature resulting from the arrangement of the bars). Thirty-five participants were shown bar or stacked bar graphs, and compared one bar to the other in a part-to-part proportion judgment, or one bar to the sum in a part-to-whole judgment. Completion times and absolute rror were recorded for each condition. Participants made larger errors with stacked bar graphs in part-to-part tasks, but graph type had little effect on error for part-to-whole tasks. Participants took more time with the bar graphs in the part-to-whole task, but there was little time difference between the graph types in part-to-part <b>tasks.</b> In general, <b>bars</b> were better for the part-to-part <b>task,</b> and stacked <b>bars</b> better for the part-to-whole task.
