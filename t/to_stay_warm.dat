5|$|The first {{evidence}} for feathers in tyrannosauroids {{came from the}} small species Dilong paradoxus, found in the Yixian Formation of China, and reported in 2004. As with many other theropods discovered in the Yixian, the fossil skeleton was preserved with a coat of filamentous structures which are commonly recognized as the precursors of feathers. Because all known skin impressions from larger tyrannosauroids known at the time showed evidence of scales, the researchers who studied Dilong speculated that feathers may correlate negatively with body size—that juveniles may have been feathered, then shed the feathers and expressed only scales as the animal became larger and no longer needed insulation <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm.</b> Subsequent discoveries showed that even some large tyrannosauroids had feathers covering much of their bodies, casting doubt on the hypothesis {{that they were a}} size-related feature.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm</b> in a {{membrane}} suit, {{the wearer}} must wear an insulating undersuit, today typically made with polyester or other synthetic fiber batting. Polyester and other synthetics are preferred over natural materials, since synthetic materials have better insulating properties when damp or wet from sweat, seepage, or a leak.|$|E

5000|$|Body mass of Mus macedonicus {{exposed to}} short photoperiods {{increased}} - essentially they got bigger <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warmer</b> {{when it is}} cold. The short photoperiods also increased their resistance to cold while long photoperiods increased their ability to manage higher temperatures. Food consumption and waste production are lower in the mice that have longer photoperiods. [...] These physiological changes allow Mus macedonicus to be well adapted to the changes {{that occur in the}} Mediterranean on a seasonal basis. This mouse also shows a genetic tendency for glial fibrilary acidic protein in their lens epithelial cells. This is a new marker of polymorphism in the Mus Genus.|$|R
50|$|The coat of a Cornish Rex is {{extremely}} fine and sometimes curly. Their light coat {{means that they}} are best suited for indoor living in warm and dry conditions, as they are sensitive to low temperatures. Cornish Rexes like <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> near <b>warm</b> places such as computer monitors, light bulbs, laps and shoulders.|$|R
25|$|The Leatherman spent {{each night}} in a {{different}} 'cave' on his route where he had usually left a supply of firewood and tinder to start a fire soon after he arrived. The fire's heat would warm the stone sides of the 'cave' and allow it <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm</b> throughout the night. Most of the cave's provided an opening for the fire's smoke to exit while still providing shelter from cold wind and rain. The Leatherman would accept food and drink (and occasional lodging and/or treatment when ill) from concerned charitable citizens along the route.|$|E
25|$|Migratory Lepidoptera are, in most cases, {{excellent}} flyers. Species {{like the}} Vanessa atalanta {{are capable of}} managing a fierce headwind. In case of headwind, they usually fly low and are more goal-oriented. During migration, some species {{can be found at}} high altitudes, ranging to up to two kilometers. This is especially noteworthy for day-flying species like Vanessa atalanta, since the temperatures on these altitudes are low and day-flying species depend on the outside temperature <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm.</b> It is thought that Vanessa atalanta produces enough body warmth during flight since it has also been recorded migrating at night.|$|E
25|$|Brody died, as did five {{passengers}} {{aboard the}} train. The lead car caught fire and was eventually destroyed. Damage {{was estimated at}} $3.7million. Passengers who escaped or were evacuated and were not injured were taken to a nearby climbing gym called The Cliffs, where they were able <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm</b> until buses arrived. Nine passengers were taken to Westchester Medical Center, {{with one of them}} in very serious condition. A police helicopter with thermal imaging equipment scanned the nearby Kensico Cemetery in search of survivors who might have wandered away from the scene and collapsed into the snow, but found none. There were a total of six deaths and fifteen injuries.|$|E

25|$|St. Bernards {{are often}} portrayed, {{especially}} in old live action comedies such as Swiss Miss, the TV series Topper, and classic cartoons, wearing small barrels of brandy around their necks. Avalanche victims supposedly drank the brandy <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm</b> while awaiting rescue, {{although this is}} medically unsound. The monks of the St. Bernard Hospice deny that any St. Bernard has ever carried casks or small barrels around their necks; they attribute the image to an 1820 painting by Edwin Landseer, perhaps Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveler (which became a popular engraving in 1831 by Charles Landseer). The monks did keep casks around for photographs by tourists.|$|E
25|$|Hartness’s {{interest}} in optics and astronomy {{led to his}} development of a telescope mount with the revolving dome on an equatorial plane. An additional feature of this telescope, which still stands at the former Hartness Mansion, was that the optics of the telescope passed through a lens in {{the wall of the}} dome. This allowed the observer <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm</b> in winter. (Conventional telescopes were often contained within domes that opened an aperture for the telescope to gain exposure both to the sky and the ambient air.) The success of this patent led to more telescope activities and commissions. With Hartness's encouragement and financial support, Russell W. Porter initiated the Springfield Telescope Makers Club. The club still celebrates their annual Stellafane gathering in Springfield.|$|E
25|$|King {{penguins}} and emperor penguins also do {{not build}} nests; instead, they tuck their eggs and chicks between their feet and folds of skin on their lower bellies. They are thus able to move about while incubating, though in practice only the emperor penguin regularly does so. Emperor penguins breed during the harshest months of the Antarctic winter, and their mobility allows them to form huge huddled masses which help them to withstand the extremely high winds and low temperatures of the season. Without the ability to share body heat (temperatures in the centre of tight groups can {{be as much as}} 10C above the ambient air temperature), the penguins would expend far more energy trying <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm,</b> and breeding attempts would probably fail.|$|E
50|$|This species inhabits shallow {{coastal waters}} over sandy or silty bottoms, estuaries, and lakes. They prefer water {{temperatures}} over 15 C and can tolerate temperatures over 30 C. These stingrays conduct seasonal migrations <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in <b>warmer</b> water: {{they are only}} present in the northerly Chesapeake bay {{in the summer and}} fall, and elsewhere they migrate to deeper water in the winter. When inshore, they usually stay at depths of 2 - 6 m, and after migrating offshore they may be found as deep as 25 m.|$|R
50|$|GHG {{emissions}} {{are an important}} correlate of wealth, at least at present (Banuri et al., 1996, pp. 91-92). Wealth, as measured by per capita income (i.e., income per head of population), varies widely between different countries. Activities of the poor that involve emissions of GHGs are often associated with basic needs, such as heating <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> tolerably <b>warm.</b> In richer countries, emissions tend {{to be associated with}} things like cars, central heating, etc. The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human welfare according to wealth.|$|R

He had his winter appetite, and had lunched early. So said he to the night druggist, who had opened his [...] "Dormstock," [...] "How {{would you like to}} sit here and read awhile, while I go and get my dinner?

25|$|Insects {{generally}} {{have a higher}} food conversion efficiency than more traditional meats, measured as efficiency of conversion of ingested food, or ECI. While many insects can have an energy input to protein output ratio of around 4:1, raised livestock has a ratio closer to 54:1. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that feed first needs to be grown for most traditional livestock. Additionally endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates need to use a significantly greater amount of energy just <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm</b> whereas ectothermic (cold blooded) plants or insects do not. An index which can be used as a measure is the Efficiency of conversion of ingested food to body substance: for example, only 10% of ingested food is converted to body substance by beef cattle, versus 19–31% by silkworms and 44% by German cockroaches. Studies concerning the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) provide further evidence for the efficiency of insects as a food source. When reared at 30°C or more and fed a diet of equal quality to the diet used to rear conventional livestock, crickets showed a food conversion twice as efficient as pigs and broiler chicks, four times that of sheep, and six times higher than steers (oxen) when losses in carcass trim and dressing percentage are counted.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Camarillo Ranch House’s ideal {{location}} in Southern California, {{back in the}} early 1900s the home struggled <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm.</b> Almost every room in the house has a fireplace in it. Adolfo looked to technology as a way to remedy problems that would arise on the ranch. He was the first farmer to ever purchase a refrigerator, which at that time, would take up an entire room in the house. However, he was able to safely store perishables {{for the first time in}} his life. He also had multiple heaters installed throughout the house in hopes of providing more warmth to his family. The most beautiful room in the Camarillo Ranch house belonged to Adolfo's middle daughter Carmen. Carmen was an avid equestrian who learned how to care for and maintain the horses from the Ranch Manager, Meliton Ortiz. Up until Meliton Ortiz’ death in 2010, he would visit the Camarillo Ranch House frequently to provide stories and details about his life growing up on the ranch. The home was remodeled in 1914, when the oldest daughter Carmen married. They opened many rooms by taking down walls and changing the stair design. The grand parlor had the greatest changes from this, causing it to go from multiple to rooms to one giant open grand parlor. This was in the hopes that it would open up the house more.|$|E
25|$|Velásquez began {{assisting}} {{his parents}} in the fields when he was four years old. His family traveled from the Southwest to Midwest each year, following the harvest season for various crops. They rode with other migrant workers in a pickup truck with a canvas-covered bed, huddling around a can of hot ashes and covering themselves in blankets <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm.</b> Often, the family would have only a single room for the parents and all their children. One winter, he and his siblings had gathered together for warmth while snow drifted into their one-room shack through gaps in the walls. The family's poverty worsened one year when an employer paid his father only half the wages he was owed. In 1954, his parents settled permanently in Gilboa, Ohio, where they worked in the fields {{in the summer and}} in a cannery during the winter. Baldemar knew almost no English when he entered the first grade, and struggled academically. He was a good athlete, playing several sports, but was often ridiculed for his Mexican American heritage. Velásquez led his first strike at the age of 12, helping pickers at his summer job win better wages. He began to excel in his studies in the eighth grade, making honor roll. He attended Pandora-Gilboa High School, where he participated in baseball, basketball, football, and track and field, and took college preparatory courses. His high school career guidance counselor advised him to only focus on industrial arts courses, but Velásquez refused.|$|E

25|$|On Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates—Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician—struggle <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm</b> {{and produce}} their art ("Tune Up #1"). Mark's mother leaves him a {{voicemail}} wishing him a merry Christmas {{and trying to}} comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him ("Voice Mail #1"). Their friend Collins, a gay anarchist Ivy League tutor, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger's former roommate Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year's rent, before shutting down their electrical power ("Tune Up #2"). However, Mark and Roger rebel and pledge to not pay the rent they were promised wouldn't be a problem ("Rent"). Meanwhile, a cross-dressing street drummer (currently out of drag) named Angel finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him ("You Okay Honey?"). The two are immediately attracted to each other, and learn that they are both HIV positive. Roger also has HIV which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who committed suicide, causing Roger to fall into a deep depression. Mark goes looking for Collins ("Tune Up #3"), while Roger wishes to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies ("One Song Glory"). An exotic dancer, junkie, and neighbor, Mimi, shows up to flirt with Roger, but he is clearly hesitant {{to start a new}} relationship ("Light My Candle"). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen's girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents ("Voice Mail #2").|$|E
500|$|On 11 August 1963, Evans {{began working}} for the Beatles in the {{combined}} role of roadie/bodyguard. Evans and Aspinall's duties were to drive the van while on tour, and {{to set up and}} test the equipment. Mal's telephone engineering experience was valuable in setting up and maintaining the electrical equipment. The Beatles were being driven back to Liverpool from London by Evans through heavy fog on 21 January 1963, when the windscreen was hit by a pebble and crazed over, so Evans had to break a large hole in it to see the road ahead. This was in winter, so the group had to lie {{one on top of the}} other in the back with a bottle of whisky and try <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm</b> in the freezing temperatures; something McCartney later referred to as a [...] "Beatle sandwich".|$|E
500|$|Richard Elfman {{had never}} gone to film school when {{production}} started, and [...] "I didn't know what I was getting into." [...] The production, {{from its original}} 16mm roots to its finish, took three years. Cast and crew members would sleep on the film's stage, wearing spare gorilla suits <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm.</b> Among the film's artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s (such as Betty Boop). Some of the film's cast {{was made up of}} non-professionals cast off the street. In one scene, Richard Elfman brought in a young man to mouth the words of [...] "Bim Bam Boom", but when he was put in front of the camera, he stood there as the scene was shot. Elfman left the scene in the film by editing in Bright's lips over the actor's face. Another scene featured homeless men.|$|E

The family moved again to the sunnier 17Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was eleven. Illness would be a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin. Contemporary views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was bronchiectasis or even sarcoidosis.|$|R

500|$|On {{the last}} few days on set, the {{conditions}} had become so poor that the crew began burning furniture <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm.</b> Since only exterior shots needed to be filmed at that point, they burned nearly every piece of furniture left. Several actors went days without showering, and because of the freezing conditions, several caught colds and other illnesses. Campbell later described the filming process as nearly [...] "twelve weeks of mirthless exercise in agony", though he allowed that he did manage to have fun while on set. On January 23, 1980, filming was finished and almost every crew member left the set to return home, with Campbell staying with Raimi. While looking over the footage that had been shot, Raimi discovered that a few pick-ups were required to fill in missing shots. Four days of re-shoots were then done to complete the film. The final moment involved Campbell having [...] "monster-guts" [...] splattered on him in the basement.|$|E
500|$|As Bond girl Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson in the 2002 {{blockbuster}} Die Another Day, Berry recreated a {{scene from}} Dr. No, emerging from the surf to be greeted by James Bond as Ursula Andress had 40 years earlier. Lindy Hemming, costume designer on Die Another Day, had insisted that Berry wear a bikini and knife as a homage. Berry has said of the scene: [...] "It's splashy", [...] "exciting", [...] "sexy", [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "it will keep me still out there after winning an Oscar". The bikini scene was shot in Cadiz; the location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels in between takes to try <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>warm.</b> According to an ITV news poll, Jinx was voted the fourth toughest girl on screen of all time. Berry was hurt during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. It was removed in a 30-minute operation.
