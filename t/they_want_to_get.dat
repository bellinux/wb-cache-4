5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
25|$|The {{citizens}} of the city (controlled by the game player) earn the money by driving around a vehicle for a given amount of time, picking up passengers and taking them to their destinations. The player receives money upon successfully dropping off each passenger, and bonuses are obtained when they are transported in {{a short amount of}} time. Players have to avoid certain hurdles, such as other vehicles and Burns' nuclear transit buses. The game contains seventeen different collectible vehicles, six starting locations, and ten different missions. In order to collect the vehicles and unlock starting locations, players must earn progressively more money for each vehicle or starting location <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> In order to complete missions, players must do certain things (such as protecting Krusty the Clown from a fan mob by driving him away, and getting Homer to his workplace unnoticed).|$|E

500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I {{hear the word}} 'conservative,' {{it makes me sick}} to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people.

Rehman had turned down a chance to move to Luton Town and team up with Mick Harford, who was {{previously}} the assistant manager at QPR, and said he was only prepared to drop down to League Two if he joined Bradford City. Rehman said of the move, [...] "I was only prepared to drop down the leagues to play for this club. I spoke to the manager and chairmen and I know <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Bradford back up to where they belong. I've been involved in relegation battles in the past and it's nice to be joining a club pushing for promotion – that's a good pressure to have." [...] He made his debut the following day in a 1–0 defeat to Bury at Gigg Lane, and in doing so became the first British Asian to play in all four divisions of professional football in England. He made his home debut on 31 January, playing at right back, in a 2–0 home win over Grimsby Town at Valley Parade. In March he turned down the chance to play for Pakistan in the Asian Football Confederation Challenge Cup qualifiers in order to help Bradford's push for promotion.|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of but {{have to find a}} place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I {{go to the grocery store}} – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Kidney Now!" [...] {{was first}} read by its cast on March 5, 2009; it was filmed on March 16–17, 2009. [...] "He Needs a Kidney", the charity song {{featured}} in this episode, was written by show composer and co-executive producer Jeff Richmond. Richmond is married to series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. In discussion {{of the development of}} [...] "Kidney Now!", Richmond said that Carlock and Fey [...] "were trying {{to figure out a way}} to highlight Jack's dad in getting a kidney and how they're going to deal with that", and that the two came to the decision to [...] "take advantage of the singing", as they have done so in the past with different 30 Rock episodes, in which the show's characters have sung songs. Carlock and Fey agreed to the idea that a song be included in the season finale, but that it be an anthem like the 1985 charity song, [...] "We Are the World", [...] as the cause is that the Milton Greene character is in need of a kidney donor. [...] "Basically, the parameters were if 'We Are the World' but <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a kidney. I think we had angles that everyone has two kidneys and you'll only need one kidney, and we thought 'Alright, we'll get some distance on that'", said Richmond. While working on the track, Fey suggested to Richmond that he incorporate Milton Greene's name in one part of the song, which he did, as this was sung by singers Cyndi Lauper and Robert Randolph.|$|E

500|$|Still {{during the}} race, the {{stewards}} handed Nico Hülkenberg a three-place grid penalty {{for the following}} race in Japan for causing the collision with Felipe Massa on lap 14. Hülkenberg was [...] "frustrated" [...] with the decision, saying: [...] "The accident with Felipe was very unlucky and I don't understand why I've been given a penalty before there has even been the chance to discuss the incident in the stewards' room [...] In my view it was my corner and I'm surprised Felipe backed out of it much too late, locking up just before he hit me." [...] Massa had a different view about the incident, stating: [...] "I was braking for the corner and he turned his car in on mine, leaving me with nowhere to go, so we hit." [...] Force India decided not to appeal the decision. Williams's Head of Vehicle Performance Rob Smedley lamented the slow pit stop of his team that preceded the incident, saying that Massa should have exited the pit lane safely ahead of Hülkenberg. While initial reactions in the United Kingdom agreed with the stewards' decision, German tabloid Bild called the penalty a [...] "joke". Hülkenberg later accepted {{that he was at}} fault and apologised to Massa via text message. Concerning the accident between Button and Maldonado, no further action was taken by the stewards. Jenson Button however followed up on his [...] "mental"-remark during the race, by stating that he felt Maldonado's driving was [...] "very strange" [...] and that he [...] "won't ever change". Maldonado answered by saying: [...] "No driver's happy if there's a car {{in front of them and}} <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> past, especially if it damages their car trying to overtake [...] We both got damage to our cars; he was behind me trying to get past, I was defending my position.

Iranians had a spontaneous demonstration to support Americans on 911." [...] He added, [...] "What strikes you most about Iran (vs. Saudi Arabia) is that Iran has real politics...

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, Miller {{appeared}} {{in an interview}} with Chris Matthews on the MSNBC show Hardball. Here, Miller became visibly angry. Matthews criticized the premise of Miller's assertion that Kerry had actually voted against such defense programs by noting that in voting on appropriations bills, senators often vote against a version of a bill without wishing to oppose every item in that bill. Matthews also asked Miller to compare his assertion that a military under Kerry would be armed with only [...] "spitballs" [...] with rhetoric from Democrats that Republicans [...] "want to starve little kids, <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of education, they want to kill the old people" [...] and whether such level of rhetoric was constructive. When Miller expressed irritation at this line of questioning, Matthews pressed Miller with the question, [...] "Do you believe now– do you believe, Senator, truthfully, that John Kerry wants to defend the country with spitballs?" [...] Miller at first said that he wished the interview had been face-to-face so that he could [...] "get a little closer up into your face." [...] Miller angrily told Matthews to [...] "get out of my face," [...] and declared, [...] "I wish we lived in the day where you could challenge a person to a duel." [...] At the conclusion of the interview, Matthews asked [...] "Let's be friends," [...] which Miller ignored. Miller later said about the interview, [...] "That was terrible. I embarrassed myself.
