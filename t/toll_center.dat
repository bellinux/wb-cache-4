50|$|Operator {{assistance}} or participation may be {{an optional}} function. In U.S. common carrier telephony service, a <b>toll</b> <b>center</b> designated Class 4C is an office where assistance in completing incoming calls is provided {{in addition to other}} traffic; a <b>toll</b> <b>center</b> designated Class 4P is an office where operators handle only outbound calls, or where switching is performed without operator assistance.|$|E
50|$|The class 4 {{office is}} the <b>Toll</b> <b>Center</b> (TC), Toll Point (TP), or Intermediate Point (IP). A call going between two end offices not {{directly}} connected, or whose direct trunks are busy, is routed through the <b>toll</b> <b>center.</b> The <b>toll</b> <b>center</b> {{is also used}} to connect to the long-distance network for calls where added costs are incurred, such as operator handled services. This <b>toll</b> <b>center</b> may also be called the tandem office because calls have to pass through this location to get {{to another part of the}} network. Toll centers might have been operated either as interstate facilities, under the operation of AT&T Long Lines (GTE in a few cases), or by local telephone companies, handling long distance traffic to points within a particular operating company territory. Class 4 offices continue to exist, although with considerable changes, as they handle local exchange company interconnections, locally charged or long distance rated, or provide facilities for connection to long distance company points of presence.|$|E

50|$|The class 2 {{office was}} the Sectional Center (SC). The {{sectional}} center typically connected major <b>toll</b> <b>centers</b> within {{one or two}} states or provinces, or {{a significant portion of}} a large state or province, to provide interstate or interprovincial connections for long-distance calls. At various times, there were between 50 and 75 active class two offices in the network.|$|R
5000|$|The {{key to the}} {{new system}} was {{two-stage}} multi-frequency pulsing. The outgoing sender sent its Class 4 <b>toll</b> <b>center</b> an off-hook signal as usual, received a wink as usual as a [...] "proceed to send" [...] signal, and outpulsed only a special 3-digit (later 6-digit) access code. The <b>toll</b> <b>center</b> picked a trunk through the long distance network to the gateway office, which sent a second wink to the originating office, which then sent the whole dialed number. Thus the toll switching system needed no modification except at the gateway. The international trunks used Signaling System No. 5, a [...] "North Atlantic" [...] version of the North American multi-frequency signaling system, with minor modifications including slightly higher digit rate. European MF systems of the time used compelled signalling, which would slow down too much on a long transoceanic connection.|$|E
5000|$|When Ohio Bell {{refused to}} run lines to McClure's rural residents, {{they formed a}} {{separate}} company, with volunteer labor used to build lines connecting the residents. The new company in 1908 bought the Bell equipment, and in 1909 {{changed its name to}} the Citizens Mutual Telephone Co. [...] Long Distance calls were routed via Bell System equipment in Napoleon to the <b>toll</b> <b>center</b> in Maumee, and onward.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, {{it was common}} for many smaller cities {{to have their own}} operators. An NPA (area code) would usually have its largest city as its primary <b>toll</b> <b>center,</b> with smaller toll centers serving the {{secondary}} cities scattered throughout the NPA. TSPS allowed telephone companies to close smaller toll centers and consolidate operator services in regional centers which might be hundreds of miles from the subscriber.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, <b>toll</b> <b>centers</b> were {{modified}} by adding TSPS. With these new computers in place, digit storage in the toll system {{was no longer}} a problem. End offices were less extensively modified, and sent all their digits in a single stream. TSPS handled the gateway codes and other complexities of toll connections to the gateway office.|$|R

50|$|The class 3 {{office was}} the Primary Center (PC). Calls being made {{beyond the limits}} of a small {{geographical}} area where circuits are not connected directly between class 4 toll offices would be passed from the <b>toll</b> <b>center</b> to the primary center. These locations use high usage trunks to complete connection between toll centers. The primary center never served dial tone to the user. The number of primary centers in the network fluctuated from time to time, ranging between 150 and 230.|$|E
50|$|The long {{distance}} operator would record {{the name and}} city of the person to be called, and the operator would advise the calling party to hang up {{and wait for the}} call to be completed. Each <b>toll</b> <b>center</b> had {{only a limited number of}} trunks to distant cities, and if those circuits were busy, the operator would try alternate routings through intermediate cities. The operator would plug into a trunk for the destination city, and the inward operator would answer. The inward operator would obtain the number from the local information operator, and ring the call. Once the called party answered, the originating operator would advise him or her to stand by for the calling party, whom she'd then ring back, and record the starting time, once the conversation began.|$|E
50|$|The Bell System {{organized}} the numbering plan {{to minimize the}} cost of providing automatic dialing to large population centers, as calls that crossed area code boundaries were required to be switched by special toll switching systems. Thus, the number of toll calls (long distance in common parlance) calls were minimized by well-designed geographical aress. Tributary routes were placed into the same area as the major <b>toll</b> <b>center.</b> States that were anticipated to required more than about 500 central offices, a technical limitation of the number plan, were split into multiple areas, receiving a code with the middle digit being 1, while area codes that covered an entire state, had the digit 0 in the middle. In contrast to the area code, the second digit of the three-digit exchange code was never 0 or 1, thus affording a simple rule for recognition of whether a user was dialing a full ten-digit telephone number or merely dialing within the local area code using seven-digit dialing. Toll operators were able to differentiate between {{the two types of}} areas from the middle digit of the area code when a routing operator had to be consulted.|$|E

50|$|In the United States and Canada, area codes {{were first}} {{allocated}} in 1947.

5|$|The {{application}} {{on urban}} roads is currently {{limited to a}} few cities, including London, Stockholm, Singapore, Milan, and Gothenburg, {{as well as a}} few smaller towns, such as Durham, England; Znojmo, Czech Republic; Riga (the scheme ended in 2008), Latvia; and Valletta, Malta. Four general types of systems are in use; a cordon area around a city center, with charges for passing the cordon line; area wide congestion pricing, which charges for being inside an area; a city <b>center</b> <b>toll</b> ring, with toll collection surrounding the city; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing, where access to a lane or a facility is priced.|$|R
5|$|Practical {{implementations}} of road {{congestion pricing}} are found {{almost exclusively in}} urban areas, because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers. Autoroute A1 in Northern France {{is one of the}} few cases of congestion pricing implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 congestion prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings. As congestion pricing has been increasing worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide congestion pricing; city <b>center</b> <b>toll</b> ring; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing.|$|R

On June 30, 1958, the Eastern DEW Extension had 4 stations and there were 4 DER & 4 AEW&C aircraft operating for the Atlantic Barrier and on July 19, 1958, DYE 1 (DYE 4 on August 3) was begun by Western Electric using helicopter-assisted sealift at the coasts and airlift from Sondrestrom Air Base for the interior stations. By October 1, 1958, DYE communications were linked to the NORAD Combat Operations Center at Ent Air Force Base via the AT&T Denver <b>Toll</b> Test <b>Center.</b> From 1954, the U.S. Air Force expected that the air defense radar network would have to extend across the North Atlantic to Europe or the Azores, and by early 1956 studies to this effect were approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

40|$|Dorsoventral cell fate in the Drosophila embryo is {{specified}} by {{activation of the}} Toll receptor, leading to a ventral-to-dorsal gradient across nuclei of the NF-ÎºB transcription factor Dorsal. Toll receptor has been investigated genetically, molecularly, and immunohistologically, but much less is known about its dynamics in living embryos. Using live imaging of fluorescent protein chimeras, we find that Toll is recruited from the plasma membrane to Rab 5 + early endosomes. The distribution of a constitutively active form of Toll, Toll 10 b, is shifted from the plasma membrane to early endosomes. Inhibition of endocytosis on the ventral side of the embryo attenuates Toll signaling ventrally and causes Dorsal to accumulate on the dorsal side of the embryo, essentially inverting the dorsal/ventral axis. Conversely, enhancing endocytosis laterally greatly potentiates Toll signaling locally, altering {{the shape of the}} Dorsal gradient. Photoactivation and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies reveal that Toll exhibits extremely limited lateral diffusion within the plasma membrane, whereas Toll is highly compartmentalized in endosomes. When endocytosis is blocked ventrally, creating an ectopic dorsal signaling <b>center,</b> <b>Toll</b> is preferentially endocytosed at the ectopic signaling center. We propose that Toll signals from an endocytic compartment rather than the plasma membrane. Our studies reveal that endocytosis plays a pivotal role in the spatial regulation of Toll receptor activation and signaling and in the correct shaping of the nuclear Dorsal concentration gradient...|$|R

30|$|Although {{prevention}} counseling {{is desirable}} for high risk individuals, the CDC recognizes that such counseling {{might not be}} appropriate or feasible in all settings (CDC 2006 b), and it could pose a barrier to testing. States such as New York that have streamlined regulations regarding pre-test counseling have seen increases in HIV testing (Koo et al. 2006). Given the recent licensure of rapid tests with processing times as little as 60 Â seconds (FDA 2010), an expedited/express testing approach that excludes prevention counseling sessions could be provided through street outreach programs at large events such as gay pride. Individuals could choose to receive their results by text message or email, or retrieve them online using a confidential personal identification number (PIN) whenever ready. Preliminary positive persons would receive their results either by phone or in person by a trained counselor. In addition to saving time, this approach can help reduce stigma associated with HIV testing options requiring an assessment of risk behaviors (Copenhaver and Fisher 2006; Hutchinson et al. 2004). Rapid home self-testing with a recently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved oral fluid test (FDA 2012), is another testing modality offering privacy and convenience (Pai et al. 2013). Individuals can read their own test results within 20 Â minutes, and {{have the option of}} calling a 24 Ã— 7 support <b>center</b> <b>toll</b> free if they have questions or receive a preliminary positive result. This non-invasive approach differs from home dried blood spot (DBS) self-collection wherein specimens need to be returned for laboratory HIV testing, and results are available by phone within 7 Â days (FDA 1996).|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring recent decades, {{major public}} road {{authorities}} showed an increasing trend in seeking for alternative ways {{to establish and}} implement road infrastructures concession systems, with the main aim to make it doable in a reliable, socio-economically sustainable and cost effective manner. This phenomenon is mainly due to increasingly higher risks related {{to the establishment of}} road concession system and risk related to the introduction of road toll payment requirements. During the last three years, ANAS International Enterprise S. p. A., a subsidiary company of the Italian Highway Agency ANAS S. p. A., has been appointed for assessing the feasibility and comprehensively structuring road concessions, through the implementation of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative, for a large part of road network of the Republic of Colombia. The main activities consisted in (i) the development of a financial model, consistent with the rules and economic parameters related to the Colombian market; (ii) the assessment of the economic and financial feasibility; (iii) carrying out studies and simulations for several concessions scenarios implementation, including analysis of risks and technical, financial and legal assessment; (iv) preparation of tender documentation and delivery of technical support to the National Infrastructure Agency during the public-private partnership awarding process. Along with these activities, the implementation of an innovative road concession system allowed the transfer and application of a number of best practices in various sectors. Indeed, improvement on the following aspects have been achieved:â€¢Innovations in construction, including alternative solutions for road embankment slope stabilization; barriers against rock falls; asphalt concrete mixtures modified with polymers;â€¢Technological innovations, including intelligent transport systems, telecommunications and information infrastructure, subsystem <b>tolls,</b> transport operating <b>centers,</b> subsystem video surveillance cameras hotspots, emergency call subsystem, weighing subsystem, lighting systems in urban areas and tolls;â€¢Innovations in financial structuring, including tailor-made regulating financial planning and monitoring tools, introduction of innovative solutions for the use of appropriate discount rates aimed to ensure investor profitability, assessment tool to manage public- and private-sides risks, assessing tools to ensure value for money, implementation of alternative solutions for public participation in Project Financing initiatives, development and implementation of alternative solutions for private funding in the financing process (including structuring infrastructure bonds), adoption of PPP structure type contracts provisions;In this paper, the Authors describe in detail the concession implementation process, by particularly focusing on criteria adopted in selecting the contract type and related aspects, and highlighting main criticalities identified throughout the concession setting up process. Aiming to give food for thought for further development of road infrastructure concession practice implementation, this paper aims to provide the Reader with an analysis of an actual successful case study and accurate and well-balanced comments on advantages, disadvantages and criticalities faced...|$|R
