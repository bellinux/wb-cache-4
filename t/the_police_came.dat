25|$|Even though Rosado did not {{participate}} in the revolts, she was accused by the US Government in doing so. She was occupied in her job as a school social worker when <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>came</b> and arrested her. Rosado was sentenced to serve fifteen months in jail and fired from her job. Since she was unable to earn a living in the public school system, she obtained a position in a private school.|$|E
25|$|During their investigation, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>came</b> to {{know that}} the couple had a history of {{domestic}} violence and that the couple fought on a regular basis. According to a source, Luetgert had financial difficulties so he started courting a rich widow whom he planned to marry once he got rid of his wife. The police continued their investigation and discovered that on the night of May 1, 1897, the night Louisa disappeared, she was seen entering the factory with her husband at 10:30pm. A watchman from the sausage plant confirmed the story, saying that Mr. Luetgert gave him an errand to run and told him that he could take {{the rest of the night}} off.|$|E
25|$|On one occasion, {{they entered}} the Hudson's Bay Company Department Store to {{publicize}} their grievances to shoppers. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>came</b> to evict the men, and a bloody clash ensued. After that incident, the unemployed congregated at Victory Square Park, where McGeer came and read the Riot Act. The camp strikers left the city after two months to begin the On-to-Ottawa Trek. They felt they accomplished all they could in Vancouver and voted to take their grievances directly to Prime Minister R. B. Bennett. Shortly before the trekkers left, another Communist-led strike broke out on the waterfront, culminating with another bloody clash that {{became known as the}} Battle of Ballantyne Pier. Gerry McGeer treated these protests not as strikes, but as an attempted Bolshevik uprising. Although he came from a background as an iron molder and union representative, he came to be seen as an enemy of organized labour because of these events.|$|E

25|$|On 5 March, about 7000-8000 people {{broke into}} the Dimapur Central Jail. They dragged the accused out, while parading him naked, pelted him with stones and beat him. They dragged the accused to a clock tower about 7km away, by tying a rope to his waist from a motorcycle. The accused died on the way. The body was {{displayed}} from the clock tower's railings, until <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>came</b> and took it down. The Superintendent of Police Meren Jamir later said that the mob was led {{by a group of}} a few hundred school and college girls in uniforms, which prevented the police from using more force. Jamir said that the initial crowd was small and they had been repelled by baton charges. But, later the mob returned with larger numbers. Even though 8 companies of security forces were present at the jail, they failed to stop the mob. The police later said that there was at least one former inmate of the prison, who knew the interior layout of the jail.|$|E
25|$|Around 2 A.M. on April 15, 1865, {{members of}} the District of Columbia police visited the Surratt {{boarding}} house, seeking John Wilkes Booth and John Surratt. Why <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>came</b> to the house is not entirely clear. Most historians conclude that Weichmann's friend, Department of War employee Daniel Gleason, had alerted federal authorities to Confederate activity centered on the Surratt house, {{but that does not}} explain why police rather than federal agents appeared there. (Historian Roy Chamlee, however, says that there is evidence that Gleason did not tell police about his suspicions of Weichmann for several days.) Within 45 minutes of the attack on Lincoln, John Surratt's name had become associated with the attack on Secretary of State William H. Seward. The police as well as the Provost Marshal's office both had files on John Surratt, Jr., and knew he was a close friend of Booth. (It is possible that either James L. Maddox, property supervisor at Ford's Theatre and a friend of Booth's, or actor John Matthews, both of whom may have known about the plot to attack government officials, mentioned Surratt's name.) Historian Otto Eisenschiml has argued that David Herold's attempt to steal a horse from John Fletcher may have led them to the Surratt boarding house, but at least one other scholar has called the link uncertain. Other sources claim that eyewitnesses had identified Booth as Lincoln's attacker, and the detectives had information (a tip from an unnamed actor and a bartender) linking John, Jr., to Booth. Mary lied to the detectives that her son had been in Canada for two weeks. She also did not reveal that she had delivered a package to the tavern on Booth's behalf, only hours earlier.|$|E

2500|$|Anniston was {{the center}} of {{national}} controversy in 1961 when a mob bombed a bus filled with civilian Freedom Riders during the American Civil Rights Movement. As two Freedom buses were setting out to travel the south in protest of their Civil Rights following the Supreme Court case saying bus segregation was unconstitutional, one headed to Anniston, and one to Birmingham, Alabama before finishing in New Orleans. The Freedom Riders were riding an integrated bus to protest Alabama's Jim Crow segregation laws that denied African Americans their civil rights. One of the buses was attacked and firebombed by a mob outside Anniston on Mother's Day, Sunday, May 14, 1961. Prior to the bus being firebombed, attackers broke windows, and slashed tires, using metal pipes, clubs, chains and crowbars, before <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>came</b> to escort the bus away. The bus was forced to a stop just outside of Anniston, in front of Forsyth and Sons grocery, by more mob members. As more windows were broken, rocks and eventually a firebomb were thrown into the bus. As the bus burned, the mob held the doors shut, intent on burning the riders to death. An exploding fuel tank caused the mob to retreat, allowing the riders to escape the bus. The riders were viciously beaten as they tried to flee, where warning shots fired into the air by highway patrolmen prevented the riders from being lynched on the spot,. as well as a young girl by the name of Janie Forsyth. The then 12-year-old girl set out against the mob with a bucket of water and cups to help the Riders, first tending to the one who had looked like her own nanny. Forsyth and Son grocery is located along Alabama Highway 202 about [...] west of downtown. The site today is home to a historic marker and was designated Freedom Riders National Monument by President Barack Obama in January 2017.|$|E
