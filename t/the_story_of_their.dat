5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence Kling, five years older than he, as the {{daughter}} of a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man accustomed to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work from the time she could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> romance.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{libretto}} is original. The main {{plots of}} acts {{two and three}} are the librettists' invention, {{with only a few}} passing references to incidents and characters in Murger. Most of acts one and four follow the novel, piecing together episodes from various chapters. The final scenes in acts one and four—the scenes with Rodolfo and Mimì—resemble both the play and the novel. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> meeting closely follows chapter 18 of the novel, in which the two lovers living in the garret are not Rodolphe and Mimì at all, but rather Jacques and Francine. The story of Mimì's death in the opera draws from two different chapters in the novel, one relating Francine's death and the other relating Mimì's.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} quite how {{the letters of}} Abelard and Héloïse came to be preserved. There are brief and factual {{references}} to their relationship by 12th-century writers including William Godel and Walter Map. It seems unlikely, however, that the letters were widely known in this period. Rather, the earliest manuscripts of the letters are dated to the late 13th century. It therefore {{seems likely that the}} letters sent between Abelard and Héloïse were kept by Héloïse at the Paraclete along with the 'Letters of Direction', and that more than a century after her death they were brought to Paris and copied. At this time, <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> love affair was summarised by Jean de Meun in his continuation to Le Roman de la Rose.|$|E

25|$|Privation {{had made}} a man of him, and in these little books he proves himself a poet of deep feeling and {{considerable}} power of expression. The stirring incidents in the political emancipation of Portugal inspired his muse, and he describes the bitterness of exile, the adventurous expedition to Terceira, the heroic defence of Porto, and the final combats of liberty. In 1837 he founded the Panorama in imitation of the English Penny Magazine, and there and in Illustração he published the historical tales which were afterwards collected into Lendas e Narrativas; {{in the same year}} he became royal librarian at the Ajuda Palace, which enabled him to continue his studies of the past. The Panorama had a large circulation and influence, and Herculano's biographical sketches of great men and his articles of literary and historical criticism did much to educate the middle class by acquainting them with <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> nation, and with the progress of knowledge and the state of letters in foreign countries.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings {{came into}} the game with great {{confidence}} internally but none by the wider league. They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E
25|$|Deuteronomy {{occupies}} a puzzling {{position in the}} Bible, linking {{the story of the}} Israelites' wanderings in the wilderness to <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> history in Canaan without quite belonging totally to either. The wilderness story could end quite easily with Numbers, and the story of Joshua's conquests could exist without it, at least {{at the level of the}} plot; but in both cases there would be a thematic (theological) element missing. Scholars have given various answers to the problem. The Deuteronomistic history theory is currently the most popular (Deuteronomy was originally just the law code and covenant, written to cement the religious reforms of Josiah, and later expanded to stand as the introduction to the full history); but there is an older theory which sees Deuteronomy as belonging to Numbers, and Joshua as a sort of supplement to it. This idea still has supporters, but the mainstream understanding is that Deuteronomy, after becoming the introduction to the history, was later detached from it and included with Genesis-Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers because it already had Moses as its central character. According to this hypothesis, the death of Moses was originally the ending of Numbers, and was simply moved from there to the end of Deuteronomy.|$|E
