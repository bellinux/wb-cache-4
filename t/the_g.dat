5|$|Since 2010, {{ridership}} on <b>the</b> <b>G</b> {{has risen}} 17%, with approximately 150,000 riders per weekday in 2015. It is the route with {{the fastest growing}} ridership base in the entire system. These improvements will also have the side benefit {{of being able to}} accommodate the growing ridership base in gentrified neighborhoods along <b>the</b> <b>G,</b> like Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Long Island City. This is due in part because <b>the</b> <b>G</b> weekday frequencies have become more dependable {{as a result of its}} 2013 review. However, weekend service was still lacking, according to some riders.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>G</b> {{operates}} {{at all times}} between Court Square in Long Island City, Queens, and Church Avenue in Kensington, Brooklyn, making local stops along its entire route. <b>The</b> <b>G</b> is the only non-shuttle service in the system that does not serve Manhattan. It suffers from constant service disruptions, infrequent train headways, few free transfers to other services, and low rolling stock capacity, leading to criticism from politicians and residents of the neighborhoods through which it travels. Since the 2000s, several improvements {{have been made to}} <b>the</b> <b>G,</b> including a route extension in Brooklyn and a full-route audit that identified solutions for issues on <b>the</b> <b>G</b> service.|$|E

5|$|Due to the MTA {{financial}} {{crisis in the}} late 2000s, <b>the</b> <b>G</b> was to be cut back from Forest Hills–71st Avenue to Court Square at all times beginning June 27, 2010. However, due to planned track repairs during the times <b>the</b> <b>G</b> normally ran on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, it ceased running on that line on April 19. In addition, train headways were reduced, which inconvenienced about 201,000 weekly commuters since they had to wait longer for G trains.|$|E

40|$|Using three surveys, a {{comparative}} assessment of needle performance and patient preference for 27 -gauge (G) and 29 G needles for glatiramer acetate administration for multiple sclerosis therapy was performed.

In Survey 1 on <b>the</b> 27 <b>G</b> needle, 545 (82. 70 %) patients reported no needle problems, 106 (16. 09 %) cited one type (dull, bent, or broken), five (0. 76 %) cited two types, and three (0. 46 %) cited all three types. In Survey 2 on <b>the</b> 29 <b>G</b> needle, 553 (98. 05 %) indicated no problems, two (0. 35 %) cited dull needles, and nine (1. 60 %) cited bent needles. On <b>the</b> 29 <b>G</b> needles versus 27 G needles pain comparison, 219 (38. 83 %) reported <b>the</b> 29 <b>G</b> needle was a little better, and 155 (27. 48 %) reported {{it was a lot}} better than <b>the</b> 27 <b>G.</b> For injection-site experiences, 515 patients (91. 31 %) reported no, very slight, or mild reactions with <b>the</b> 29 <b>G</b> needle.

5|$|A new county-designated highway {{appeared}} on maps {{for the first}} time in 1983, H-16; it was marked as running between US2 and M-28 only.

The roadway is part of the Forest Highway System that is funded and administered by the US Forest Service and the Federal Highway Administration; the system was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921.

G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{structure of}} multiferroic GdMn 2 O 5 is studied by x-ray magnetic scattering, both off resonance and in resonant conditions at <b>the</b> <b>Gd</b> LIII edge. Temperature dependence of magnetic Bragg reflections shows an initial incommensurate (ICM) ordering appearing at T∼ 40 K with magnetic propagation vector kICM ∼(0. 49 0 0. 18) which condenses at T∼ 33 K in a commensurate (CM) wave vector kCM=(1 / 2 0 0).

40|$|Luminescence-kinetics {{studies of}} Ce 3 +-doped GdP 3 O 9 metaphosphate, which was {{prepared}} by a melt-solution technique, are performed using time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy techniques at T = 4. 2 – 300 K. The processes of energy migration along <b>the</b> <b>Gd</b> 3 + sub-lattice and energy transfer between Gd 3 + and Ce 3 + ions are investigated. At low temperatures, <b>the</b> emission of <b>Gd</b> 3 + {{is caused by}} the radiative decay of its lowest-energy relaxed excited 6 P 7 / 2 state, and <b>the</b> <b>Gd</b> 3 + → Ce 3 + energy transfer is absent.

The phonon-assisted population of <b>the</b> <b>Gd</b> 3 + 6 P 5 / 2 excited level at T 150 K takes place owing to the thermally stimulated population of the highest-energy 6 P 3 / 2 excited level together with the lower energy shift of the Ce 3 + 4 f– 5 d 1 absorption band.
