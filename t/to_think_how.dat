Clark submitted recommendations to the governor on such diverse subjects as converting migratory fisherman into permanent colonists and establishing a textiles industry. In fact, Clark himself was taken aback by the apparent scope of his influence on colonial affairs, writing to his wife, “Governor Kuroda consults me constantly and always follows my advice.” He later wrote, “I tremble <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>how</b> much confidence is reposed in me and what responsibilities I am daily assuming.” ...|$|E
500|$|Producer John Lloyd, {{speaking}} to The Times in 1989 hinted {{that it was}} the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series: [...] "Things do get very tense by the end of a series, because everyone involved in the thing is very clever, and very funny, and they all want to push the scripts along. It's a very exhausting process, {{and by the end of}} it we all swear we'll never, ever, do another one. But then you start <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>how</b> rare it is to get so many good people in the same room and you talk yourself into doing another series." ...|$|E

The bout ended in a unanimous decision victory for Griffin and led to the show's renewal on Spike TV. Regarding the success of the show, UFC president Dana White said, [...] "It's amazing <b>to</b> <b>think....</b> <b>how</b> close we came to not being here today. If it weren't for what these guys did, I don't know if there would even be a UFC. I'll never forget these guys. Ever." ...|$|E

500|$|Maus proved {{difficult}} to classify to a genre, {{and has been}} called biography, fiction, autobiography, history, and memoir. [...] Spiegelman petitioned The New York Times to move it from [...] "fiction" [...] to [...] "non-fiction" [...] on the newspaper's bestseller list, saying, [...] "I shudder <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>how</b> David Duke... would respond to seeing a carefully researched work based closely on my father's memories of life in Hitler's Europe and in the death camps classified as fiction". [...] An editor responded, [...] "Let's go out to Spiegelman's house and if a giant mouse answers the door, we'll move it to the nonfiction side of the list!" [...] The Times eventually acquiesced. [...] The Pulitzer committee sidestepped the issue by giving the completed Maus a Special Award in Letters in 1992.|$|E

The A-side reached number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was later {{featured on the}} Beach Boys' album 20/20 on February 10, 1969. When Manson discovered he was uncredited on the single, he was furious and threatened Dennis Wilson with murder. Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks recalled [...] "One day, Charles Manson brought a bullet out {{and showed it to}} Dennis, who asked, 'What's this?' And Manson replied, 'It's a bullet. Every time you look at it, I want you <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>how</b> nice it is your kids are still safe'". Wilson confronted Manson about the incident, realizing Manson's growing erratic behavior, and ended their friendship soon after.|$|E
500|$|Balthier {{has been}} {{compared}} to other characters in fiction. Simon Wigham of Console Obsession called Balthier his [...] "favourite by quite a wide margin", comparing him to James Bond due to his [...] "humorous lines". RPGFan editor Stephen Harris compared his voice to that of Ian Fleming's depiction of Bond. 1UP.com editor Andrew Pfister compared the duo of Balthier and Fran to that of Han Solo and Chewbacca, two characters from the Star Wars franchise, adding that they are far more interesting than any other character in the [...] "modern FF era". Gideon Emery's work as Balthier's English voice actor was acclaimed by Eurogamer writer Martin Robinson {{as one of the best}} ones from the entire game as [...] "it's fascinating <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>how</b> the game's wider perception might have changed if he was placed as the leading man". In August 2017, Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age producer Hiroaki Katō discussed the possibilities of Balthier and Fran of having the their own spin-off games based on gamers' demands.|$|E

500|$|Further reviews {{tended to}} be negative. IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 6.0/10, {{explaining}} [...] "It's starting {{to feel as if}} Walter's loony logic is starting to influence the actual writing of Fringe." [...] Fickett criticized Walter's science and [...] "silly ranting", Olivia's stepfather storyline, and believed certain lines of dialogue to be [...] "dangerously close to self-parody." [...] Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the episode's science, and explained [...] "I really don't want any more of this. I'm tired of this formulaic series. I'm tired of Anna Torv's earnest, sad expressions—can we get this woman to laugh once or twice? Joshua Jackson and Kirk Acevedo are good supports and foils for Olivia, but there's no there there when it comes to Agent Dunham." [...] Patrick Kevin Day from the Los Angeles Times liked the opening sequence, but was distracted from fully enjoying the episode because he thought the science was [...] "wonky." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with a B, explaining he liked Chris Eigeman's presence and the efforts at further developing the characters, but questioned the Pattern storyline, despite admitting that he does not require rational scientific explanations in science fiction. Tim Grierson of New York Magazine disliked the focus on Olivia, calling it [...] "a long hour of television." [...] Referring to Olivia's [...] "feminist" [...] speech to Broyles, Grierson continued, [...] "It's sort of cute how Fringe occasionally pretends that it's more than just a freak show. But if they're going to focus on a character, it should be Walter — though we shudder <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>how</b> his flatulence will factor into the plot." ...|$|E

[...] "When I realized this, the logical next step was <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> <b>how</b> can I do a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change?" [...] He added that his goal with Walter White was to turn him from Mr. Chips into Scarface.|$|E

2500|$|The title role—"one of {{the most}} taxing and wide-ranging parts in the entire repertory"—is one {{of the most}} {{difficult}} in the soprano repertoire. It calls for great vocal control of range, flexibility, and dynamics as well as containing a wide range of emotions: conflict of personal and public life, romantic life, maternal love, friendship, jealousy, murderous intent, and resignation. The German soprano Lilli Lehmann once remarked that the singing of all three Brünnhilde roles of Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen in one evening would be less stressful than the singing of one Norma. She also commented [...] "When you sing Wagner, you are so carried away by the dramatic emotion, the action, and the scene that you do not have <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>how</b> to sing the words. That comes of itself. But in Bellini, you must always have a care for beauty of tone and correct emission."According to the Met Opera Archives Lehmann said this to Herald Tribune critic Henry Krehbiel.|$|E
2500|$|By this time, however, he {{had decided}} to further his {{education}} at a first-rate university. His first choice was Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. But he soon realized that he probably would not pass Vanderbilt's tough entrance examinations. So, in 1895, at the age of 28, Lomax matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in English literature, and undertaking almost a double course load (including Greek, Latin, and Anglo Saxon) and was graduated in two years. With a touch of Texas hyperbole, he later wrote:Never was there such a hopeless hodge-podge, There was I, a Chautauqua-educated country boy who couldn't conjugate an English verb or decline a pronoun, attempting to master three other languages at the same time. ... But I plunged on through the year, for since I was older than the average freshman, I must hurry, hurry, hurry. I don't think I ever stopped <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>how</b> foolish it all was. In his memoir, Adventures of a Ballad Hunter, Lomax recounts how he had arrived at the University of Texas with a roll of cowboy songs he had written down in childhood. He showed them to an English professor, Morgan Callaway, only to have them discounted as [...] "cheap and unworthy," [...] prompting Lomax to take the bundle behind the men's dormitory and burn it. His interest in folksongs thus rebuffed, Lomax focused his attentions on more acceptable academic pursuits. He joined the fraternity Phi Delta Theta and the Rusk Literary Society, as well as becoming an editor and later the editor-in-chief of the University of Texas Magazine. During the summer of 1896, he attended a summer school program in Chicago studying languages. In 1897, he became an associate editor of the Alcalde, a student newspaper. After graduation in June 1897, he worked at the University of Texas as registrar for the next six years until the spring of 1903. He also had other duties such as being personal secretary to the President of the University, manager of Brackenridge Hall (the men's dormitory on campus), and serving on the Alumni Scholarship Committee. Lomax joined a campus fraternity known as The Great and Honorable Order of Gooroos receiving the title [...] "Sybillene Priest".|$|E
