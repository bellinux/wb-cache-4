5|$|Her mantra may be {{repeated}} ten <b>thousand</b> <b>times,</b> repeated one <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> while offering flowers and ghee {{in a fire}} sacrifice, or repeated one hundred times while offering water (Arghya) or while offering food to Brahmin priests. Her yantra (sacred geometric diagram), whether physically constructed or mentally envisioned, is used in worship along with the mantra. Offering certain items to a fire sacrifice—particularly those performed at cremation grounds, river banks, forests, or crossroads—while repeating the mantra is said to fulfil specific goals. An offering of Bael leaves is said to result in kingship; salt gives the power to control; turmeric gives the power to paralyse; neem twigs bring wealth; and an offering of sandalwood, camphor and saffron together or a salt and honey mixture grants the power to attract people. A rice-flour bread prepared while repeating her mantra is said to give the power to attract women.

5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> the Sun may be more likely.|$|E

5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens {{about global warming}} via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given more than a <b>thousand</b> <b>times.</b> The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on global warming, which coincided {{with the opening of}} The Day After Tomorrow. Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before it}} becomes a red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today {{and a couple of}} <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E

5|$|The 55 Cancri {{system is}} located fairly {{close to the}} Solar System: the Hipparcos {{astrometry}} satellite measured the parallax of 55 Cancri A as 81.03 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of 12.3 parsecs (40.3 light years). 55 Cancri A has an apparent magnitude of 5.95, making it just {{visible to the naked}} eye under very dark skies. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th magnitude and only visible through a telescope. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of 1065 AU (one <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> the distance from the Earth to the Sun). Despite their wide separation, the two stars appear to be gravitationally bound, as they share a common proper motion.|$|E
5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value {{that was more than}} a <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and {{interstellar}} space begins is not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E

5|$|The solar wind, {{a stream}} of charged {{particles}} flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is {{the point at which}} pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out {{to the edge of the}} scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper {{layers of the}} atmosphere is quite rare. Probably the first one reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 fireball was more than a <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> as massive and it got 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating the trajectory of another Earth-grazing meteoroid, observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E
5|$|If, in {{the famous}} garden and {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend.

Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a <b>thousand</b> <b>times</b> by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician {{that he had to}} give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E
