40|$|The species {{composition}} and {{spatial distribution of}} a fish assemblage were studied in three reaches of a river in {{the east coast of}} Brazil: a section of rapids (upper), another of water flowing on plain terrain (lowland) and the other of a mangrove environment. Two methods were employed with the purpose of estimating their effectiveness in naturalistic studies of tropical fish assemblages. One method consisted of underwater observations and the other was characterized by catches using gears such as fish <b>traps,</b> <b>sieves</b> and fishing rods. Both methods showed that their effectiveness is dependent upon the characteristics of the environment and the biology of the species. In areas of high water transparency and flow speed, rocky substrate and no submerged marginal vegetation (upper reach), the employment of the traditional gears was quite inefficient, despite the excellent conditions for underwater observations. In areas of clear water and high flow speed with abundant submerged marginal vegetation (lowland and mangrove), the gears were rather efficient yielding excellent results when coupled with direct observation methods. Since the abiotic characteristics of a stream change longitudinally, it is appropriate to employ different methods {{in the study of the}} ichthyofauna composition and distribution in order to reduce the constraints imposed by sampling methods in running waters.

40|$|Aims Picea asperata {{is one of}} the {{keystone}} spruce species used for reforestation in subalpine coniferous forest of western Sichuan, China. A total of ca. 13 000 hm 2 of plantations are dominated by this species in this region. Our objective was to assess (a) potential for natural regeneration and (b) critical factors limiting regeneration of this tree species in spruce plantations. Methods We conducted field studies on the seed rain, soil seed bank dynamics and seedling establishment in a 65 -year spruce plantation in Miyaluo subalpine coniferous forest of western Sichuan, China from 2002 to 2008. We used seed <b>traps,</b> <b>sieved</b> to determine the soil seed bank, and recorded seedlings. Important findings Pinus asperata seed rain commonly lasted from early October to the end of January or early February. There was a large annual variation in seed production, with mast years at 4 -year intervals. We concluded that seed availability was not a limiting factor for natural regeneration, at least in mast years. The seed bank was transient, with losses from seed decay and seed predation being the two most important factors affecting seed bank dynamics. Only a small fraction of seeds germinated and produced seedlings, e. g., 3. 6 % in 2002. Higher seedling mortality greatly reduced the total number of germinated seedlings, and few seedlings survived after one growing season. Deep litter and moss were the most common substrates for P. asperata regeneration, having 93 % of all germinated seedlings. Most surviving seedlings occurred with a substrate depth of 0 – 2 cm, and seedling mortality increased with greater depth, suggesting substrate depth is an important constraint on natural regeneration. Seedlings on moss substrate had greater root collar diameter, number of green shoots, estimated dry weight and annual dry weight increment but less height than those on litter substrate. In conclusion, despite a substantial seed production, high depletion of soil seed, low germination and high seedling mortality limit natural regeneration of P. asperata...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{sandy beaches}} on Malta and two on Gozo were sampled for {{macrofauna}} {{to test the}} hypothesis that Maltese beaches have an intrinsically low diversity. Stations distributed in the supralittoral (dry zone), mediolittoral (wet zone) and upper infralittoral (submerged zone to 1 m water depth) were sampled by sieving core samples and standardised searching during daytime, and pitfall trapping and standardised sweeping of the water column using a hand-net at night, as appropriate. Physical parameters of the sediment were measured and human occupancy of the beaches was estimated. From the supralittoral and mediolittoral, 39 species represented by 1584 individuals were collected by the combined techniques of pitfall <b>trapping,</b> <b>sieving</b> and standard searching. For Ramla beach, which had the highest diversity, 267 individuals representing 25 infaunal species were collected by sieving from a combined volume of 1. 175 m 3 of sand, and 149 individuals representing 28 epifaunal species were collected by standardised searching from a combined area of 700 m 2 of sand during two winter and two summer sampling sessions between 1992 and 1993. For nine other beaches sampled during the summer of 2000, only six macrofaunal species were collected from core samples, with overall population densities ranging from 4. 13 to 45. 45 individualsm 2. Only 92 individuals belonging to 12 species were collected by hand-net from the uppermost infralittoral of five beaches sampled using this method during the summer of 2000. Taxa of gastropods, bivalves, decapods, mysids and staphylinid beetles generally abundant on Mediterranean sandy beaches, were entirely absent from the beaches sampled. Few correlations that could explain the impoverishment of Maltese sandy beaches were found between physical parameters and faunal abundances, and other factors such as inadequate sampling effort, human disturbance and marine pollution were also excluded; however, seasonally biased sampling may partly explain the results obtained. One factor that may explain why certain species are missing could be lack of recruitment, due to Malta’s geographical isolation from the European and African mainlands. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested the method on a soil at a grassland site, and using a synthetic soil created to provide a contrasting isotopic signature. As with other passive sampling techniques, a small amount of fractionation of the 13 C isotope occurs during sampling, which we have quantified, otherwise the results show that the molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>traps</b> a sufficiently large and representative sample of CO 2 for C isotope analysis.

40|$|Os riachos e rios são ambientes lóticos, caracterizados por um fluxo de água forte e unidirecional, com ictiofauna de pequeno porte e geralmente endêmica. Os estudos sobre ecologia trófica e partilha de recursos nestes ambientes são importantes no entendimento da dinâmica da comunidade no ambiente e na manutenção das espécies. Os objetivos do presente trabalho foram estudar a ecologia trófica da ictiofauna no córrego da Lapa e analisar os padrões de simpatria de espécies congenéricas nesta bacia. A microbacia do córrego da Lapa localiza-se na região central do estado de São Paulo em relevo de cuestas basálticas. O estudo foi realizado por meio de quatro coletas sazonais, {{realizadas}} entre abril de 2002 e fevereiro de 2003 nos períodos diurno e noturno. Foram amostradas 12 estações distribuídas nos córregos da Lapa, Cantagalo e no rio Passa Cinco com o auxílio de tarrafas, peneiras, peneirões, armadilhas iscadas e redes de emalhar. A dieta de 29 espécies foi analisada, sendo que o principal hábito alimentar foi o insetívoro, seguido por algívoro - iliófago e onívoro. A sobreposição alimentar foi alta em diversas espécies, mas houve segregação de hábitat em boa parte delas. A dieta de três espécies foi alterada no gradiente nascente foz. Os padrões de simpatria foram analisados em três gêneros: Bryconamericus, Apareiodon e Astyanax, sendo que o alimento foi o principal recurso partilhado pela maioria destas espécies, seguido pelo espaço. Os resultados mostraram que a microbacia encontra-se ainda bem preservada, mas que investimentos na sua manutenção e recuperação são necessários. Streams {{and rivers}} are loctic environments characterized {{for a strong}} and unidirectional water flow. These environments in general have the light incidence partial or totally obstructed by the canopy of the riparian vegetation showing a high dependence of allocthonus organic inputs. The stream fishes are usually small sized, with reproductive strategies adapted to the unstable environment and have great trophic plasticity. The endemism is very common in this ictiofauna. The studies on trophic ecology and resources partitioning are important for {{the understanding of the}} community dynamics in the environment and the maintenance of the species. The Lapa Stream Watershed is located in the central region of the São Paulo State on area of basaltic cuesta relief. The surroundings of these streams are relatively well preserved and the main economic activities of the region are farming and ecotourism. This study was performed throughout four seasonal fish collections, carried out between April of 2002 and February of 2003 in the diurnal and nocturnal periods. Twelve collection stations were distributed in Lapa and Cantagalo Streams and in Passa Cinco River and sampling were made using cast nets, baited <b>traps,</b> <b>sieves,</b> and gill nets. The diet of 29 species were studied and it was found that insetivory was the main alimentary habit, followed by iliophagy - algivory and omnivory. The alimentary overlapping was high in several species pairs, but the habitat segregation occurred in some of them. The diet of three species altered along the upstream downstream gradient. The patterns of simpatry had been analyzed in three genera: Bryconamericus, Apareiodon and Astyanax and the food was the main resource partitioned among these species followed by the space resource.

40|$|Agricultural {{soils are}} the {{greatest}} source of human derived greenhouse gases to the atmosphere (Braswell, 1987). Because of this a number of efforts are underway to minimize the {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} from soils that include use of organic fertilizers and no-till practices. Such mitigation practices, however, require verification particularly at national and international levels where carbon credits can be bought and sold. For this reason, we propose the development of an autonomous soil gas flux chamber that, once deployed, automatically traps greenhouse gases (CO 2 and N 2 O) being released from soils to the atmosphere {{for months at a time}} (an Automated Trace Gas-Trapping System or ATGTS). The ATGTS consists of a flux chamber to collect gas evolving from soils, chemical or molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>traps</b> to remove water and trap CO 2 and N 2 O, a pumping system that periodically turns on and off to move gases through the chemical traps, a system for collecting and distributing rain-water within the flux chamber, and a power system consisting of a 24 V battery.

40|$|Carbon dioxide evasion from {{inland waters}} such as lakes, {{rivers and streams}} {{represents}} a significant component of the global carbon cycle, yet {{in many parts of}} the world, relatively little is known about its source. Radiocarbon dating of aquatic CO 2 has the potential to provide new insights into C cycling in the terrestrial–aquatic–atmosphere continuum, and whilst a range of methods are available for the collection of samples for 14 C analysis, they all have limitations or disadvantages (e. g. slow collection rates and potential non-equilibrium). These issues are further compounded in remote field sites. Here, we describe a new method for the field collection of CO 2 samples from low-pH waters (pH < 7) for radiocarbon analysis, which involves a scaled-up version of the widely used headspace equilibration technique coupled with syringe injection of samples into molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>traps</b> for convenient and stable storage.

The purpose of the present work is to examine the applicability of these methods to the study of surface phenomena by using the water vapor adsorption on Ti 02 as an example. The instrument is specially designed (Rigaku Denki Co.

40|$|The age {{and source}} of CO 2 {{released}} from water surfaces {{to the atmosphere}} provides significant insight into the processes that control this important flux in key areas of the biosphere, such as peatlands and tropical river systems. Two approaches currently exist that enable the isotopic composition of CO 2 lost by evasion (degassing) to be either measured or estimated. 13 C-CO 2 and 14 C-CO 2 can be measured directly using a molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>trapping</b> system attached to a floating chamber, or indirectly by calculation from DIC.

On six occasions, samples of evaded CO 2 were collected above the water surface for the determination of d 13 C and 14 C. Simultaneously, samples of streamwater were collected for the determination of the isotopic composition of DIC. Our results suggest that whereas on some occasions the radiocarbon ages of evaded CO 2 and DIC were similar, on others the measured 14 C-DIC age was significantly older. Differences were also observed between the directly measured and calculated d 13 C-CO 2 values. We critically evaluate both methods, highlight the importance of making the appropriate isotopic corrections for evasion CO 2, and conclude that care needs to be taken in applying the indirect approach, as some of the inherent assumptions associated with equilibrium conditions used in the underlying calculation may not hold in certain aquatic systems...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{increasingly}} recognized that {{dramatic changes in}} magma storage conditions can occur over very {{short periods of time}} at a single volcano and might be in close relationships with stress variations imposed on the crustal plumbing by the overlying volcano as it changes shape and volume over time. The Santorini volcano (South Aegean Arc) is an ideal target to unravel these potential relationships as its history is marked by alternating episodes of edifice construction and caldera collapses and the chronostratigraphy is well constrained. We focused our study on the products of the four major, dominantly silicic, explosive eruptions of Santorini: the Lower Pumice 1 and 2 (200 to 180 ka; 1 st explosive cycle) and, the Cape Riva and the Minoan (~ 21 to 3 ka, 2 nd explosive cycle). In order to precisely define the P, T, fO 2, X (X for volatiles) storage conditions of the silicic magmas prior to these eruptions, we carried out a detailed micro-petrological and geochemical study on natural samples combined with an experimental work. The selected silicic components of the four eruptions are dacite to rhyodacite (SiO 2 = 67 - 70 wt. %) with similar mineral paragenesis (plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, ilmenite, magnetite, apatite ± pyrrhotite) and crystallinity < 20 %. High resolution BSE images of plagioclase and pyroxene phenocrysts and EMPA profiles reveal a complex crystallization history. Plagioclases display fine-scale oscillatory normal zoning, resorbtion zones where melt inclusions (MI) of rhyolitic compositions were <b>trapped,</b> and An-rich <b>sieved</b> cores. Clinopyroxenes also show zoning patterns and include rhyolitic MI. Both interstitial glass and MI are Cl-rich (~ 3000 ppm) while F and S are less abundant (F ≤ 700 ppm, S ≤ 100 ppm). Determination of H 2 O contents by SIMS is in progress at the CRPG-Nancy (previous measurements from the literature gave ~ 5 wt. % H 2 O in the Minoan rhyodacite and ~ 4 wt. % in the Lower Pumice 2). Ilmenite-magnetite geothermometry indicates temperatures ranging from ~ 850 to 900 °C and deltaNNO ~ - 1. For experimental work, the natural rocks were melted twice at 1400 °C and 1 atm; the resulting dry glasses were used as starting materials. Each composition was loaded in Au capsules as powdered glass together with known amounts of water and CO 2 (added as silver oxalate) keeping the XH 2 Oloaded [=moles of H 2 O/(H 2 O+CO 2) ] in the range 1 - 0. 6. We run crystallization experiments by using an Internally Heated Pressure Vessel (ISTO-CNRS) pressurised by an Ar-H 2 mixture. The investigated conditions were: T = 850 °C and 900 °C with P = 2 and 4 kbar and fO 2 ~ FMQ, for a total of 20 charges per experiment. The experimental products are analysed by SEM and then by EMPA for major elements compositions of the glass and minerals. Dissolved water content will be determined using the "by difference" method and the SIMS. The experimental work is still in progress; the results of this set of experiments will be presented in our communication...|$|R
