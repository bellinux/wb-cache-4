5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on the tropical depression, {{the government of the}} Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm watch from Barahona to its border with Haiti, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic westward to Port-au-Prince. The United States' National Hurricane Center in Miami recommended interests in eastern Cuba to monitor <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> the storm. When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to its border with Haiti. While located 155miles (250km) from the coast of Hispaniola, the government of the Dominican Republic extended the tropical storm warning eastward to Isla Saona, while the government of Haiti upgraded its watch area to a tropical storm warning along the coast. The National Hurricane Center also recommended citizens in the Bahamas to monitor <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> the storm. After the heavy rainfall began in the Dominican Republic, officials evacuated citizens of low-lying areas.|$|E

5|$|Very minimal impact {{occurred}} {{as a result}} from Hurricane Alberto. Dakar, Senegal, received 25mm (1in) of rain as the pre-Alberto tropical wave passed over the city. A discussion was issued on August 9 advising residents in Bermuda to monitor <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> the storm until it safely passed. Also, from August 12 to August 14, public advisories were issued advising people from Azores to monitor <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane Alberto. This stopped when Alberto began to slow its motion and began {{to turn to the}} south, away from the Azores. Some swells were reported along the east coast of the United States {{a few days after the}} storm's recurvature. No reports were available on the impact of Alberto on Iceland, but it was estimated that winds of at least tropical storm force were experienced there. Otherwise, there were no known reports of damage or casualties as a result of Hurricane Alberto.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{endeavour}} {{to expose}} the public to more foreign-language works, Johnson facilitated the translation of educational texts, serious fiction, and philosophy (he was less interested in translating popular novels). In particular, he promoted the translation {{of the works of}} persecuted French Girondins, such as Condorcet's Outlines of an Historical View of <b>the</b> <b>Progress</b> <b>of</b> the Human Mind (1795) and Madame Roland's An Appeal to Impartial Posterity (1795), which he had released in English within weeks of its debut in France. His publication of a translation of Constanin Volney's deistic Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) quickly became a bestseller. Johnson also had some of the most prominent French children's literature translated, such as the works of Madame de Genlis.|$|E

In April, Leiber and Stoller were called for a meeting in New York City to show <b>the</b> <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> the repertoire. The writers, who had not produced any material, toured the city and were confronted {{in a hotel room}} by Jean Aberbach, who locked them into their hotel room by blocking the hotel room door with a sofa until they wrote the material. Presley recorded the soundtrack at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on April 30 and May 3, with an additional session at the MGM Soundstage on May 9. During post-production, the songs were dubbed into the films scenes, in which Presley mimed the lyrics.|$|E
