However, molecular analysis of DNA sequences {{showed that the}} most species belonged in the family Psathyrellaceae, distinct from the type species {{that belonged to the}} Agaricaceae. It was given its current binomial name in 2001 as a result, as this and other species were moved to the new genus Coprinopsis.|$|E

Signifying the ship's importance the launch had been planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> elaborate festive event, however as the court was still in mourning for Queen Alexandra's father who had died twelve days before, she did not attend and a more sober event occurred.|$|E
5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives.

5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known}} as Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E

Instead of searching for a full-time replacement, the band recruited Jason Gerken, formerly of Shiner, to play drums on the record. Production of their sixth album, entitled Rival Factions, followed suit with Deftones engineer Ulrich Wild.

The global production of palladium from mines was 222tonnes in 2006 {{according to the}} United States Geological Survey. Many are concerned about {{a steady supply of}} palladium in the wake of Russia's military maneuvers in Ukraine, partly as sanctions could hamper Russian palladium exports; any restrictions on Russian palladium exports would exacerbate what is already expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> palladium deficit in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> ape in the forest. The other team members investigate {{for a couple of}} days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to contact them at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{pterosaur}} researcher Alexander Kellner revisited H.W. Miller's classification. Kellner followed Miller's {{opinion that}} {{the differences between the}} Pteranodon species were great enough to place them into different genera. He placed P. sternbergi into the genus named by Miller, Geosternbergia, along with the Pierre Shale skull specimen which Bennett had previously considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> male P. longiceps. Kellner argued that this specimen's crest, though incompletely preserved, was most similar to Geosternbergia. Because the specimen was millions of years younger than any known Geosternbergia, he assigned it to the new species Geosternbergia maysei. Numerous other pteranodont specimens are known from the same formation and time period, and Kellner suggested they may belong to the same species as G. maysei, but because they lack skulls, he could not confidently identify them.|$|E

5|$|When the 1864 {{treaty was}} signed, the Klamath Tribes, with much less land, became short on the stream water needed for fishing. Although from the 1950s to the 1970s {{they were not}} federally recognized, the tribes never lost their water rights, and in 2001, when Klamath Basin farmers twice sued the U.S. Department of the Interior for more access to {{irrigation}} water, their rights were upheld. The tribes' water allotments for fishing continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> factor in Klamath Basin water disputes in the 21stcentury. In 2013, the Tribe's water rights were enforced for the first time, in {{what is known as}} a 'Water Call'. The Klamath Tribe called upon their in-stream water right, which was enforced by the Water Master. This resulted in almost all upper-basin irrigation being denied water, except for groundwater irrigators. The Klamath Project, however, was not called upon.|$|E
