5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover, {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada {{since the turn of the}} century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. <b>The</b> <b>rabbit</b> that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but <b>the</b> <b>rabbit</b> that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|E

The wolves also blame <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> for a lightning strike that kills one of the wolves because [...] "it is well known that lettuce-eaters cause lightning". After the wolves announce plans [...] "to civilize" [...] <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> if they don't stop causing natural disasters, <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> decide to flee to an island. However, the other nameless animals - living out of harm's way - convince <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> to stay because [...] "This is no world for escapists" [...] and guarantee them protection against the wolves - [...] "in all probability".|$|R

5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on {{the southern end of}} Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also help to keep more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of <b>the</b> <b>rabbit</b> population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster <b>the</b> <b>rabbit</b> population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E

5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, <b>the</b> <b>rabbit</b> {{haemorrhagic disease}} virus {{was introduced to}} Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing immunity to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.|$|E

50|$|If this {{population}} of rabbits occurred {{in an environment}} that had areas of black rocks as well as areas of white rocks, <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> with black fur would be able to hide from predators amongst the black rocks, and <b>the</b> <b>rabbits</b> with white fur likewise amongst the white rocks. <b>The</b> <b>rabbits</b> with grey fur, however, would stand out in all areas of the habitat, and would thereby suffer greater predation.|$|R
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as <b>the</b> <b>rabbit</b> brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E
5|$|Chao have {{appeared}} in many games in the series, beginning with Sonic Adventure in 1998.

Most notably, the character Cream <b>the</b> <b>Rabbit</b> has a Chao named Cheese, whom she uses to attack enemies. They have also appeared in games outside the series, the Sonic the Hedgehog comics, and the Sonic X anime, as well as being featured in promotions and merchandise. Critics have given mixed opinions on Chao and their integration into Sonic gameplay, generally praising their worth as a diversion but criticizing Chao minigames' low interactivity.|$|E

5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits.

There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing <b>the</b> <b>rabbit,</b> just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E
5|$|Journalists often {{visited the}} set and wrote {{positively}} about the production.
