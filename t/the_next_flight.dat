During the orbiter's stay, Titov and Parazynski conducted a spacewalk to affix a cap to the docking module for a future attempt by crew members to seal the leak in Spektrs hull. Wolf spent 119 days aboard Mir with the EO-24 crew and was replaced during STS-89 with Andy Thomas, who carried out the last US expedition on Mir. The EO-25 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-27 in January 1998 before Thomas returned to Earth on the final Shuttle–Mir mission, STS-91.|$|E
5|$|At a music festival, Sunny is embarrassed when Ringo and Declan Napier (James Sorensen) {{interrupt}} a kiss {{between her}} and Zeke. She runs off into the bush, falls down a cliff and injures her ankle. Zeke also falls down the cliff, they are eventually rescued by Declan and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Karl and Susan call Sunny's parents and learn that they know nothing about the festival or Zeke. Sunny's parents demand that she is placed on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>flight</b> home. However, Zeke moves out, so Sunny's parents will not worry about them having a relationship. Zeke later moves back home and Karl asks Sunny to call her father and translate for him. Sunny lies to her father {{about the nature of}} the conversation and tells him that her father said everything is fine.|$|E

5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>flight,</b> ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of DNL. It also applied, {{though the}} sister company Braathens Helikopter, for {{concessions}} for helicopter services from Stavanger to offshore oil platforms. As a reaction, the incumbent, Helikopter Service, applied for Braathens SAFEs West Coast routes. At this point, SAS bought 15% of Helikopter Service. In 1984, Braathens SAFE introduced services to Farsund Airport, using wet leased F-27s from Busy Bee. The same arrangement {{was used to}} connect Haugesund to Bergen and Stavanger. In Haugesund, this was in competition with Norving. Busy Bee-operated planes were also used on routes from Sandefjord in competition with Norsk Flytjeneste. The same year, the cabin crew had a 14-day strike, halting all flights. It {{was caused by the}} company paying lower wages than SAS and Busy Bee. In 1985, a new booking system was introduced, that allowed overbooking. This gave increased revenue, but the company had to start compensating rejected passengers with a full refund and a free seat on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>flight.</b> On 16 December 1985, the airline's administration moved into the a new building, the Diamond, located at Fornebu. The frequent flyer program Bracard was launched in September 1985. It was a cooperation with Inter Nor Hotels, and gave special privileges to travelers that made 25 full-price trips per year with Braathens.|$|E

He called Prime Minister Gordon Brown [...] "the biggest coward in Europe" [...] and remarked, [...] "Of course I will come back". Wilders had visited the United Kingdom in December 2008 without any problem. In response to the ban, both Pearson and Cox accused the government of [...] "appeasing" [...] militant Islam.|$|R
50|$|X PRIZE rules {{required}} that the date and place of competitive flights be announced to the X PRIZE Foundation at least 60 days before the flight. Due to problems encountered during flight 15P on June 21, 2004, Scaled Composites did not immediately set a date for their competitive flights, suspecting that another test flight might be required. By July 7, 2004 Burt Rutan reported that the faults had been resolved and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>flights</b> would be competitive. On July 27, 2004, the X PRIZE Foundation announced that Scaled Composites had given notice that they would make their first competitive flight on September 29, 2004.|$|R
25|$|On 29 September 2008, NASA {{announced}} {{that due to}} {{a problem with the}} Hubble telescope, they would be revising the manifest to postpone STS-125 until 2009, so a solution to the issue with the telescope could be integrated into the flight plan. This moved STS-126 to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>flight,</b> so on 23 October 2008 Endeavour was moved from launch pad 39B to 39A.|$|E
25|$|Although Apollo 6 did {{not reach}} full translunar {{velocities}} in either direction, it was considered successful enough to fly astronauts on the next Saturn V, which in addition was tasked {{to send them to}} the Moon (lunar orbit) instead of the previously-planned Earth orbit for Apollo 8 the following December. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>flight,</b> Apollo 7, which did not use a Saturn V, was used to first test the manned capability of Apollo, doing so in Earth orbit.|$|E

40|$|Archeops, a balloon-borne experiment, {{will provide}} a {{measurement}} of CMB anistropies from large to small angular scale thanks to its large sky coverage (30 %), its high angular resolution (10 arcminutes), and its high signal-to-noise ratio due to high sensitivity 100 mK cooled bolometers. We will therefore {{be able to put}} strong constraints on the value of the cosmological parameters. Archeops flew already twice, once in Sicily for a technical flight in 1999, and once from Sweden for its first scientific flight in January 2001.

This angered Russo and later that day Russo exploded during a close-door meeting with management. According to Russo, that was their worst fight ever. The duo didn’t talk, or even look at each other, during commercial breaks for 2 and a half months. Francesa said he went on vacation in the summer of 2000 and told WFAN to figure something out because he refused to work with Russo again when he returned.|$|E
500|$|Communication between {{company and}} band was almost non-existent, and Pink Floyd's {{relationship}} with Tower and Capitol was therefore poor.

500|$|While the Catalina was {{suitable}} for postal flights, {{it was not}} {{suitable for}} a permanent solution for transporting passengers and freight, mainly due to its small size. Store Norske contacted the domestic airline Braathens SAFE for a regular service. The first trial flight was made on 2 April 1959 with a Douglas DC-4 with 54 passengers from Bardufoss Airport. Store Norske cleared a [...] runway for the aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>flight</b> was done in 1962, followed by one in 1963 and two in 1964. Due to lack of runway lights, flights could only be done during daylight, thus hindering flights during parts of December and January, when the sun never rises. By April, the runway could melt, and no flights could be done during summer. Navigation was conducted using radio signals from Bear Island and Isfjord.|$|E

I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>flight</b> I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
