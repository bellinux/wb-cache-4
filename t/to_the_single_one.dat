40|$|Measurements of {{azimuthal}} correlations at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) {{have shown}} an away-side that is suppressed in Au+Au collisions compared to proton+proton/Deuteron+proton collisions. Such suppression {{is taken as}} a signature of the predicted QCD dense medium. However, the near-side of the azimuthal correlations shows little modification. The near-side of such correlations {{is related to the}} ratio of the dihadron fragmentation function <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>one.</b> As such, dihadron fragmentation functions shall provide a better basis for the interpretation of the near-side correlations. Dihadron fragmentation functions also also provide a baseline of such measurements in heavy ion collisions...|$|E
40|$|The global phase {{coherence}} in doubly-connected superconductors {{leads to}} fluxoid quantization, allowing the superfluid velocity vs {{to be controlled}} by an applied magnetic flux. In ultrasmall samples this quantization requirement leads, surprisingly, to the destruction of the phase coherence itself around half-integer flux quanta, because of the sample-size-induced growth in vs, as predicted by de Gennes. We report observations of the predicted phenomenon in ultrathin Al and Au 0. 7 In 0. 3 cylinders, and the corresponding phase diagram for ultrathin superconducting cylinders.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Repair of cracked {{components}} by an adhesively bonded composite patch {{has gained}} acceptance in aerospace structures. The {{advantages of the}} double symmetric repair compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> are well known. These advantages permit a significant reduction of the stress intensity near the repaired defect. In this study, a new approach {{was used to determine}} the advantage of the double symmetric patch: it is the determination of the mass gain obtained by the use of the double patch if the two techniques (single and double patches) give the same stress intensity at the crack tip. The mass gain was estimated numerically using the three-dimensional finite element method for repaired inclined cracks. The obtained results show that the mass gain eventually obtained by the use of the double patch can be very significant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{implementation}} of a new Kanban system in an electronic connector plant is described in this paper. The plant was characterized by relatively long setup time of machines, high variety of products and multiple machines to multiple assembly lines in job assignment. It’s verified that the traditional Kanban system is not suitable for the plant’s production system under study. A multi-triangular Kanban system was developed to avoid the potential negative effects caused by long setup time and high variety of product types. For the job assignment problem, Kanban allocation was modeled and solved using integer programming. Simulation was run to determine optimal parameter values, including batch size and low control limit, {{as well as to}} compare the multi-triangular Kanban system with the single triangular Kanban system. The results show that the multi-triangular Kanban system is superior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> in reducing the WIP of the system...|$|E
40|$|Employing oval shaped quantum billiards {{connected}} by quantum wires as {{the building blocks}} of a linear quantum dot array, we calculate the ballistic magnetoconductance in the linear response regime. Optimizing the geometry of the billiards, we aim at a maximal finite- over zero-field ratio of the magnetoconductance. This switching effect arises from a relative phase change of scattering states in the oval quantum dot through the applied magnetic field, which lifts a suppression of the transmission characteristic for a certain range of geometry parameters. It is shown that a sustainable switching ratio is reached for a very low field strength, which is multiplied by connecting only a second dot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>one.</b> The impact of disorder is addressed in the form of remote impurity scattering, which poses a temperature dependent lower bound for the switching ratio, showing that this effect should be readily observable in experiments.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the time-dependent transport properties of single and double quantum-impurity systems {{based on the}} hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach. In the Kondo regime, the dynamical current in both cases is found oscillating due to the temporal coherence of electrons tunneling through the device, which shares the same mechanism as the single-level resonance without e-e interactions but shows some different characteristics. For single quantum-impurity systems, the temperature T plays an inhibitory action to the oscillations of dynamic current through its suppression to the Kondo effects. The amplitude of the current oscillations is attenuated by the e-e interaction $U$ in the Kondo regime. The frequency of the current oscillation is found almost independent of T and U. For parallel-coupling double quantum-impurity systems, the oscillation of the current shows similar behaviors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>one,</b> but with two-to-three times larger amplitudes. At the limit of small inter-impurity coupling the oscillation of the current exhibits enhanced characters while it is weakened at the other limit. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|Distribution {{characteristics}} of fish assemblages and environmental variation in emerged plant, floating-leaved plant and blank habitats were studied. Emergent plant habitat supported the greatest fish biomass, density and body size, followed by floating-leaved plant habitat, {{and those of}} blank habitat was the lowest. Transparency of emergent plant habitat decreased during the period, but of blank habitat increased. Species number of dominant fish of emergent plant habitat compared to the others decreased from four species, i. e., Hemicculter leuciclus, Pseudobrama simoni, Carassius auratus and Ophicephalus argus in May <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>one,</b> C. auratus in September. Those of blank habitat increased from two species, H. leuciclus and Pseudorasbora parva to four species, H. leuciclus, C. auratus, P. parva and O. argus. This result suggested that emergent plant with excessively high density could worsen habitat physical and chemical conditions, resulted in the fish’s emigration to unvegetated area. Those of floating-leaved plant habitat from two species, Cultrichthys erythropterus and P. simoni, changed into four species, C. erythropterus, P. simoni, H. leuciclus and P. parva. The increasing structure complexity and biomass of floating-leaved macrophyte promoted the increase of dominant fish species number with seasonal change. C. auratus, C. erythropterus and H. leuciclus displayed special preferences on emergent plant, floating-leaved plant and blank habitats respectively. Fish’s special habitat preference was determined by plant physical morphology, habitat characteristics and fish breeding habits. </p...|$|E

For this study a comparison of a natural, mechanical and hybrid ventilation system applied to a school building has been made by means of detailed modeling.

Control strategies were set <b>to</b> obtain <b>the</b> same indoor climate for all ventilation modes and <b>to</b> fulfill <b>the</b> requirements of EN 15251. The modeling of the hybrid ventilation system resulted in a primary energy demand for fans electricity and heating of 10 - 11 kWh/m² per year in all three locations. Compared to that, natural and demand-controlled mechanical ventilation resulted in a primary energy demand of 18 - 21 kWh/m² per year in Munich and Copenhagen and 16 - 18 kWh/m² per year in London.
