The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>center,</b> their height above the galactic plane, and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life.|$|E

5|$|Early {{research}} on the galactic habitable zone, including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward, did not demarcate any specific boundaries, merely stating that the zone was an annulus encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation, and that habitability {{would be more likely}} in the galaxy's thin disk.

5|$|SIM Lite {{measurements}} of Milky Way stars were to yield data to understand four topics: fundamental galactic parameters, the Oort Limit, disk mass potential, and {{mass of the}} Galaxy to large radii.

5|$|The {{idea of a}} galactic {{habitable}} zone {{was further}} developed in 2001 in a paper by Ward and Brownlee, in collaboration with Guillermo Gonzalez of the University of Washington. In that paper, Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward stated that regions near the galactic halo would lack the heavier elements required to produce habitable terrestrial planets, thus creating an outward limit {{to the size of}} the galactic habitable zone. Being too close to <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> <b>center,</b> however, would expose an otherwise habitable planet to numerous supernovae and other energetic cosmic events, as well as excessive cometary impacts caused by perturbations of the host star's Oort cloud. Therefore, the authors established an inner boundary for the galactic habitable zone, located just outside the galactic bulge.|$|E
5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between <b>the</b> low-metallicity <b>galactic</b> halo and <b>the</b> high-radiation <b>galactic</b> <b>center,</b> may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of <b>the</b> <b>galactic</b> habitable zone.

5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy.

40|$|Model of {{supermassive black}} holes {{formation}} inside the clusters of primordial black holes is developed. Namely, it is supposed, that some mass {{fraction of the}} universe ~ 10 ^- 3 is composed of the compact clusters of primordial (relic) black holes, produced during phase transitions in the early universe. These clusters are the centers of dark matter condensation. We model the formation of protogalaxies with masses about 2 * 10 ^ 8 M_sun at the redshift z= 15. These induced protogalaxies contain central black holes with mass ~ 10 ^ 5 M_sun and look like dwarf spheroidal galaxies with central density spike. The subsequent merging of induced protogalaxies and ordinary dark matter haloes corresponds to the standard hierarchical clustering scenario of large-scale structure formation.
