5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a wind <b>turbine</b> are not straightforward. The {{air flow}} at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the <b>turbine.</b> The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the <b>turbine.</b> In addition the aerodynamics of a wind <b>turbine</b> at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind <b>turbine</b> are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|Wind <b>turbine</b> {{design is}} the process of {{defining}} the form and specifications of a wind <b>turbine</b> to extract energy from the wind.

5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} voltage (often 34.5 kV), {{power collection system}} and communications network. In general, a distance of 7D (7 × Rotor Diameter of the Wind <b>Turbine)</b> is set between each <b>turbine</b> in a fully developed wind farm. At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With an {{increasing}} amount of wind energy installed, {{the behavior of}} wind <b>turbines</b> during grid disturbances {{becomes more and more}} important. This paper introduces the basic structures of doubly-fed wind <b>turbines</b> and direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous wind <b>turbines</b> and analyses the capability of low voltage ride through (LVRT) of the wind <b>turbines.</b> Finally this paper elaborates the principle and the procedures of the LVRT tests. The results of the tests show that: Doubly-fed wind <b>turbines</b> and direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous wind <b>turbines</b> are equipped with LVRT capability. The <b>turbines</b> are able to operate normally without disconnection and provide reactive power to support grid restoration during the dip. The direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous wind <b>turbines</b> are superior to the doubly-fed wind <b>turbines</b> on LVRT since a full-power converter is used...|$|R

5|$|The HPOTP <b>turbine</b> and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the <b>turbine</b> section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the <b>turbine</b> section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are affected}} by wind shear. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those {{at the top of}} blade travel, and this in turn affects the <b>turbine</b> operation. This low level wind shear can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two bladed <b>turbine</b> when the blades are vertical. The reduced wind shear over water means shorter and less expensive wind <b>turbine</b> towers can be used in shallow seas.|$|E
