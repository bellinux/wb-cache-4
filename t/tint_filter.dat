40|$|Learning disabilities, {{including}} reading disabilities, {{are commonly}} diagnosed in children. Their etiologies are multifactorial, reflecting genetic influences and dysfunction of brain systems. Learning disabilities are complex problems that require complex solutions. Early recognition and referral to qualified educational professionals for evidence-based evaluations and treatments seem {{necessary to achieve}} the best possible outcome. Most experts believe that dyslexia is a language-based disorder. Vision problems can interfere {{with the process of}} learning; however, vision problems are not the cause of primary dyslexia or learning disabilities. Scientific evidence does not support the efficacy of eye exercises, behavioral vision therapy, or special <b>tinted</b> <b>filters</b> or lenses for improving the long-term educational performance in these complex pediatric neurocognitive conditions. Diagnostic and treatment approaches that lack scientific evidence of efficacy, including eye exercises, behavioral vision therapy, or special <b>tinted</b> <b>filters</b> or lenses, are not endorsed and should not be recommended...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>tinted</b> <b>filters</b> on visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity and patient satisfaction in diabetic retinopathy associated with low vision. Methods: In a prospective study, 51 patients with diabetic retinopathy and low vision were assessed. We chose a simple random sampling method and used the patient's files for data collection. LogMAR notations were applied for assessing VA and a contrast sensitivity chart (CSV- 1000) was employed for measuring contrast sensitivity. First, measurements were performed without <b>tinted</b> <b>filters</b> and then using them. Appropriate lenses {{were given to the}} patients for 2 days, and they were questioned about their satisfaction using them in different places. Results: A total of 20 male and 31 female patients with mean age of 57. 3 years participated in the study. With a 527 ± 10 nm filter, mean VA improved significantly (P ≤ 0. 05). Using the 527 ± 10 nm and 511 ± 10 nm filters, mean contrast sensitivity was improved significantly at 3 and 6 cycles/degree frequencies (P < 0. 05). The effect of other filters on VA and contrast sensitivity was not significant. Patient satisfaction rate was generally high. Conclusion: <b>Tinted</b> <b>filters</b> are able to rehabilitate low-vision patients due to diabetic retinopathy. The 527 ± 10 and 511 ± 10 nm wavelength filters improved contrast sensitivity and the 527 ± 10 nm filter improved VA to some extent. Further investigations are recommended to assess the effect of these filters in patients with other causes of low-vision...|$|R
5000|$|The R.O.B. unit's {{height is}} 24 cm (9.6 in). It has a head {{movement}} {{range of a}} 45° horizontally centered tilt. The arm movement range is 240° left and right with five stopping points, 7 cm (2.75 in) {{up and down with}} six stopping points, and 7 cm (2.75 in) between hands when open. The unit has five accessory slots around the hexagonal base, numbered clockwise, starting at the rear-left from the robot's point of view; and notches on the hands allow for specialized parts to be attached for each game. The optional <b>tinted</b> <b>filter</b> can be attached over the eyes to compensate for overly bright televisions. The unit is powered by four AA batteries.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a review}} of studies that have {{investigated}} the proposed rehabilitative benefit of <b>tinted</b> lenses and <b>filters</b> for people with low vision. Currently, eye care practitioners {{have to rely on}} marketing literature and anecdotal reports from users when making recommendations for <b>tinted</b> lens or <b>filter</b> use in low vision. Our main aim was to locate a prescribing protocol that was scientifically based and could assist low vision specialists with tinted lens prescribing decisions. We also wanted to determine if previous work had found any tinted lens/task or tinted lens/ocular condition relationships, i. e. were certain <b>tints</b> or <b>filters</b> of use for specific tasks or for specific eye conditions. Another aim was to provide {{a review of}} previous research in order to stimulate new work using modern experimental designs. Past studies of tinted lenses and low vision have assessed effects on visual acuity (VA), grating acuity, contrast sensitivity (CS), visual field, adaptation time, glare, photophobia and TV viewing. Objective and subjective outcome measures have been used. However, very little objective evidence has been provided to support anecdotal reports of improvements in visual performance. Many studies are flawed in that they lack controls for investigator bias, and placebo, learning and fatigue effects. Therefore, the use of tinted lenses in low vision remains controversial and eye care practitioners will have to continue to rely on anecdotal evidence to assist them in their prescribing decisions. Suggestions for future research, avoiding some of these experimental shortcomings, are made. © 2002 The College of Optometrists...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeSpectral filters {{have been}} used {{clinically}} in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, {{they have not been}} formally assessed using objective techniques in this population. Thus, the aim of the present pilot {{study was to determine the}} effect of spectral filters on reading performance and visuo-cortical responsivity in adults with mTBI. Methods 12 adults with mTBI/concussion were tested. All reported photosensitivity and reading problems. They were compared to 12 visually-normal, asymptomatic adults. There were several test conditions: three luminance-matched control filters (gray neutral density, blue, and red), the patient-selected ‘precision tint lens’ that provided the most comfort and clarity of text using the Intuitive Colorimeter System, and baseline without any filters. The Visagraph was used to assess reading eye movements and reading speed objectively with each filter. In addition, both the amplitude and latency of the visual-evoked potential (VEP) were assessed with the same filters. ResultsThere were few significant group differences in either the reading-related parameters or VEP latency for any of the test filter conditions. Subjective improvements were noted in most with mTBI (11 / 12). ConclusionsThe majority of patients with mTBI chose a <b>tinted</b> <b>filter</b> that resulted in increased visual comfort. While significant findings based on the objective testing were found for some conditions, the subjective results suggest that precision tints should be considered as an adjunctive treatment in patients with mTBI and photosensitivity...|$|R
50|$|Polarized light (PL) is {{very useful}} when {{studying}} {{the structure of}} metals with non-cubic crystal structures (mainly metals with hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal structures). If the specimen is prepared with minimal damage to the surface, the structure can be seen vividly in cross-polarized light (the optic axis of the polarizer and analyzer are 90 degrees to each other, i.e., crossed). In some cases, an hcp metal can be chemically etched and then examined more effectively with PL. Tint etched surfaces, where a thin film (such as a sulfide, molybdate, chromate or elemental selenium film) is grown epitaxially on the surface to a depth where interference effects are created when examined with BF producing color images, can be improved with PL. If {{it is difficult to}} get a good interference film with good coloration, the colors can be improved by examination in PL using a sensitive <b>tint</b> (ST) <b>filter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In late 2005, {{interest}} in digital 3-D stereoscopic projection {{led to a}} new willingness {{on the part of}} theaters to co-operate in installing 2K stereo installations to show Disney's Chicken Little in 3-D film. Six more digital 3-D movies were released in 2006 and 2007 (including Beowulf, Monster House and Meet the Robinsons). The technology combines a single digital projector fitted with either a polarizing filter (for use with polarized glasses and silver screens), a filter wheel or an emitter for LCD glasses. RealD uses a [...] "ZScreen" [...] for polarisation and MasterImage uses a filter wheel that changes the polarity of projector's light output several times per second to alternate quickly the left-and-right-eye views. Another system that uses a filter wheel is Dolby 3D. The wheel changes the wavelengths of the colours being displayed, and <b>tinted</b> glasses <b>filter</b> these changes so the incorrect wavelength cannot enter the wrong eye. XpanD makes use of an external emitter that sends a signal to the 3D glasses to block out the wrong image from the wrong eye.|$|R
40|$|Reading is a {{skill that}} unlocks the doors of {{learning}} and success. It is commonly accepted that reading is a foundational skill that {{plays a major role}} in a child 2 ̆ 7 s academic success. The history of teaching reading includes many theories about the development of reading, the source of reading difficulties, and interventions for remediation. A large body of research has demonstrated that reading difficulties stem from a phonological basis and interventions that target this area are generally beneficial in helping improving reading skills (National Reading Panel, 2000; Shaywitz, 2003; Stanovich, 1986). However, there are some who even with extensive intervention continue to struggle to read. Helen Irlen (2005) proposed that these people may experience visual-perceptual distortions when reading high-contrast text (black on white background). Irlen claims that symptoms of this disorder, termed Scotopic Sensitivity or Irlen Syndrome, can be alleviated by the use of color overlays or <b>filters</b> (<b>tinted</b> glasses). Research into the existence of this syndrome and the effectiveness of the overlays and filters to remediate reading problems has been inconsistent and criticized for lacking scientific rigor and heavy reliance on subject report of improvement. The present study seeks to evaluate differences that may exist in eye movements and reading fluency when subjects diagnosed with IS read text with and without color overlays. Participants were screened with the Irlen Reading Perceptual Scale (IRPS) to determine whether or not they suffered from the syndrome. From this screening, participants chose an overlay reported to alleviate distortions or discomfort they experienced when reading. They were then asked to read 18 passages under three conditions [...] with a clear overlay, with their chosen overlay, and with a random overlay [...] while their eye movements were recorded. Results indicated that participants showed no improvement in eye movement or reading fluency when they read passages with an optimum (chosen) overlay verses a clear overlay or a random overlay...|$|R
