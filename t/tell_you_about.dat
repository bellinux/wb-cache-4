5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

500|$|General François Kellermann {{distinguished}} {{himself at}} Marengo. Melas, trapped in Alessandria with his hopes of breaking {{through to the}} east shattered, sent the same evening to Vienna a message in which he explained that the [...] "charge of Kellermann had broken the soldiers and this sudden and terrible change of fortunes finished by smashing the courage of the troops. The disorder of the cavalry which had disorganised our infantry precipitated its retreat." [...] At the same time, Murat was writing to Berthier: [...] "I especially have to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Kellermann; through a powerful charge he managed to tilt the balance in our favour." [...] However, in the Bulletin de l'armée issued the following day, Napoleon sought to counterbalance Kellermann's charge with Jean-Baptiste Bessières's: [...] "The chef de brigade Bessières, {{in front of the}} reckless grenadiers of the guard, executed a charge with as much activity as valour and penetrated the line of the enemy cavalry; this resulted in the entire rout of the army." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the rise}} of media {{watchdog}} groups, such as the conservative Media Research Center (MRC), Jennings came under increasing scrutiny for what some observers deemed a liberal bias. The anchor drew fire from conservatives, such as the MRC and Cal Thomas, for his November 14, 1994, remarks on ABC Radio, in which he analyzed {{the results of the}} 1994 U.S. midterm elections. [...] "Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any two-year-old and they can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> those temper tantrums: the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming," [...] said Jennings. [...] "Imagine a nation full of uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum last week....Parenting and governing don't have to be dirty words: the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old." [...] A July 1995 documentary, Peter Jennings Reporting: Hiroshima: Why the Bomb Was Dropped, which aired a week before the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, also drew scorn from conservatives and some television critics, who called the program a revisionist look at the decision to drop the bomb. Some viewers of the documentary mailed bus fares to Jennings, telling him to return to Canada.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} that Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan would also be featured on the song, who West had invited to Hawaii. Raekwon initially {{had no interest in}} working with West musically, and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him. According to the rapper, a lot of artists in the music industry refuse to be honest and give genuine advice because they don't want to help their competition, comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel. One of the reasons for Raekwon's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, spoke positively of West. RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu-Tang Clan, and praised his skills as a producer. RZA {{was a part of the}} recording sessions for the album in Hawaii, and contributed to the production of songs [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and [...] "So Appalled". Eventually after being impressed by West himself, Raekwon decided to collaborate with West on several tracks, including [...] "Gorgeous". Raekwon described West as a hard worker, and stated that the [...] "first thing I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Kanye West is that he's a hard worker. When you look at him, you can tell that he still has that whole hip-hop thing in his bones." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} in Final Fantasy XII have received mixed opinions from reviewers. Praises were given by Calvin Smith of PSX Extreme, who {{stated that the}} characters are [...] "classy and well thought out, an ensemble cast whose players rarely descend into needless melodrama or writhing angst". He {{also said that the}} supposed main character's role was changed to become an observer, [...] "a different outlook than in the previous installments". 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister applauded the character dialogues as being [...] "intelligent, subtle and sharp"; the relationships between characters were lauded as well. Balthier and Fran's relationship was compared to Han Solo and Chewbacca of Star Wars, being [...] "far more interesting than anything Square's put out in the modern FF era". IGN editor Jeremy Dunham praised the game and its writers for [...] "evolving the personalities, histories, and motives of characters you already thought you knew, but didn't" [...] and for [...] "capitaliz on the opportunity to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> them". He also noted the visual and auditory detail of the characters, saying that [...] "each and every model, down to the most obscure NPC, has an immense level of attention paid to them -- from their clothes and facial expressions, to their walking and idle animations" [...] and that the voice acting was [...] "top-notch". GameSpy's Justin Speer also praised the characters, saying that it was hard to [...] "resist being charmed by a few of the characters" [...] and that they [...] "interact with each other in dramatic and interesting ways". The voice acting was praised by Keith Schleicher of Gaming Trend, who said that the characters voices all matched their appearances well.|$|E

2500|$|Often the {{minister}} reads passages from well-known historical, sociological, or anthropological works, and finds in them inconspicuous {{references to the}} Blackman’s true history in the world....

Well, you can look it up in a book I’m going to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> that was written by a white man.” He then reads off references that his hearers are challenged to check for themselves.

The fact that a North Carolina slaveholder had an Arabic-speaking Muslim slave of unusual mathematical ability may be offered as evidence that all slaves brought to America were Moslem, Arabic-speaking, and learned. Similarly, historical facts may be indiscriminately mingled with myths and countermyths. (The Black Muslims in America, pp. 120–121) ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 6, 1986, Engine 819 {{moved out}} of the Cotton Belt Route's yard at Pine Bluff marking the first time it had moved under its own power since 1953. The large crowd {{gathered}} at the railyard, including a number of railroad employees, burst into applause and shouted their approval as the locomotive's nose emerged from the shop building and into the bright sunshine. The American flag and the Arkansas state flag affixed to the right and left sides of the shiny black engine gave a patriotic air to the event. Members of the Cotton Belt Railroad Historical Society invested over 35,000 man-hours into this restoration project. Jake Commer praised the efforts the Cotton Belt Route had extended stating, [...] "They helped us so much I can't even begin to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> all of it. If it hadn't been for the railroad, we couldn't have done it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in The Guardian in 2000, Sontag was quite open about being bisexual: [...] "'Shall I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> getting older?', she says, and she is laughing. 'When you get older, 45 plus, men stop fancying you. Or put it another way, the men I fancy don't fancy me. I want a young man. I love beauty. So what's new?' She says {{she has been in}} love seven times in her life. 'No, hang on,' she says. 'Actually, it's nine. Five women, four men.'" [...] Many of Sontag's obituaries failed to mention her significant same-sex relationships, most notably that with Annie Leibovitz. In response to this criticism, New York Times Public Editor, Daniel Okrent, defended the newspaper's obituary, stating {{that at the time of}} Sontag's death, a reporter could make no independent verification of her romantic relationship with Leibovitz (despite attempts to do so). After Sontag's death, Newsweek published an article about Annie Leibovitz that made clear references to her decade-plus relationship with Sontag.|$|E

In an October 2014, interview with Rolling Stone, Reubens gave an update on the status of the film, saying: [...] "It's been months and months of being right {{on the verge of being}} announced…I thought something was going to go public yesterday, actually, and that you’d be the first person I’d be talking about this with.

2500|$|The 2nd Test match {{witnessed}} many controversial umpiring decisions {{from the}} two umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and even the third Umpire. Three of Steve Bucknor's gaffes occurred {{when he did not}} give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV Replays clearly showed that the ball had passed through the bat's edge. The second one occurred when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Andrew Symonds to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder’s foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. This was a major boost for Australia as Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the Game. After these incidents, Andrew Symonds said, [...] "I was very lucky. I was out when I was 30, given not out. That's cricket though, I can sit here and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> my bad decisions as well - but I won't." [...] On the fifth day, Bucknor declared Rahul Dravid out caught behind though television replays later showed the ball had brushed his pad without touching his bat.|$|E
