40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{measured the}} efficiency of monitoring complex scenes composed of changing objects, or events. All events lasted about 4 s, but in a given block of trials, could be of a single type (single task) or of multiple types (multitask, with a <b>total</b> of four <b>event</b> <b>types).</b> Overall accuracy of detecting target events amid distractors was higher for single <b>event</b> <b>types</b> relative to multiple <b>types.</b> Multiple <b>event</b> <b>types</b> were processed reasonably well when each <b>event</b> <b>type</b> was restricted to its own region, and much worse when <b>event</b> <b>types</b> were mixed in location. In most task conditions, observers reached an optimal level of performance (optimal attentional set). After one target was identified, performance for other targets dropped markedly and then recovered to optimal levels. However, set was not optimized when task locations were intermixed. The results {{support the idea that}} attentional set determines {{the efficiency of}} event perception in complex scenes. Although single event set was most efficient, there can be a reasonably efficient set for multiple <b>event</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R

40|$|Verb lexical {{semantic}} {{properties are}} {{only one of the}} factors that contribute to the determination of the <b>event</b> <b>type</b> expressed by a sentence, which is instead the result of a complex interplay between the verb meaning and its linguistic context. We report on two computational models for the automatic identification of <b>event</b> <b>type</b> in Italian. Both models use linguistically-motivated features extracted from Italian corpora. The main goal of our experiments is to evaluate the contribution of different types of linguistic indicators to identify the <b>event</b> <b>type</b> of a sentence, as well as to model various cases of context-driven <b>event</b> <b>type</b> shift. In the first model, <b>event</b> <b>type</b> identification has been modelled as a supervised classification task, performed with Maximum Entropy classifiers. In the second model, Self-Organizing Maps have been used to define and identify <b>event</b> <b>types</b> in an unsupervised way. The interaction of various contextual factors in determining the <b>event</b> <b>type</b> expressed by a sentence makes <b>event</b> <b>type</b> identification a highly challenging task. Computational models can help us to shed new light on the real structure of <b>event</b> <b>type</b> classes as well as {{to gain a better understanding}} of context-driven semantic shifts...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} goal of {{this project}} was to extend the existing implementation of the Corba-Based Event Architecture (COBEA) with support for object-oriented <b>event</b> <b>type</b> classes and static type-checking of events. Application programmers {{should be able to}} use the Object Definition Language (ODL) to describe <b>event</b> <b>type</b> hierarchies, which are then transformed into C++ stub code by the means of an <b>event</b> <b>type</b> compiler. Moreover, it should be possible to transform these ODL event class declarations into a programming language independent representation by using the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Work Completed The design, implementation and evaluation of an <b>event</b> <b>type</b> compiler was successfully carried out. The compiler transforms ODL <b>event</b> <b>type</b> descriptions into C++ stub code that is usable with the COBEA system. Complex <b>event</b> <b>type</b> hierarchies can be easily expressed in ODL, giving the event application programmer an intuitive programming model to use, combined with the advantages of type-checking. The current implementation of COBEA was altered in order to support the idea of a hierarchical structure between <b>event</b> <b>types.</b> In addition to that, XML output of the <b>event</b> <b>type</b> hierarchy can be generated...|$|R
40|$|Most {{previous}} event extraction {{studies have}} {{relied heavily on}} features derived from annotated event mentions, thus {{cannot be applied to}} new <b>event</b> <b>types</b> without annotation effort. In this work, we take a fresh look at event extraction and model it as a grounding problem. We design a transferable neural architecture, mapping <b>event</b> mentions and <b>types</b> jointly into a shared semantic space using structural and compositional neural networks, where the <b>type</b> of each <b>event</b> mention can be determined by the closest of all candidate types. By leveraging (1) available manual annotations for a small set of existing <b>event</b> <b>types</b> and (2) existing event ontologies, our framework applies to new <b>event</b> <b>types</b> without requiring additional annotation. Experiments on both existing <b>event</b> <b>types</b> (e. g., ACE, ERE) and new <b>event</b> <b>types</b> (e. g., FrameNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Without any manual annotations for 23 new <b>event</b> <b>types,</b> our zero-shot framework achieved performance comparable to a state-of-the-art supervised model which is trained from the annotations of 500 event mentions...|$|R
40|$|In the paper, we {{consider}} the problem of discovering sequential patterns from event-based spatio-temporal data. The problem is defined as follows: {{for a set of}} <b>event</b> <b>types</b> F and for a dataset of events instances D (where each instance in D denotes an occurrence of a particular <b>event</b> <b>type</b> in considered spatio-temporal space), discover all sequential patterns defining the following relation between any <b>event</b> <b>types</b> participating in a particular pattern. The following relation → between any two <b>event</b> <b>types,</b> denotes the fact that instances of the first <b>event</b> <b>type</b> attract in their spatial proximity and in considered temporal window afterwards occurrences of instances of the second <b>event</b> <b>type.</b> In the article, the notion of sequential pattern in event-based spatio-temporal data has been defined and the already proposed approach to discovering sequential pattern has been reformulated. We show, it is possible to efficiently and effectively discover sequential patterns in event-based spatio-temporal data.

40|$|Most {{real-world}} {{judgments and}} decisions require {{the consideration of}} multiple types of evidence. For example, judging the severity of environmental damage, medical illness, or negative economic trends often involves tracking and integrating evidence from multiple sources (i. e. different natural disasters, physical symptoms, or financial indicators). We hypothesized that the requirement to track and integrate across distinct types of evidence would affect severity judgments of multifaceted problems, compared to simpler problems. To test this, we used scenarios depicting crop damage. Each scenario involved either two <b>event</b> <b>types</b> (i. e. mold damage and insect damage), or one <b>event</b> <b>type.</b> Participants judged {{the quality of the}} crop following each scenario. In Experiments 1 and 2, subjective judgments were attenuated if the scenario depicted multiple <b>event</b> <b>types,</b> relative to scenarios depicting single <b>event</b> <b>types.</b> This was evident as a shallower slope of subjective severity ratings, as a function of objectively quantifiable severity, for scenarios with multiple <b>event</b> <b>types.</b> In Experiment 3, we asked whether alternation between <b>event</b> <b>types</b> might contribute to this attenuation. Each scenario contained two <b>event</b> <b>types,</b> and the sequence of events either alternated frequently between types or was organized into two sequential groups. Subjective judgments were attenuated for scenarios with frequently alternating sequences. The results demonstrate that alternation between distinct <b>event</b> <b>types</b> attenuates subjective judgments of severity. This suggests that a requirement to integrate evidence across multiple sources places extra demands on the cognitive system, which reduces the perceived evidence strength...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{organization}} of personal photos {{is a problem}} with many real world ap- plications, and can be divided into two main tasks: recognizing the <b>event</b> <b>type</b> of the photo collection, and selecting interesting images from the collection. In this paper, we attempt to simultaneously solve both tasks: album-wise event recognition and image- wise importance prediction. We collected an album dataset with both <b>event</b> <b>type</b> labels and image importance labels, refined from an existing CUFED dataset. We propose a hybrid system consisting of three parts: A siamese network-based event-specific image importance prediction, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that recognizes the <b>event</b> <b>type,</b> and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) -based sequence level event recognizer. We propose an iterative updating procedure for <b>event</b> <b>type</b> and image importance score prediction.

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} problem of {{analyzing}} spatial correlation between <b>event</b> <b>types</b> in large point data sets. Collocation rules are unsatisfactory, when confidence is not a sufficiently accurate interestingness measure, and Monte Carlo testing is infeasible, when the number of <b>event</b> <b>types</b> is large. We introduce an algorithm for mining correlation patterns, based on a non-parametric bootstrap test that, however, avoids the actual resampling by scanning each point and its distances to the events in the neighbourhood. As a real data set we analyze a large place name data set, the set of <b>event</b> <b>types</b> consisting of different linguistic features that appear in the place names. Experimental results show that the algorithm can be applied to large data sets with hundreds of <b>event</b> <b>types.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Detecting {{concurrency}} {{relations between}} events {{is a fundamental}} primitive in process mining. Existing approaches to this problem identify concurrency relations between pairs of <b>event</b> <b>types</b> under a global interpretation. If two <b>event</b> <b>types</b> {{are found to be}} concurrent, every occurrence of one <b>event</b> <b>type</b> is deemed to be concurrent to one occurrence of the other. In practice, this assumption not always holds. This paper proposes a finer-grained approach, whereby two <b>event</b> <b>types</b> may be in a concurrency relation relative to one state of the process, but not relative to other states, i. e. the concurrency relation holds locally. Experimental results both with artificial and real-life logs show that the proposed local concurrency detection approach improves the accuracy of existing concurrency detection techniques. </i...|$|R

40|$|Subtype {{polymorphism}} is {{an important}} feature available in most modern type systems which makes code reuse and specialization possible. Recent works on separation of crosscutting concerns have created <b>event</b> interfaces (<b>types)</b> to decouple subjects from handlers.

Ptolemy allows declaring quantified, <b>typed</b> <b>events</b> which provide an interface between subjects and handlers. We add the notion of polymorphic <b>event</b> <b>types</b> to the Ptolemy language, defining a subtype relation among <b>event</b> <b>types</b> which in turn allows for both depth and width subtyping with regard to event context. Since Ptolemy only has explicit event announcement, our semantics is simpler and easier to reason about when compared to previously defined approaches. We also give the first formally defined static semantics for polymorphic events as well as demonstrate its usefulness via examples...|$|R

For RR and OR, inclusion of such trials causes small changes, even when they comprise the large majority of included trials.

An important prerequisite for this sort of research is the building of a corpus of stimuli that meets our needs (web-based pre-tests were run to test the reliability of the stimuli, which should be balanced to control the variables known to aect processing costs) and an analysis of pre-existing literature in experimental psycholinguistics of <b>event</b> <b>types.</b> Our main concern was to explore new experimental settings in verb semantics psycholinguistics and to adapt them to this specic type of investigation: the choice of the method was narrowed down to the semantic priming paradigm, although the set of stimuli could also be suitable for other experimental settings, such as reading-time studies. The semantic priming paradigm was exploited to contrast processing effects on achievement verbs and activity verbs, which dier with respect to two superordinate features: durativity and resultativity.
