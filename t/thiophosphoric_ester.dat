50|$|The {{structure}} of diazinon contains a <b>thiophosphoric</b> <b>ester.</b> The phosphorus center is the reactive {{site of the}} chemical. However, no known mechanisms currently exist. A novel mechanism does exist, which proposes that the sulfur is protonated in acidic medium via a hydronium ion which ultimately delivers a hydroxide group to the phosphorus center and can react readily.|$|E
50|$|Diazinon is {{a contact}} {{insecticide}} which kills insects by altering normal neurotransmission within {{the nervous system}} of the insect. As mentioned above, diazinon inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in cholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junctions. This results in abnormal accumulation of ACh within the nervous system. Diazinon, although a <b>thiophosphoric</b> <b>ester,</b> shares a common mechanism of toxicity with other organophosphate insecticides such as chlorpyrifos, malathion and parathion, and is not very effective against the organophosphate-resistant insect populations.|$|E
5000|$|The form of {{diazinon}} {{varies widely}} {{as it can}} be in dusts, granules, liquids, concentrates, microencapsulations, wettable powders, and seed dressings. Its appearance varies depending on purity, ranging from a dark brown (industrial grade), to a colorless liquid (pure). Indicative of its functionality of a <b>thiophosphoric</b> <b>ester,</b> the chemical has a pronounced smell similar to that of diethyl ether. [...] Diazinon is relatively stable under standard ambient temperature and pressure but is susceptible to form toxic phosphine gas upon heating. Furthermore, diazinon can oxidize into toxic phosphorus oxides if {{in the presence of a}} strong oxidizing agent.|$|E
40|$|DD 240843 A UPAB: 19930922 The {{microencapsulation}} of pesticides, in aq. soln. using water-soluble amine resins comprises using, for the encapsulation, {{a partially}} methanol-etherified, water soluble cationic modified melamine formaldehyde condensation prod. without further additives {{and with a}} content of free methylol gps. of 0. 75 - 3 mol/mol melamine. Pref. the pH value is 1. 0 - 7. 0. Suitable pesticides for encapsulation are e. g. sparingly soluble phosphonic acid <b>esters,</b> <b>thiophosphoric</b> acid <b>esters</b> and dithiophosphoric acid esters. USE/ADVANTAGE - The encapsulated pesticides {{can be used in}} agrochemistry. Pesticides which are sparingly soluble in water can be encapsulated by this method. The capsules have high mechanical stability so that after several days, a high active ingredient concn. is maintained. The capsules are of low toxicity. Simple starting materials are used. 0 /...|$|R
50|$|Diazinon (IUPAC name: O,O-Diethyl O-4-methyl-6-(propan-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl phosphorothioate, INN - Dimpylate), a colorless to {{dark brown}} liquid, is a <b>thiophosphoric</b> acid <b>ester</b> {{developed}} in 1952 by Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss chemical company (later Novartis and then Syngenta). It is a nonsystemic organophosphate insecticide formerly {{used to control}} cockroaches, silverfish, ants, and fleas in residential, non-food buildings. Diazinon was heavily used during the 1970s and early 1980s for general-purpose gardening use and indoor pest control. A bait form was used to control scavenger wasps in the western U.S. Diazinon is used in flea collars for domestic pets in Australia and New Zealand. Residential uses of diazinon were outlawed in the U.S. in 2004 {{but it is still}} approved for agricultural uses. An emergency antidote is atropine.|$|R
40|$|Chlorpyrifos is {{a typical}} {{chlorinated}} organophosphorus pesticide. The heterogeneous reaction of chlorpyrifos particles with NO 3 radicals was investigated using a vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS) and a real-time atmospheric gas analysis mass spectrometer. Chlorpyrifos oxon, 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol, O,O-diethyl O-hydrogen phosphorothioate, O,O-diethyl <b>ester</b> <b>thiophosphoric</b> acid, diethyl hydrogen phosphate and a phosphinyl disulfide compound were identified as the main degradation products. The heterogeneous reaction pathways were proposed and their kinetic processes were investigated via a mixed-phase relative rate method. The observed effective rate constant is 3. 4 +/- 0. 2 x 10 (- 12) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1). (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{membrane}} extraction-gas chromatography {{method was}} developed for determination of organophosphorus pesticides and related compounds including methamidophos, DDVP, dimethoate, methyl parathion, parathion, <b>thiophosphoric</b> acid trimethyl <b>ester,</b> and thiophosphoramidic acid dimethyl ester in water samples. In this method, surface-modified acetic cellulose membranes were used to extract the target analytes in water samples, the extracted analytes were back-extracted into {{a small amount of}} methanol, and gas chromatography with pulsed flame photometric detector (GCPFPD) was used to determine the concentrations of target analytes in the extracts. The recoveries obtained for the target analytes spiked into the water samples ranged from 66 to 94 %. The method detection limit for each target analyte was 0. 05 mug L- 1. The method developed in this study had shown the advantages of being cheap, simple, fast, and reliable. It had been used successfully to determine the concentrations of target analytes in river water samples...|$|R
