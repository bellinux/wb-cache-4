5|$|When {{a warrior}} is so old, or sustains an injury <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> {{can no longer}} serve their Clan, they retire to become elders. Elders live out the {{remainder}} of their life in general peace, {{using it as a}} time of rest and relaxation. They sleep in their own separate den, which is looked after by the apprentices. Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan, but are able to do so if the mood takes them. Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave. Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders, thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior. Sadly, it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders, as many warriors die before they can retire.|$|E

However, people may gain admission for a concentrated period of therapy or for respite. Despite changes in mental health policy in many countries that have closed psychiatric hospitals, many nurses continue work in hospitals though patient length of stay has decreased significantly.|$|E

500|$|Friedrich Körner (36 victories) also {{recognised}} this as unique: [...] "Shooting {{in a curve}} (deflection shooting) is {{the most}} difficult thing a pilot can do. The enemy flies in a defensive circle, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> are already lying in a curve and the attacking fighter has to fly into this defensive circle. By pulling his aircraft right around, his curve radius must be smaller, but if he does that, his target disappears in most cases below his wings. So he cannot see it anymore and has to proceed simply by instinct." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{everyone}} with Tourette's wants treatment or a [...] "cure", especially if <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> may [...] "lose" [...] {{something else in}} the process. Researchers Leckman and Cohen, and former US Tourette Syndrome Association (TSA) national board member Kathryn Taubert, believe {{that there may be}} latent advantages associated with an individual's genetic vulnerability to developing Tourette syndrome, such as a heightened awareness and increased attention to detail and surroundings that may have adaptive value. There is evidence to support the clinical lore that children with [...] "TS-only" [...] (Tourette's in the absence of comorbid conditions) are unusually gifted: neuropsychological studies have identified advantages in children with TS-only. Children with TS-only are faster than the average for their age group on timed tests of motor coordination.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh {{conceived}} the series Phineas and Ferb, {{based on their}} similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. [...] Povenmire spent 14–16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing [...] "It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on." [...] Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: [...] "Usually <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> {{throw it in the}} trash later," [...] Povenmire recalled. [...] Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, on the condition that he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between both clubs had become strained, {{not least because}} of Chelsea's financial advantage; the club was owned by billionaire Roman Abramovich. The day after Chelsea announced losses of £80million for 2005–06, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger expressed concern over his opponent's conduct: [...] "I have said many times that all the clubs should be balanced with their natural resources. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> can only spend what they earn." [...] Chelsea manager José Mourinho refused to respond to Wenger's comments in his UEFA Champions League pre-match press conference, but made reference to his record in the competition in contrast to his counterpart: [...] "Many great managers {{in the world have}} never won it. The big example is not far from us; Arsène Wenger is a top manager in the world. He's a big manager in the world of football and he never did it so when I did it once, I can thank God for that. I have that." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E

She is bisexual, and said she believes that [...] "all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes". [...] "I have {{no question in my mind}} about being bisexual," [...] Fox stated. [...] "But I'm also a hypocrite: I would never date a girl who was bisexual, because <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> also sleep with men, and men are so dirty that I'd never want to sleep with a girl who had slept with a man." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{what appears}} to be a dream, Emma wakes up in a car and is greeted by Neal, who tells her that he's just sending her a [...] "long {{distance}} call from an old friend."

Neal warns Emma not to go, but she refuses to listen to his advice and he knew she would and so he tells her he loves her and kisses her goodbye and Emma wakes up. As Emma, Gold, Mary Margaret, David, Henry, Regina, and Robin Hood arrive in the Underworld in their quest to find Hook, the ensemble comes across a brimstone-hued version of Storybrooke. Gold tells them that every soul with unfinished business lives here until it is fulfilled, and since they have arrived <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>they</b> are ready to finish it as they were responsible, as Emma sees Cruella's car that serves as an example.|$|E
