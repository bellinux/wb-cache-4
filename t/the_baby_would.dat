25|$|According to the Life of St. Macarius, when he {{was still}} a baby, he would start crying every time he heard the ringing of the bells of the nearby church. There was no way to console the child. The parents would not want to bring the baby boy to the church, afraid that he would disturb the service with his crying; but {{eventually}} they decided to try. And, to their surprise, as soon as they brought the child to the church, he became quiet, smiling joyfully. From this time on, the parents had to attend every service at the parish church, and to take the child with them, because if they stayed at home during the service, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> again start crying.|$|E
25|$|The Sims 2 {{characters}} pass through seven life stages — babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with University), adults, and elders — with eventual death of old age, while babies in The Sims only become children before ceasing to continue aging. The aspiration system (described above) is also new to The Sims 2. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits {{as opposed to}} Sims, in which <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> take on random appearance and personality. Genetics {{play a major role}} in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child.|$|E

5000|$|In the Anglo-Scottish {{border region}} it was {{believed}} that elves (or fairies) lived in [...] "Elf Hills" [...] (or [...] "Fairy Hills"). Along with this belief in supernatural beings was the view that they could spirit away children, and even adults, and take them back to their own world (see Elfhame). Often, it was thought, a <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> be snatched and replaced with a simulation of <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> usually a male adult elf, to be suckled by the mother. <b>The</b> real <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> be treated well by the elves and would grow up to be one of them, where as <b>the</b> changeling <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> be discontented and wearisome.

25|$|The actual {{duties of}} the midwife in antiquity {{consisted}} mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the midwife would call for {{the assistance of a}} physician when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the midwife brought along two or three assistants. In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her. The midwife sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards {{on the top of the}} mother's abdomen.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ritual {{practices}} and beliefs {{are associated with}} birth among the Tanala. In the past, after delivery of a baby the mother would wash {{her hands in the}} blood of a freshly sacrificed chicken, bathe herself in hot water, and then rest upright beside a fire to make her sweat out impurities. The period that she needed to stay beside the fire varied; noblewomen might stay beside the fire for as long as several months, but more commonly the duration was eight days. Immediately after this period beside the fire was concluded, a party was held, which the mother had to attend regardless of her condition; the event was marked by the slaughter of zebu. Immediately after birth, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> be bathed in cold water, and a sorcerer would declare certain days to be lifelong fady (taboo days); if a baby was born on a day that was fady for both the mother and father, the child would be abandoned to die. In addition, there are eight fady days per month for all Tanala, and historically if a child was born on one of these days, it would be drowned by holding its head in a water-filled winnowing pan.|$|E

He said that he approached filming as seriously as he could because he felt the script was a classic.

He {{was born in the}} family home above his father's {{bookshop}} in Lichfield, Staffordshire. His mother Sarah was 40 when she gave birth to Samuel. This was considered an unusually late pregnancy, so precautions were taken, and a [...] "man-midwife" [...] and surgeon of [...] "great reputation" [...] named George Hector was brought in to assist. The infant Samuel did not cry, and there were concerns for the baby's health. His aunt exclaimed that, [...] "she would not have picked such a poor creature up in the street." [...] The family feared that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> not survive, and in this extremity, the vicar of St Mary's was summoned to perform a baptism.

2500|$|Other critics {{claim that}} there is a {{difference}} between artificial and extraordinary means of preservation, such as medical treatment, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions, and normal and natural means of preservation, such as gestation, childbirth, and breastfeeding. They argue that if a baby was born into an environment in which there was no replacement available for her mother's breast milk, and <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> either breastfeed or starve, the mother would have to allow the baby to breastfeed. [...] But the mother would never have to give the baby a blood transfusion, no matter what the circumstances were.

2500|$|One of {{the main}} defences Winnicott thought a baby could resort to was what he called [...] "compliance", or {{behaviour}} motivated {{by a desire to}} please others rather than spontaneously express one's own feelings and ideas. For example, if a baby's caregiver was severely depressed, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> anxiously sense a lack of responsiveness, {{would not be able to}} enjoy an illusion of omnipotence, and might instead focus his energies and attentions on finding ways to get a positive response from the distracted and unhappy caregiver by being a [...] "good baby". The [...] "False Self" [...] is a defence of constantly seeking to anticipate others' demands and complying with them, as a way of protecting the [...] "True Self" [...] from a world that is felt to be unsafe.|$|E

2500|$|Many of Winnicott's {{writings}} {{show his}} efforts to understand what helps {{people to be able}} to play, and on the other hand what blocks some people from playing. Babies can be playful when they're cared for by people who respond to them warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, [...] "Peek-a-boo!" [...] when she sees her baby playfully peeking out from behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, sooner or later <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> stop trying to elicit play from her. [...] Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that [...] "Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure". [...] "Potential space" [...] was Winnicott's term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).|$|E

2500|$|The {{day of the}} Buddha's {{birth is}} widely celebrated in Theravada {{countries}} as Vesak. Buddha's Birthday is called Buddha Purnima in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India as he {{is believed to have}} been born on a full moon day. Various sources hold that the Buddha's mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. The infant was given the name Siddhartha (Pāli: Siddhattha), meaning [...] "he who achieves his aim". During the birth celebrations, the hermit seer Asita journeyed from his mountain abode and announced that the child would either become a great king (chakravartin) or a great sadhu. By traditional account, this occurred after Siddhartha placed his feet in Asita's hair and Asita examined the birthmarks. Suddhodana held a naming ceremony on the fifth day, and invited eight Brahmin scholars to read the future. All gave a dual prediction that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> either become a great king or a great holy man. Kondañña, the youngest, and later to be the first arhat other than the Buddha, was reputed to be the only one who unequivocally predicted that Siddhartha would become a Buddha.|$|E
