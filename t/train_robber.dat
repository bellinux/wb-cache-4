Following Edge of Darkness, he acted as specialist adviser to the British House of Commons Select Committee on Environment for their 1986 study, Radioactive Waste. He continues to contribute to the policy debate about energy and environmental issues. Advice on the policing aspects of the serial was provided by the West Yorkshire Police and former Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper, famous for his pursuit of the <b>train</b> <b>robber</b> Ronnie Biggs.|$|E
5|$|Lucan's {{disappearance}} has captivated the public's imagination for decades, {{with thousands}} of sightings reported across the world. One of the earliest, shortly after the murder, {{turned out to be}} a British ex-politician, John Stonehouse, who had attempted to fake his own death. The police travelled to France in June the following year to hunt another lead, to no avail. A sighting in Colombia {{turned out to be a}}n American businessman. John Miller, a bounty hunter who kidnapped the fugitive <b>train</b> <b>robber</b> Ronnie Biggs, claimed in 1982 to have captured the earl, but was later exposed by the News of the World as a hoaxer. In 2003 a former Scotland Yard detective thought he had tracked the earl to Goa, India; the man he traced was actually Barry Halpin, a folk singer from StHelens. In 2007, reporters in New Zealand interviewed a homeless British expatriate who neighbours claimed was the missing earl.|$|E

500|$|Not as {{well known}} today but famous in his time was the dapper, derby-wearing <b>train</b> <b>robber</b> Marion Hedgepeth, who despite his swell appearance, [...] "was a deadly killer {{and one of the}} fastest guns in the Wild, Wild West". William Pinkerton, whose National Detective Agency had sought to capture Hedgepeth and his gang for years, noted that Hedgepeth once gunned down another outlaw who had already unholstered his pistol before Hedgepath had drawn his revolver. The infamous assassin Tom Horn was also said to have participated in a duel with a second {{lieutenant}} from the Mexican Army, due to a dispute with a prostitute when he was twenty-six years old. Gunfighters Jim Levy and Tom Carberry became infamous for participating in at least two quick draw duels in their lifetimes.|$|E
500|$|Jericho Cross (voiced by Christopher Corey Smith): The {{protagonist of}} the game, a jaded American Civil War deserter and drifter {{who became a}} gunslinger and <b>train</b> <b>robber.</b> During his [...] "one last job", he {{releases}} Lazarus Malkoth from his prison in a failed attempt to steal the contents. While dueling with Lazarus, Jericho gets bitten and infected by the vampire curse. His already deadly skills are enhanced by his vampire powers that afford him superhuman strength, increased endurance, enhanced agility, and heightened senses, {{in the form of}} the bioluminescent red orb that regenerated from his empty eye socket. Shadow is Jericho's demonic horse that appears at his beckon. According to the developers, they created [...] "deep psychological profiles of every character in the game" [...] with [...] "hope that Jericho's character arc — as this desperate [...] that's robbing trains with a subconscious death wish — makes a believable transition into this half-vampire hybrid gunslinger and will ultimately envelop the player in his destiny: which is a guy that can be either a hero or a terror. Basically, we just want people to care about this character and what happens to him — and I can't think of a first-person shooter that's really made us do that yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Supergrass {{followed}} I Should Coco with 18 {{months of}} heavy touring, appearing at festivals such as Scotland's T In The Park and the Glastonbury Festival. After Performing at Rio's Hollywood Rock Festival in April 1996, Supergrass met the <b>train</b> <b>robber</b> Ronnie Biggs, and apparently said to him, [...] "I was frightened {{for my life}} when I heard there was a supergrass in the area." [...] A photograph of Ronnie Biggs and Gaz together was subsequently included in the music video for their 1996 single [...] "Going Out". Recorded at Great Linford Manor the single peaked at number five in the UK charts, but was the last song produced by Sam Williams. Supergrass returned to Sawmills Studio to co-produce follow up album, In It For The Money (released April 1997), with John Cornfield. The album was a huge success and went platinum in the UK, but confused some fans expecting something similar to [...] I Should Coco. The single, [...] "Richard III", reached number two. Subsequent releases, [...] "Sun Hits the Sky" [...] and [...] "Late In The Day", reached numbers 10 and 18 respectively.|$|E

60|$|The ladies didn't stop to dress. They were so {{curious to}} see a real, live <b>train</b> <b>robber,</b> bless 'em, that they just wrapped {{blankets}} and sheets around themselves and came out, squeaky and fidgety looking. They always show more curiosity and sand than the men do.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I imagine,' says I, after ingurgitating another {{modicum of}} the royal booze, 'that it wouldn't be at all a disingenuous idea for a <b>train</b> <b>robber</b> to run down into {{this part of the}} country to hide for a spell. A sheep-ranch, now,' says I, 'would be the finest kind of a place. Who'd ever expect to find such a desperate {{character}} among these song-birds and muttons and wild flowers? And, by the way,' says I, kind of looking H. Ogden over, 'was there any description mentioned of this single-handed terror? Was his lineaments or height and thickness or teeth fillings or style of habiliments set forth in print?' ...|$|E
60|$|As to {{the train}} crew, we never had any more trouble with them than {{if they had been}} so many sheep. I don't mean that they are cowards; I mean that they have got sense. They know they're not up against a bluff. It's the same way with the officers. I've seen secret service men, marshals, and {{railroad}} detectives fork over their change as meek as Moses. I saw one of the bravest marshals I ever knew hide his gun under his seat and dig up along with the rest while I was taking toll. He wasn't afraid; he simply knew that we had the drop on the whole outfit. Besides, many of those officers have families and they feel that they oughtn't to take chances; whereas death has no terrors for the man who holds up a train. He expects to get killed some day, and he generally does. My advice to you, if you should ever be in a hold-up, is to line up with the cowards and save your bravery for an occasion when it may be of some benefit to you. Another reason why officers are backward about mixing things with a <b>train</b> <b>robber</b> is a financial one. Every time there is a scrimmage and somebody gets killed, the officers lose money. If the <b>train</b> <b>robber</b> gets away they swear out a warrant against John Doe et al. and travel hundreds of miles and sign vouchers for thousands on the trail of the fugitives, and the Government foots the bills. So, with them, {{it is a question of}} mileage rather than courage.|$|E

60|$|Warner {{had been}} wanted by the law, and by nobody else, for many years. Desperado, murderer, <b>train</b> <b>robber</b> and road agent, {{he was a}} man beyond the pale of human pity. He had {{deserved}} a dozen deaths, and the Los Amigos folk grudged him so gaudy a one as that. He seemed to feel himself to be unworthy of it, for he made two frenzied attempts at escape. He was a powerful, muscular man, with a lion head, tangled black locks, and a sweeping beard which covered his broad chest. When he was tried, there was no finer head in all the crowded court. It's no new thing to find the best face looking from the dock. But his good looks could not balance his bad deeds. His advocate did all he knew, but the cards lay against him, and Duncan Warner was handed over to the mercy of the big Los Amigos dynamos.|$|E

His hair is naturally a light reddish. Then he gave me the most scientific cussing I ever had, and took off his coat.|$|E

6000|$|Now, I {{will give}} you a sort of general {{synopsis}} of my idea--of course, everything is subject to your own revision and change. The article, we will say, is written by a TYPICAL train hoister--one without your education and powers of expression (bouquet) but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from HIS STANDPOINT--not from John Wanamaker's. Yet, in order to please John, we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess. Comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible. Do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in, and, on the contrary, do not depreciate a profession that is really only financiering with spurs on. Describe the FACTS and DETAILS--all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a Pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see. Here is a rough draft of my idea: Begin abruptly, without any philosophizing, with your idea of the best times, places and conditions for the hold-up--compare your opinions of this with those of others--mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others, giving your opinion why--as far as possible refer to actual occurrences, and incidents--describe the manner of a hold-up, how many men is best, where they are stationed, how do they generally go into it, nervous? or joking? or solemnly. The details of stopping the train, the duties of each man of the gang--the behavior of the train crew and passengers (here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of). Your opinions on going through the passengers, when is it done and when not done. How is the boodle gotten at? How does the express clerk generally take it? Anything done with the mail car? UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL A <b>TRAIN</b> <b>ROBBER</b> SHOOT A PASSENGER OR A TRAIN MAN--suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands? Queer articles found on passengers (a chance here for some imaginative work)--queer and laughable incidents of any kind. Refer whenever apropos to actual hold-ups and facts concerning them of interest. What could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try? Why don't they try? How long does it take to do the business. Does the train man ever stand in with the hold-up? Best means of getting away--how and when is the money divided. How is it mostly spent. Best way to manoeuvre afterward. How to get caught and how not to. Comment on the methods of officials who try to capture. (Here's your chance to get even.) ...|$|E
