30|$|Numerous {{investigations}} {{are dealing with}} anlage of the mammalian kidney and primary development of nephrons. However, only few information is available about the last steps in kidney development leading at birth to a downregulation of morphogen activity in the nephrogenic zone and {{to a loss of}} stem cell niches aligned beyond the organ capsule. Surprisingly, these natural changes in the developmental program display similarities to processes occurring in the kidneys of preterm and low-birth-weight babies. Although those babies are born at a time with a principally intact nephrogenic zone and active niches, a high proportion of them suffers on impairment of nephrogenesis resulting in oligonephropathy, formation of atypical glomeruli, and immaturity of parenchyma. The setting points out that up to date not identified noxae in the nephrogenic zone hamper primary steps of parenchyma development. In this situation, a possible therapeutic aim is to prolong nephrogenesis by medications. However, actual data provide information that administration of drugs is problematic due to an unexpectedly complex microanatomy of the nephrogenic zone, in niches so far not considered textured extracellular matrix and peculiar contacts between mesenchymal cell projections and epithelial stem cells via tunneling nanotubes. Thus, it remains <b>to</b> be <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>whether</b> disturbance of morphogen signaling altered synthesis of extracellular matrix, disturbed cell-to-cell contacts, or modified interstitial fluid impair nephrogenic activity. Due to most unanswered questions, search for eligible drugs prolonging nephrogenesis and their reliable administration is a special challenge for the future.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} mainly {{discussing}} about two major institutional investors’ stock preference [...] - foreign investment investor and investment trust investor. This paper {{is trying to}} use market portfolio concept, we define each stock’s market portfolio weight as the optimal portfolio weight. We calculate each stock’s real portfolio holding weight in total foreign investment investor’s and investment trust investor’s stock holding portfolio, and use the real portfolio holding weight to minus the optimal portfolio weight. Our study define the difference of these two kinds of weight as bias, therefore we will have two kinds of bias [...] - foreign bias for foreign investment investor and domestic bias for domestic investment trust investor. This paper is trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> that <b>whether</b> foreign bias and domestic bias effect firm value, {{and what kind of}} firm characteristics would affect foreign bias and domestic bias. We use random effect model to complete our regression analysis and we have two empirical evidence result. First, foreign bias is negatively related to firm value and domestic bias is positively related to firm value. Second, foreign bias and domestic bias are related to firm characteristics such as sales、EPS、ROE…. Etc. The most obviously effective firm characteristics variable for two kinds of biases is firm market value, and this result is in accordance with the research of Chan, Ng and Covrig(2005) 、Kang and Stulz(1997). 本研究主要目的是要探討在台灣股票市場當中，在外資法人與投信法人之總投資組合中個股所占之權重比例與個股之市場投資組合權重之比重差距，本研究定義外資法人之投資組合中個股所占其權重比例與個股之市場投資組合權重之比重差距為國外投資偏誤(Foreign Bias) 、投信法人之投資組合中個股所占其權重比例與個股之市場投資組合權重之比重差距為國內投資偏誤(Domestic Bias) ，藉由迴歸分析的方式探討這兩大Bias情況是否會影響公司價值Tobin’s Q值。以及探討主要影響國外投資偏誤(Foreign Bias) 與國內投資偏誤(Domestic Bias) 之公司特性與原因。研究對象為台灣股票市場上全體上市櫃公司。研究期間為 2002 - 2007 年之公司財務報告年資料，利用隨機效果模型(Random Effect Model) 實證綜合了橫斷面與時間序列資料性質之追蹤資料(Panel Data) 。經本研究實證結果如下： 1. 	本研究定義之國外投資偏誤(Foreign Bias) 變數與公司價值Tobin’s Q值呈現負向之迴歸關係，表示國外投資偏誤(Foreign Bias) 越小之公司會有較高之Tobin’s Q值；而本研究定義之國內投資偏誤(Domestic Bias) 與公司價值Tobin’s Q值呈現正向之迴歸關係，表示國內投資偏誤(Domestic Bias) 越大會有之公司有較高的Tobin’s Q值。且國內投資偏誤(Domestic Bias) 之迴歸係數大於國外投資偏誤(Foreign Bias) 之係數表示投信法人之Bias對於公司價值之影響更大。 2. 	國外投資偏誤(Foreign Bias) 與國內投資偏誤(Domestic Bias) 會受營業收入淨額、股價淨值比、每股盈餘、市值等因素影響，其中市值之統計檢定t值最為顯著，與過去研究顯示機構投資人均偏好市值規模大的我國上市公司結果相吻合，而以外資之偏好程度最大。第一章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究背景與動機	 1 第二節 研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻回顧	 4 第一節 機構投資人持股投資偏好相關文獻	 4 第二節 投資偏誤(Home Bias) 相關文獻	 7 第三章 資料來源與研究方法	 8 第一節 研究期間、樣本選取與資料來源	 8 第二節 BIAS計算說明	 9 第三節 變數定義說明	 11 第四節 模型設計	 13 第四章 實證分析	 15 第一節 敘述統計量	 15 第二節 迴歸分析	 24 第五章 結論與建議	 31 第一節 結論	 31 第二節 研究建議	 33 參考文獻	 34 中文部份	 34 英文部份	 3...|$|R
40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the Bachelor of Laws DegreeThe main objective {{of this paper is}} to assess the veracity of penal law objectives in child abuse cases in Kenya. The Children's Act under Section 2 looks at child abuse as consisting physical, sexual, psychological and mental injury. The research endeavours to cover the various forms of child abuse covered by various pieces of legislation, which are sexual abuse, child physical abuse and child trafficking and exploitation. The area is of interest due to a significant rise in child abuse incidences in the country over the years. One of the objectives of laws is to bring about social order in its purest form with an end to avoid conflict. As such to maintain this order the characteristic response of Kenyan legislate:·" to these atrocities was to pass laws that gave unlimited judicial discretion in sentencing and also severe deterrent punishments. From collected data over a span of 10 years since the enforcement of key legislations, the trend of child abuse crimes across the board have increased in conviction rates, prosecutions and arrests. The question then is whether the objective of the laws is responsible for this inefficiency. <b>To</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the <b>whether</b> a nexus exists thejurisdiction of Canada was used as a comparative study. The Canadian criminal system, based on Common law, is similar to that of Kenya. The similarity of judicial systems and similar child protection laws provided a proper specimen to analyse whether a nexus exists. The sentencing objectives in child abuse cases however is based on a mixture of retribution and deterrence tempered by mandatory minimum sentence. Across the board it was seen. that the cases of child abuse either diminished or maintained the same number due to effective investigations, implementation of mandatory minimum sentences and less judicial discretion in sentencing. Therefore, the Kenyan experience can be remedied through introduction of mandatory minimums of penalties. This removes discretion of the judiciary and as such aligns the purpose of the laws. Strengthening of child abuse investigations by the Kenya Police Service. This goes to improvement of infrastructure and reduction of bureaucracy. Setting up of proper reporting mechanisms to ensure an associated effort to ensure prosecution of crimes. This goes to the front of accessibility to proper authorities and access to justice...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} While {{corporate}} governance has received lots of attention in the academic economics and finance literature, board of directors’ committees (excluding audit committee) have not drawn the public eye. Even though, board member election {{is one of the}} most crucial ways for shareholders to affect how the company is managed, just a handful of studies have been conducted about the different methods of preparing and electing the directors. Since these ways vary from country to country it is no surprise that shareholders’ nomination boards, which are mainly used just in Scandinavia, have remained in the darkest shadows of academic literature. In 2015, the Finnish Corporate Governance Code was updated to include shareholders’ nomination boards as an equal alternative to the more common, within board nomination committees. After the inclusion, many companies have adopted shareholders’ nomination boards and at the end of 2016 already 41 listed firms used it in Helsinki stock exchange. Therefore, it is about the time to shed some academic light to shareholders’ nomination boards. Data and methodology A unique dataset is hand collected to study shareholders’ nomination boards and their development in Finland. Main data sources are company annual and corporate governance reports. After a thorough descriptive analysis, two different methods are used to examine nomination boards. First, Poisson and negative binomial regression models are constructed to study whether changes in nomination boards’ nominators have an effect on the subsequent board member turnover. Then, an event study methodology is used <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> evidences <b>whether</b> the ‘hit-and-run’ philosophy is in use in Finland. In ‘hit-and-run’ philosophy an investor buys large block of shares just before the holdings revision date to secure a seat in the shareholders’ nomination board. After that, she promotes new board member candidates that drive short-term value adding methods such as share repurchase plans or higher dividends. When the effect of the artificial short-term value creation is realized in the company stock, the agent collects the profit and moves on to next target. Key findings The thesis is the first detailed documentation of the shareholders’ nomination boards in Finland. Firms that use nomination board are very different in size and come from various industries but have on average highly concentrated ownership among the largest owners. Similarly, the nomination authority is concentrated to the hands of few, mainly to government and large pension funds. In addition, changes in nominators have a statistically significant and positive effect on the following board member turnover. Finally, there exist no indication that ‘hit-and-run’ philosophy would be used in Finland...|$|R
