50|$|Vendors who {{participate}} in farmers' markets usually have another, often primary form of employment. So, selling their goods at the market is usually a residual use of their time. One study suggests that participating in farmers' markets may reduce the incentives of small farm growers to expand their farms and become more efficient because they must dedicate significant <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> activities. This suggests that vendor profits may not increase {{by as much as}} they could due <b>to</b> the <b>time</b> dedicated <b>to</b> <b>marketing.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{measure of}} {{innovation}} at the organizational level relates to individuals, team-level assessments, and private companies from the smallest {{to the largest}} company. Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys, workshops, consultants, or internal benchmarking. There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation. Corporate measurements are generally structured around balanced scorecards which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances, innovation process efficiency, employees' contribution and motivation, as well benefits for customers. Measured values will vary widely between businesses, covering for example new product revenue, spending in R, <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>market,</b> customer and employee perception & satisfaction, number of patents, additional sales resulting from past innovations.|$|E
25|$|The MSX3 was {{scheduled}} for market in 1990. Delays {{in the development of}} its VDP—then named V9978 on the pre-release spec sheets—caused Yamaha to miss its <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>market</b> deadline. In its place, an improved MSX2+ was released as the MSX TurboR; features of the new R800 processor such as DMA and 24-bit addressing were disabled. The VDP was eventually delivered two years after its planned deadline, by which time the market had moved on. In an attempt to reduce its financial loss, Yamaha stripped nearly all V9958 compatibility and marketed the resulting V9990 E-VDP III as a video-chipset for PC VGA graphic cards, with moderate success. Sony also employed the V7040 RGB encoder chip on many other products. MSX-FAN Magazine also mentions the then-impressive power of the V9990, being able to compete with much more expensive hardware such as the Sharp X68000.|$|E
25|$|The 6809 {{design team}} {{believed}} that future system integrators would look to off-the-shelf code in ROMs to handle common tasks. Motorola's official programming manual contains the full listing of assist09, a so-called monitor, a miniature operating system {{intended to be}} burned in ROM. Another example of ROM code might be binary floating point arithmetic, which is a common requirement in many systems. In order to speed <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>market,</b> common code modules would be purchased, rather than developed in-house, and integrated into systems with code from other manufacturers. Since a CPU designer could hardly guarantee where this code would be located in a future system, the 6809 design focused heavily on support of position-independent, reentrant code that could be freely located anywhere in the memory map. This expectation was, in reality, never quite met: Motorola's only released example of a ROM'd software module was the MC6839 floating-point ROM. However, the decisions made by the design team made for a very powerful processor and made possible advanced operating systems like OS-9 and UniFlex, which {{took advantage of the}} position-independent, re-entrant nature of the 6809 to create multi-user multitasking operating systems.|$|E

On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio and Fantasia, the company had debts of $4million with the Bank of America in 1944. At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss {{the future of the}} company, the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini, told his executives, [...] "I've been watching the Disneys' pictures quite closely because I knew we were lending them money far above the financial risk....

[...] Disney's production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life Adventures, with Seal Island the first; the film won the Academy Award in the Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) category.|$|E

These studies typically use self-reported measures from surveys, often characterized by measurement error. This paper {{is the first}} validation study of access <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> data. Unique data from Peru allow comparison of self-reported variables with scientifically calculated variables. We investigate the determinants of the deviation between imputed and self-reported data and show that it is non-classical and dependent on observable socio-economic variables. Our results suggest that studies using self-reported measures of access may be estimating biased effects.
