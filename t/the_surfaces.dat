5|$|Chrysippus also {{responded to}} a problem first posed by Democritus. If a cone is divided by a plane {{parallel}} to its base, are <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then the cone becomes a cylinder; if they are unequal, then {{the surface of the}} cone must be stepped. The reply of Chrysippus was that <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> are both equal and unequal. Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of excluded middle with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>surface</b> {{energy of}} a liquid may be {{measured}} by stretching a liquid membrane (which increases <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> area and hence <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> energy).

40|$|We discuss <b>the</b> rough <b>surface</b> {{effects on}} a {{two-dimensional}} chiral k_x+ik_y superconductor. The atomic scale roughness at <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> is considered using the random S matrix model. The roughness {{effects on the}} self-consistent order parameter, <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> mass current and <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> density of states are studied using the quasi-classical theory. We find that <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> mass current is suppressed by <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> roughness. <b>The</b> <b>surface</b> density of states shows a quite similar behavior to that of superfluid ^ 3 He B phase. When <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> is specular, <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> Andreev bound states form a band which fills the bulk energy gap Δ_ bulk. When <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> becomes diffusive, there occurs a sharp upper edge of <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> bound states band and there opens a sub-gap between the edge and the bulk energy gap. We show that this sub-gap is induced by the repulsion between <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> bound states and the propagating Bogoliubov quasi-particles through the second order process of roughness.

5|$|Jupiter's {{extensive}} magnetosphere envelops its {{ring system}} and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites. Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles sputter off material from <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> and create chemical changes via radiolysis. The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries. In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.|$|E

The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the tombs}} are {{not open to}} the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs.

40|$|Fluorescence {{correlation}} spectroscopy (FCS) is a sophisticated and an accurate analytical technique {{used to study}} the diffusion of molecules in a solution at the single-molecule level. FCS is strongly affected by many {{factors such as the}} stability of the excitation power, photochemical processes, mismatch between the refractive indices, and variations in the cover glass thickness. We have studied FCS near <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of a cover glass by using rhodamine 123 as a fluorescent probe and have observed that <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> has a strong influence on the measurements. The temporal autocorrelation of FCS decays with two characteristic times when the confocal detection volume is positioned near <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> cover glass. As the position of the detection volume is moved away from <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>the</b> FCS autocorrelation becomes one-component decaying; the characteristic time of the decay {{is the same as the}} faster-decay-ing component in the FCS autocorrelation near <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> This observation suggests that the faster component can be attributed to the free diffusion of the probe molecules in the solution, while the slow component has its origin from the interaction between the probe molecules and <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> We have characterized <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> contribution to <b>the</b> FCS measurements near <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> by changing <b>the</b> position of the detection volume relative to <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> influence of <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> on <b>the</b> diffusion of the probe molecules was monitored by changing the chemical pro-perties of <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> <b>surface</b> contribution to <b>the</b> temporal autocorrelation of the FCS strongly depends on the chemical nature of <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> hydrophobicity of <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> is a major factor determining <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> influence on <b>the</b> free diffusion of the probe molecules near <b>the</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|R

5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E
