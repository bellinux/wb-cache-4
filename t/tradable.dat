In October 2016, the National Assembly of Quebec passed a new zero emission vehicle legislation that obliges major automakers selling cars in the Canadian province to offer their customers a minimum number of plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. Under the new law, 3.5% {{of the total number}} of autos sold by carmakers in Quebec have to be zero emissions vehicles starting in 2018, rising to 15.5% in 2020. A <b>tradable</b> credit system was created for those carmakers not fulfilling their quotas to avoid financial penalties. Quebec aims to have 100,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by 2020.|$|E

40|$|In most sub-Saharan African (SSA) {{countries}} {{there is}} a strong connection between <b>tradables</b> recovery and the alleviation of rural poverty through higher farm incomes, agricultural wages, rural multiplier effects and inter-sectoral linkages. Liberalisation policies, as elaborated in the Berg report (1991) and subsequent World Bank documents, stressed the importance of reversing stagnation in agricultural <b>tradables</b> by `getting prices right' and removing state monopolies on marketing. Increasing producer prices and devaluing overvalued exchange rates was seen as the means of increasing export revenues and reducing current account deficits. This paper examines the performance of agricultural <b>tradables</b> through the reform phase for a selection of sub-Saharan African countries to see how far recovery has taken place. The descriptive statistics show that agricultural <b>tradables</b> recovery has not been sustained and that in real terms, prices have fallen rather than risen, while the relative prices of non-tradables have increased. A simple model of the determinants of <b>tradables</b> output is tested using data for 14 SSA countries and six major <b>tradables.</b> The results show that, contrary to conventional theory, none of the price variables underlying liberalisation are significantly associated with <b>tradables</b> output, indicating the importance of non-price factors such as the reform of institutions. The final part of the paper examines variations in the relevant institutional arrangements and evidence for `export pessimism' attitudes which may have hindered sustained <b>tradables</b> recovery and the alleviation of rural poverty...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} macroeconomic literature {{attributes the}} nominal and real {{exchange rate volatility}} to two mechanisms. The first one, underlined by Betts and Devereux [1996], lays stress on the deviation from the law of one price due to Pricing-To-Market (PTM) behavior whereas the second mechanism, uncovered by Hau [2000], relies {{on the presence of}} non <b>tradables.</b> This paper provides an integrated model with PTM and non <b>tradables.</b> We show that both effects are deeply intertwined. Following an expansion in the relative money supplies, PTM increases exchange rate volatility especially in open economies. Similarly, non <b>tradables</b> magnifies the exchange rate depreciation providing that the law of one price holds for a large share of <b>tradables.</b> Finally, the model suggests that PTM is more important than non <b>tradables</b> in accounting for the high exchange rate volatility. ...|$|R

40|$|It is a truism {{that the}} Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC), through the {{establishment}} of her plantations, is a major development partner in Cameroon; {{it is the second}} largest employer after the government. This corporation principally cultivates three <b>tradables,</b> they include, rubber, oil palm and banana. The large scale cultivation of these <b>tradables</b> contributes significantly to Cameroon’s agricultural exports. However, it is observed that variations in climate {{have an effect on the}} output of these <b>tradables.</b> This study attempts a comparative assessment of the effects of climatic variations on CDC’s rubber, oil palm and banana; it identifies the extent to which the observed 16 year fluctuations in rainfall and temperature have affected the output of the three <b>tradables.</b> Climatic data, which constituted essentially of rainfall and temperature, was obtained for a 16 year period (1995 - 2010) in each of the plantation sites while the output for these three <b>tradables</b> were also obtained from the CDC Group Rubber, Oil palm and Banana Departments. Trend analyses were done to establish variations in temperature and rainfall while the error correction model was employed to determine the impact of such variations on the output of the three <b>tradables.</b> In order to ensure the robustness of the results, the Phillips - Perron unit root test statistics was employed to test for stationarity and the results for each of the variables used in the error correction model equations for the different crops confirm that all the variables were stationary after the first differencing. In addition, the Durbin Watson test for the presence of serial correlation and the semi-robust standard error was used to take care of potential problems of heteroskedasticity. It was established that there is an observed variation in climate and such variations have a profound effect on the three <b>tradables,</b> although the magnitudes vary. The production trend for all the <b>tradables</b> show an average decline in yields from 1. 6 tons to 1 ton per hectare for rubber, 7. 5 to 5. 1 tons per hectare for oil palm and 41. 9 to 23 tons per hectare for banana between 1995 and 2010. Generally, the findings show that increasing temperature and declining rainfall have significant and varied effects on the outputs of these perennial crops of the CDC. In the circumstances therefore, the study recommends crop-specific adaptation measures which could be adopted by the CDC to reduce the effects of climatic variations on these <b>tradables.</b> </p...|$|R

Across countries, national price levels increase systematically with the level of a country's per capita income, and the ratios of <b>tradables</b> to nontra— dables prices decrease. Over time, increases in per capita income are generally associated with increases in price levels in the industrial countries, although the opposite relationship tended to prevail among deve-loping countries.

25|$|Rudi Dornbusch (1998) {{and others}} say that income rises can change the ratio of demand for goods and {{services}} (<b>tradable</b> and non-tradable sectors). This is because services tend to be superior goods, which are consumed proportionately more heavily at higher incomes.|$|E
30|$|The {{estimation}} {{results show}} {{clear evidence of}} asymmetric effects from the production growth rate: in manufacturing and <b>tradables,</b> the asymmetry consists of larger effects of low (including negative) growth rates on capital accumulation than those of high growth rates, while in non-tradables the opposite is true, with larger effects from high growth rates than those of low growth rates. Thus, in <b>tradables</b> for example, a relatively low production growth rate (or a negative one) tends to reduce the capital accumulation rate by {{more than it is}} increased by a high production growth rate. Note, however, that the new results do not affect the conclusions previously obtained for the RER: as in the original equations, we still observe that in manufacturing and <b>tradables</b> an appreciation tends to reduce the capital accumulation rate by more than a depreciation tends to increase it.|$|R
30|$|According to one view, a depreciated RER level {{raises the}} rate of {{economic}} growth by redistributing income from wages to profits, thus increasing the economy’s saving and investment rates (see for example Gluzmann et al. 2012). The dominant theoretical approach (as articulated for example by Rodrik 2008), however, takes a more disaggregated view and argues that a depreciated RER level affects {{the rate of}} economic growth by its differentiated effects on the <b>tradables</b> and non-tradables sectors. In particular, a depreciation increases the relative price and profitability of <b>tradables,</b> stimulating its expansion. Since the <b>tradables</b> sector {{is characterized by the}} use of modern, capital-intensive technology, its expansion leads to higher rates of capital accumulation and productivity growth for {{the economy as a whole}} (see Rapetti 2016 for a discussion of the RER’s growth channels, and Ibarra 2016 for a review of the literature).|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{structure}} of Gaussian pricing models (that is, models in which future returns are normally distributed). Although much is already known about such models, this article differs {{in that it is}} based on a formulation of the theory of derivative pricing in which numeraire invariance is manifest, extending earlier work on this subject. The focus on symmetry properties leads to a deeper insight in {{the structure of}} these models. The central idea is the construction of the most general class of derived Gaussian <b>tradables</b> given a set of underlying <b>tradables</b> which are themselves Gaussian. These derived <b>tradables</b> are called "generalized power tradables" and they correspond to portfolios in which the fraction of total value invested in each asset is a deterministic function of time. Applying this theory to Gaussian HJM models, the new <b>tradables</b> give an explicit description of the interdependence of bonds implicit in such models. Given this structure, a simple condition is derived under which these models allow a description in terms of an M-factor Markov functional model, as introduced by Hunt, Kennedy and Pelsser. Finally, conditions are derived under which these Gaussian Markov functional models are time homogeneous (bond volatilities depending only on the time to maturity). This result is linked to recent results by Björk and Gombani...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relative}} wage {{and the relative}} price effects of higher productivity growth in <b>tradables</b> relative to non <b>tradables</b> in a two-sector open economy model with search unemployment. Applying cointegration methods to a panel of eighteen OECD countries over the period 1970 - 2007, our estimates reveal that a 1 percentage point increase in the productivity differential between <b>tradables</b> and non <b>tradables</b> lowers the non traded wage relative to the traded wage (relative wage) by 0. 22 % and appreciates the relative price of non <b>tradables</b> by 0. 64 %. While {{the decline in the}} relative wage reveals the presence of mobility costs preventing from the wage equalization across sectors, the relative wage responses to a productivity differentialdisplay a large dispersion across countries, thus suggesting that labor market frictions vary substantially across OECD economies. Using a set of indicators capturing the heterogeneity of labor market frictions across economies, we find that the relative wage significantly declines more in countries where labor market regulation is more pronounced. These empirical findings can be rationalized in a two-sector open economy model with search in the labor market and an endogenous labor force participation. In line with our estimates, our quantitative analysis reveals that the relative wage falls more in countries where unemployment benefits are more generous, firing cost is high, the worker bargaining power is large, and/or the labor force is less responsive at the extensive margin. When calibrating the model to each OECD economy, our numerical results reveal that the model predicts the relative wage response fairly well, {{and to a lesser extent}} the relative price response...|$|R
