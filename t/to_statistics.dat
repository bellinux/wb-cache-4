5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>statistics,</b> the South Okanagan {{region is}} underserved {{in terms of}} airports, owing to its population. The Kelowna International Airport {{provides}} international flights to 62commercial destinations daily. South Okanagan is home to 79,475people, totaling 25percent of the Okanagan area as a whole. The air travel market of the local area consists of 210,000passengers yearly. However, in 1990, the Penticton Regional Airport {{was considered to be}} the area's primary airport, hence why people questioned the need to expand the Kelowna International Airport at that time, when its runway {{was in the process of}} expansion.|$|E

According <b>to</b> <b>statistics</b> collected by the National Australia Bank and reported in The Canberra Times, Canberrans on average give significantly more money to charity than Australians in other states and territories, for both dollar giving and as a proportion of income.|$|E
5|$|The English Cocker Spaniel is {{the most}} {{successful}} breed at the most popular dog show in the UK, Crufts, with seven best-in-show wins since the prize was first awarded in 1928.

They are the second most popular dog breed in the UK according <b>to</b> <b>statistics</b> released by the KC with 22,211 registrations in 2009, beaten only by the Labrador Retriever with 40,943.

50|$|System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is a {{framework}} <b>to</b> compile <b>statistics</b> linking environmental <b>statistics</b> <b>to</b> economic <b>statistics.</b> SEEA {{is described as}} a satellite system to the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA). This means that the definitions, guidelines and practical approaches of the SNA are applied to the SEEA. This system enables environmental <b>statistics</b> <b>to</b> be compared <b>to</b> economic <b>statistics</b> as the system boundaries are the same after some processing of the input statistics. By analysing statistics on the economy and the environment {{at the same time it}} is possible to show different patterns of sustainability for production and consumption. It can also show the economic consequences of maintaining a certain environmental standard.|$|R

As a result of the lack of a competition, there were no postseason games played after the 1882 season. According <b>to</b> <b>statistics</b> compiled by the National Championship Foundation, Parke Davis, and the Helms Athletic Foundation, Yale was declared the 1884 season champion.

5|$|According to the 2006 census, the country's largest {{self-reported}} {{ethnic origin}} is Canadian (accounting for 32% of the population), followed by English (21%), French (15.8%), Scottish (15.1%), Irish (13.9%), German (10.2%), Italian (4.6%), Chinese (4.3%), First Nations (4.0%), Ukrainian (3.9%), and Dutch (3.3%). There are 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands, encompassing {{a total of}} 1,172,790 people. Canada's indigenous population is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's population claimed an indigenous identity in 2006. Another 16.2 {{percent of the population}} belonged to a non-indigenous visible minority. In 2006, the largest visible minority groups were South Asian (4.0%), Chinese (3.9%) and Black (2.5%). Between 2001 and 2006, the visible minority population rose by 27.2 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups. By 2007, almost one in five (19.8%) were foreign-born, with nearly 60 percent of new immigrants coming from Asia (including the Middle East). The leading sources of immigrants to Canada were China, the Philippines and India. According <b>to</b> <b>Statistics</b> Canada, visible minority groups could account for a third of the Canadian population by 2031.|$|E
5|$|Playing {{away from}} Merton at a {{supposedly}} temporary home, Wimbledon {{set a record}} for the lowest-ever English top-flight attendance on 22 August 1992 with 3,759 watching the clash with Coventry City, before breaking it twice more: 12 December 1992 against Oldham Athletic with 3,386, and finally on 26 January 1993, drawing only 3,039 fans to a Tuesday-night match against Everton, with reportedly 1,500 travelling from Liverpool. All ten of the Premier League's lowest attendances were Wimbledon home matches in the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons. However the general trend {{was one of a}} sharp rise—the club's average home attendance more than doubled at Selhurst Park from around 8,000 during the last years at Plough Lane to a peak of over 18,000 during the 1998–99 Premier League season. Wimbledon's fans were a blend between locals who had supported the club since its non-League days and supporters who had defected from other London teams. According <b>to</b> <b>statistics</b> compiled in 2000, 56% of Wimbledon season-ticket holders were locally born (the second lowest in the Premier League), and only 12% had fathers who were Wimbledon fans. Many attended Wimbledon matches as it was cheaper and safer than other clubs in the capital—Wimbledon had more women and children at their games than any other top-flight club. In 2000, 23% of Wimbledon season-ticket holders earned over £50,000 a year, the second-highest in the division after Chelsea (33%).|$|E
