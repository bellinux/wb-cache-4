40|$|AbstractA {{modal shift}} to rail {{is crucial to}} {{achieving}} a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, relieving urban congestion and providing increased mobility. In order to successfully meet this growing demand for efficient and green mobility, the railway sector needs to progress in terms of quality of service, energy and life cycle costs, interoperability, capacity, noise reduction and must also further develop its carbon emission advantages. Roll 2 Rail is a research project which aims to develop key technologies that will overcome hurdles to innovation in rolling stock development and forms part of a longer term strategy towards revolutionising the rolling stock of today. The results {{will contribute to the}} increase of operational reliability and to the reduction of the life cycle costs. This project started in May 2015 and it is supported by the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Commission (www. roll 2 rail. eu). Roll 2 Rail is one of the so called “lighthouse projects” of the Shift 2 Rail Joint Undertaking and will contribute to Innovation Programme 1. At the end of the project the outcomes will be incorporated into real vehicles or relevant environments within the <b>Technical</b> <b>Demonstrators</b> of Shift 2 Rail. In particular, Roll 2 Rail focuses on technological innovations in different subsystems of the vehicles which, individually, each and all together, contribute to achieve the desired impact at vehicle and whole railway system level on capacity, reliability, efficiency, comfort and life cycle costs. The project expects innovations in 8 different areas such as traction and power electronics, train communications, car bodyshell, running gear technologies, brakes, train interiors, noise and vibration and energy performance. Moreover, this project will deliver a set of technical recommendations and proposals of standardisation.

40|$|Moisture-harvesting lizards, {{such as the}} Australian {{thorny devil}} (Agamidae: Moloch horridus) and two horned lizards (Iguanidae: Phrynosoma cornutum, P. platyrhinos) studied during this thesis, have {{remarkable}} adaptations for inhabiting arid regions. Special skin structures enable the lizard to collect water by capillarity and passively transport it to the mouth for ingestion. The ecological role of this mechanism clearly is the acquisition of water from various possible sources. Possible sources were evaluated regarding their potential for water uptake of M. horridus and P. platyrhinos. The water volume required to fill the skin capillary system was determined for both species. Thorny devils standing in water could fill the capillary system and drank its water, whereas desert horned lizards only drank when sprayed with water. Drinking occurred at about 0. 67 µL per jaw movement. Water collection from moist sand could only fill the capillary channels to 58 % of their capacity, and none drank water. However, placing moist sand on skin replicas of thorny devils and considering sand shoveling behavior suggest that water collection from moist sand could be considered as the most ecologically-likely source for M. horridus on a regular basis. For P. platyrhinos {{the total amount of}} water collection from moist sand was four times less than that of thorny devils. Taking behavioral aspects, such as rain-harvesting posture and nocturnal burrowing, into account, rain appears to be a major water source for P. platyrhinos. Capillary water transport was characterized for live thorny devils using high-speed video analyses. Comparison with preserved specimens showed that live lizards are required for detailed studies of skin water transport. For thorny devils, there was no directionality in cutaneous water transport (unlike Phrynosoma) as water droplets applied to the skin were transported radially. The total capillary volume is reduced to 50 % filling by the time capillary transportation ceases. The channels were found to be hierarchically structured as a large channel between the scales that is sub-divided by protrusions into smaller sub-capillaries. The large cavities were considered to quickly absorb water and the sub-capillaries were identified to extend the transport distance by about 39 %. This potentially reduces the water volume required for imbibition. P. cornutum exhibits a directional water transport, where water is transported preferentially towards the lizard's snout. It could be shown that this phenomenon is based on geometric principles, namely on a periodic pattern of interconnected half-open capillary channels that narrow and widen. Following a biomimetic approach, these principles were used to develop designs for <b>technical</b> <b>demonstrators</b> of functionality. Building upon the Young-Laplace equation, a theoretical model for the local behavior of the liquid in such capillaries is derived. Artificial surfaces designed in accordance with this model and derived design rules prevent liquid flow in one direction while sustaining it in the other. This fluid transport is passive, requiring no external energy. The surface structures were successfully validated for material-liquid combinations such as Plexiglas® with water and hot working tool steel with oils and lubricants. Laser ablation for manufacturing demonstrators was found to require further adaptation of structure designs in order to avoid potential sub-capillaries. However, several fabrications methods can be considered for the great number of potential applications that require such directional, passive liquid transport. In particular, the surface structures could lead to process improvements and reduction of resources in fields of lubrication...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the AO performance we got on-sky with RAVEN, a Multi-Object Adaptive Optics (MOAO) <b>technical</b> and science <b>demonstrator</b> {{installed and tested}} at the Subaru telescope. We report Ensquared-Energy (EE) and Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) measured from science images on Subaru's IRCS taken during all of the on-sky observing runs.

The performances of the MOAO and Ground-Layer AO (GLAO) modes are between the classical Single-Conjugate AO (SCAO) and seeing-limited modes. We achieve the EE of 30 % in H-band with the MOAO correction, which is a science requirement for RAVEN. The MOAO provides sightly better performance than the GLAO mode in both asterisms. One of the reasons which cause this small difference between the MOAO and GLAO modes may be the strong GL contribution.

In order to increase accessibility of onboard experimentation, Space Applications Services will soon launch the ICE Cubes facility as part of its ICE Cubes Service. The facility is foreseen to host standardized plug-and-play payload cubes to reduce overall cost and procedure time required to install payloads on the station. To remotely support the facility it is decided to develop a utility cube named Cube-Zero that will be launched and installed with the facility on the station. This thesis work included the complete design, development and documentation of the cube. The thesis started by conducting a preliminary needs and market study from which two specific purposes were defined for the cube. In addition to its original function of support-utility, the cube is tasked to be a <b>technical</b> commercial <b>demonstrator</b> for the service. This led to the conceptual design of the cube as a multidisciplinary framework able to host two user-defined experiment modules. The preliminary concept was further refined in this paper and with support of prototypes, simulations and analyses led to a final functional design for the Cube-Zero. The work is concluded with the manufacturing of an engineering model of the cube. The model is fully operational, can support the test of the facility before launch and can demonstrate to users its versatility and ease of use in operating any kind of experiment module. Eventually, the information gathered in this thesis report will support future users into developing their own Cube-Zero payload module and guide Space Applications Services into manufacturing, testing and operating the Cube-Zero protoflight model.

This session takes a student-centred perspective on curriculum design & integration, induction and academic & social integration. The poster session discusses the integration of modular schemes and the impact on students new to HE with particular reference to creative practice, {{but it should be}} of interest to any academic staff teaching on modular schemes, as well as personal tutors, year tutors and <b>technical</b> & <b>demonstrator</b> staff. We examine the ways in which studio practice can be integrated within a holistic approach to learning: discuss the role of expert technical staff {{in the context of a}} broader programme of work and make specific reference to first year students and their transition to HE studies. We argue against looking at any aspect of the curriculum in isolation. Instead we should look to create an experience that encourages students, particularly new students, to engage with all aspects of the curriculum and at the same time, offer them creative challenges and encourage their social and academic integration into the programme. We draw references from a range of writers: Tinto (1975), Grossman, Hammerness and McDonald (2009), Martinez (2001) and Thomas (2002) who all promote, in subtly different ways, an emphasis on integration, group support, academic support, shared values and a community of learning. We discuss how expert technical staff can give valuable feedback without the pressure of the formal critique (Day, 2012) and how they can encourage the development of peer group support that now seems an essential aspect of success in HE (University of Leicester, 2010). With specific reference to our own subject area, Photography, we examine how we have created a more holistic experience within a modular scheme, how we have co-ordinated the curriculum across a range of subject areas, integrated the role of personal tutors, encouraged academic and social integration among new students and how we have actively supported students at risk of withdrawing.

40|$|The {{scattering}} of radio waves and multipath propagation in {{the interstellar medium}} (ISM) of our Galaxy produces various observable phenomena such as the interstellar scintillation (ISS) and angular broadening of compact radio sources, {{as well as the}} temporal smearing of impulsive radio bursts. These effects have been harnessed as probes of the ISM and of the background sources themselves. On the other hand, scattering in the intergalactic medium (IGM) has yet to be incontrovertibly detected, and is a main target of future surveys and instruments, since the IGM constitutes the main reservoir of baryons in the Universe. The first part of this thesis makes use of observational data from a survey of interstellar scintillation (ISS) of compact Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) to further investigate the nature of these sources, the ISM, ISS, and methods of handling variability data in the presence of stochastic and systematic errors. This study therefore acts as a <b>technical</b> and scientific <b>demonstrator</b> for future large-scale surveys of ISS and the variable radio sky. The results of this study further strengthen the link between AGN variability at radio wavelengths with ISS, and show how the spectral indices and mean flux densities of the sources, as well as observing frequencies, all influence the observed ISS characteristics. Six new rapid scintillators with characteristic time-scales of. 2 hours were identified in the sample, providing new insight into the origin of rapid and extreme scintillation. This thesis also presents the first detailed investigation into the origin of the suppresion of ISS for AGNs at z & 2 as discovered by the Micro-Arcsecond Scintillation Induced Variability (MASIV) Survey, a precursor to the present work. I determined that the redshift dependence of ISS is partially linked to the steepening of source spectral indices (_ 8. 4 4. 9) with redshift, caused either by selection biases or AGN evolution, coupled with weaker ISS in the _ 8. 4 4. 9 < − 0. 4 sources. Selecting only the − 0. 4 < _ 8. 4 4. 9 < 0. 4 sources, the redshift dependence of ISS is still significant, but is not significantly steeper than the expected (1 + z) 0. 5 scaling of source angular sizes due to cosmological expansion for a brightness temperature and flux-limited sample of sources. No significant evidence of scatter broadening in the IGM was found, placing the strongest upper limit to date of. 8 μas at 4. 9 GHz for sight-lines to the most compact, _ 10 μas sources. The second part of the thesis makes use of this observational limit on IGM scattering, together with extensions of ISM scattering models to cosmological scales, to investigate the detectability of the IGM with next generation radio arrays. While angular broadening in the IGM is insignificant for most sight-lines and appears difficult to resolve even with space VLBI, significant temporal smearing of extragalactic radio transients cannot be ruled out, and provides the best chance of detecting IGM scattering. However, the corresponding reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio of these bursts potentially places crippling limits on the detectability of such transient pulses in the first place, particularly at frequencies below _ 1 GHz. This has important ramifications for the optimization of observational strategies for detecting extragalactic radio transients with low-frequency instruments such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the low frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{improved}} situation awareness {{is a key}} concern for military agencies, promising to deliver strategic advantages {{in a variety of}} conflict and non-conflict scenarios. Improved situation awareness can benefit operational effectiveness by facilitating the planning process, improving the quality and timeliness of decisions, and providing better feedback regarding the strategic consequences of military actions. In this paper, we aim to show how a combination of semantic technologies and user interface design initiatives can be used to improve situation awareness in a simulated humanitarian relief scenario. We describe the development of a <b>technical</b> <b>demonstrator</b> system, the AKTiveSA TDS, which integrates a variety of knowledge technologies and visualization components {{within the context of a}} unitary application framework. We also describe our approach to scenario development, knowledge acquisition, ontology engineering and system design. Some specific problems encountered during system development are discussed, e. g. the performance overheads associated with rules-based processing, and potential solution strategies for these problems are presented alongside a description of future development activities...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop/elaborate the concept Privacy by Design (PbD) and to explore the {{validity}} of the PbD framework. Design/methodology/approach: Attention for alternative concepts, such as PbD, which might offer surplus value in safeguarding privacy, is growing. Using PbD to design for privacy in ICT systems is still rather underexplored and requires substantial conceptual and empirical work to be done. The methodology includes conceptual analysis, empirical validation (focus groups and interviews) and technological testing (a <b>technical</b> <b>demonstrator</b> was build). Findings: A holistic PbD approach can offer surplus value in better safeguarding of privacy without losing functional requirements. However, the implementation is not easily realised and confronted with several difficulties such as: potential lack of economic incentives, legacy systems, lack of adoption of trust of end-users and consumers in PbD. Originality/value: The article brings together/incorporates several contemporary insights on privacy protection and privacy by design and develops/presents a holistic framework for Privacy by Design framework consisting of five building blocks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E
40|$|Globalization, rising product variety, {{the need}} for {{continuously}} improving productivity and quality demand higher agility of manufacturing systems. Well-known principles like encapsulating functionality into mechatronic systems to enable reuse and standardization are basic approaches to gain agility in manufacturing environments. However, {{there is a lack}} of a holistic communication architecture for manufacturing systems and an overall concept to organize the continuously changing production planning and control processes. The paradigm of service-oriented architectures emerged as a concept to increase the flexibility and reuse within IT environments by using software modules with standardized communication interfaces. Transferring this paradigm to the field of manufacturing offers a unique opportunity to complement the advances of standardized communication interfaces and mechatronic encapsulation with powerful production planning and control methods. In this paper the central aspects and the potentials of transferring service-oriented paradigms from IT to automation are discussed. The methodology of process-oriented manufacturing planning is presented as the organizational fundament for an efficient establishment of service-oriented manufacturing systems. An approach for a process-oriented factory model is presented as the basis for a process-oriented planning process. Furthermore, a <b>technical</b> <b>demonstrator</b> that provides the opportunity for evaluating SOA technologies and our new planning approach is shown...|$|E
40|$|Focusing {{on small}} {{satellites}} to perform scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>demonstrator</b> missions {{have been a}} successful concept within the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) for two decades. This paper will focus on two missions that are currently underway, PRISMA, which is in Phase C, and SVEA, which has completed Pre-phase A studies. Both missions require advanced and newly developed technologies to operate as intended and are meant to extend the capabilities of small satellites to areas previously limited to medium to large satellites, such as formation flying, environment and security. This paper will describe the PRISMA formation flying two satellite platform {{and how it will}} demonstrate techniques such as formation flying, proximity ranging and novel propulsion technologies, each of which may have significant impact on future spacecrafts. The subsequent section will describe the SVEA high resolution Earth observation platform. SVEA would be an operational satellite within the Swedish government and be at the disposal to various Swedish agencies. It will show that high resolution images can be obtained from a low-cost small satellite. The technology development and knowledge gained from PRISMA will be taken advantage of in SVEA. The paper concludes by showing how such missions as PRISMA and SVEA demonstrate areas where small satellites can be key to mission success...|$|E
