Prior to filming, Foster met with the fallen serviceman's family and friends to understand the person he would be portraying. [...] "It was such a rich opportunity {{to listen to the}} Axelsons talk about their son. Their generosity and inclusiveness with me was so touching and open. <b>They</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> talk about their boy because they love him; so we, in turn, love him. We can’t bring him back, but what we can do is aim, every day, to do the best that we can to honor him." ...|$|E
500|$|For Filipinos, {{music and}} dancing {{is said to}} be a way of life. Natives of the Philippines are {{reported}} to have a tendency to [...] "sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations". Thomeczeck stated, [...] "The Filipinos love music and <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> sing and dance. Whatever they are in a natural way, they can continue that habit in prison." [...] Despite other colleagues' enthusiasm about the dancing, chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing, as CPDRC was undermanned. Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center's Operations Manual, Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen. [...] "As a jail officer, I got worried when I saw it", Rubio commented. The inmates were not fond of the idea either, pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison. Prisoners eventually agreed to dance, but admitted that the routines took awhile to master. [...] "It was difficult at first, but eventually we inmates got used to it", inmate Mario Benito revealed. [...] The program began as an experiment and, after six months, prison chiefs concluded that it was a successful one.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{most people}} not knowing {{she is the}} actual artist of the artwork, Ward stated: And who am I going to tell that I am behind the artwork? I don’t think most people {{think about all the}} work that happens behind the scenes. And it should be that way. The viewers should be caught up in the show. Anyway, it doesn’t come up much. I do have a niece who thinks it’s pretty cool. And I {{impressed}} a bunch of third-graders at career day at my daughter’s school. But they were much more excited by the work I did for the [...] Go figure...And drawing for [...] was exceptional. It wasn’t just a one-time gig for a movie that is out in theaters for a couple weeks. It was ongoing and evolving. Although I {{had nothing to do with}} the concepts behind Peyton’s art, and her drawings are a tiny part of the show, I have to admit I have loved hearing that people out there have connected with the artwork. I have received e-mails from [...] fans who say <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> draw and the artwork on the show is really important to them. How cool is that?! ...|$|E

60|$|The boys {{went upstairs}} {{and started to}} undress. Phil had been asleep, but roused up at their entrance. The boys {{occupied}} a large chamber, with two double beds in it, for <b>they</b> <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> be together, as at school.|$|R

2500|$|Federal {{authorities}} say Shahzad voluntarily waived his Miranda rights {{and his right}} to an initial speedy court appearance, and agreed to answer questions. He was interrogated by the recently formed High-Value Interrogation Group. Ron Kuby, who has represented a number of terrorism defendants, said: [...] "My experience with ... Islamists, is <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> talk. Their goal isn't to beat the rap when they're caught. Their goal is either to die as a martyr, or commit mass murder". Ken Wainstein, a former U.S. attorney who headed the Justice Department's anti-terrorism efforts, said that a defendant's cooperation is motivated by [...] "just sheer pride in what he's done." [...] Faisal was arraigned on May 18. He is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. On June 17, {{a federal grand jury}} indicted Shahzad on terror charges. Shazad pleaded guilty to the charges. On October 5, 2010, he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole by a federal judge in New York. He responded to the sentence by saying that [...] "the defeat of the U.S. is imminent." [...] When asked by the judge, [...] "Didn't you swear allegiance to this country?" [...] Shahzad, a naturalized U.S. citizen, replied, [...] "I sweared, but I didn't mean it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duff herself co-wrote three {{tracks on}} the album: [...] "Mr. James Dean", [...] "Haters" [...] and [...] "Rock This World", {{the first two}} of which, along with [...] "The Last Song", Haylie co-wrote. Hilary said she refrained from co-writing the entire album because [...] "I don't know if I'm secure enough with myself to do that". She has characterised [...] "Haters" [...] as [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] and said people would {{know what it is}} about when they heard it, and it {{attracted}} substantial publicity when rumors circulated that it was about actress Lindsay Lohan, with whom Duff was alleged to have been feuding. The Scoop, a gossip section of the website MSNBC, quoted an insider who had said, [...] "Hilary thinks that Lindsay has been directing negativity at her for too long." [...] Duff denied that the rumors were true, saying she did not know Lohan and would not write a song about her. She said that at the time she wrote it she was feeling she had to openly discuss her personal life because [...] "people make accusations and there are lies and rumors constantly ... people are so negative. <b>They</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> read what's coming out next on Page Six [...] and I just felt like it was appropriate." [...] She said she felt [...] "normal girls" [...] could relate to the song because of the [...] "petty stuff" [...] that occurs in schools.|$|E

Then Ata had a baby, and the old woman who came up to help her through her trouble stayed on. Presently the granddaughter of the old woman came to stay with her, and then a youth appeared -- no one quite knew where from or to whom he belonged -- but he settled down with them in a happy-go-lucky way, and they all lived together.|$|E
