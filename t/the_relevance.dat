40|$|Background: This study tests <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of interim {{accounting}} information. The {{study also}} explores whether <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of annual and interim financial statements {{has changed over}} time. Aim: It explores whether <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of interim financial statements is higher than <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of annual financial statements. Finally, it investigates whether accounting information published in interim and annual financial statements has incremental value <b>relevance.</b> Setting: Data for <b>the</b> period from 1999 to 2012 were collected from a sample of non-financial companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Method: The Ohlson model to investigate <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of accounting information {{was used for the}} study. Results: The results show that interim book value of equity is value relevant while interim earnings are not. Interim financial statements appear to have higher value relevance than annual financial statements. <b>The</b> value <b>relevance</b> of interim and annual accounting information has remained fairly constant over the sample period. Incremental comparisons provide evidence that additional book value of equity and earnings that accrue to a company between interim and annual reporting dates are value relevant. Conclusion: The study was conducted over a long sample period (1999 – 2012), in an era when a technology-driven economy and more timely reporting media could have had an effect on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of published accounting information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of published interim and annual financial statements...|$|R
40|$|Accounting {{literature}} suggests that contemporaneous earnings are more useful than current operating cash flow in predicting future cash flows and, therefore, also more relevant for company valuation.

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> {{of research and}} development (R&D) expenditures in the pre and post International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) periods in the UK. It also examines firm size and sector-based differences in <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of R&D during the sample period between 2001 and 2011. The results indicate that capitalized R&D has value <b>relevance</b> during <b>the</b> 11 years sample period. However, <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of capitalized R&D {{does not appear to have}} improved in the post-IFRS period. Large firms present higher value relevance of capitalized R&D than small firms which suggest that firm size has significantly different valuation effects on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of R&D expenditures. Sectors, however, do not appear to present valuation differences across manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms. The overall findings of this study report no difference in <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of expensed R&D in the pre and post-IFRS periods; however, <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of capitalized R&D appears to decrease from pre to post-IFRS period.

40|$|This thesis investigates <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and {{the effect}} of the {{financial}} crisis on European financial firms. The empirical work is divided into two parts. The first part examines the impact of mandatory IFRS adoption and of the financial crisis on <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of accounting information. For a sample of financial firms listed in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland over 1998 - 2012, the results indicate that <b>the</b> combined value <b>relevance</b> of book value of equity and earnings has increased following mandatory IFRS adoption in 2005, thereby supporting the view that IFRS adoption improves the quality of accounting information. In addition, the findings suggest that <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of book value of equity increases while that of earnings decreases as the financial crisis evolves. Moreover, during the crisis period <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of equity book value appears greater for firms operating in countries with weak institutional environment as well as for firms with weak corporate governance mechanisms. The results are consistent for the whole sample of financial firms and a sub-sample of banks. The second empirical part of this thesis evaluates <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7 that requires firms to classify fair value measurements into three levels based on the valuation inputs. Using a sample of listed financial firms in the EEA and Switzerland over 2009 - 2012, the results show that <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of level 1 and level 2 fair values is greater than <b>the</b> value <b>relevance</b> of fair values at level 3, although the difference is significant only for level 1.
