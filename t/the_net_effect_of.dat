5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E

As integrators of local catchment and regional processes, freshwater ecosystems are also ranked highly sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> multiple stressors, yet {{there has not been}} a large-scale quantitative synthesis. We analysed data from 88 papers including 286 responses of freshwater ecosystems to paired stressors and discovered that overall, their cumulative mean effect size was less than the sum <b>of</b> their single <b>effects</b> (i. e. an antagonistic interaction). <b>Net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> dual stressors on diversity and functional performance response metrics were additive and antagonistic, respectively. Across individual studies, a simple vote-counting method revealed that <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> stressor pairs were frequently more antagonistic (41 %) than synergistic (28 %), additive (16 %) or reversed (15 %). Here, we define a reversal as occurring when <b>the</b> <b>net</b> impact of two stressors is in the opposite direction (negative or positive) from that of the sum <b>of</b> their single <b>effects.</b> While warming paired with nutrification resulted in additive <b>net</b> <b>effects,</b> <b>the</b> overall mean <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> warming combined with a second stressor was antagonistic.

40|$|This {{research}} considers <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{tax system}} complexity in Australia, {{at the federal}} government level. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> tax system complexity have been defined as both the short- and long-term <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> tax operating costs on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Since annual estimates of tax compliance costs from empirical studies are not available, an alternative method to estimate tax compliance costs must first be provided. A state space and Kalman filter model was employed to estimate a series of annual percentage changes in tax system complexity. A series of annual tax compliance costs can then be generated based on tax compliance survey results for 1995 (Evans et al. 1997) and the assumption that tax system complexity fundamentally explains why tax compliance costs change over time. A vector error-correction model (VECM) was constructed to analyse <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> tax system complexity given that VECM can estimate short- and long-term relationships simultaneously. A series of tax compliance costs for the period between financial years 1965  66 and 2011  12, was generated. The simulated data show that tax system complexity is highly persistent. Tax operating costs {{were found to have}} a negative effect on the gross domestic product (GDP) in the long run. It was estimated that a 1 % increase in real tax operating costs can lead to a 0. 122 % decrease in real GDP in the long run. The short-term relationships tax operating costs and the GDP were simulated based on the VECM. An initial decline in the GDP in response to an increased tax operating costs was evident and was followed by a steady recovery. Approximately seven years after the initial shock, the increase in tax operating costs can contribute to the GDP growth, but this positive relationship slowly dissolved over time. Finally, it was found that tax revenue had a slow diminishing tendency, which suggests that existing tax laws eventually become ineffective in raising revenue...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposition}} that widespread gun ownership {{serves as a}} deterrent to residential burglary is widely touted by advocates, but the evidence is weak, consisting of anecdotes, interviews with burglars, casual comparisons with other countries, and the like. A more systematic exploration requires data on local rates of gun ownership and of residential burglary, and such data have only recently become available. In this paper we exploit a new well-validated proxy for local gun-ownership prevalence [...] the proportion of suicides that involve firearms [...] together with newly available geo-coded data from the National Crime Victimization Survey, to produce the first systematic estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> gun prevalence on residential burglary patterns. The importance of such empirical work stems in part from the fact that theoretical considerations do not provide much guidance in predicting <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> widespread gun ownership. Guns in the home may pose a threat to burglars, but also serve as an inducement, since guns are particularly valuable loot. Other things equal, a gun-rich community provides more lucrative burglary opportunities than one where guns are more sparse. The new empirical results reported here provide no support for a <b>net</b> deterrent <b>effect</b> from widespread gun ownership. Rather, our analysis concludes that residential burglary rates tend to increase with community gun prevalence. ...|$|R

Here, we combined wetland surveys with a mesocosm experiment to examine the individual and combined <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> nonnative fish predators and nonnative bullfrogs on aquatic communities. Among 139 wetlands, nonnative fish (bass, sunfish, and mosquitofish) negatively influenced the probability of occupancy of Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), but neither invader correlated strongly with occupancy by California newts (Taricha torosa), western toads (Anaxyrus boreas), or California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii). In mesocosms, mosquitofish dramatically reduced the abundance of zooplankton and palatable amphibian larvae (P. regilla and T. torosa), leading to increases in nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton (through loss of zooplankton), and rapid growth of unpalatable toad larvae (through competitive release). Bullfrog larvae reduced the growth of native anurans but had no effect on survival. Despite strong effects on natives, invaders did not negatively influence one another, and their combined effects were additive.
