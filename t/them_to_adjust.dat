25|$|Irish Wolfhounds are {{the tallest}} of all dog breeds, {{sometimes}} reaching 7 feet tall on their hind legs. They are {{well suited to}} rural life, but their medium energy profile allows <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> fairly well to suburban and urban life as well, provided they receive appropriate exercise.|$|E
25|$|An {{observation}} of the Datta study is that the learning group spent 180% more time in SWS than did the control group during the post-trial sleep-recording session. This study shows that after spatial exploration activity, patterns of hippocampal place cells are reactivated during SWS following the experiment. Rats were run through a linear track using rewards on either end. The rats would then {{be placed in the}} track for 30 minutes to allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> (PRE), then they ran the track with reward-based training for 30 minutes (RUN), and then they were allowed to rest for 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{operational}} design changes were also {{applied to the}} existing CANDU 6 to produce the Enhanced CANDU 6. Also known as CANDU 6e or EC 6, this was an evolutionary upgrade of the CANDU 6 design with a gross output of 740 MWe per unit. The reactors are designed with a lifetime of over fifty years, with a mid-life program to replace {{some of the key}} components e.g. the fuel channels. The projected average annual capacity factor is more than ninety percent. Improvements to construction techniques (including modular, open-top assembly) decrease construction costs. The CANDU 6e is designed to operate at power settings as low as 50%, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> to load demand much better than the previous designs.|$|E

50|$|A multi-disciplinary team, {{including}} doctors (often {{a physician}} is involved, but more likely a clinical neuropsychologist will head the treatment team), physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, dietician, and social worker, {{work together in}} treating aphasia. For the most part, treatment relies heavily on repetition and aims to address language performance by working on task-specific skills. The primary {{goal is to help}} the individual and those closest <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> changes and limitations in communication.|$|R
25|$|While a bowler, {{with the}} use of {{variations}} in his/her delivery aims to target the concentration of batsmen as well as their skill and technique of batting, anticipation of the delivery is crucial for the batsman, as emphasised by Jodi Richardson. Richardson reveals the world class batsman's dilemma while facing fast bowlers, stating that the time between the batsmen's anticipation of the trajectory of the ball and positioning themselves for the appropriate shot can be twice as long as the interval between the ball leaving the bowler's hand and reaching the batsman's crease. Side by side, Richardson alludes to the research undertaken by Dr. Sean Müller in Australia which was partly funded by Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence. The results of the research demonstrated the importance of anticipation of the delivery for batsmen in cricket. They revealed that experienced batsmen possessed a unique ability which enabled <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> their feet as well as their positioning on the crease accordingly based upon their reading of the body language and movements enacted by the bowler prior to the release of the ball. This foresight that batsmen use while on the crease is referred to as 'advance information' by Richardson. Moreover, Müller's research outlined that the presence of this 'advance information' was not as evident among the lesser skilled batsmen in comparison to the experienced ones.|$|E
500|$|Long term {{treatment}} of acute porphyrias {{is centered on}} the avoidance of acute attacks by eliminating precipitating factors, such as drugs, dietary changes, and infections. [...] Females often have attacks coincident with their menstrual cycle, which can be managed effectively with hormonal birth control. [...] Because of the reduced penetrance of HCP, family members of a patient may carry the same mutation without ever presenting with symptoms. [...] Molecular analysis of CPOX {{is the best way}} to identify these patients, as they will not express a biochemical phenotype on laboratory testing unless they are symptomatic. [...] Identification of asymptomatic patients allows <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> their lifestyle to avoid common triggering factors.|$|E
500|$|The {{surprise}} {{appearance of}} the Flood during Halo: Combat Evolved {{was seen as an}} important plot twist and a scary moment even after repeat playing of the game. Gamasutra, writing about video game plots, gives the example of the Flood not only as an important reversal to the story of Halo, but a textbook example of how games and their stories are made more interesting by twists in the plot. Mark Binelli of Rolling Stone credited the {{appearance of the}} Flood as an excellent way to keep players on their toes by forcing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> their strategies, as well as being a twist as radical [...] "as if, several levels into a game of Pac-Man, the dots suddenly began to attack you".|$|E

2500|$|Some socialists such as H. D. Dickinson and Oskar Lange, {{responded by}} invoking general {{equilibrium}} theory, which they argued disproved Mises's thesis. [...] They {{noted that the}} difference between a planned and a free market system lay in who was responsible for solving the equations. [...] They argued, if some of the prices chosen by socialist managers were wrong, gluts or shortages would appear, signalling <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> the prices up or down, just as in a free market. Through such a trial and error, a socialist economy could mimic the efficiency of a free market system, while avoiding its many problems.|$|E

The group began to phase out the modern tools and began only using ancient tools and techniques.|$|R
2500|$|Economists also {{distinguish}} the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. [...] In this context, {{two things are}} assumed constant by definition of the short run: the availability {{of one or more}} fixed inputs (typically physical capital), and the number of firms in the industry. [...] In the long run, firms have a chance <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> their holdings of physical capital, enabling <b>them</b> <b>to</b> better <b>adjust</b> their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long run potential competitors can enter or exit the industry in response to market conditions. [...] For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.|$|R
