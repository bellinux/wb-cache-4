500|$|McCarthy {{argued that}} the rules already {{prohibited}} strikes {{to the back of}} the head and questioned if it was just the 12-6 elbow strike <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Following this discussion, Nick Lembo wrote the Unified Rules, including a rule prohibiting downward elbow strikes. McCarthy felt that Lembo wrote the rule relating to downward elbow strikes [...] "poorly" [...] as he felt the definition was broad and left the rule open to interpretation. Pride eventually did not adopt the Unified Rules; however, their ruleset prohibited any elbow strikes to the head. Eventually the rule on 12-6 elbows meant that very few fighters attempted them, which could also be attributed to the fact that it is difficult for fighters to get into a position where they could use them.|$|E
500|$|We had a {{marvelous}} antagonist, so omnipotent {{that for us}} to defeat it or even communicate with it, or {{have any kind of}} relationship with it, made the initial concept of the story false.

As the story developed, everything worked until the very end. How do you resolve this thing? If humans can defeat this marvelous machine, [...] it's really not so great, is it? Or if it really is great, will we like those humans who do defeat it? Should they defeat it?

But the great truism of the MESON remains for all thinking men, and these people have not upset any balance except their own.

Ragnall, who had come up from his lines, agreed with me. As he said, these people were fighting for life as well as honour, seeing that most of the corn which they needed for their sustenance was stored in great heaps either in or {{to the rear of the}} temple behind us. Therefore they must come on until they won or were destroyed.

60|$|My reason wavered, {{but it did}} {{not fail}} me utterly.

My drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet; how was I to reach them? <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> that (crushing my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I had closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would consign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and thought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into his presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague, Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from end to end.|$|E
