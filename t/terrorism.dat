5|$|After the {{terrorist}} attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of <b>Terrorism</b> Act. The aim of the act was to improve the government's {{ability to deal with}} <b>terrorism.</b> It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a joint session of the Parliament, where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass. The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of <b>terrorism.</b> However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it had been used to target Muslims. It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the film}} was not a major success, former Research Fellow at Australia's National Film & Sound Archive Robert Cettl, in his 2009 book <b>Terrorism</b> in American cinema: an {{analytical}} filmography, 1960–2008 argues that the film reveals an alarmingly realist insight into US-Middle Eastern politics and <b>terrorism</b> since the 2000s, dealing with an al-Qaeda-esque terrorist organization and the conspiracy theories that some believe the US government is using the Middle East as a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the attacks, many governments across the world passed {{legislation}} to combat <b>terrorism.</b> In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted. The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany. The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement. Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, that nation's first anti-terrorism law. The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of <b>Terrorism</b> Act 2005. New Zealand enacted the <b>Terrorism</b> Suppression Act 2002.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the Congress, the BJP takes a more {{aggressive}} and nationalistic position on defence policy and <b>terrorism.</b> The Vajpayee-led NDA government carried out nuclear weapons tests, and enacted the Prevention of <b>Terrorism</b> Act, which later came under heavy criticism. It also deployed troops to evict infiltrators from Kargil, and supported the United States' War on Terror.|$|E

5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of <b>terrorism,</b> to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such <b>terrorism</b> begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
