40|$|AbstractThe SIS 100 {{synchrotron}} is {{the core}} accelerator of the FAIR project (Darmstadt, Germany).

40|$|How might one—in {{creating}} a built environment—educate others about the natural environment, restore commerce to a dying community, {{and touch the}} earth as lightly {{as possible in the}} process? The intent of this project is to create an interpretive center for a proposed regional tourism network in a rural Nebraska County. The design will be based on issues of sustainability, including resource conservation, socio-economic improvement, and environmental protection. Specific issues addressed include: Green Buildings, Biomimicry, Mechanical Systems, Construction Methods, Biology and Geology Research and Education, Regional Planning, and Vernacular Buildings. This project, explores how architecture {{can be used in a}} rural setting as a way to solve problems of declining economic and environmental conditions in rural areas. Sustainable architecture, as exemplified in the style of Australian architect Glenn Murcutt, is a potential solution to these problems. Such an attraction would bring tourist dollars to revitalize the area economy, educate locals and visitors about the need to preserve this area’s natural resources, and provide an example of practical, environmentally-responsive design for others to emulate. A foundation in Nebraska’s Sandhills region wishes to build an interpretive center on a large rural site near a small Sandhills community that would benefit from the jobs and activity created by such an attraction. The center will include educational facilities to be jointly used by the foundation, the University of Nebraska’s Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and local community groups. The foundation has requested that the facility include programs that educate visitors about the unique geography of the Sandhills, promote tourism throughout the region, and provide assembly space for group meetings, field trips and educational workshops. The buildings shall be energy-efficient, low-maintenance, and environmentally benign. <b>The</b> <b>facility</b> <b>shall</b> be designed to be built in phases as funding becomes available. The center will serve as the hub for a proposed Sandhills tourism network. In time, there will be three locations with interpretive and educational functions, each in a different general location of the region, to be located along the three major transportation corridors: Highways 2, 20, and 83; and on sites exemplary of three of the Sandhills’ distinct ecological regions: the western high aquifer, the Niobrara valley, and the Loup River system. The facilities will exist to promote other regional attractions rather than to compete with them. The building’s location, just south of the intersection of highways 2 and 83, near the small community of Thedford, NE, includes an abandoned sand quarry, a portion of the Middle Loup River, and tall, majestic sand hills as far as the eye can see.

Sorting water is water from sorting areas where the waste is sorted by character. For landfill operation, leachate and sorting water are the biggest influencing factors on the surrounding environment. Sofielunds recycling plant is owned by SRV and is located at Gladö kvarn in Huddinge. The facility {{is one of the}} largest in the country with an annual reception of over 200 000 tonnes of industrial and domestic waste. The purification of leachate and sorting water from the landfill is done in the local treatment plant operated by the Stockholm water before sending it on to Henriksdals reningsverk in Stockholm. The treatment consists of screening, biological treatment, sedimentation, and filtration through sand filters. For Henriksdal to be able to REVAQ certify their sludge, concentrations of certain parameters ought to be met. In the thesis the purification procedure have been reviewed and optimized based on the water's character. The requirement for purification of leachate and sorting water is slightly different and to reduce the load on the biological treatment stage, the sorting water is instead undergoing chemical treatment. The task was to investigate how the chemical precipitate at <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> <b>shall</b> be conducted with the mechanical equipment available and provide recommendation for improvement. Water contamination level was assessed by laborative results within the control programme and of the probation conditions of pollutants. The optimization of the chemical treatment was tested in the lab with various precipitation chemicals and then applied at the facility. The goal was to reduce the particle content of the water and reduce the heavy metals cadmium, chromium, mercury, lead, copper and zinc in the sorting water. The results of the lab stood as the basis for the testing of full-scale where the chemicals were applied in a real scenario and optimized on the basis of the outcome. The sorting water contained high levels of heavy metals and organic material before purification and good reduction was observed after treatment. Two chemicals that have shown the best results in lab tests, PAX-XL 60 and PIX- 111, were tested at the treatment plant. The experiments performed in the lab showed that PAX-XL 60, a liquid polymerized aluminum chloride, gave the best results in the separation of particles and pollutants. When applied at the treatment plant, PIX- 111, which is a liquid ferric chloride, was found to provide the most desirable results with efficiency, price and handling in mind. It was found that a dose of about 20 mg of active substance per liter sorting water was adequate to achieve good reduction. To reduce the chemical consumption and costs, the dosing procedure ought to be reviewed to find a more precise dosing, which may also be beneficial from an environmental standpoint. ...|$|E

For an individual APS radiation worker, {{the goal is to}} keep the maximum occupational total effective dose equivalent of any one employee as far below 200 mrem/yr as reasonably achievable. The ALARA goal for APS beamline scientists is to keep the total of the work-related radiation exposure (exposure coming from other than natural or medical sources) as far below 100 person-mrem per year, collective total effective dose equivalent, as reasonably achievable. For an individual APS beamline scientist, the goal is to keep the maximum occupational total effective dose equivalent of any one scientist as far below 50 mrem/yr as reasonably achievable. The dose is actively monitored by the radiation monitors on the storage ring wall in each sector and by the frequent area surveys performed by the health physics personnel.
