40|$|One of {{the biggest}} threats to coffee growers in East Africa are {{emerging}} vascular wilt diseases (<b>tracheomycosis)</b> caused by Fusarium spp. Many Trichoderma species {{are known to be}} natural antagonists of these pathogens and are widely used in biological control of fungal plant diseases. More recently, several Trichoderma spp., which exhibited high antifungal activity have been isolated as endophytes. Consequently, we have investigated the presence and the antagonistic activity of endophytic Trichoderma isolated from roots of healthy coffee plants (Coffea arabica) from the major coffee growing regions of Ethiopia. Our results showed that community of Trichoderma spp. in roots of C. arabica contains fungi from coffee rhizosphere, as well as putatively obligate endophytic fungi. The putatively “true” endophytic species, until now, isolated only from coffee plant ecosystems in Ethiopia and recently described as T. flagellatum and novel T. sp. C. P. K. 1812 were able to antagonize Fusarium spp., which cause coffee <b>tracheomycosis.</b> Moreover, we found that strains of these species are also highly antagonistic against other phytopathogenic fungi, such as Alternaria alternata, Botryotinia fuckeliana (anamorph: Botrytis cinerea), and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum...|$|E
40|$|The southwestern {{highlands}} {{forests of}} Ethiopia are {{the origin of}} the coffee plant Coffea arabica. The production of coffee in this area is affected by <b>tracheomycosis</b> caused by a soil-born fungus Gibberella xylarioides. The use of endemic antagonistic strains of mycoparasitic Trichoderma species would be a nature conserving means to combat this disease. We have used molecular methods to reveal that the community of Trichoderma in the rhizosphere of C. arabica in its native forests is highly diverse and includes many putatively endemic species. Among others, the putative new species were particularly efficient to inhibit growth of G. xylarioides...|$|E

A proposal is made to restrict the term ‘esca’ to grapevine wood rot, as in the past, and to apply the name ‘Grapevine leaf stripe disease’ for the <b>tracheomycosis</b> which is the conspicuous and familiar visible tiger stripe symptoms on grapevine leaves. Retention of the term ‘esca proper’, to designate the co-occurrence of esca and Grapevine leaf stripe diseas, will retain linkage with the early terminology and with the convention of associating tiger striped leaves with wood rot...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora (Pch) {{is one of}} {{the main}} causal agents of <b>tracheomycosis</b> in grapevine. We {{characterize}} how this fungus affects the response of Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon to bark and xylem-tissue wounding after six weeks post-treatment. A histological investigation shows that, in xylem tissue, cell-wall modifications in response to wounding are related to suberin deposits rather than to lignin-induced wall thickening. The xylem response does not appear to be disturbed by Pch infection. Therefore, cell-wall modification strongly inhibits the development of wound-closure tissue (WCT) but does not prevent the differentiation of the necro-phylactic periderm. Hyphae localization in tissue surrounding the wound or inoculation sites indicates that Pch colonizes all cell types, such as vascular tissues, paratracheal parenchyma cells, fibers and rays. The results also suggest that efficient compartmentalization separating fascicular xylem portions is assured by thick suberized cell walls bordering the ray parenchyma...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tracheomycosis</b> (or Coffee Wilt Disease) is a {{vascular}} {{disease that}} causes damage in plantations up to 80 % of {{production in the}} absence of treatment. The fungus of the disease is Fusarium xylarioides. An experiment in micro-plots was put in place to look for 9 strains of this species from different production regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo (Equateur, Nord Kivu and Province Orientale) in terms of their pathogenicity on coffee Robusta (clone L 251). The results from this experiment highlight several levels of pathogenicity significantly different (P ≤ 0. 05), and particularly high for aggressive strain Mindembo. The differences {{do not seem to be}} related to geographic origins. Mindembo strain, from Equateur, was more aggressive and induces a high mortality (50 %). Strains Bunduki and MUCL 45580, originating in Equateur and the Province Orientale, showed high pathogenicity although lower than Mindembo. However, the strain Zobolia (Equateur) multiplies much more slowly and has caused no mortality 3 months after inoculation. This work has important implications for studies on varietal resistance...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium oxysporum {{includes}} nonpathogenic strains and pathogenic strains {{that can}} induce necrosis or <b>tracheomycosis</b> in plants. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare the abilities of a pathogenic strain (Foln 3) and a nonpathogenic strain (Fo 47) to colonize flax roots and to induce early physiological responses in flax cell culture suspensions. Both strains colonized the outer cortex of the root; however, plant defense reactions, i. e., the presence of wall appositions, osmiophilic material, and collapsed cells, were less frequent and less intense in a root colonized by Foln 3 than by Fo 47. Early physiological responses were measured in flax cell suspensions confronted with germinated microconidia of both strains. Both pathogenic (Foln 3) and nonpathogenic strains (Fo 47) triggered transient H 2 O 2 production in the first few minutes of the interaction, but the nonpathogenic strain also induced a second burst 3 h postinoculation. Ca 2 + influx was more intense in cells inoculated with Fo 47 than in cells inoculated with Foln 3. Similarly, alkalinization of the extracellular medium was higher with Fo 47 than with Foln 3. Inoculation of the fungi into flax cell suspensions induced cell death 10 to 20 h postinoculation, with a higher percentage of dead cells observed with Fo 47 than with Foln 3 beginning at 14 h. This is the first report showing that early physiological responses of flax cells can be used to distinguish pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of the soil-borne fungus F. oxysporum...|$|E
40|$|Gibberella xylarioides Heim & Saccas (presumed anamorph, Fusarium xylarioides Steyaert) is {{the causal}} agent of coffee wilt disease, an {{economically}} important <b>tracheomycosis</b> in Africa. In vitro crosses {{carried out with}} Congolese, Ugandan, and Tanzanian single-ascospore/conidial isolates originating from diseased Coffea canephora/excelsa demonstrated a heterothallic mating system, controlled by a single locus with two alleles, MAT- 1 and MAT- 2. Compatible isolates produced fertile perithecia within 2 to 8 weeks after mating. Mating type (MAT) was characterized by PCR with primer pairs previously developed for the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (GFC) and for Fusarium oxysporum. All strains analyzed were morphologically identical and corresponded to Booth's description of the "female" F. xylarioides strain. Based on crossing results and MAT- 2 /translation elongation 1 -alpha (tef) sequence data, G. xylarioides, as currently understood, is demonstrated to encompass at least three "groups": G. xylarioides sensu strictu Ia, defined hitherto by two "historical" West African strains originating from the severe 1930 s to 1950 s epidemic (CBS 25852 and CBS 74979); G. xylarioides sensu strictu Ib, defined by two "historical" Central African lowland strains (DSMZ 62457 and ATCC 15664); and G. xylarioides sensu lato II, containing Congolese, Ugandan, and Tanzanian C. canephora/excelsa isolates. Infertility of crosses between the coffee wilt pathogen and known GFC mating populations demonstrates that G. xylarioides sensu lato constitutes a new biological species within the G. fujikuroi complex. MUCL 44532 /MUCL 43887 and MUCL 35223 /MUCL 44549 are proposed as G. xylarioides sensu lato II MAT- 1 /MAT- 2 reference mating type tester strains...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tracheomycosis</b> or {{vascular}} wilt disease (Fusarium xylarioides) of toffee bas re-emerged {{as one of}} the most significant threats to the coffee industry in Central Africa. The fungus initially causes a characteristic spiral yellowing of the leaves which later becomes general and eventually causes the tree to die. Diseased trees have to be burnt and the soil disinfected The International Coffee Organisation (ICO) requested that the International Mycological Institute (IMI) prepare an independent report on the nature and extent of the disease in Zaire. It was agreed that the lack of basic knowledge of this disease required urgent attention and that the ICO, together with the IMI, should submit a project for consideration by the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC). A similar survey was subsequently undertaken in Uganda in order to gain further information for the project application to the CFC. A question that the project will be endeavouring to answer is why this disease has re-emerged after 40 years. One possibility is that the pathogen bas mutated to a more aggressive form. Changes in the environment or a combination of factors could also account for its re-emergence.
