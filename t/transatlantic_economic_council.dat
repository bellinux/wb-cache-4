Depending on the political agenda, {{the focus of attention}} in the relationship between the United States (US) and Europe shifts between policy fields. Since the 9 / 11 attacks on the Twin Towers in New York, differences between the responses of the US and the European Union (EU) 2 to the new global security situation and the related ‘Global War on Terrorism’ have been most prominent and have diverted attention from other policy fields. Therefore widely unnoticed, <b>transatlantic</b> <b>economic</b> cooperation – a process that started in the early 1990 s – has evolved resulting in the signing of a new agreement – the ‘Framework for Advancing <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Economic</b> Integration’ (FATEI) – in April 2007...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{analysis}} of the shifting {{role of the state}} in the context of globalization processes and aims to explain acting of the state in a bilateral cooperation, as an actor who faces these challenges. This framework is afterwards examined on the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>economic</b> cooperation. Main argument is, that in the bilateral cooperation, such shifts can be observed, that are intertwined with greater interactions of components of the states. These transgovernmental networks can be considered inevitable in response to the rising significance of non-tariff barriers and in trade liberalization. In case of the EU-US partnership, the cooperation on this level is focused on harmonizing of regulatory measures what is crucial for further integration of the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>economic</b> relations...|$|R
40|$|Initiatives {{to reduce}} transatlantic trade {{barriers}} or to harmonize trade-related domestic {{policies in the}} EU and the US appear regularly {{on the agenda of}} policy makers. The last decade saw also considerable steps in <b>transatlantic</b> <b>economic</b> cooperation focusing on special aspects. In February 2002, a new call for a study on the benefits of a transatlantic free trade area (TAFTA) was made by the President of the EU Council to facilitate further liberalization schemes. This article examines recent developments in <b>transatlantic</b> <b>economic</b> policies, discusses changes in approaches in transatlantic regionalism and presents estimates of the <b>economic</b> consequences of <b>transatlantic</b> liberalization. Given the expected small benefits of a TAFTA and the induced costs for multilateral liberalization negotiations, the article discusses alternatives to TAFTA and argues for a multilateral approach, eventually being accompanied by some sort of open regionalism.

And this frustrates companies {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. The <b>Transatlantic</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Council</b> is the forum where we try to resolve these differences, and I believe harmonizing regulatory schemes between the United States and the EU is one of the best ways we can both enhance growth, enhance exports, and avoid duplicative costs. But if you spend weeks arguing about the size of a jar for baby food, that’s not exactly facing up to the potential of the payoff that comes from resolving these issues." ...|$|E
