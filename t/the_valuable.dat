5|$|Individuals of the Asian {{species have}} been often trained as working animals. In the forests of Myanmar, for example, {{elephants}} have {{played a critical role}} in sustainable logging. Under the guidance of their handlers, elephants are used to manipulate and drag heavy teak logs from road-less areas to rivers and roads. From there, <b>the</b> <b>valuable</b> logs are shipped to commercial mills.|$|E

Historians estimate that the peasant families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although {{the value of an}} average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable to pay this amount, especially because they also had to pay the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.|$|E
5|$|Armored and {{mechanized}} divisions normally {{made use}} of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these were generally a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion, or vice versa. Given {{the size of the}} forces deployed across the border, it is thought that the Iraqi Army planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Khafji, in order to seize <b>the</b> <b>valuable</b> oil fields at Dammam.|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1860, Frewin Hall {{housed the}} future Edward VII whilst he {{attended}} Christ Church. The chapel and old kitchen were planned to {{form part of}} a new, third, quadrangle for Brasenose. <b>The</b> <b>valuable</b> rents that the shops {{on the south side}} of Brasenose earned the college provided the most significant reason for the delay in further expansion, which only began in 1886 when work on the west side was started. It was finally completed in 1911, the last work having been done to the High Street frontage. Frewin Hall was reconstructed between 1887 and 1896, as were the chapel and antechapel. It had been in 1886 that Cradock had died and was replaced by Albert Watson.|$|E

He also obtained three female slaves from al-Radi's palace, whose singing he remembered from his earlier {{visits to the}} Caliph.|$|E

5|$|In the post-apocalyptic environment, {{ammunition}} is a {{rare and}} essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse, military-grade ammunition is used as currency. Players can avoid consuming all <b>the</b> <b>valuable</b> currency by using lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and other items. The military-grade ammunition {{can be used to}} purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations. Weapon attachments, such as scopes and silencers, which improve weapon efficiency, can be purchased with these bullets.|$|E

Nedry stores the embryos inside a canister disguised as Barbasol shaving cream, supplied by Dodgson. Because of Nedry, the power goes out and the tour vehicles become stuck. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated as well, allowing the Tyrannosaurus to escape and attack the tour group. Grant, Lex, and Tim escape, while the Tyrannosaurus injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. On his way to deliver the embryos to the island's docks, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his Jeep Wrangler, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus.|$|E

Some offers of marriage started to arrive from German princes, but she chose to return to Normandy. She {{does not appear to have}} expected to return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns, and <b>the</b> <b>valuable</b> relic of the Hand of St James the Apostle.|$|E

One insect, the honey bee, provides honey, pollen, royal jelly, propolis and an anti-inflammatory peptide, melittin; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include maggot therapy for wound debridement. Over a thousand protein families {{have been identified in}} the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, vasodilators, antihistamines and anaesthetics.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Ali's {{successor}} was Hamad bin Thuwaini, {{who became}} sultan in 1893.
