40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of UV irradiation, treat temperature of nano-titanium dioxide and intensity of UV irradiation on <b>the</b> mercury <b>removal</b> performance, experiments were carried out on a photocatalytic oxidization system {{to find the best}} experimental conditions. Commercial Degussa P 25 was used as a photocatalyst loading on titanium mesh, and <b>the</b> mercury <b>removal</b> efficiency was stable at 8 % in the absence of UV irradiation. Under the UV irradiation of 300 W mercury lamp, <b>the</b> mercury <b>removal</b> efficiency surged to 100 %. With the same light intensity, <b>the</b> same <b>removal</b> time, <b>the</b> mercury <b>removal</b> efficiency of nano-titanium dioxide calcinated at 100 ℃ reached 92. 2 % after 0. 5 h while <b>the</b> mercury <b>removal</b> efficiency of nano-titanium dioxide calcinated at 500 ℃ reached 93. 6 %.

30|$|In the batch experiments, the {{presence}} of waste iron shavings improved <b>the</b> TN <b>removal</b> efficiency by 3 % (<b>the</b> TN <b>removal</b> efficiencies increased from 14 to 17 %) in the batch experiments (Fig.  6 b), while <b>the</b> TN <b>removal</b> efficiency was improved by 8 % (<b>the</b> TN <b>removal</b> efficiencies increased from 12 to 20 %) {{with the addition of}} waste iron shavings in the continuous experiments (Fig.  3). The reason might be that the microorganisms utilizing waste iron shavings were mostly attached in the surface of waste iron shavings, while the sludge used for the batch experiment was obtained from the liquid phase. The observation of biofilm formation during iron corrosion was also reported before (Lee and Characklis 1993). As previously mentioned, <b>the</b> TN <b>removal</b> by heterotrophic denitrification should be lower than 12 % (the value in AnSBR-C) in AnSBR-Fe since the effluent COD of AnSBR-Fe was higher than that of AnSBR-C. Since <b>the</b> TN <b>removal</b> by waste iron shavings via chemical reaction could be negligible (Fig.  6 c), <b>the</b> TN <b>removal</b> efficiency by autotrophic denitrification should be higher than 8 % in AnSBR-Fe considering <b>the</b> total TN <b>removal</b> efficiency of 20 %.|$|R

5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Allison, FEMA opened six {{disaster}} recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. After the extensive damage to Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a temporary hospital at the Houston Police Academy. The team of 87medical personnel served over 1,000patients within two weeks of Allison's passage. Similarly, the National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people. Debris removal, which was initially slow, was aided by FEMA to expedite <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> process. FEMA provided 75% of the federal cost of <b>the</b> <b>removal.</b> Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses.|$|E

5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified.

After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>removals</b> {{were driven}} by the {{assertion}} that the monuments glorify and perpetuate white supremacy.

The monuments have thus become highly politicised; according to Eleanor Harvey, a senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and a scholar of Civil War history: “If white nationalists and neo-Nazis are now claiming this as part of their heritage, they have essentially co-opted those images and those statues beyond any capacity to neutralize them again”.|$|R
