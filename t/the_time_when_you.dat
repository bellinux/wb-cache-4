2500|$|Consulting {{producer}} for A Nero Wolfe Mystery, Doyle was the show's only full-time writer — overseeing {{the work of}} freelance screenwriters and writing 11 of the teleplays herself. She devoted most of {{her attention to the}} dialogue: [...] "What Stout writes actually sounds good when you say it out loud, but the stuff that makes you laugh out loud and fall {{on the floor in the}} books doesn't work most of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> transpose it directly into actors' mouths. Frequently I end up moving words — tenderly and respectfully — but retaining as much of the language as possible. I feel a great belief in Rex Stout. I see the script process as writing his second draft." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{publication}} of Home of the Gentry, Goncharov took {{an opportunity to get}} acquainted with the original text at recitals held by Turgenev for a circle of friends. He pointed to its author that many ideas, fragments of a plotline and situations looked very much like they've been copied from The Precipice, the novel which was yet unpublished but very familiar to Turgenev in every detail. On March 27, 1860, Goncharov reminded Turgenev in a letter: [...] "Remember, there was <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> agreed that the general plan of your novel and characters' interactions had been similar you even excluded one scene, too obviously similar to mine, which made me feel totally satisfied." [...] In another letter, dated March 28, Goncharov specified the scene similar to that which involved Vera and grandmother (in The Precipice), which, being [...] "a weak one", had been [...] "magnanimously sacrificed" [...] by Turgenev. The scene mentioned was absent from the final version of Home of the Gentry, but references to it have been found in rough copies of the novel; this [...] corroborated Goncharov's claim that Turgenev indeed had been making some cuts so as to make parallels less obvious. According to N. Budanova, [...] "it is important to bear in mind that parallels between the two novels were for all to see and Turgenev at one point conceded as much, blaming his 'over-impressionability' for this." ...|$|E
