5|$|Consequently, {{the rise}} of slavery was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> rise of crops being {{produced}} and traded, more specifically {{the rise of}} the plantation economy The rise of the plantations was the main reason for the trade of commodities during proto-globalization. Plantations were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy. Commodities that grew in trade due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and rubber.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> {{trend of}} {{decreased}} fertility rate, {{there has been}} an increased nuclearization of the family, where families have less immediate relatives to depend on in times of need. Because of this phenomenon, families do not have an extended family to depend on when they need a caretaker or someone to do domestic work, and must turn to market substitutes or a member of the immediate family doing both domestic and paid work instead.|$|E

5|$|Ecgric's successor, Anna, {{acted as}} a {{challenge}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> power of Penda throughout his reign. In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda's sister, Penda drove him from his kingdom and into exile. Anna {{was strong enough to}} offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years of the Stadtbahn, many trains {{previously}} terminating at the old terminuses Lehrter Bahnhof, Görlitzer Bahnhof or Potsdamer Bahnhof operated via the Stadtbahn to reduce the load on the terminus stations. By the end of the 19th century, however, most of these train runs had to terminate at their old destination stations again due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> local traffic on the Stadtbahn.|$|E
5|$|Strategic management: Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> {{importance}} of design as a differentiator and its supporting role in brand equity, design management deals with strategic design issues and supports the strategic {{direction of the}} business or enterprise. The debate on design thinking suggests the integration of design thinking into strategic management. Design thinking and strategic thinking have some commonalities in their characteristics, both are synthetic, adductive, hypothesis-driven, opportunistic, dialectical, enquiring and value-driven.|$|E

5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} iodine {{are the highest}} among the halogens, {{conforming}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> trend down the group, since iodine has the largest electron cloud among them {{that is the most}} easily polarised, resulting in its molecules having the strongest van der Waals interactions among the halogens. Similarly, iodine is the least volatile of the halogens. Because it has the largest atomic radius among the halogens, iodine has the lowest first ionisation energy, lowest electron affinity, lowest electronegativity and lowest reactivity of the halogens.|$|E

5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> numbers of {{destitute}} poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E

5|$|Although HTC has {{developed}} several notable Android devices, {{such as the}} Dream—the first publicly released Android device, it failed {{to capitalize on the}} first-mover advantage, and has struggled financially in recent years due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> market share captured by other vendors such as Samsung and Apple. In some markets, HTC released numerous carrier-specific phones and relied heavily on wireless providers to promote its products, a strategy that was unsuccessful in the face of Samsung and Apple’s strong marketing efforts. The company’s flagship phone in 2012, the One X, received critical acclaim from reviewers, but was commercially unsuccessful {{in the wake of the}} Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5. In response, the company planned to take bigger risks with their next flagship device to make it stand out among its competitors, and also planned to take a more direct role in promoting its products—doubling its marketing budget for 2013.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film , every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Ace's output was {{approaching}} one hundred titles a year, still heavily {{dominated by the}} primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced {{an increase in the}} price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's Dune, were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the ratio}} of gross fixed nonresidential {{investment}} to GNP has decreased very little since the late 1960 's, the corresponding net investment ratio declined by nearly 40 percent between {{the second half of}} the l 960 's and {{the second half of the}} 1970 's. Four—fifths of this decline was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> ratio of depreciation to GNP and only one—fifth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decreased ratio of gross investment <b>to</b> GNP. <b>The</b> <b>increased</b> ratio of depreciation to GNP was in turn due in equal amounts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher ratio of capital to GNP and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher rate of depreciation. Nearly half of the higher depreciation rate was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> rate of depreciation of equipment and nearly half <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> share of equip-ment in the capital stock...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  1 B, <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in Tween 80 {{concentration}} led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in <b>the</b> EE of EGCG nanoliposomes. This increased EE {{may be attributed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in densification of liposome surface due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> availability of lipophilic ambience, which could accommodate EGCG to a higher extent[36]. The results indicated the higher level of phosphatidylcholine-to-cholesterol ratio and EGCG and Tween 80 concentrations <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> encapsulation efficiency.|$|R
5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} {{injury to the}} spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number of}} them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries can be caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can be caused by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the 4th Army {{began to}} {{withdraw}} southwards on 9 April.
