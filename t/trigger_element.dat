40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a flux-lock type superconducting {{fault current}} limiter (SFCL) using two {{triggered}} high-Tc superconducting (HTSC) elements was proposed and its fault current limiting characteristics according to short-circuit location were analyzed. The flux-lock type SFCL with two <b>triggered</b> HTSC <b>elements</b> {{consists of two}} parts. One is two magnetically coupled coils with serial connection. The other, which is connected in series with the second coil, is composed of two HTSC elements in parallel connected through the normal resistor. Since the amplitude of the fault current depends on the fault location in case the fault occurs in a power system, the suggested flux-lock type SFCL can perform the fault current limiting operation through the quench occurrences of one HTSC element or two HTSC elements according to the amplitudes of the fault current. In case a low fault current, the fault current can be limited by utilizing only one HTSC <b>triggered</b> <b>element.</b> On the other hand, a larger fault current can be limited by two HTSC <b>triggered</b> <b>elements.</b> The short-circuit tests for the proposed flux-lock type SFCL according to the fault location were carried out in a feeder line of a power distribution system and its effective limiting operations could be discussed through the analysis on the short- circuit...|$|R

40|$|Although being {{discovered}} 80 years ago, {{there are still}} unsolved questions about cosmic radiation. In this diploma thesis, an effort to measure the multiplicity distribution of cosmic muons and their arrivaltime with the H 1 detector at DESY (Deut­ sches Elektronen Synchrotron) was initiated. For this purpose, new Level 1 and Level 2 triggers, as well a new Level 4 filter were designed. In Level 1 a new <b>trigger</b> <b>element,</b> MU_ 3 _BAR, was created to select events with at least three muon candidates. In addition, the topological Level 2 trigger selects events fulfilling some topological conditions. In Level 4 a filter, looking for events with multiple muon candidates, was installed. The total output of this triggering scheme is below 0. 1 Hz. This allows to include the triggersalso in normal ep running mode of the experiment. Since January 1999, H 1 COSMO data are taken and analyzed. Hints for time correlations between different extensive air showers (EAS), induced hy primary cosmic particles exist.

40|$|The {{architecture}} of a readout system is described {{which will be}} used in conjunction with the muon detector in the UA- 1 experiment at the pp collider at CERN. In addition to measuring drift time for spatial information, the system provides a fast trigger (< 1 mu s after drift time) and a second level trigger decision based on a fast microprocessor. The fast trigger part allows the use of the muon detector as an active <b>trigger</b> <b>element,</b> while a second level trigger decision using the detailed digitizer data is included for adequate reduction of the trigger rate. The multiple time digitizer (MTD) is based on the use of fast RAMs (256 * 4) as 125 MHz shift registers, giving time bins of 8 ns and a time range of 2 mu s (256 * 8 ns). The high input rate has imposed a fast readout and transfer to a buffer in the controller. The data in this buffer is reordered according to wire number and corresponding times. Together with look-up tables this allows fast processing of the data for a second level trigger. (9 refs) ...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance of {{skeletal}} muscle mass is contingent upon the dynamic equilibrium (fasted losses–fed gains) in protein turnover.

Our objective was to measure muscle protein anabolism in response to Leu and its metabolite HMB. Using [1, 2 - 13 C 2]Leu and [2 H 5]phenylalanine tracers, and GC-MS/GC-C-IRMS we studied the effect of HMB or Leu alone on MPS (by tracer incorporation into myofibrils), and for HMB we also measured muscle proteolysis (by arteriovenous (A–V) dilution). Orally consumed 3. 42 g free-acid (FA-HMB) HMB (providing 2. 42 g of pure HMB) exhibited rapid bioavailability in plasma and muscle and, similarly to 3. 42 g Leu, stimulated muscle protein synthesis (MPS; HMB + 70 %vs. Leu + 110 %). While HMB and Leu both increased anabolic signalling (mechanistic target of rapamycin; mTOR), this was more pronounced with Leu (i. e. p 70 S 6 K 1 signalling ≤ 90 min vs. ≤ 30 min for HMB). HMB consumption also attenuated muscle protein breakdown (MPB; − 57 %) in an insulin-independent manner. We conclude that exogenous HMB induces acute muscle anabolism (increased MPS and reduced MPB) albeit perhaps via distinct, and/or additional mechanism(s) to Leu...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a neutron-based interrogation system is presented that non-intrusively, non-destructively detects threats and contraband within vehicles. It {{has been applied to}} the detection of vehicle borne improvised explosive devices. It utilizes two D-T neutron generators coupled with uranium reflectors and eight high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray detectors. The neutron source and gamma-ray detectors are housed in moving components that sweep the entire vehicle and allow for a single location re-scan. ^ It was found that the coupling of the D-T neutron generator with a uranium reflector/amplifier produces a switchable source of 14 MeV neutrons and 1 MeV fission neutrons that optimizes the detection of gamma-ray signals produced in inelastic scattering and thermal capture reactions on nuclei in explosives. For every 14 MeV neutron entering the reflector/amplifier, more than one fission-like neutron is emitted {{in the direction of the}} vehicle. Experiments have shown that the reflector/amplifier enhances thermal signals in a sample by up to a factor of 15 in contrast to no reflector. ^ A threat algorithm is presented that automatically detects the presence and location of explosives in a vehicle. The algorithm images each <b>trigger</b> <b>element</b> detected along the length of the vehicle and then between the detector towers. It clears vehicles when the elements occur in distinct parts of the vehicle, reducing the statistical false-positive rate to improve overall system performance.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Environmental Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Sustainable {{development}} and resource efficiency are the common global {{strategies of the}} 21 st century. The actual global natural resource consumption of humankind went far over the limit and to cover this worldwide resource consumption the productivity of 1. 5 earths is now necessary. The work “Reduction of anthropogenic environmental influences by advanced and optimized technologies” discussed the problem of advanced resource efficiencies with mining activities in South Africa as an example. Related strategies to reverse anthropogenic impacts {{to such an extent}} that it resembles former natural conditions were also discussed. Heavy metal contaminated soil and water were treated with natural techniques and different natural media to reduce and eliminate contamination and to provide a market value for former unusable material. Specially developed soil ameliorants and natural filter media could increase the total quality of soil and water. Even plants could be established in these changed conditions. Applied to the natural environment an overall upgrade of mining activities could be achieved. To optimize these laboratory and field results support was generated by using evolutionary algorithms as part of the artificial intelligence. By combining applied technologies with the evolution strategy an optimization tool could be developed to simulate, optimize and forecast procedures of anthropogenic impact reversion. With this tool a transfer of solutions to other similar applications in under–developed and developing countries could be shown. The trans–disciplinary scientific approach of balancing the <b>trigger</b> <b>element</b> carbon proved that the reduction to the smallest common element carbon can be used to balance processes and to indicate pollution. As stated in the United Nations Framework, carbon balances are one of the most significant causes of environmental problems, including environmental pollution and health and are also closely related to climate change in general. With carbon balances resource efficiency and resource protection can be transferred into practice. Finally, all results were collected and verified in a decision support system with the aim to optimize the treatment steps and to make the results transparent and available for users in academia and practice. The work was exemplary in showing that the approach of environmental sciences and techniques to reverse anthropogenic interferences back to natural sustainability and evolution, optimized the equilibrium of nature.
