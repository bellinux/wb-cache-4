5|$|Calhoun {{died at the}} Old Brick Capitol {{boarding}} house in Washington, D.C., on March 31, 1850, of tuberculosis, {{at the age of}} 68. He was interred at the St. Philip's Churchyard in Charleston, South Carolina. During the Civil War, a group of Calhoun's friends were concerned about the possible desecration of his grave by Federal troops and, during the night, removed his coffin to a hiding place under <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>of</b> the church. The next night, his coffin was buried in an unmarked grave near the church, where it remained until 1871, when it was again exhumed and returned to its original place.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, on 21 October 1968, with the first scene shot being an aerial view of Bond climbing <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>of</b> Blofeld's mountain retreat. The scenes were shot atop the now-famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria, located atop the Schilthorn {{near the village of}} Mürren. The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich after three weeks of location scouting in France and Switzerland. The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule. In March 1969 production moved to England, with London's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting, and M's house being shot in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In April the filmmakers went to Portugal, where principal photography wrapped in May. Filming finished on 23 June, two months later than planned, which was largely due to the warm Swiss winter, which had hampered shooting.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>of</b> the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E

25|$|The Luzhniki {{disaster}} is sometimes {{compared with the}} second Ibrox disaster because of some striking similarities. Both of the crushes happened {{at the end of}} the match, when a fall on <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>of</b> one of the spectators caused a massive chain-reaction pile-up. There was also the same number of fatalities in both crushes– 66, many of whom were youths. Furthermore, both crushes coincided with a last-minute goal on the pitch.|$|E

Although his injury affected his performancehe hardly used his legs, Scherer won the bronze in the 4×100-meter freestyle and participated in two other heats, ranking 12th in the 4×100-meter medley and 20th in the 50-meter freestyle.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Phyllis Potter's son, Eliphalet IV (known as Peter), the Astaires had two children. Fred, Jr. (born January 21, 1936), appeared {{with his father}} in the movie Midas Run but became a charter pilot and rancher instead of an actor. Their daughter Ava Astaire (born March 19, 1942; married Richard McKenzie) remains actively involved in promoting her late father's legacy. Fred Astaire was a devoted father and would often dance down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>of</b> the family's home every morning, simply to entertain his two children.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Empire invaded northwestern Persia in 1914. Before {{the end of}} 1914, Turkish and Kurdish {{troops had}} {{successfully}} entered the villages in and around Urmia. On February 21, 1915 the Turkish army in Urmia seized 61 leading Assyrians from the French missions as hostages, demanding large ransoms. The mission had enough money to convince the Ottomans to let 20 of the men go. However, on February 22 the remaining 41 were executed, having their heads cut off at <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>of</b> the Charbachsh Gate. The dead included bishop Mar Denkha.|$|E

Samsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who conducted the Alipore Case was shot and killed by Biren Dutta Gupta on <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>of</b> Calcutta High Court building on 24 January 1910.

25|$|In September 1888 Pyotr Bykov {{published}} a full bibliography of Leskov's works (1860–1887) which intrigued publishers. In 1889 Alexei Suvorin's publishing house began publishing the Complete Leskov in 12 volumes (which contained mostly fiction). By June 1889, {{the fourth and}} fifth volumes had been issued, but in August volume six, containing some anti-Orthodox satires was stopped. On 16 August, Leskov suffered his first major heart attack on <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>of</b> Suvorin's house, upon learning the news. The publication of his works continued with volume seven, generating considerable royalties and greatly improving the author's financial situation. A different version of volume six came out in 1890.|$|E
25|$|Nelson {{continued}} {{to maintain a}} reputation as a conservative maverick as an independent MP, and in September 1999, called for the introduction of conscription for the long-term unemployed to supplement Australia's then-peacekeeping operation in East Timor. Although he had earlier supported proposals to legalise prostitution in the state, he voted against such moves by the Beattie government in December 1999, arguing that the laws would be impossible to enforce. He caused some controversy in May 2000 when, along with Dorothy Pratt, he was suspended from parliament for 28 days and threatened with expulsion for pouring a milk churn down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>of</b> parliament during a protest against the deregulation of the dairy industry. This meant that Nelson had spent more days suspended from the house than any other MP in more than 25 years.|$|E

He married his first wife Meharqanda in 1912; she was a daughter of Yar Mohammad Khan of the Kinankhel clan of the Mohammadzai tribe of Razzar, a village adjacent to Utmanzai. They had a son in 1913, Abdul Ghani Khan, who would become a noted artist and poet. Subsequently, they had another son, Abdul Wali Khan (17 January 1917–), and daughter, Sardaro. Meharqanda died during the 1918 influenza epidemic. In 1920, Bacha Khan remarried; his new wife, Nambata, was a cousin of his first wife and the daughter of Sultan Mohammad Khan of Razzar. She bore him a daughter, Mehar Taj (25 May 1921 – 29 April 2012), and a son, Abdul Ali Khan (20 August 1922 – 19 February 1997). Tragically, in 1926 Nambata died early as well from a fall down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>of</b> the apartment they were staying at in Jerusalem.|$|E
