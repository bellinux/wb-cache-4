5|$|If {{the account}} of Gilli in the {{aftermath}} of Clontarf has been constructed for dramatic effect, the passage may not be evidence of his floruit beyond this point in history. In fact, it is possible that he is identical to Gilla Ciaráin mac Glún Iairn (died 1014), a man who was amongst those slain at the battle. The Annals of Ulster, which records the latter's fall, styles him rígdamna Gall ("heir-designate of the Foreigners"), revealing that Gilla Ciaráin was indeed a prominent man. Sitriuc is known to have had an elder brother named Glún Iairn, a man who had reigned as King of Dublin until his death in 989. If Gilla Ciaráin was a son of this king, his apparent <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> {{at the time of his}} father's death could account for Sitriuc's accession to the kingship. Furthermore, the aforesaid title accorded to Gilla Ciaráin appears to indicate that he was regarded as his uncle's royal heir. If Gilli and Gilla Ciaráin are indeed identical, his pre-eminent status in the Norse-Gaelic world would help to explain his marital alliance with Sigurðr.|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} a positive critical response. James Hunter of The Village Voice called the album a [...] "pop masterpiece," [...] praising the singing, songwriting and {{decision to use}} live backing instruments. Chuck Taylor from Billboard said the album featured [...] "a decidedly mature acoustic pop/rock signature, belying the <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> of the act's two singers", and also gave favourable reviews of both the singles [...] "Everything" [...] and [...] "Don't". John Berge from Norwegian music website [...] gave the album five out of seven stars, praising the album's harmonies and saying it was guaranteed to be a hit with young people. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B-, favourably comparing the uptempo tracks to Hanson though stating M2M's vocal range could not handle the album's ballads.|$|E

2500|$|At a young age, Kennedy began {{collecting}} Florida folklore material and wrote poetry about Florida nature.

2500|$|The {{officers}} {{serving in}} the Irish regiments in the French army were the other Irish community of significance that sought the services of the Irish colleges.

[...] Presumably this is what happened to James Blackwell as in 1784 he subsequently joined the Esterhazy regiment of Hussars in the French army, becoming, at the same time, a naturalized citizen of his adopted country, a fact that undoubtedly saved his life later on.

2500|$|The {{idea came}} from the French diplomat Alquier, who had been {{ambassador}} in Madrid and Naples. His plan was to bring the Kingdom of Naples, an ally of England and hostile to France, into the recently formed Spanish-French alliance, proposing a closer {{relationship between the two}} families through double marriages. Infanta Maria Isabel and her eldest brother, Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias, would marry their first cousins: Maria Antonia of Naples and Francesco, Duke of Calabria. The Queen, Maria Carolina of Austria, who hated France and mistrusted Spain for its good will toward Napoleon, opposed the match. Infanta Maria Isabel was only twelve years old; even at a time when princesses married very young, her <b>tender</b> <b>age</b> was unusual for a bride. [...] But her early marriage was justified by the need to secure the hasty resumption of close relations between Spain and Naples at a particularly critical time for the European courts, struggling with the expansionist policy of Napoleon.|$|E
2500|$|Legend has it {{that the}} first European to {{discover}} Mammoth Cave was either John Houchin or his brother Francis Houchin, in 1797. While hunting, Houchin pursued a wounded bear to the cave's large entrance opening near the Green River. Some Houchin Family tales have John Decatur [...] "Johnny Dick" [...] Houchin as the discoverer of the cave, but this is highly unlikely because Johnny Dick was only 10 years old in 1797 and was unlikely to be out hunting bears at such a <b>tender</b> <b>age.</b> His father John is the more likely candidate from that branch of the family tree, but the most probable candidate for discoverer of Mammoth Cave is Francis [...] "Frank" [...] Houchin whose land was much closer to the cave entrance than his brother John's. There is also the argument that their brother Charles Houchin, who was known as a great hunter and trapper, was the man who shot that bear and chased it into the cave. The shadow over Charles's claim {{is the fact that he}} was residing in Illinois until 1801. Contrary to this story is Brucker and Watson's The Longest Cave, which asserts that the cave was [...] "certainly known before that time." [...] Caves in the area were known before the discovery of the entrance to Mammoth Cave. Even Francis Houchin had a cave entrance on his land very near the bend in the Green River known as the Turnhole, which is less than a mile from the main entrance of Mammoth Cave.|$|E

40|$|Aged pork loins were {{selected}} to have similar ultimate pH, color, lipid content, and purge. The star probe values (kg) obtained from these loins were evaluated and loins were sorted into either a low star probe (LSP) group or a high star probe (HSP) group. Two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) was used to identify differences insarcoplasmic proteomes between LSP and HSP groups. Metabolic, stress response, structural, and regulatory protein spots were identified to be significantly different between classification groups. The structural protein desmin was identified to be more abundant in LSP samples and the stress response protein peroxiredoxin- 2 was identified to be more abundant in HSP samples. Because these protein were identified as being significantly different between classification groups in the soluble, sarcoplasmic fraction of samples, these proteins are potential candidates to be biomarkers to differentiate between tough and <b>tender</b> <b>aged</b> pork loins...|$|R

40|$|In West Africa, {{the foliage}} of both wild and {{cultivated}} varieties of Amarnathus species is used widely as vegetable and as fodder for cattle. This widely cultivated vegetable is severely {{attacked by the}} snouted beetle, Gastreoclisus rhomboidalis. A comprehensive study on {{some aspects of the}} biology of G. rhomboidalis has been carried out. The full life cycle of the beetle (from copulation and oviposition through the various immature stages to the emergence of adult beetles) was investigated. It took on the average 40 days for the adult beetle to emerge from the day of oviposition. Studies on the feeding habit of the beetles revealed that the beetles fed heavily on the leaves and can inflict an enormous destruction on the host plant over a short period of time. Generally; the studies have been able to confirm that the larva and adult beetles are the most potent destroyers of the host plant. While the adult beetle fed heavily on the leaves and tender plant stem, the larva when hatched in the plant stem, destroyed the host plant (particularly duri ng the <b>tender</b> <b>ages</b> of between 2 - 3 weeks) with its boring activities causing the plant to wilt and die...|$|R

40|$|A {{study to}} {{determine}} the mental health needs of adolescents in Zimbabwe. Promotion of mental health for adolescents has become an emerging global concern since its absence brings in a myriad of challenges for adolescents in theform ofantisocial behaviour, unwanted pregnancies, abortions, sexually transmitted infections and HIV among other problems. The study examined the need for mental health needs among adolescents in Chiredzi. The study triangulated quantitative and qualitative data. The survey, {{through the use of}} a questionnaire, was used to gather information from adolescents. Qualitative data was collected through the use of focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and key informant interviews. It was noted that there was limited emphasis on mental health issues within and among families because of limited resources for adolescents. This was also because of poverty, anxiety, the absence of support from extendedfamily network, cultural initiation ceremonies, siblings and peer pressure. Consequently adolescents find themselves engaged in drug and alcohol abuse and became sexually active at <b>tender</b> <b>ages.</b> The study recommended school policy to support primary carers, that is, parents and communities in the promotion of good mental health for the benefits of adolescents and the nation as a whole.
