500|$|On October 30, 2006, {{before a}} crowd of about 100 people on the Naval Base San Diego waterfront, Hunter {{announced}} {{the formation of an}} exploratory committee to begin raising campaign funds and organizing supporters for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination. He reasoned, [...] "his {{is going to be a}} long road, it's a challenging road, there's going to be some rough and tumble, but I think it's the right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> our country." [...] He did not seek advice from party leaders before making the decision. The New York Times described the move as a [...] "surprise." [...] Mesa College Political Science professor Carl Luna speculated that Hunter's run was an attempt to find [...] "something to do" [...] in preparation for his loss of the Armed Services Committee chairmanship with Democrats heavily favored to reclaim the House. Political analysts saw little chance for the campaign's success. Claremont McKenna College government professor Jack Pitney argued that due to low name recognition and [...] "no following within the party", Hunter [...] "faces extremely long odds".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} Mel Gibson {{as a guest}} voice. Scully {{had previously}} met him while writing jokes for a school fundraiser {{along with his wife}} Julie Thacker. Gibson and Daniel Stern were the hosts and needed jokes for the event. It turned out that Gibson was a fan of the show and watched it with his children. With that knowledge, it did not take Scully long to invite him to do a part. Gibson was willing to do the job and even came in on three separate occasions to do retakes – mostly because he knew his children would be watching. Unlike most guest voices, Gibson recorded the show along with the cast. On one occasion, it turned out that a joke written for Gibson actually did happen in real life. The writing staff wanted Gibson to say that he would urinate behind a dumpster, because it sounded like {{it would not be a}} classy <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> a movie star. He had, however, already done that during a couple of film premieres because he can feel trapped in a public toilet with a lot of fans. Gibson was surprised the writers knew about the story, but it turned out to be a coincidence. Otherwise, the episode frequently references films Gibson appeared in. After the studio cart crashes, Gibson says to Homer, [...] "I'm getting too old for this crap," [...] a reference to a line said by Danny Glover's character Roger Murtaugh to Gibson's character Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon film series. A poster for his film Braveheart is on the wall in the editing room and the Road Warrior car from the 1981 film Mad Max 2 is also featured. In addition to Gibson, Jack Burns guest starred in the episode, voicing a film studio executive named Edward Christian. His frequent use of the terms [...] "Huh?" [...] and [...] "You know what I mean?" [...] is a reference to a comedy routine performed by Burns and Avery Schreiber. The episode also features John Travolta, in whose private jet Gibson flies to Springfield, but his voice was imitated by Dan Castellaneta.|$|E

500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

It was not an easy thing to do, but it was something I had to do. I thought about it very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be." [...] It was mentioned in the film Some Kind of Monster that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but it was proven false.|$|E

2500|$|There are multiple, {{conflicting}} {{explanations for}} Atta's behavior and motivation. Political psychologist, Jerrold Post, {{has suggested that}} Atta and his fellow hijackers were just following orders from al-Qaeda leadership, [...] "and whatever their destructive, charismatic leader Osama bin Laden said was the right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> {{the sake of the}} cause was what they would do." [...] In turn, political scientist, Robert Pape, has claimed that Atta was motivated by his commitment to the political cause, that he was psychologically normal, and that he was “not readily characterized as depressed, not unable to enjoy life, not detached from friends and society.” By contrast, criminal justice professor, Adam Lankford, has found evidence that indicated Atta was suicidal, and that his struggles with social isolation, depression, guilt, shame, hopelessness, and rage were extraordinarily similar to the struggles of those who commit conventional suicide and murder-suicide. By this view, Atta’s political and religious beliefs affected the method of his suicide and his choice of target, but they were not the underlying causes of his behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{in early}} 2005, Cunningham was heavily courted by Lehigh Valley democrats {{to run for}} {{executive}} of Lehigh County. No Democrat had ever won the executive's office since the county's home rule charter {{went into effect in}} 1978, and Lehigh County Democratic Committee Chairman Charles F. Smith Jr. called Cunningham the party's [...] "dream candidate". Cunningham announced his candidacy for the position in March, and he formally resigned from the Rendell administration on April 8. He ran with no opposition in the Democratic primary, clearing the way for a challenge against Republican Executive Jane R. Ervin, who was seeking a second four-year term. During his campaign, Cunningham strongly criticized Ervin for a 69 percent county tax increase in 2003, calling it [...] "unconscionable" [...] declaring that a change in leadership was necessary. Cunningham raised other campaign issues as the election continued, including crime prevention, the cost of a planned courthouse expansion, and priorities in county construction projects. Ervin responded aggressively to Cunningham's campaign, raising questions about his record in Bethlehem and Rendell's administration and defending her tax increase as the right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> the county. Cunningham defeated Ervin by a margin of 33,263 to 20,721, capturing 62 percent of the vote, becoming the first Democrat ever elected to the executive post. He had spent roughly $500,000 in the election. The county executive position paid $65,000 annually, a 41 percent cut from Cunningham's salary as a cabinet secretary.|$|E
