40|$|International audienceOur {{laboratory}} {{has previously}} shown that apelin is mitogenic for endothelial cells. We have postulated that apelin represents an angiogenic factor secreted by tumour cells {{in order to}} promote the formation of new vessels necessary for tumour growth. We first demonstrate that apelin and its receptor are not expressed by the mouse TS/A mammary carcinoma cells. We therefore established clones of this tumoral cell type stably overexpressing the apelin cDNA (TS/A-apelin clones). Comparison of the in vitro proliferation rates between TS/A-mock and TS/A-apelin cells did not reveal any difference and confirmed the lack of receptor expression by tumour cells. On the other hand, apelin overexpression clearly increased the in vivo tumour growth and this increase was associated with an earlier onset of tumour development. In tumours derived from TS/A-apelin clones, the expression of the endothelial marker CD 31 was increased and revealed the formation of large intratumoral vessels lined with CD 31 positive cells. These data suggest that apelin behaves as a potent activator of tumour neoangiogenesis by a paracrine effect on host vessels. The pathological relevance of <b>this</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by hypoxia-induced upregulation of apelin gene and its overexpression in one-third of human tumours...|$|R

However, these data are not supported as fully in the geovisualization of the Digital City as established data categories such as feature attributes, 2 D rasters, or geometry. Consequently, 3 D surface properties are largely excluded from the information extraction and knowledge creation process of geovisualization despite their potential for being an effective tool in many such tasks.

40|$|Volatile {{exchange}} rates {{and how to}} manage them are a contentious topic whenever economic policymakers gather in international meetings. This book examines the broad parameters of exchange rate policy in light of both high-powered theory and real-world experience. What are {{the costs and benefits}} of flexible versus fixed {{exchange rates}}? How much of a role should the exchange rate play in monetary policy? Why don't volatile exchange rates destabilize inflation and output? The principal <b>finding</b> of <b>this</b> book <b>is</b> that using monetary policy to fight exchange rate volatility, including through the adoption of a fixed exchange rate regime, leads to greater volatility of employment, output, and inflation. In other words, the "cure" for exchange rate volatility is worse than the disease. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in economic models, in historical case studies, and in statistical analysis of the data. The book devotes considerable attention to understanding the reasons why volatile exchange rates do not destabilize inflation and output. The book concludes that many countries would benefit from allowing greater flexibility of their exchange rates in order to target monetary policy at stabilization of their domestic economies. Few, if any, countries would benefit from a move in the opposite direction. ...|$|R
40|$|The Ski {{oncogene}} has dramatic {{effects on}} the differentiation of several different cell types. It induces the differentiation of quail embryo cells into myoblasts and arrests the differentiation of chicken hematopoietic cells. The mechanism that Ski uses to carry out these disparate biological activities is unknown. However, we were struck by the similarity of these effects to those of certain members of the nuclear hormone receptor family. Both Ski and the thyroid hormone receptor-derived oncogene v-ErbA can arrest the differentiation of avian erythroblasts, and v-Ski-transformed avian multipotent progenitor cells resemble murine hematopoietic cells that express a dominant-negative form of the retinoic acid receptor, RARα. In this paper, we have tested the hypothesis that v-Ski and its cellular homologue c-Ski exert their effects by interfering with nuclear hormone receptor-induced transcription. We demonstrate that Ski associates with the RAR complex and can repress transcription from a retinoic acid response element. The physiological significance of <b>this</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by the ability of high concentrations of a RARα-specific ligand to abolish v-Ski-induced transformation of the multipotent progenitors. These results strongly suggest that the ability of Ski to alter cell differentiation is caused {{in part by the}} modulation of RAR signaling pathways...|$|R

The main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of invasive algae on one of the highest diversity assemblages in the Mediterranean, the coralligenous. Two manipulative experiments were designed to study the effects of overgrowth of invasive species on juvenile colonies of the Mediterranean gorgonian Paramuricea clavata, an important structural species in coralligenous assemblages. The experiments were conducted in two French marine protected areas, Port-Cros National Park and Scandola Regional Park, which are separated by hundreds of km and are invaded by Caulerpa racemosa and Womersleyella setacea, respectively.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of hydraulic transmissivity of permeable fracture reservoirs {{is a very}} important task in the exploration of water resources and hydrocarbons. Previ-ous studies that model the permeable structure as a single fluid-filled fracture failed to explain the observed significant Stoneley wave attenuation across the permeable struc-ture. In this paper, the structure is modeled as a permeable fracture zone and synthetic Stoneley wave seismograms {{in the vicinity of the}} structure are calculated. The results show that Stoneley waves can be strongly attenuated or even eliminated without sig-nificant reflection, because of the dissipation of wave energy into the permeable zone. Several field cases are also modeled and the theoretical results are compared with the field data. It is shown that low- and medium-frequency Stoneley waves (1 kHz data from Moodus, Conneticut, and 5 kHz data from Monitoba, Canada) are very sensitive to the permeability of the fractures and can be used to assess permeability from in-situ logging data, if the fracture porosity and zone thickness can be measured. At high frequencies, however, Stoneley waves are not very sensitive to permeability but are mainly affected by the sum of the fracture openings expressed as the product of fracture zone thickness 44 Tang et al. and porosity in the fracture zone. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by a logging data set (Monitoba, Canada) obtained using high-frequency Stoneley waves at 34 kHz...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe liver {{has been}} {{suspected}} {{to be one}} of the major targets of dengue virus infection. Here, we detected increasing secretion of the chemokine RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), which functions to recruit the immune cells, in dengue-virus-infected liver cells and patients. Three luciferase reporter genes with various deletions at the 5 ′-end of the RANTES promoter were constructed to explore the RANTES activation mechanism in human liver cells. The reporter gene was optimally activated by dengue- 2 virus when the RANTES promoter contains the region from the transcription starting site (+ 1) to the nucleotide at the − 181 position. NF-IL- 6 and an undefined factor forming DNA–protein complexes in the RANTES promoter E and A/B regions in the infected cells <b>were</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Further analysis showed that oxidative stress was an upstream inducer of NF-IL- 6 and RANTES signaling in dengue-virus-infected liver cells. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by three antioxidants (N-acetyl-l-cysteine, nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) used to suppress the activation. In contrast, the DNA binding activity of the undefined factor was not affected by the antioxidant treatment, indicating the existence of an oxidant-independent pathway. We hypothesize that dengue virus infection of the liver cells may trigger both an oxidant-dependent and an oxidant-independent pathway to up-regulate RANTES mRNA expression through activating NF-IL- 6 and an undefined factor, respectively. In conclusion, the present study suggests a new direction for the study of liver pathogenesis involving RANTES in host immune responses during dengue virus infection...|$|R

In this study, a framework for the longitudinal analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) -based mapping {{was applied to the}} assessment of predefined white matter tracts in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as an example for a rapid progressive neurodegenerative disease. Methods: DTI was performed every 3 months in six patients with ALS (mean (M) = 7. 7; range 3 to 15 scans) and in six controls (M = 3; range 2 – 5 scans) with the identical scanning protocol, resulting in a total of 65 longitudinal DTI datasets. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axonal diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and the ratio AD/RD were studied to analyze alterations within the corticospinal tract (CST) which is a prominently affected tract structure in ALS and the tract correlating with Braak’s neuropathological stage 1. A correlation analysis was performed between progression rates based on DTI metrics and the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALS-FRS-R). Results: Patients with ALS showed an FA and AD/RD decline along the CST, while DTI metrics of controls did not change in longitudinal DTI scans. The FA and AD/RD decrease progression correlated significantly with ALS-FRS-R decrease progression. Conclusion: On the basis of the longitudinal assessment, DTI-based metrics can be considered as a possible noninvasive follow-up marker for disease progression in neurodegeneration. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> here for ALS as a fast progressing neurodegenerative disease...|$|R

40|$|The Class III β-tubulin isotype (βIII-tubulin) is a {{predictive}} biomarker in {{ovarian cancer}} and other solid tumor malignancies. We discovered that βIII-tubulin function is linked to two GTPases: guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP 1), which activates its function, and GNAI 1, which inhibits it. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in a panel of ovarian cancer cells resistant to several chemotherapeutic agents. Using a protein microarray, we identified PIM 1 as the downstream partner of GBP 1, recruited into the cytoskeleton under hypoxic conditions. The clinical value of these observations was tested by performing an archive study of 98 ovarian cancer patients, which demonstrated that the βIII-tubulin -/PIM 1 - cohort responded to treatment, exhibiting long overall survival (OS), while βIII-tubulin +/PIM+ patients experienced poor outcomes and OS times similar to patients receiving palliation alone. βIII-tubulin expression is commonly believed responsible for paclitaxel resistance due to its enhancement of the dynamic instability of microtubules, which counteracts the activity of taxanes. In contrast, our research reveals that βIII-tubulin behaves as a gateway for prosurvival signals, such as PIM 1, {{to move into the}} cytoskeleton. When cells are exposed to microenvironmental stressors, they activate this pathway by telling the cytoskeleton to incorporate PIM 1 through GBP 1 and βIII-tubulin, which ultimately leads to drug resistance.

The discovery of such protein:protein interactions underlying this prosurvival cascade makes feasible the development of therapeutic approaches using novel compounds that are capable of inhibiting the transmission of prosurvival signals into the cytoskeleton...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectrophoresis of {{a mixture}} of NaCl and CaCl 2 in a {{lysozyme}} crystal is investigated using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Upon exposure to an electric field, the stability of lysozyme is found to decrease slightly. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by increases in the root mean-square deviations of the heavy atoms of lysozyme, in the solvent-accessible surface area of hydrophobic residues, and {{in the number of}} hydrogen bonds between lysozyme and water. The solvent-accessible surface area of hydrophilic residues changes marginally, and the number of hydrogen bonds between lysozyme molecules decreases. Water molecules tend to align preferentially parallel to the electric field, and the dipole moment along the pore axis increases linearly with increasing field strength. Two pronounced layered structures are observed for Na+ and Ca 2 + in the vicinity of protein surface, but only one enriched layer is observed for Cl−. The number distributions of all ions are nearly independent of the electric field. The water coordination numbers of all ions are smaller in the crystal than in aqueous bulk solution; however, the reverse is found for the Cl− coordination numbers of cations. Both the water and the Cl− coordination numbers are insensitive to the electric field. Ion diffusivities in the crystal are ∼ 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those in aqueous bulk solution. The drift velocities of ions increase proportionally to the electric field, particularly at high strengths, and depend on ionic charge and coordination with oppositely charged ions. Electrical current exhibits a linear relationship with the field strength. The zero-field electrical conductivity is estimated to be 0. 56 S/m, which is very close to 0. 61 S/m as predicted by the Nernst-Einstein equation...|$|R

As {{a result of its}} high reactivity, isoprene is an important ozone precursor in the troposphere and can {{play a key role in}} atmospheric chemistry. Measurements of isoprene in urban areas in Central Europe are scarce. Thus, in Essen, Germany, the isoprene concentration was measured at various sites during different seasons using two compact online GC-PID systems. Isoprene concentrations were compared with those of benzene and toluene, which represent typical anthropogenic VOCs. In the summer, the diurnal variation in isoprene concentration was dependent on the biogenic emissions in the city. It was found that its maximum concentration occurred during the day, in contrast to the benzene and toluene concentrations. During the measurement period in the summer of 2012, the average hourly isoprene concentrations reached 0. 13 to 0. 17 ppb between 10 and 20 LST. At high air temperatures, the isoprene concentration exceeded the benzene and toluene concentrations at many of the sites.

40|$|Apoptosis in glomerular sclerosis. Glomerulosclerosis is {{characterized}} by progressive extracellular matrix accumulation and glomerular cell loss. The role of glomerular cell apoptosis in glomerulosclerosis was investigated in the rat remnant kidney model and in human glomerular diseases. We identified apoptotic cells in the glomeruli, tubules and interstitium in the remnant kidney by electron microscopy. DNA fragmentation, which is a biochemical characteristic of apoptosis, was detected by in situ nick end-labeling of fragmented DNA with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and biotinylated deoxyuridine triphosphate. Fragmented DNA in the glomeruli and tubules increased with the progression of glomerulosclerosis in the remnant kidney model. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> also <b>demonstrated</b> in other glomerular sclerotic lesions such as IgA and lupus nephritis. The number of cells positive for nick end-labeling in the glomerulus significantly correlated with the degree of glomerulosclerosis and the deterioration of renal function. These results indicate that apoptosis is, at least in part, involved in the cell deletion of various glomerular diseases leading to sclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Generalized {{capillary}} dysfunction is a morbid {{element in}} the metabolic syndrome, {{and it is likely}} involved in its complications. We tested the hypothesis that vast amounts of serum albumin previously observed in kidneys of rats with the metabolic syndrome were caused, in part, by leakage from renal peritubular capillaries. We report herein large scale leaks of plasma fluid in peritubular capillaries of rats with the metabolic syndrome. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> directly <b>demonstrated</b> in vivo, and the presence of leftover albumin residue confirmed the leak in post-mortem kidney specimens. Moreover, renal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy were found in a distribution similar to the leaked renal albumin in obese rats. We suggest that there is an important link between peritubular capillary damage and interstitial fibrosis, represented as tubulo-interstitial disease in the metabolic syndrome. We propose that maintenance of the peritubular microcirculation may improve renal outcomes in diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Page 3 of 35...|$|R
40|$|Reasoning {{from all}} {{knowledge}} and belief is an adaptive approach {{to thinking about}} the world. It has been robustly shown that conditional ‘if then’ reasoning with everyday content {{is influenced by the}} background knowledge an individual has available. If we are presented with the statement ‘if it rains, then John will get wet’ then we are told that it is raining and asked if John will get wet, we may consider a number of possibilities before answering the question; perhaps John has an umbrella or is sheltered from the rain. Hence, when engaged in conditional reasoning of this sort people typically draw on background knowledge to arrive at an informed response. People with autism tend not to process information in context. There is a wealth of evidence indicating that these individuals have a piecemeal rather than an integrative processing style. It was therefore hypothesised that adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) would be less influenced by background knowledge when engaged in conditional reasoning with everyday content. Adolescents with ASD showed a weak or absent effect of available background knowledge on reasoning outcomes compared to a typically developing control group. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in two separate conditional reasoning tasks. These results were not explained by a failure to generate background knowledge or by differences in the beliefs held by the two groups regarding problem content. Within the typical population a lack of contextualised reasoning was also found among participants with high scores on one particular autistic trait, attention to detail. The ability to integrate all relevant information during conditional reasoning was also found to be dependent on available working memory resources. These results extend the known domains which demonstrate a lack of contextualised processing in autism. They also show that for individuals with autism reasoning without regard for background knowledge stems from a failure to integrate information. The <b>findings</b> suggest that <b>this</b> failure is related to the cognitive demands of the task and the processing style of the individual.

This property {{can be used to}} perform direction finding using a single fixed antenna, without the need for an array or antenna rotation. In <b>this</b> paper direction <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> using a simple candelabra-shaped monopole operating in the 1 - 3 GHz range. The method requires a known transmitted pulse shape and high signal-to-noise ratio, and is not as accurate or robust as conventional methods.

40|$|The {{polypeptide}} encoded by {{the open}} reading frame UL 69 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which is homologous to the immediate-early regulator ICP 27 of herpes simplex virus, has recently {{been identified as a}} transactivator protein that exerts a broad stimulatory effect on gene expression (M. Winkler, S. A. Rice, and T. Stamminger, J. Virol. 68 : 3943 - 3954, 1994). Here, we provide evidence that pUL 69 is a phosphorylated tegument protein of HCMV. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> could <b>be</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by Western blot (immunoblot) analyses with purified virions and a specific antiserum against pUL 69. These experiments revealed that one phosphorylated subform of the three pUL 69 polypeptides that are synthesized in infected fibroblast cells is contained within the HCMV virion. After the treatment of purified virions with detergents, pUL 69 could not be detected within the membrane fraction, suggesting that it is either a capsid or a tegument protein. Its presence within dense bodies, however, shows that pUL 69 is a constituent of the viral tegument...|$|R

The purpose of this study <b>was</b> to <b>demonstrate</b> the need for individual institutions to conduct validity studies to develop admission standards for their (MBA) programs. The study identified and compared pre-admission factors which were valid predictors of success for three selected MBA programs. The MBA programs studied were all at private institutions and only part-time students were included in the samples. MBA Program A was a large prestigious, highly selective, AACSB accredited program. MBA Program B was a large well-known, selective, AACSB accredited program. MBA Program C was a small, somewhat selective, regionally accredited but non-AACSB program. The dependent variable assessed was graduating grade point average from the MBA program. The independent variables included in the study were: (1) undergraduate grade point average (UGGPA), (2) junior/senior year grade point average (JRSRGPA), (3) GMAT composite score (GMATCOMP), (4) GMAT verbal score (GMATVERB), (5) GMAT quantitative score (GMATQUAN), (6) business major (BUSMAJ), (7) science major (SCIMAJ), (8) work experience (WORK EXP), (9) business experience (BUSEXP), (10) management experience (MANEXP), (11) age (BIRTH), and (12) interruption in years, between undergraduate and graduate study (INTERRUPT). Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the best combination of predictors for each school. All tests for significance were at the. 05 level of confidence. The best combination of variables for predicting success for Program A was GMATCOMP, WORKEXP, and BIRTH. The best combination of variables for predicting success for Program B was UGGPA, INTERRUPT, BIRTH, and BUSEXP. The best combination of variables for predicting success for Program C was GMATCOMP, UGGPA, and SCIMAJ. The best combination of pre-admission factors for predicting academic success was determined to be significantly different for each school. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by cross-testing models. Most prior studies in this area found that some combination of undergraduate grades and test scores was the best predictor of success for MBA programs. This was not the case for two of the three programs studied (Programs A and B) ...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbons from road runoff and {{faecal matter}} from sewage {{overflows}} have previously been implicated as major contributors to urban stormwater contamination, but little source identification or quantitative data exist. In this. study chemical marker techniques were utilised to identify specific sources of these contaminants in selected stormwater catchments of Hobart, Tasmania. The mean concentration of hydrocarbons in stormwater during {{this study was}} found to be 2. 88 mg/l with an estimated total annual discharge to the Derwent Estuary in the order of 164, 000 kg/year. Assessment of the major hydrocarbon inputs to the Derwent estuary <b>demonstrated</b> that stormwater <b>is</b> the largest single contributor. Source elucidation of hydrocarbons demonstrated inputs to stormwater from automotive oils, diesel fuel, and plant waxes. Analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) profiles by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and multivariate analysis confirmed, in most cases, that automobile sump oil, rather than unused lubricating oils were the major component of oil in stormwater. Cluster analysis, based on PAH composition, was used for grouping stormwater samples relative to potential source materials. Other techniques {{such as the use of}} PAH isomer pair ratios proved useful for determining the input of combustion derived P AH. In sheltered embayments of the Derwent Estuary a clear link <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> between urban stormwater and the build-up of hydrocarbon contaminants in sediments. Localised extreme hydrocarbon concentrations were found associated with stormwater discharge and boat mooring areas. Aliphatic hydrocarbons (10, 100 iJg/g) and P AHs (27 iJg/g) in sediments at Prince of Wales Bay were the highest yet recorded levels for estuarine sediments in Australia. Stormwater in Hobart {{was found to be}} highly contaminated with faecal pollution. Sterol and bacterial analysis of stonnwater samples showed that dog faeces is potentially the most significant contributor to the faecal contamination. <b>This</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> primarily by the similarity between sterol profiles of dog faeces and stonnwater samples and the low levels or absence of sterol markers for other sources of faeces. Human faecal material was detected in urban stonnwater by tracing the faecal sterol coprostanol. During flood conditions, human faeces, attributed to cross contamination from the sewerage system, became a major contaminant in stonnwater. During dry weather, urban runoff contained low levels of human faecal material possibly derived from illegal sewer connections. On an annual basis in Hobart, stonnwater was calculated to represent an estimated 80 - 91...|$|R
