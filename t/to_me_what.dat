Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: [...] "I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing {{was at the heart of}} the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> a special player he was." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, {{while still}} grieving {{the loss of}} her daughter, Rice took a {{previously}} written short story and turned it into her first novel, the bestselling Interview with the Vampire. She based her vampires on Gloria Holden's character in Dracula's Daughter: [...] "It established <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive people. I was really just going with that feeling when writing Interview With the Vampire. I didn't do a lot of research." [...] After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says, [...] "What you see when you're in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you can't control it and you go crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|Like some of Madonna's {{previous}} music videos, such as [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer", religious imagery plays a {{big role}} in the music video. In the book Madonna's Drowned Worlds the use of Catholic imagery in the video is discussed. Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández points out that unlike Madonna's previous music videos, much of the religious imagery is associated with the torero, not Madonna, {{due to the fact that}} religious images are a strong part of the bullfighting ritual. It has also been argued that in the video Madonna [...] "subverts the gender structure and masculine subjectivity implicit in traditional bullfighting." [...] This is achieved through the [...] "feminization of the matador and the emphasis on Madonna's character" [...] and also through Madonna's [...] "dominant gaze" [...] as she watches the matador perform." [...] Roger Beebe, one of the authors of Medium Cool: Music Videos from Soundies to Cellphones, noted that the video was an example of [...] "how music, image, and lyrics of a song possesses their own temporality". He explained that the [...] "graceful" [...] nature of the song was contrast to the repetitive scenes in the video, which he felt indicated that the protagonist has long been engaging in the activities, including the [...] "demoralizing sex scenes". In Madonna as Postmodern Myth, author Georges-Claude Guilbert felt the video [...] "defied feminists of the Marilyn Frye and Adrienne Rich variety, who see in the video a disgusting example of passé female submissiveness." [...] Madonna responded to this criticism by stating [...] "I don't believe that any organization should dictate <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> I can and cannot do artistically." [...] Guilbert also noted the usage of religious iconography in the video, especially dubious representation of the Virgin. He explained that most of the times Madonna and the torero make love through the television screen, implying that [...] "one of their purity had to be maintained always".|$|E

500|$|On 3 November, Frederick and {{his entourage}} {{departed}} for San Remo. At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat. Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while {{there was no immediate}} danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had [...] "unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn," [...] and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology Leopold Schrötter and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin. On 9 November, Schrötter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year. All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared {{on the right side of}} the larynx, and that an immediate and total laryngectomy was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous. Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, [...] "To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> <b>What</b> have I done to be thus stricken and condemned?" [...] Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition. The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering [...] "foreigner" [...] who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father [...] "whether he is ill or not, [...] whether the K is then unable permanently to perform his duties," [...] would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution. [...] Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.|$|E

2500|$|Getty, {{who went}} through a three-hour {{transformation}} to become Sophia, wore heavy make-up, thick glasses, and a white wig to look the part. The character of Sophia was thought by the creators to enhance the idea that three retirement-aged women could be young. Disney's Michael Eisner explains, [...] "Estelle Getty made our three women into girls. And that was, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>what</b> made it seem like {{it could be a}} contemporary, young show." [...] As surprising as it may sound, Estelle Getty continuously battled her stage fright. During an interview in 1988, Getty commented on her phobia and expressed how working with major stars, such as Arthur and White, made her even more nervous. At times, she even froze on camera while filming.|$|E
2500|$|About this work, Allen Tate wrote: [...] "The {{new form}} is most interesting, the poems quite {{beautiful}} and distinguished." [...] Encouraged by {{this and other}} commendatory responses to her twelve-tone poems by poets, musicians, and composers including Stephen Sondheim, Bartlett continued to develop the new form. The House of Sleep, published in 1975, was the result, consisting of 68 poems related to dreams and written in the new form. [...] Of these poems, William Stafford wrote: [...] "There is a trancelike progression in these poems, in which all unfolds quietly, with a steady holding of a certain pervasive tone." [...] Robert M. Hutchins wrote: [...] "I am much impressed. The poems seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> is called an important contribution, and a beautiful one." [...] A third collection of twelve-tone poems, In Search of Identity, was published in 1977, further establishing the diversity and versatility {{of ways in which}} Bartlett was able {{to make use of the}} new form. A fourth collection of twelve-tone poems was published in 1981, Memory Is No Stranger.|$|E
