The {{landscape}} is littered with salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I {{was the first one}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>that</b> in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E
5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>that</b> engineering {{discipline to}} North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience {{served him well}} in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
5|$|No.6 Squadron's Lincolns were {{replaced}} with Canberra jet bombers in early 1955, and the unit became operational with these aircraft on 11 July. As {{part of the}} transition to the Canberra, the squadron's remaining aircrew were posted to the Lincoln Conversion Flight, which continued to support No.1 Squadron in Malaya, and replacement aircrew were posted from No.2 Squadron. The squadron suffered a number of accidents during the next two years in which several Canberras were damaged as a result of defects with the aircraft. No.6 Squadron continued its training duties with the new aircraft; these included regular deployments to Darwin in the Northern Territory to participate in air defence exercises as well as training flights to Malaya and New Zealand. In early 1967 most of the squadron's personnel were transferred to No.2 Squadron <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>that</b> unit up to its full strength before it deployed to South Vietnam as part of Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War. From this point onwards, No.6 Squadron was heavily engaged in training aircrew for service in South Vietnam.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the show, Lana Lang is {{characterized}} as the girl next door. As Kreuk describes her, she is the [...] "beautiful, popular girl who is really lonely". She has a [...] "hole in her heart", because of the loss of her parents, and feels empathy for everyone. Kristin feels that deep down the character is a [...] "tough girl", and that Lex manages <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>that</b> side of her out more. For instance, he convinces her to fight back against a rival coffee shop that is spreading rumors about The Talon – the coffee shop that she joint owns with Lex. Unfortunately, that tough side is not seen in the first season. According to Kreuk, the character was never placed in situations where she could show her outgoing side, because she was left to communicate primarily with Whitney and Clark. Kreuk thinks that Lana [...] "lived in her head a little bit"; she was intelligent enough to read classical books, but would also read romantic novels [...] "on the sly".|$|E
500|$|Beginning with Jones and {{continuing}} with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards {{refers to as}} the [...] "ancient art of weaving" [...] responsible for part of their sound – the interplay between two guitarists on stage. Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's (Watts). [...] Likewise, Watts is primarily a jazz player who was able <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>that</b> genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming. The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills. In the studio, the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on Beggars Banquet are driven by Nicky Hopkins' piano playing. On Exile on Main St., Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four.|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>that</b> back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E

[...] "Nice Guys Finish Last" [...] has been considered a song that [...] "eases the transition" [...] from Insomniac to Nimrod. Sandy Masuo of the Los Angeles Times likened [...] "Worry Rock" [...] to the music of Elvis Costello. [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] has been referred to as a [...] "pop-punk campfire singalong ballad".

2500|$|By 1964, Franklin began {{recording}} more pop music, {{reaching the}} top ten on the R chart with the ballad, [...] "Runnin' Out of Fools" [...] in early 1965.

By the mid-1960s, Franklin was netting $100,000 from countless performances in nightclubs and theaters. Also during that period, Franklin appeared on rock and roll shows such as Hollywood A Go-Go and Shindig!. However, it was argued that Franklin's potential was neglected at the label.

Joystiq interviewed Twisted Pixel's Mike Wilford who cited Final Fight as {{an inspiration for}} melee combat, while Contra and Gunstar Heroes served as inspirations for gun sequences, and said the humor as akin to Earthworm Jim. Wilford further stated [...] "Back in the day, {{there seemed to be}} a whole lot of mascot-type characters in games, like Mario, Sonic, all those things, and not many devs seem to be doing that anymore.

2500|$|In his analysis, svabhāva is {{somewhat}} redefined from the Theravada interpretation to mean: inherent existence or self-characterization. Nagarjuna is notably departing from {{the interpretation of}} that term as merely meaning 'a self-sustaining, permanent, or unchanging identity.' If an object was inherently what-it-was from its own side, what need would there be for causes and conditions <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>that</b> object into being? If any object was characterized by 'being-itself,' then it has no need to dependently rely on anything else. Further, such an identity or self-characterization would prevent the process of dependent origination. Inherence would prevent any kind of origination at all, for things would simply always have been, and things would always continue to be. Madhyamaka suggests that uncharacterized mere experiences—with no specific qualities—are designated by conceptual labels, and this brings them into being (See Prasaṅgika Merely Designated Causality). According to Nagarjuna, even the principle of causality itself is dependently originated, and hence it is empty.|$|E
