5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of any {{visits by}} eminent {{people to the}} castle, {{although}} there is a belief that in 1207 KingJohn visited and donated £5 towards the upkeep of its chapel. EdwardII certainly visited the castle and was there for three days in November 1323, during which time he also visited Norton Priory.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{at least}} the nineteenth century the song thrush was kept as a cage bird because of its melodious voice. As with hunting, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> that the taking of wild birds for aviculture has had a {{significant}} effect on wild populations.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E

50|$|Bone {{fragments}} {{found at}} the site came mostly from cattle (16.4%), sheep and goats (10.7%) and horses (10.7%). Farming at the site seems to have <b>been</b> mostly pastoral; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of arable cultivation.|$|R
5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, boats from {{mainland}} Scotland and the Netherlands dominated the local herring fishery. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of an Orcadian fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and later Stromness becoming leading centres of development. White fish never became as dominant as in other Scottish ports.|$|E
5|$|However, pay {{would have}} been much more {{attractive}} in higher-grade units. The top of the pay pyramid were the scholae elite cavalry regiments. Next came palatini units, then comitatenses, and finally limitanei. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> about the pay differentials between grades. But that they were substantial is shown by the example that an actuarius (quartermaster) of a comitatus regiment was paid 50% more than his counterpart in a pseudocomitatensis regiment.|$|E
5|$|Less clearcut is the {{question}} of whether the regular auxilia recruited barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people living outside the empire's borders). Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of it before the 3rd century, the consensus is that auxilia recruited barbarians throughout their history. In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E

50|$|What Bernstein {{meant was}} that he {{believed}} that Marx was wrong in assuming that the capitalist economy would collapse {{as a result of}} its internal contradictions, as by the mid-1890s <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of such internal contradictions causing this to capitalism.|$|R
3000|$|Classically, the {{decision}} to transfuse is driven by arbitrary [...] "triggers" [...] (hemoglobin level) rather than clinical or physiologic findings. Data from the CRIT study [5], in which <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> that age or comorbidities significantly influenced transfusion practice, tend to support this view.|$|R
5|$|Rigveda, however, {{does not}} {{describe}} yoga and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> {{as to what}} the practices were. Early references to practices that later became part of yoga, are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the earliest Hindu Upanishad. For example, the practice of pranayama (consciously regulating breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 900 BCE), and the practice of pratyahara (concentrating all of one's senses on self) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad (c. 800–700 BCE).|$|E
5|$|The {{first-line}} {{psychiatric treatment}} for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which {{can reduce the}} positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. Antipsychotics, however, fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. In those on antipsychotics, continued use decreases the risk of relapse. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years. However use of anti-psychotics can lead to dopamine hypersensitivity increasing the risk of symptoms if antipsychotics are stopped.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known {{version of}} the poem is the Northumbrian aelda recension. The {{surviving}} witnesses to this text, Cambridge, University Library, Kk. 5. 16 (M) and St. Petersburg, National Library of Russia, lat. Q. v. I. 18 (P), date to at least the mid-8th century. M in particular is traditionally ascribed to Bede's own monastery and lifetime, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> to suggest it was copied much before the mid-8th century.|$|E
50|$|In {{total to}} date, 559 {{patients}} {{have participated in}} clinical trials involving Cloderm, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of local and/or systemic adverse effects.

The orange colour results from abundant carotenes in these cultivars.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> for {{military}} action during Nyuserre's reign; the Egyptian state continued to maintain trade relations with Byblos on the Levantine coast and to send mining and quarrying expeditions to Sinai and Lower Nubia. Nyuserre's reign saw {{the growth of the}} administration, and the effective birth of the nomarchs, provincial governors who, for the first time, were sent to live in the provinces they administered rather than at the pharaoh's court.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of {{occupation}} in the Motul de San José area during the Late Postclassic, from AD 1250 to AD 1697. It {{is possible that}} La Trinidad de Nosotros was Xililchi, a settlement visited by conquistador Martín de Ursúa {{after the fall of}} the Itza capital Noj Petén to the Spanish in 1697, but no Late Postclassic remains have yet been identified by archaeologists.|$|E
50|$|On March 18, 1977 President Ngouabi was assassinated. A {{number of}} people were accused of {{shooting}} Ngouabi were tried {{and some of them}} executed, including former President Alphonse Massemba-Débat, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> to prove their involvement, and the motive behind the assassination remains unclear.|$|R
50|$|By the late-1900s, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of Prescott Junction’s existence.

50|$|In 2012, McPhedran and Baker found <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> for any {{impacts of}} the gun laws on firearm suicide among people under 35 years of age, and suggest that the {{significant}} financial expenditure associated with Australia's firearms method restriction measures {{may not have had}} any impact on youth suicide.|$|R
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{vanadium}} or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens.

The carcinogenicity of vanadium has not been determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth (died 1038) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Descended {{from an earlier}} English king, Æthelnoth became a monk prior to {{becoming}} archbishop. While archbishop, he travelled to Rome and brought back saint's relics. He consecrated {{a number of other}} bishops who came from outside his archdiocese, leading to some friction with other archbishops. Although he was regarded as a saint after his death, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> of his veneration or of a cult in Canterbury or elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General Staff had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> that the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 the Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation {{produced}} a report comparing {{the performance of}} the NHS in the four countries of the UK since devolution in 1999. They included data for the North East of England as an area more similar to the devolved areas than the rest of England. They found that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> that any one country was moving ahead of the others consistently across the available indicators of performance. <b>There</b> had <b>been</b> improvements in all four countries in life expectancy and in rates of mortality amenable to health care. Despite the hotly contested policy differences between the four countries <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence,</b> where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> comparable data, of any significant differences in outcomes. The authors also complained about the increasingly limited set of comparable data on the four health systems of the UK.|$|R

50|$|The Court of Justice {{held that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of an actual}} problem, and a {{justification}} based on preserving Austrian homogeneity was not valid. If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> excessive demand for courses, non-discriminatory measures such as an entry exam or minimum grade would suffice. According to the Court, the problems ‘have been and are suffered by other Member States’.|$|R
