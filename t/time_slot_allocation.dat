The algorithm starts with some arbitrary (e.g., equal) <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> <b>allocation</b> ϕ^l(δ_(t)) and iteratively improves total system utility function in a while loop.

The solution provides current time slot allocations, ϕ^l(δ_(t)), for that particular frame, which also updates the average <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> <b>allocation</b> ϕ^l(δ_(t)) through an exponential moving average (line 7.4).

So optimization schemes for efficient resource usage have been extensively researched. Throughput maximization under the condition of limited total power or power minimization under the condition of minimum bit rate are usually considered objective in many papers.

30|$|An Efficient Dynamic Scheduling Approach (EDSA) is {{suggested}} and compares with Time Division Beacon Scheduling (TDBS) [63]. The comparison of both schemes {{is based on}} the <b>allocation</b> of dynamic <b>slots</b> and assignments of addresses to nodes.

Both <b>slot</b> <b>allocation</b> processes are verified from the table which is maintained under the supervision of a personal area network coordinator (PANC). The advantage of the dynamic algorithm is collision-free processing without delay and achieves a higher data reliability.

40|$|AbstractIn {{digital video}} {{broadcasting}} and return channel via satellite (DVB-RCS) systems, the time slot location assigned to a given traffic in multiple frequency-time division multiple access (MF-TDMA) frame has significant effects upon the traffic delay performance. This article proposes models to analyze the relationships among frame length, bandwidth assignment (assigned time slot count), time slot location in frame, and traffic delay performance for traffics of constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR). From the proposed models, {{it is found that}} the time slot location plays a leading role in affecting the traffic delay performance, which ameliorates more when the time slot location is more uniform in frame. Compared with the traditional mode of consecutive <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> <b>allocation,</b> the mode of uniform <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> <b>allocation</b> can effectually reduce the average delay and jitter, which will not vary with the frame length. Furthermore, with the mode of uniform <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> <b>allocation</b> increasing bandwidth assignment could promote the delay performance more effectually. This article also puts forward a practical time slot uniform allocation method (TUAM), which is based on the DVB-RCS standard and compatible with it. The computer simulation, apart from testifying to the validity of the model, shows that it leads to efficacious reduction of the mean traffic delay and jitter. By adopting the method, the real-time traffic-like voice over IP (VoIP) traffic's packets will not suffer from dropping due to an overlong end-to-end delay, thus improving quality of service (QoS) provision for real-time traffics in DVB-RCS systems...|$|E

The other nodes, that generate non-periodic traffic which is unconstrained from the transmission reliability, participate in the CP without any SI transmission. By the rate of transmission reliability, the ratio between TDMA and CSMA durations (RTC) can be calculated, which is motivated by the guaranteed <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> (GTS) <b>allocation</b> scheme in IEEE 802.15. 4 network [20].|$|R

The first contribution regards the analysis of multi-carrier power allocation algorithms for half duplex time division two-hop relay networks where the power transmitted by each network node is constrained by a PSD mask, rather than a total power constraint. In particular, for the achievable rate maximization problem of ODF, we find the optimal power and <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> <b>allocation.</b> Whatever the time slot duration is, the power allocation that maximizes the DF achievable rate {{is equal to the}} one that satisfies the PSD mask. Consequently, we show that the optimal time slot duration is found by the intersection of two linear functions. For the power minimization problem of ODF, we show that {{it is very hard to}} solve the problem of joint power and <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> <b>allocation.</b> Therefore, to reduce complexity, we propose a simplified algorithm that considers two convex sub-problems.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{multiple}} access control (MAC) protocol for wireless ATM systems, in which user demands are highly heterogeneous {{and can be}} classified as CBR, VBR, and ABR. Our protocol is motivated {{by two of the}} most significant drawbacks of existing protocols: (1) channel condition is ignored or not exploited, and (2) inflexible or biased <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> <b>allocation</b> algorithms are used. Indeed, existing protocols mostly ignore the burst errors due to fading and shadowing, which are inevitable in a mobile and wireless communication environment. A few protocols take into account the burst errors but just `handle' the errors in a passive manner. On the other hand, most of the existing protocols employ an inflexible or biased allocation algorithm such that over-provisioning may occur for a certain class of users {{at the expense of the}} poor service quality received by other users. Our proposed protocol, called SCAMA (synergistic channel adaptive multiple access), does not have these two drawbacks. The proposed protocol works closely with the underlying physical layer in that through observing the channel state information (CSI) of each mobile user, the MAC protocol first segregates a set of users with good CSI from requests gathered in the request contention phase of an uplink frame. The MAC protocol then judiciously allocates information <b>time</b> <b>slots</b> to the users according to their traffic types, CSI, urgency, and throughput, which are collectively represented by a novel and flexible priority function.

30|$|Without the {{insertion}} of the DAS, and N 2 [*]>[*] 1, {{we assume that the}} radio resource management (by the MBS) assigns orthogonal resource blocks for the MUESs because of their direct transmission to the MBS by default. Thus, there is MUE interference avoidance from the MUEs to the MBS. Each femtocell cluster experiences the interference from one or two MUEs. No Feedback and MBS Feedback represent each the conventional system without the DAS. With No Feedback, each femtocell experiences an MUE interference without interference mitigation. MBS Feedback considers a feedback from the MBS; each cluster which experiences an MUE interference can receive a feedback from the MBS for interference cancellation. However, the feedback is subject to the orthogonal resource allocation applied for the MUEs directly transmitting to the MBS. Because of the MUE transmission scheduling (we assume different <b>time</b> <b>slot</b> <b>allocations</b> in the simulations), the sum rate decreases with N 2. DAS 1 and DAS 2 represent our proposed modification of the two-tier network with the DAS insertion. With DAS 1, the MUEs transmit to their respective RAUs. Thus, there is a simultaneous transmission of the MUEs; besides, the DAS can feedback the symbols of each interfering MUE to the femtocells which experience the interference. DAS 2 is similar to DAS 1 except that in DAS 2, the interference cancellation removes all the cross-tier interference.|$|R

A new frame structure is proposed for the considered network. A wireless power transfer (WPT) model and a compressive spectrum sensing model are introduced. In the WPT model, a new WPT scheme is proposed, and the closed-form expressions for the power outage probability are derived. In compressive spectrum sensing model, two scenarios are considered: 1) Single SU, and 2) Multiple SUs. In the single SU scenario, {{in order to reduce}} the energy consumption at the SU, compressive sensing technique which enables sub-Nyquist sampling is utilized. In the multiple SUs scenario, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is performed with adopting low-rank matrix completion technique to obtain the complete matrix at the fusion center.
