5|$|In 1979, Muntz {{decided to}} sell blank tapes and VCRs as loss leaders to attract {{customers}} to his showroom, where he would then <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them his projection TV systems. His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested heavily in the Technicolor Compact Video Cassette (CVC), a 1/4in(0.6cm) system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the Super 8 film home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales quickly eroded, and Muntz's store closed soon after.|$|E
5|$|An extra in the film, Tyler Nelson, {{violated}} his nondisclosure {{agreement in}} an interview with The Edmond Sun on September 17, 2007, which was then picked up by the mainstream media. It is unknown if he remained in the final cut. At Nelson's request, The Edmond Sun subsequently pulled the story from its website. On October 2, 2007, a Superior Court order was filed finding that Nelson knowingly violated the agreement. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A number of production photos and sensitive documents pertaining to the film's production budget were also stolen from Spielberg's production office. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department set up a sting operation after being alerted by a webmaster that the thief might <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the photos. On October 4, 2007, the seller, 37-year-old Roderick Eric Davis, was arrested. He pleaded guilty to two felony counts and was sentenced to two years and four months in prison.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey was {{released}} by Magnavox in September 1972. After initially ordering a production run of 50,000 units, prior to release Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built up a large stock of the systems, as market testing had shown an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers and not through general retailers; Magnavox felt that as the first video game console it would draw consumers into its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased along with a Magnavox television. There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey product manager Bob Fritsche recalls selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalls sales being closer to 100,000. Baer has stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high price—US$100 being the equivalent of US$587 in 2017—and because of Magnavox restricting sales to their dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealership salespeople would try to mislead customers to that effect in order to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> more television sets. Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry has noted that the sales were {{in line with the}} original projections, if not with the production run.|$|E

500|$|During the Civil War, Cooke & Company sold {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars in Union government bonds. [...] Its reputation among investors around the world enabled the bank to sell these bonds when other brokerages could not. [...] Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase asked Cooke to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the government's new $500million issue of 5-20 bonds. [...] These paid six percent interest (in gold) and matured in 20 years, but were callable in five years. [...] Cooke used numerous agents from a variety of professions—small bankers, insurance agents, and real estate professionals—to sell these bonds to support the Union war effort. Cooke & Company's innovative use of the telegraph to confirm sales allowed selling throughout the country to be coordinated in Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|There {{are other}} {{dimensions}} to the lyrics, with Gaga playing off her image of self-promotion and criticisms directed {{at her with}} the line [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> myself, but I am really laughing because I just want the music not the bling". In a review for Artpop, Simon Chandler from Tiny Mix Tapes gave {{a detailed analysis of}} the lyrical composition. According to him, Gaga wanted to portray her music as boundless in its meaning with [...] "Artpop", but it appeared to be arrogant since most of the conclusions derived about her music is from her public persona created and its media coverage. Chandler believed that the lyrics wanted to drive home a point about Gaga being the center for any discussion. With the previous lyrics, the implication is that Gaga's impassive personality utilizes her music to sell her brand name to the general crowd, and primarily fuels the public interest in her.|$|E

500|$|Van Gogh {{returned}} to Etten in April 1881 {{for an extended}} stay with his parents. He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Cornelia [...] "Kee" [...] Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother's older sister Willemina and Johannes Stricker, arrived for a visit. He was thrilled and took long walks with her. Kee was seven years older than he was, and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage. She refused with the words [...] "No, nay, never" [...] ("nooit, neen, nimmer"). After Kee {{returned to}} Amsterdam, Van Gogh went to The Hague to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> paintings and to meet with his second cousin, Anton Mauve. Mauve was the successful artist Van Gogh longed to be. Mauve invited him to return in a few months, and suggested he spend the intervening time working in charcoal and pastels; Van Gogh went back to Etten and followed this advice.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the industry newsletter [...] "The Jack Myers Report" [...] harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. [...] Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, [...] "In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll". [...] A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented, [...] "I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have to wonder about the people who voiced those protests." [...] He added, [...] "It was a stupid SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER. If you're offended by that, how do you get through the day without succumbing to fits of hysterical outrage every five minutes?" ...|$|E
500|$|By then {{deeply in}} debt from the {{publication}} of The Anvil and the production costs of the dummy, Morris formed Anvil Productions Ltd. [...] Its prospectus declared [...] "The Company proposes to publish a new children's coloured 'comic' paper, which will be of a much higher and more mature quality than anything published in England and in appearance and format will be modelled more on the American comic papers which are so far in advance of our own." [...] Initially he sought to keep the project under his control, but his escalating debts forced him to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the idea. [...] To that end, he made several trips to London, where—armed with the dummy—he pitched his idea to several Fleet Street publishers. [...] He met John Myers at Hulton Press, who referred him to Montague Haydon at Amalgamated Press. [...] He then met Neville Pearson at George Newnes, Ltd., whose executives claimed that the publication was [...] "not an economic proposition". The US comics reprinter Boardmans was next, followed by Mike Wardell of the Sporting Record. [...] Neither The Times nor The Daily Telegraph were interested, and at The Sunday Times the personal assistant to Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley, presumed that Morris was asking for a charitable donation. In autumn 1949 however, Hulton Press contacted Morris with the instruction [...] "definitely interested do not approach any other publisher".|$|E

500|$|Dwyane Wade {{was born}} on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's unusual {{spelling}} was decided by his own mother. In 1977, JoLinda, {{at the age of}} 18, already had two children. Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that [...] " [...] mom was on drugs and [...] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood." [...] At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated – and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said [...] "I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've seen my mother shoot up before. I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." [...] At the age of 6, he recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him – by telling him they were going to the movies – into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois. After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.|$|E
