40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to morpho-anatomically characterize nodular embryogenic calluses from zygotic embryos of peach palm during the induction of somatic embryogenesis. Immature zygotic embryos were pre-treated in MS medium added to Picloram and 2, 4 -D (25 µM) and BAP (0, 5, 10 µM). After three months, primary calluses were transferred to MS induction medium added to Picloram and 2, 4 -D (450 µM). After six months, the embryogenic calluses were then histologically analyzed and cultivated in the maturation medium. The competent tissues of the zygotic embryos differentiated embryogenic calluses under action of both Picloram and 2, 4 -D auxins (450 µM), where the presence of multi-granular structures were observed. Histological observations showed that in the nodular embryogenic calluses, the outlying parenchymal cells exhibit cellular characteristics of high mitotic activity. Differentiation of <b>tracheal</b> <b>elements</b> exists in embryogenic calluses connecting the callus to the explant. The evaluated cytokinin/auxin interaction influences the development of embryogenic calluses and globular structures.

40|$|Plants of {{the orange}} Piralima Citrus sinensis, Osbeck develop {{symptoms}} of an anomaly in certain branches that distinguish them {{from the rest of}} the plant. Among the various hypotheses raised to explain the cause of this disease is that of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, carrier of the Ti plasmid. Examinations were performed under an optical microscope of the tumors tissue structure that occurs in citrus branches compared with the tumors caused by the Ti plasmid in Kalanchoe tubiflora. The tumors produced in K. tubiflora, caused by different isolates of A. tumefaciens containing the Ti plasmid, revealed the same cell disorganization between the epidermis and the cambial region as the tumors produced in citrus. In the region closer to the cambium, in addition to the disorganization it was observed that the <b>tracheal</b> <b>elements</b> presented greater affinity to safranine. Both in K. tubiflora and in Piralima plants, the increase in the tumor volume resulted in hyperplasia caused by the abnormal activity of the vascular cambium.

40|$|Transport of 3 -indoleacetic acid (IAA) in Coleus {{cuttings}} is only {{towards the}} base (indicated by root formation). The physical basis of Went's theory (1932) on IAA anion attraction by a positive pool and repulsion by a negative pool, {{was shown to}} be incorrect. Yet potential difference (PD) could be responsible for polar transport. PD-measurements showed that with both normal and inverted cuttings the upper end was always more negative than the lower (held) end. As also no apical transport of basally applied IAA took place in inverted cuttings, PD was {{not the cause of}} polar transport. But in inverted cuttings with apically applied IAA upward basal transport took place, against the assumption of electrical transport. Before root formation, the PD was equal in normal and inverted cuttings, independent of IAA application. After root formation, however, the cuttings with and without IAA all showed a marked PD. An electrical field did not influence IAA transport but weak electric currents induced apical root formation in normal cuttings with apically applied IAA, so that IAA is probably retained. 0, 01 μg IAA only induced root formation, larger doses also cambial activity, formation of callus, <b>tracheal</b> <b>elements</b> and sclerenchyma bundles (otherwise occurring at older age),<p/...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{wealth of}} {{clinical}} observation {{has suggested that}} stress and asthma morbidity are associated. We have previously established a mouse model of stress-exacerbated allergic airway inflammation, which reflects major clinical findings. Objective: The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate the role of the neurokinin- (NK-) 1 receptor in the mediation of stress effects in allergic airway inflammation. Methods: BALB/c mice were systemically sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) on assay days 1, 14, and 21 and repeatedly challenged with OVA aerosol on days 26 and 27. Sound stress was applied to the animals for 24 hours, starting with the first airway challenge. Additionally, one group of stressed and one group of nonstressed mice received the highly specific NK- 1 receptor antagonist RP 67580. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained, and cell numbers and differentiation were determined. Airway hyperreactivity was measured in vitro by electrical field stimulation of <b>tracheal</b> smooth-muscle <b>elements.</b> Results: Application of stress in sensitized and challenged animals resulted in a significant increase in leukocyte number in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Furthermore, stressed animals showed enhanced airway reactivity. The increase of inflammatory cells and airway reactivity was blocked by treatment of animals with the NK- 1 receptor antagonist. Conclusion: These data indicate that the NK- 1 receptor {{plays an important role in}} mediating stress effects in allergen-induced airway inflammation.

40|$|Objective: Despite {{the long-standing}} {{clinical}} assumption that stress and asthma morbidity are associated, convincing experimental evidence on mechanisms has been unavailable. A {{wide range of}} immunological, endocrinological, and neuronal pathways are known to mediate and modulate a systemic stress response. Interestingly, most of these mediators {{play a crucial role}} in initiating and perpetuating symptoms associated with bronchial asthma. To explore potential mechanisms linking stress to asthma exacer-bation we developed an animal model that combines allergic airway inflammation and exposure to stress. Methods: CBA/J mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) and challenged with OVA aerosol via the airways. Additionally, some mice were stressed by exposure to an ultrasonic stressor. Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was measured in vitro by electric field stimulation (EFS) of <b>tracheal</b> smooth muscle <b>elements.</b> Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) was obtained and cell numbers determined. Cytokine levels of IL- 4, IL- 5, and IFN- in BAL were determined by ELISA. Results: Our findings demonstrate that exogenously applied stress dramatically enhances airway reactivity in OVA-sensitized and challenged mice. Further, stress significantly increases allergen-induced airway inflammation identified by increased leukocyte (ie, eosinophil) numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Conclusions: We found further evidence that stress can indeed exacerbate airway hyperreactivity and airway inflammation in an animal model of allergic bronchial asthma and now introduce a novel murine model to identify stress-triggered pathways, including mediators as neurohormones, neuropeptides, and markers of inflammation.

40|$|Pilostyles species (Apodanthaceae) are endoparasites in {{stems of}} the plant family Fabaceae. The body {{comprises}} masses of parenchyma in the host bark and cortex, with sinkers, comprising groups of twisted <b>tracheal</b> <b>elements</b> surrounded by parenchyma that enter the secondary xylem of the host plant. Here we report {{for the first time}} the effects of Pilostyles parasitism on host secondary xylem. We obtained healthy and parasitized stems from Mimosa foliolosa, M. maguirei and M. setosa and compared vessel element length, fiber length, vessel diameter and vessel frequency, measured through digital imaging. Also, tree height and girth were compared between healthy and parasitized M. setosa. When parasitized, plant size, vessel diameter, vessel element length and fiber length are all less than in healthy plants. Also, vessel frequency is greater and vessels are narrower in parasitized stems. These responses to parasitism are similar to those observed in stressed plants. Thus, hosts respond to the parasite by changing its wood micromorphology in favour of increased hydraulic safety.

40|$|This study {{performed}} the ultrastructural {{description of the}} synganglion of Rhipicephalus sanguineus males and females, aiming {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the cellular organization of this organ. The results show that the central nervous system of these individuals consists of a mass of fused nerves, named synganglion, from where nerves emerge towards several parts of the body. It is surrounded by the neural lamella, a uniform and acellular layer, constituted by repeated layers of homogeneous and finely granular material. The perineurium is just below, composed of glial cells, which extensions invaginate throughout the nervous tissue. The synganglion is internally divided into an outer cortex, which contains the cellular bodies of the neural cells and an inner neuropile. The neural cells can be classified into two types according to cell size, cytoplasm-nucleus relation, and neurosecretory activity. Type I cells are oval or spherical and present a large nucleus occupying most part of the cytoplasm, which contains few organelles. Type 2 cells are polygonal, present a great cytoplasm volume, and their nuclei are located in the cell periphery. The cytoplasm of these cells contains a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi regions, mitochondria, and several neurosecretory granules. The subperineurium and the tracheal ramifications are found between the cortex and the neuropile. The latter is formed mainly by neural fibers, <b>tracheal</b> <b>elements,</b> and glial cells. The results obtained show that R. sanguineus males' and females' nervous tissue present an ultrastructural organization similar to the one described in the literature for other tick species.
