The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines.

25|$|According to Ancestry.com's {{research}} in 2012, {{using a combination}} of historical documents and yDNA analysis, genealogists found that John Punch, the first documented African slave in the American British colonies, has been documented as likely an eleventh great-grandfather of Obama through his mother, Ann Dunham, and her Bunch ancestors. With intermarriage, there were eventually both white and African-American lines of descent from Punch; some Bunch descendants were classified as white by the early 18th century. Other Bunch descendants were considered free people of color.

25|$|The women's rights {{movements}} in these nations {{want to make}} monogamy the only legal form of marriage. The United Nations joined these efforts in 1979 when the General Assembly adopted the , an international bill of rights for women that over 180 nations have agreed to implement. Article 16 of the Convention requires nations to give women and men equal rights in marriage. Polygamy is interpreted as inconsistent with Article 16 when it extends the right of multiple spouses to men but not to women. The United Nations has established the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) to monitor the progress of nations implementing the Convention. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>is</b> thus working through the Convention and CEDAW to promote women's equality by making monogamy the only legal form of marriage worldwide.|$|E
