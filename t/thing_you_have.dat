500|$|On June 14 and 22, 2005, Deep Impact {{observed}} two {{outbursts of}} activity from the comet, {{the latter being}} six {{times larger than the}} former. The spacecraft studied the images of various distant stars to determine its current trajectory and position. Don Yeomans, a mission co-investigator for JPL pointed out that [...] "it takes 7½ minutes for the signal to get back to Earth, so you cannot joystick this <b>thing.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to rely {{on the fact that the}} Impactor is a smart spacecraft as is the Flyby spacecraft. So you have to build in the intelligence ahead of time and let it do its thing." [...] On June 23, 2005, the first of the two final trajectory correct maneuvers (targeting maneuver) was successfully executed. A 6m/s (20ft/s) velocity change was needed to adjust the flight path towards the comet and target the impactor at a window in space about [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{credited}} {{the series}} for its bold premise {{and noted that}} the show provided some insight into eating disorders while offering [...] "a few flashes of clever dialogue and satire." [...] Ultimately, however, the Times found that [...] "Starved relies too heavily on sight gags and gross-out farce." [...] The Los Angeles Times found the show [...] "vexing" [...] for being [...] "at once assured and shallow, accomplished and unconvincing, well-acted and empty." [...] The review singles out Schaeffer's character Sam as [...] "especially unappealing" [...] and points to Schaeffer's roles as creator, producer, writer and director as [...] "an object lesson in the wisdom {{of a system of}} checks and balances." [...] Perhaps most damningly, in noting Schaeffer's experiences with addiction, the reviewer writes that [...] "just because you’ve had an experience doesn’t mean you have anything interesting to say about it or are able to articulate whatever interesting <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to say." ...|$|E

500|$|Many sources {{claim that}} the 42-reel version was only ever {{intended}} to be a rough cut, and that Von Stroheim chose to cut it down to 24 reels by March 18, 1924, with the intention of screening it with intermissions over two nights. The director had difficulty cutting the film down, telling his friend Don Ryan, [...] "I could take out sequences and thus get the job over in a day. That would be child's play. But I can't do it. It would leave gaps that could only be bridged through titles. When you do such a <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> illustrated subtitles instead of a motion picture." [...] Von Stroheim later claimed that at this time the Goldwyn Company wanted him to shoot a scene of McTeague waking up in his dentist chair, showing the entire film to have been a bad dream. While von Stroheim was editing the 24-reel cut June Mathis, who {{was the head of the}} Goldwyn Story Department, had made her own 13-reel version of Greed by January 21, 1924. She ordered even more cuts to be made on January 29, but then left for Rome in early February to oversee the production of Ben-Hur and was uninvolved in the film's editing for several months.|$|E
500|$|Since its {{original}} airing, critics have listed [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] {{among the best}} X-Files episodes. TV Guide called it the tenth greatest episode in television history. Review website IGN named it the best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series, writing that the episode [...] " [...] is a distinctive episode of the series, mixing a healthy amount of humor [...] with some very nasty business [...] In just 44 minutes, Boyle creates a fully formed character who makes a big impact in his one and only appearance." [...] Topless Robot named it the ninth-funniest episode of the series. Starpulse listed it as the third-best X-Files episode. Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it {{on the list of}} [...] "10 TV Episodes that Changed Television". Tom Kessenich, in Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, named the episode the seventh-best installment of the series, noting that it features [...] "a wonderful blend of humor, drama, and pathos, something The X-Files did better than just about any other show this past decade." [...] The cast and crew of the series have expressed their enjoyment of the installment. Duchovny considers [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] to be one of his favorite episodes of the third season. Nutter highlighted it {{as one of the most}} enjoyable entries that he had worked on. He also noted that, [...] "the writing was so tight and so crisp and so fresh that I think, as a director, the only <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do is create the atmosphere, set up the characters, set up the shots and you are basically invisible. Then you step back and just let it happen." [...] Series writer and producer Frank Spotnitz stated that the episode worked on many levels and that it is his favorite of the episodes written for the show by Morgan. In 2016, Ira Madison of Vulture.com named it the best episode of the series and [...] "one of the best episodes of television ever", stating that the episode [...] "takes every element that made the series so iconic and throws them all into one heartbreaking installment".|$|E

2500|$|From his {{experiences}} in the Russo-Japanese War, Troubridge was aware that modern naval ordnance could devastate his squadron and that the Goebens 11-inch guns considerably outranged his own, which consisted of 9.2-inch and 7.5-inch guns. A night attack on the German force using the cruiser [...] failed when the British ship failed to make contact, so Troubridge attempted to catch the Germans in narrow waters to reduce the range. Troubridge was still unaware of German intentions, and feared they might double-back to the north east and effect a junction with the Austro-Hungarian fleet. Troubridge resolved to intercept the German squadron and headed southwards to do so, but his flag captain, Fawcet Wray, argued against seeking battle. Troubridge was reluctant to do so anyway, knowing that his ships would be both outranged and attacking in daylight, but felt {{it was the only}} honourable option. Wray argued that it would be suicide for the squadron to fight the bigger and longer-ranging guns of the Goeben and as Wray had a particular reputation in the fleet as an expert on gunnery, Troubridge allowed himself to be persuaded. In tears, Troubridge ordered the chase to be abandoned, a decision that caused Wray to say 'Sir, this is the bravest <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> ever done.' Troubridge's signal was transmitted shortly afterwards: 4.49am, 7/8/14, to Milne:Being only able to meet Goeben outside the range of our guns and inside his, I have abandoned the chase with my squadron. Goeben evidently going to the Eastern Mediterranean. The chase abandoned, the Germans made it to Constantinople, and the ships were almost immediately turned over the Turkish Navy.|$|E
