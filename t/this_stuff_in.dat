6000|$|He took it {{back with}} him {{and began to read}} again those {{familiar}} controversial pages. He read for the best part of an hour with his knees drying until they smoked over the gas. What curious stuff it was! How it wrangled! Was Chasters a religious man? Why did he write these books? Had he really a passion for truth or only a Swift-like hatred of weakly-thinking people? None of <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> his books was really wrong, provided it was religious-spirited. Much of it had been indeed destructively illuminating to its reader. It let daylight through all sorts of walls. Indeed, the more one read the more vividly true its acid-bit lines became.... And yet, and yet, there was something hateful in the man's tone. Scrope held the book and thought. He had seen Chasters once or twice. Chasters had the sort of face, the sort of voice, the sort of bearing that made one think of his possibly saying upon occasion, rudely and rejoicing, [...] "More fool you!" [...] Nevertheless Scrope perceived now with an effort of discovery that it was from Chasters that he had taken all the leading ideas of the new faith that was in him. Here was the stuff of it. He had forgotten how much of it was here. During those months of worried study while the threat of a Chasters prosecution hung over him his mind had assimilated almost unknowingly every assimilable element of the Chasters doctrine; he had either assimilated and transmuted it by the alchemy of his own temperament, or he had reacted obviously and filled in Chasters' gaps and pauses. Chasters could beat a road to the Holy of Holies, and shy at entering it. But {{in spite of all the}} man's roughness, in spite of a curious flavour of baseness and malice about him, the spirit of truth had spoken through him. God has a use for harsh ministers. In one man God lights the heart, in another the reason becomes a consuming fire. God takes his own where he finds it. He does not limit himself to nice people. In these matters of evidence and argument, in his contempt for amiable, demoralizing compromise, Chasters served God as Scrope could never hope to serve him. Scrope's new faith had perhaps been altogether impossible if the Chasters controversy had not ploughed his mind.|$|E

6000|$|It must be {{repeated}} that the American tradition {{is really the}} tradition of one particular ingredient in this great admixture and stirring up of peoples. This ingredient is the Colonial British, whose seventeenth century Puritanism and eighteenth century mercantile radicalism and rationalism manifestly furnished all the stuff out of which the American tradition is made. It is <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> planted <b>in</b> virgin soil and inflated to an immense and buoyant optimism by colossal and unanticipated material prosperity and success. From that British middle-class tradition comes the individualist protestant spirit, the keen self-reliance and personal responsibility, the irresponsible expenditure, the indiscipline and mystical faith in things being managed properly if they are only let alone. [...] "State-blindness" [...] is the natural and almost inevitable quality of a middle-class tradition, a class that has been forced neither to rule nor obey, which has been concentrated and successfully concentrated on private gain.|$|R

And now I'm taking it as a WayForward guy and it sort of developed all together." [...] He did not change the original compositions very much, giving each piece his take on it and made the pieces more orchestral. The game allows players to toggle between the new soundtrack and the original 8-bit soundtrack after clearing the game once, which includes 8-bit renditions of the newly added compositions. Director Austin Ivansmith added about the sound design, [...] "You can't just make it sound like foley from a movie. There are iconic sounds for jumping and landing and hitting an enemy, that they need a certain punch. Our sound designers just know how to make a perfect gameplay sound, and it just adds to the game significantly. Without it, the game just feels empty." [...] He also revealed that there were no initial plans to include voice acting, but Disney stated a few months into development that some of the original voice actors could be enlisted. As such, the team expanded the script to accommodate the addition.|$|E

One {{of the great things}} about Can... was the attention to detail and realization that the effect of each tiny moment in the course of a song can affect the momentum of the entire piece. No small miracles here: even if it's sad to think these albums represent Can's last great gasp, none of their moments have ever sounded better". [...] In his review for Allmusic, American music journalist Ned Raggett stated that [...] "With Suzuki departed, vocal responsibilities were now split between Karoli and Schmidt. Wisely, neither try to clone Mooney or Suzuki, instead aiming for their own low-key way around things", giving the album a rating of four stars out of five. Robert Christgau was less impressed in The Village Voice, comparing its [...] "singularly European" [...] music to a less interesting, less biting variation on Miles Davis' 1970s electric period: [...] "It's never pompous, discernibly smart, playful, even goofy. If you give it your all you can make out a few shards of internal logic. But the light tone avoids texture, density, or pain. The jazzy pulse is innocent of swing, funk, or sex.". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Douglas Wolk said the album was [...] "mellow and almost timid in places", with the exception of [...] "Chain Reaction", deeming the song a precursor to 1990s techno.|$|E
5000|$|Stevenson {{also joined}} Black Flag in early 1983, {{intending}} {{to be in}} both bands simultaneously. [...] "I'm the Descendents' drummer", {{he said at the}} time. [...] "I'm permanently in both bands. Other than that, I'm a nice person." [...] He spent most of January-May 1983 on the road with Black Flag, touring the United States and Europe. With this experience, he desired to take the Descendents on tour as well: [...] "I got a taste of touring in Black Flag," [...] he later recalled, [...] "and I wanted to take that and spread it laterally to what the Descendents would or could do." [...] However, he encountered resistance from Navetta and Lombardo: [...] "Bill kind of sat down with me and Frank and said something to the effect of we were at a point where we needed to grow by going on the road", Lombardo later said. [...] "Frank said no, and I had to say no also, so he said he had to leave the band and we were both kind of bummed out. I don’t think Frank even believed him at first. That was a bad scenario." [...] Stevenson soon found Black Flag's touring and recording schedule too busy to allow time for the Descendents. [...] "I got in over my head", Stevenson later said. [...] "When I joined Black Flag I had every intention of doing both bands but it was physically impossible. Flag had all <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> progress, so I put Descendents on hold." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with his official fan club [...] "Where's Eric!", Eric Clapton remembered how the song came about: [...] "Warner Bros. wanted another 'Layla'. I thought, well, if {{you sit down and}} write a song in a formatted way, it's not so hard. You think, 'What was 'Layla' ? A fiery intro modulated into the first verse and chorus with a riff around it. I had <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>in</b> my head, so I just juggled it around, and Mick Jones (of the group Foreigner) came in to help tidy up. He was the one who said 'You should put a 'Badge' middle in there'. So, we did that. Although it sounds like a cold way of doing it, it actually took on its own life". The song is about a man, who broke up several relationships and is now with the woman of his dreams. Although he is very happy and in love, the protagonist feels sad for all the people, who are not as happy as him, because he understands how it feels to be without happiness and love. The second verse explains, that the person felt unhappy with his life for a long amount of time and recalls many [...] "heartaches". Finally, though, he is happy with his life and wants to be with the person he now met. The chorus expresses the person's need to forget about his old affaires, which have felt to him like [...] "Bad Love". The song consists of two verses and one chorus which is sung between the two verses and three times after the second verse ended. The chorus and instrumental solo sections are written in a key of D minor. The verses are played and sung in the key of B minor. Because of the song's lyrics and powerful chord progression, it is widely recognised as [...] "the perfect break-up song".|$|E

I’ve had several occasions to recall this conversation, most recently with regard to my life as a mathematical researcher at a small, student oriented-institution with a large teaching load. Don’t get me wrong. I love mathe-matics teaching, and I believe that it is extremely important.
