Institutions assign “roles” {{to be performed}} by various actors, through typification of performances, such as “father-role”, “teacher-role”, “hunter”, “cook”, etc. As specialization increases in number {{as well as in}} size and sophistication, a civilization's culture contains more and more sections of knowledge specific to given roles or <b>tasks,</b> <b>sections</b> which become more and more esoteric to non-specialists. These areas of knowledge do not belong anymore to the common social world and culture.“A society’s stock of knowledge is structured in terms of what is generally relevant and what is relevant only to specific roles… the social distribution of knowledge entails a dichotomization in terms of general and role-specific relevance… because of the division of labor, role-specific knowledge will grow at a faster rate than generally relevant and accessible knowledge… The increasing number and complexity of resulting sub universes specialized knowledge make them increasingly inaccessible to outsiders (p.77-87) ...|$|E

30|$|To {{reinforce}} the declarative, procedural and conceptual knowledge (Bagley 1990), example problems {{were followed by}} two more practice problems. Declarative knowledge relates to the description of things, events or processes and their associated relationships; procedural knowledge relates to knowing how to perform the necessary tasks; conceptual knowledge requires {{an understanding of the}} explicit/implicit principles involved. The learning <b>task</b> <b>section</b> was presented as an interrogatory learning format (McKay 2000 a p. 164). Suggested solutions were given for the first practice problem (McKay 2000 a p. 172). However, in the second practice problem, the final task of writing a complete solution algorithm was left blank for the participant to finish; hence “leaving gaps in this manner provides learners with an opportunity to practise their declarative knowledge” (McKay 2000 a p. 171). By working through the problem examples, participants could check their procedural and conceptual knowledge against the suggested solutions. This technique was known as a coaching technique, which pointed out key issues relating the problem to the definition, best examples, and non-examples, according to Bagley (1990).|$|R
40|$|Every soldier must {{understand}} the law of war and its I significance. Both commanders and members of their command must secure this knowledge through forrpal instruction and field training exercises. This text provides supplemental and follow-up instructional material on the Hague Convention No. IV and the Geneva Convention of 1949 (see AR 350 - 216 and ASUBJSCH 27 - 1). These materials serve three purposes. First, they help the training manager to present a clearer explanation {{of the law of}} war. Second, they help to insure that an area of essential knowledge for the individual soldier has been thoroughly addressed. And, finally, they help the commander insure that members of his command have a basic knowledge of the law of war and its significance. The guide is divided into three sections. Section I discusses the training requirements ofAR 350 - 216 and gives general guidance on the use ofthe case studies in section II.

Given the importance of vocabulary in this type of language teaching, the article focuses on certain lexical and semantic aspects of business correspondence such as wordformation, synonymy, antonymy, collocations, part-whole relations, translation equivalence, and register differences. The analyses show that the authors of the materials covered these aspects well (albeit in different ways and to different extents in individual textbooks) despite the fact that in most cases the textbooks were written before the CEFRL was published or was known. In addition, two categories not present in the Framework but characteristic of business language were also recognized as important by the authors of the textbooks and presented in the <b>task</b> <b>sections.</b> These are some frequently used abbreviations and definitions (or their approximations considering the communicative language competence acquired) that learners can use to fill lexical gaps...|$|R
