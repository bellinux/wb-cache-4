5|$|A typhoon watch {{was issued}} for Rota, Tinian, and Saipan on December 14, which was {{upgraded}} to a typhoon warning the next day. Because Paka was intensifying while passing to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> Rota, the first wind, or northeast through east winds, was less severe than the second {{wind from the}} southeast. Sustained winds on the island reached 145km/h (90mph), with gusts reaching 185km/h (115mph). Many trees in the mountainous portion of the island were left defoliated, which limited nesting and foraging sites for the endangered bridled white-eye bird. While passing to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> the island, Paka dropped 250–300mm (10–12in) of rain. Damage on the island totaled $4.4million (1997USD, $6.4million 2015USD). The typhoon also produced above-normal precipitation on Saipan.|$|E

5|$|After their retreat, {{the native}} Theban kings found {{themselves}} trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling {{the north and}} the Hyksos' Nubian allies, the Kushites, to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> Egypt. After years of vassalage, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555BC. The pharaohs Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> Egypt, but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamose's successor, Ahmose I, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty. In the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypt's borders and attempting to gain mastery of the Near East.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>of</b> the territory, and the north of present-day Namibia, lay the Kwanyama kingdom, along with minor realms on the central highlands. All these political units were a reflection of ethnic cleavages that slowly developed among the Bantu populations, and were instrumental in consolidating these cleavages and fostering {{the emergence of new}} and distinct social identities.|$|E
