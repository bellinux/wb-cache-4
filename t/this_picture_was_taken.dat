5|$|The {{front of}} the single's US picture sleeve {{consisted}} of a photo of Harrison playing guitar inside the central tower of his recently purchased home, Friar Park, in Henley-on-Thames. The tower's sole, octagonal-shaped room was an area that Harrison had adopted as his personal temple and meditation space. <b>This</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> by photographer Barry Feinstein, whose Camouflage Productions partner, Tom Wilkes, originally used {{it as part of}} an elaborate poster intended as an insert in the album package. The poster featured a painting of the Hindu deity Krishna watching a group of naked maidens beside a bathing pond. Harrison apparently felt uncomfortable with the symbolism in Wilkes's design – the Friar Park tower image filled {{the top half of the}} poster, floating among clouds above the Krishna scene – so Wilkes abandoned the concept and instead used a darkened photo of Harrison inside the house as the album poster. The more common picture sleeve internationally was a close-up of Feinstein's All Things Must Pass front-cover image, taken on the main lawn of Friar Park. In Denmark, the sleeve featured four shots of Harrison, again with guitar, taken on stage during the Delaney & Bonnie tour.|$|E
25|$|When <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken,</b> {{almost every}} {{building}} immediately around St Paul's had burned down, with the cathedral surviving in a wasteland of destruction. Its survival was mainly {{due to the}} efforts of a special group of firewatchers who were urged by prime minister Winston Churchill to protect the cathedral. Twenty-nine incendiaries fell on and around the cathedral, with one burning through the lead dome and threatening to fall into the dome's wooden support beams. Members of the volunteer St Paul's Watch would have had to climb through the rafters to have any chance of putting it out, but the bomb fell outwards from the roof onto the Stone Gallery, where it was quickly extinguished.|$|E

60|$|But the {{one that}} {{attracted}} my attention the most was a photograph of an obstacle-race, in which the runners had to mount and climb over a wagon placed obtrusively sideways across the course on purpose to baffle them. <b>This</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> from a few yards in the rear; and the athletes were seen in it in the most varied attitudes. Some of them were just climbing up {{one side of the}} wagon: others had mounted to the top ledge of the body: and one, standing on the further edge, was in the very act of leaping down to {{the ground in front of}} him. He was bent double, to spring, with a stoop like a hunchback, and balanced himself with one hand held tightly behind him.|$|E

Mr. Crewe in kilts at five; and (prophetic picture!) with a train of cars which--so the family tradition runs--was afterwards demolished; Mr. Crewe at fourteen, in delicate health; <b>this</b> <b>picture</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> abroad, with a long-suffering tutor who could speak feelingly, if he would, of embryo geniuses. Even at this early period Humphrey Crewe's thirst for knowledge was insatiable: he cared little, the biography tells us, for galleries and churches and ruins, but his comments upon foreign methods of doing business were astonishingly precocious. He recommended to amazed clerks in provincial banks the use of cheques, ridiculed to speechless station-masters the side-entrance railway carriage with its want of room, {{and the size of the}} goods trucks. He is said to have been the first to suggest that soda-water fountains might be run at a large profit in London.|$|E
