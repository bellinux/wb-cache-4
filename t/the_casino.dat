However, due to its high stakes and formal dress code, only nobles could afford to play at <b>the</b> <b>casino's</b> tables; one such discriminating injunction, for instance, was that players had to wear three-cornered hats and masks in order to participate in Il Ridotto's games; less affluent Venetians were thereby prohibited from making wagers at <b>the</b> <b>casino's</b> tables.|$|R

5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Dawson {{had decided}} that the two French troops should take the lead into Ouistreham, {{followed}} by the six British troops. The French were unopposed apart from some mortar rounds and machine gun fire as they neared their objective. No. 8 French Troop occupied houses at the front and sides of <b>the</b> <b>Casino</b> strong point. An assault to capture <b>the</b> <b>Casino</b> was driven back. While {{this was going on}} the other French troop, No. 1, approached <b>the</b> <b>Casino</b> from the rear. Taking up firing positions they too started to engage the strong point but their fire had almost no effect. The French commander Capitaine de frégate Philippe Kieffer was just about to order an all out assault by both troops, when reports that British amphibious tanks were in Ouistreham reached him. Sending a guide to bring one forward, the tank arrived in front of <b>the</b> <b>Casino</b> and proceeded to destroy the German gun emplacements. Within 30 minutes of the tanks' arrival, all the strong point guns were silenced and No. 1Troop had assaulted and captured the objective. With its capture the French Commandos were now in control of the western suburbs of Ouistreham.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the tournament}} is {{restricted}} to casino employees, {{most of the big}} name poker professionals and previous bracelet winners are not allowed to participate. Therefore, even though <b>the</b> <b>Casino</b> Employee Championship is a World Series of Poker bracelet event, it has typically received relatively little coverage. Despite this perception, <b>the</b> <b>Casino</b> Employee Championship event does involve numerous recognized names in the poker world. The 2009 tournament included two time bracelet winner Pat Poels, WSOP vice president Ty Stewart, Bellagio Tournament Director/Former WSOP Director Jack McClelland, and Woman Poker Hall of Famer Marsha Waggoner.|$|E

5|$|Casinos {{and race}} tracks were closed because {{official}} monitors from <b>the</b> New Jersey <b>Casino</b> Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission, respectively, {{were categorized as}} non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight. Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later. <b>The</b> <b>casinos</b> attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing <b>the</b> <b>casinos</b> were not paid by the state but by <b>the</b> <b>casinos</b> themselves, but <b>the</b> appeal was rejected at the New Jersey Supreme Court; therefore {{they were forced to}} close.|$|R

5|$|Casinos, {{and vendors}} serving, selling or storing {{alcoholic}} beverages for a casino, {{are required to}} obtain a casino hotel alcoholic beverage (CHAB) license from the Division of Gaming Enforcement. CHAB licenses must be renewed every five years. New Jersey's casino alcohol regulations are divided into five different regions of activity: (a) <b>the</b> <b>casino</b> floor (includes simulcasting facilities); (b) the hotel (includes restaurants and meeting rooms); (c) package goods; (d) room service; and (e) storage. Alcohol sold or given away on <b>the</b> <b>casino</b> floor and in hotel areas must be in an open container for immediate consumption, whereas alcohol sold in a package goods area must be sealed. Alcoholic beverages brought to a patron as a room service may be open or closed, whereas storage areas must not be accessible to the public.|$|E
5|$|Charles III {{was also}} {{responsible}} for another palace in Monte Carlo, one which would fund his restorations, and turn around his country's faltering economy.

Through <b>the</b> <b>casino</b> Monaco became self-supporting.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>casino</b> {{shutdown}}, 36,000 casino {{workers were}} given leave. The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost {{revenue for the}} state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day due to {{the closure of the}} lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted to just {{a small fraction of the}} state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 million per day during the shutdown. Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that <b>the</b> <b>casino</b> industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2003, {{the tournament}} format was a Limit Hold'em tournament, but in 2004, No-Limit Hold'em became the standard.

Since its inception, with the {{exception}} of 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Casino</b> Employees event has started {{on the first day of}} the WSOP. Much of the drama encountered at <b>the</b> <b>Casino</b> Championship often involves informal rivaliries between dealers and proposition players. Proposition players are people hired to play poker, with their own money, at casinos to get games started or to ensure that they do not die out. Thus, while both the prop and dealer are casino employees, they sit on opposite sides of the table.|$|E
