25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, and ought to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, I care for nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.|$|E

Specifically, they proved, {{by examining the}} decay of K-mesons, that a reaction run in reverse does not retrace {{the path of the}} original reaction, which showed that the reactions of subatomic particles are not indifferent to time. Thus the phenomenon of CP violation was discovered. This demolished <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> physicists had that natural laws were governed by symmetry.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, [...] "I say {{my prayers}} {{for you and}} when I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you're {{at the head of}} the list." [...] Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others [...] "through the mercies of God". Many of the {{elements}} of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, [...] "This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible." [...] Jewett compares Mac's story to that of Abraham, because [...] "just like Sledge's story, [...] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God". As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> God will provide them an heir, which is exactly what occurs, though—as Paul describes—Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: [...] "It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and to be grateful for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a Modern Orthodox Jew, Lamm's {{theology}} somewhat {{resembles the}} corpus of classical rabbinic Jewish principles of faith.

[...] He believes that God exists, that God can reveal his will to mankind, and that the Torah (five books of Moses) is an exact transcription of God's revelation to Moses on Mount Sinai. As an Orthodox Jew, he believes that Judaism's oral law, as recorded in the Mishnah and Talmud, represents an accurate and authoritative understanding of how God wants mankind to understand the Hebrew Bible. [...] In accordance with standard Orthodox Jewish theology, he holds that halakha, loosely translated as [...] "Jewish law", is normative and binding on all Jews.|$|E

No intellectual pursuit had ever aroused in me such intense curiosity, and much more than my intellect was involved, much more than my curiosity aroused.

2500|$|Dante {{wakes up}} to find that he has crossed the Acheron, and Virgil leads him to the first circle of the abyss, Limbo, where Virgil himself resides. The first circle {{contains}} the unbaptized and the virtuous pagans, who, although not sinful, did not accept Christ. Dorothy L. Sayers writes, [...] "After those who refused choice come those without opportunity of choice. They could not, that is, choose Christ; they could, and did, choose human virtue, and for that they have their reward." [...] Limbo shares many characteristics with the Asphodel Meadows; thus, the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of Heaven. Without baptism ("the portal of <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> you embrace") they lacked the hope for something greater than rational minds can conceive. When Dante asked if anyone has ever left Limbo, Virgil states that he saw Jesus ("a Mighty One") descend into Limbo and take Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, and Rachel (see Limbo of the Patriarchs) into his all-forgiving arms and transport them to Heaven as the first human souls to be saved. The event, known as the Harrowing of Hell, would have occurred in A.D. 33 or 34.|$|E

2500|$|Margaret Mead, {{the first}} of five children, was born in Philadelphia, but raised in nearby Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Her father, Edward Sherwood Mead, was a {{professor}} of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, [...] and her mother, Emily (née Fogg) Mead, was a sociologist who studied Italian immigrants. Her sister Katharine (1906–1907) {{died at the age}} of nine months. This was a traumatic event for Mead, who had named the girl, and thoughts of her lost sister permeated her daydreams for many years. Her family moved frequently, so her early education was directed by her Grandmother until, at age 11, she was enrolled by her family at Buckingham Friends School in Lahaska, Pennsylvania. Her family owned the Longland farm from 1912 to 1926. Born into a family of various religious outlooks, she searched for a form of religion that gave an expression of <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> she had been formally acquainted with, Christianity. In doing so, she found the rituals of the Episcopal Church to fit the expression of religion she was seeking. Margaret studied one year, 1919, at DePauw University, then transferred to Barnard College where she earned her bachelor's degree in 1923.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was writing}} about the inner being {{in all of these}} books and his goal was to get the single {{individual}} away from all the speculation that was going on about God and Christ. Speculation creates quantities of ways to find God and his Goods but finding faith in Christ and putting the understanding to use stops all speculation because then one begins to actually exist as a Christian or in an ethical/religious way. He was against an individual waiting until certain of God's love and salvation before beginning to try to become a Christian. He defined this as a [...] "special type of religious conflict the Germans call Anfechtung" [...] (contesting or disputing). In Kierkegaard's view the Church should not try to prove Christianity or even defend it. It should help the single individual to make a leap of faith, <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> God is love and has a task for that very same single individual. He wrote the following about fear and trembling and love as early as 1839, [...] "Fear and trembling is not the primus motor in the Christian life, for it is love; but it is what the oscillating balance wheel is to the clock-it is the oscillating balance wheel of the Christian life.|$|E
2500|$|Some critics {{believe that}} any liturgy celebrated in a {{language}} in which the phrase [...] "pro multis" [...] (Latin for [...] "for (the) many") {{in the words of}} consecration of the Paul VI Roman Missal was translated as [...] "for all", as in the initial English translation, was sacramentally invalid and brought about no transubstantiation. In a circular issued on 17 October 2006, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments recalled the 1974 declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of <b>the</b> <b>Faith</b> <b>that</b> there is no doubt whatsoever regarding the validity of Masses celebrated using [...] "for all" [...] as a translation of [...] "pro multis", since [...] "for all" [...] corresponds to a correct interpretation of Christ's intention expressed {{in the words of the}} consecration, and since it is a dogma of the Catholic faith that Christ died on the Cross for all. However, the Congregation pointed out that [...] "for all" [...] is not a literal translation of the words that [...] and [...] report that Jesus used at the Last Supper and of the words used in the Latin text of the Mass: [...] "for all" [...] is rather an explanation of the sort that belongs properly to catechesis. The Congregation told the episcopal conferences to translate the words [...] "pro multis" [...] more literally. The revised English translation therefore has [...] "for many" [...] in place of [...] "for all".|$|E

2500|$|Theology and philosophy, {{practiced by}} priests and idealists, are antithetical to reality and actuality.

[...] But, to Nietzsche, [...] "Pure spirit is pure lie" [...] and he called the priest a [...] "... denier, slanderer, and poisoner of life ..." [...] who is a [...] "... conscious advocate of nothingness and negation ..." [...] and who stands truth upside down on its head. [...] Theologians were placed by Nietzsche {{in the same class}} as priests. He defined <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> they fostered as [...] "...closing one's eyes with respect to oneself once and for all, so as not to suffer from the sight of incurable falsity." [...] Seeing falsely is then valued as the highest morality. This reversal of values is considered, by Nietzsche, to be harmful to life. When the theologians seek political power, [...] "...the will to the end, the nihilistic will wants power." [...] In his native Germany, philosophy is corrupt because it is theological, according to Nietzsche. [...] Kant supported theological ideals by his discussions of the concepts of [...] "true world" [...] and [...] "morality as the essence of the world." [...] Kant's skeptical procedure was to show that these concepts could not be refuted, even though they could not be proved. Nietzsche was especially critical of Kant's Categorical imperative because it was not the result of a personal necessity and choice. Its origin from concepts and logic was decadent because it was not a product of life, growth, selfpreservation, and pleasure. Kant's practical reason was an attempt to give scientific legitimacy to his lack of intellectual conscience. [...] "...he invented a special kind of reason for cases in which one need not bother about reason [...] that is, when morality, when the sublime command 'thou shalt,' makes itself heard." [...] Kant's selfdeceptive fraudulence {{is a result of the}} influence of priestly theology on his philosophy.|$|E
