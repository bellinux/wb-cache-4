5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive <b>toxicant</b> in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
25|$|Toxicodynamics, termed {{pharmacodynamics}} in pharmacology, {{describes the}} dynamic interactions of a <b>toxicant</b> with a biological target and its biological effects. A biological target, {{also known as}} the site of action, can be binding proteins, ion channels, DNA, or a variety of other receptors. When a <b>toxicant</b> enters an organism, it can interact with these receptors and produce structural or functional alterations. The mechanism of action of the <b>toxicant,</b> as determined by a toxicant’s chemical properties, will determine what receptors are targeted and the overall toxic effect at the cellular level and organismal level.|$|E
25|$|While {{toxicokinetics}} {{describes the}} changes in the concentrations of a <b>toxicant</b> over time due to the uptake, biotransformation, distribution and elimination of toxicants, toxicodynamics involves the interactions of a <b>toxicant</b> with a biological target and the functional or structural alterations in a cell that can eventually lead to a toxic effect. Depending on the toxicant’s chemical reactivity and vicinity, the <b>toxicant</b> may be able to interact with the biological target. Interactions between a <b>toxicant</b> and the biological target may also be more specific, where high-affinity binding sites increase the selectivity of interactions. For this reason, toxicity may be expressed primarily in certain tissues or organs. The targets are often receptors on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Toxicants can either induce an unnecessary response or inhibit a natural response, which can cause damage. If the biological target is critical and the damage is severe enough, irreversible injury can occur first at the molecular level, which will translate into effects at higher levels of organization.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{emphasis}} of the Olympia Field Station is {{on the development of}} non-lethal methods to control pest species, sometimes lethal methods are necessary. <b>Toxicants</b> can be an effective means of quickly reducing high populations of some problem animals or maintaining acceptable population densities. Depending on their mode of action, <b>toxicants</b> are classified into three categories: fumigants, acute <b>toxicants</b> and chronic <b>toxicants...</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{organism}} can {{be exposed}} to <b>toxicants</b> at various stages of its life cycle. The toxicity can vary with the organism's placement within its food web. Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism stores <b>toxicants</b> in fatty tissues, which may eventually establish a trophic cascade and the biomagnification of specific <b>toxicants.</b> Biodegradation releases carbon dioxide and water as by-products into the environment. This process is typically limited in areas affected by environmental <b>toxicants.</b>|$|R
40|$|Fish acute {{toxicity}} studies {{are required for}} environmental hazard and risk assessment of chemicals by national and international legislations such as REACH, the regulations of plant protection products and biocidal products, or the GHS (globally harmonised system) for classification and labelling of chemicals. Alternative methods like QSARs (quantitative structure-activity relationships) can replace many ecotoxicity tests. However, complete substitution of in vivo animal tests by in silico methods may not be realistic. For the so-called baseline <b>toxicants,</b> {{it is possible to}} predict the fish {{acute toxicity}} with sufficient accuracy from log Kow and, hence, valid QSARs can replace in vivo testing. In contrast, excess <b>toxicants</b> and chemicals not reliably classified as baseline <b>toxicants</b> require further in silico, in vitro or in vivo assessments. Thus, the critical task is to discriminate between baseline and excess <b>toxicants.</b> For fish acute toxicity, we derived a scheme based on structural alerts and physicochemical property thresholds to classify chemicals as either baseline <b>toxicants</b> (=predictable by QSARs) or as potential excess <b>toxicants</b> (=not predictable by baseline QSARs). The step-wise approach identifies baseline <b>toxicants</b> (true negatives) in a precautionary way to avoid false negative predictions. Therefore, a certain fraction of false positives can be tolerated, i. e. baseline <b>toxicants</b> without specific effects that may be tested instead of predicted. Application of the classification scheme to a new heterogeneous dataset for diverse fish species results in 40 % baseline <b>toxicants,</b> 24 % excess <b>toxicants</b> and 36 % compounds not classified. Thus, we can conclude that replacing about half of the fish acute toxicity tests by QSAR predictions is realistic to be achieved in the short-term. The long-term goals are classification criteria also for further groups of <b>toxicants</b> and to replace as many in vivo fish acute toxicity tests as possible with valid QSAR predictions...|$|R
25|$|By the mid-twentieth century, copper oxide-based paints {{could keep}} a ship out of drydock {{for as much}} as 18 months, or as little as 12 in {{tropical}} waters. The shorter service life was due to rapid leeching of the <b>toxicant,</b> and chemical conversion into less toxic salts which accumulated as a crust which would inhibit further leaching of active cuprous oxide from the layer under the crust.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, {{there has}} been rapid growth in the tissue residue {{approach}} to toxicology. The water-based approach has been re-evaluated due to challenges in assessing the toxicity of bioaccumulating chemicals. Water-based approaches are not always an accurate estimation of the concentration of a bioaccumulating chemical in an organism, nor does the water-based approach incorporate the multiple routes of exposure of an organism to a <b>toxicant</b> and the additive effects across these routes.|$|E
25|$|Historically, aquatic {{toxicology}} toxicity {{tests have}} focused on water-based approaches where concentration of a <b>toxicant</b> is determined by its concentration in the water. Although tissue residue use and concepts have existed for over 100 years due to interest in narcosis and anesthesia, it was not widely used in toxicology. The first known study of tissue residue in environmental toxicology was reported in 1912 by White and Thomas who investigated the effects of copper exposure to fish using whole-body copper concentrations.|$|E
50|$|A mode {{of toxic}} {{action is a}} common set of {{physiological}} and behavioral signs that characterize a type of adverse biological response. A mode of action {{should not be confused with}} mechanism of action, which refer to the biochemical processes underlying a given mode of action. Modes of toxic action are important, widely used tools in ecotoxicology and aquatic toxicology because they classify <b>toxicants</b> or pollutants according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting <b>toxicants</b> and specific acting <b>toxicants.</b> Non-specific acting <b>toxicants</b> are those that produce narcosis, while specific acting <b>toxicants</b> are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.|$|R

40|$|Energy {{intake of}} {{individuals}} affects growth of organisms and, therefore, populations. Persistent lipophilic <b>toxicants</b> acquired {{with the energy}} can bioaccumulate and harm individuals. Marine mammals are particularly vulnerable because of their large energy requirements, and transfer of energy and <b>toxicants</b> from mothers to their young during gestation and lactation. Dynamic energy budget (DEB) models for energy assimilation and utilization, coupled with pharmacokinetic models that calculate distribution of <b>toxicants</b> in individuals, can help investigate the vulnerability. In this dissertation I develop the first individual DEB model tailored specifically to marine mammals and couple it to a pharmacokinetic model for lipophilic <b>toxicants.</b> I adapt the individual model to the right whale {{and use it to}} analyze consequences of energy availability on individual growth, reproduction, bioaccumulation, and transfer of <b>toxicants</b> between generations. From the coupled model, I create an individual-based model (IBM) of a marine mammal population. I use it to investigate how interactions of food availability, exposure to <b>toxicants,</b> and maternal transfer of <b>toxicants</b> affect populations. I also present a method to create matrix population models from a general DEB model to alleviate some of the drawbacks of the IBM approach. by Tin Klanjšček. Thesis (Ph. D.)

25|$|Toxicants {{may also}} cause {{endocrine}} disruption through {{interacting with the}} estrogen receptor. This mechanism has been well-studied with PCBs. These chemicals {{have been used as}} coolants and lubricants in transformers and other electrical equipment due to their insulating properties. A purely anthropogenic substance, PCBs are no longer in production in the United States due to the adverse health effects associated with exposure, but they are highly persistent and are still widespread in the environment. PCBs are a xenoestrogen, which elicit an enhancing (rather than inhibiting) response, and are mediated by the estrogen receptor. These are often referred to as estrogen mimics because they mimic the effects of estrogen. PCBs often build up in sediments and bioaccumulate in organisms. These chemicals diffuse into the nucleus and bind to the estrogen receptor. The estrogen receptor is kept in an inactive conformation through interactions with proteins such as heat shock proteins 59, 70, and 90. After the <b>toxicant</b> binding occurs, the estrogen receptor is activated and forms a homodimer complex which seeks out estrogen response elements in the DNA. The binding of the complex to these elements causes a rearrangement of the chromatin and transcription of the gene, resulting in production of a specific protein. In doing this, PCBs elicit an estrogenic response which can affect numerous functions within the organism. These effects are observed in various aquatic species. The levels of PCBs in marine mammals are often very high as a result of bioaccumulation. Studies have demonstrated that PCBs are responsible for reproductive impairment in the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Similar effects have been found in the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), the ringed seal (Pusa hispida) and the California sea lion (Zalophys californinus). In the grey seals and ringed seals, uterine occlusions and stenosis were found which led to sterility. If exposed to a xenoestrogen such as PCBs, male fish have also been seen to produce vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is an egg protein female fish normally produce but is not usually present in males except at very low concentrations. This is often used as a biomarker for EDCs.|$|E
500|$|Normal {{functioning}} of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because, besides being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal. Uranium is also a reproductive <b>toxicant.</b> Radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation, the primary form of 238U decay, has a very short range, and will not penetrate skin. Alpha radiation from inhaled uranium has been demonstrated to cause lung cancer in exposed nuclear workers. [...] Uranyl (...) ions, such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds, {{have been shown to}} cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals. While the CDC has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium, exposure to uranium and its decay products, especially radon, are widely known and significant health threats. Exposure to strontium-90, iodine-131, and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure, but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons.|$|E
