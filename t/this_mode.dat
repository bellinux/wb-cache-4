5|$|Capture the Flag. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> of {{game play}} {{is by far}} the most popular among Warhawk players. In <b>this</b> <b>mode</b> each team has a flag at their base which they must defend while {{attempting}} to capture the second flag in their opponent's base. You can only capture the flag if your flag remains at the base.|$|E
5|$|Season mode was {{replaced}} with Road to WrestleMania in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, and remained in the games until WWE '12. In <b>this</b> <b>mode,</b> players could choose from superstars to play as in single-player or multi-player storylines. The difference is that each storyline is tailor made for the superstar the player chooses. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> is a more authentic experience and less arcade-like than the former season mode was.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>mode</b> was {{discontinued}} in WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2009.|$|E
50|$|Homerun Mode: When {{struck by}} an uppercut or a {{powerful}} attack, the fighters will float much {{higher in the}} sky. <b>This</b> <b>mode's</b> name is {{a reference to the}} baseball explicit term home run.|$|R
5000|$|Sniper - Players {{are only}} {{allowed to use}} sniper rifles and knives on <b>this</b> <b>mode's</b> {{exclusive}} maps. The team that kills all the opposing team's members wins the round. With a premium item, there is an option to allow secondary weapons.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> {{valuation}} <b>mode</b> {{is typically}} used by local distribution companies (LDCs). It {{is based on}} pricing storage, according to the savings resulting from not having to resort to other more expensive options. <b>This</b> pricing <b>mode</b> depends on the consumer and their respective load profile/shape.|$|R
5|$|Completing {{the game}} on <b>this</b> <b>mode</b> results in either an {{achievement}} (Xbox 360/Steam) or trophy (PlayStation 3) being awarded.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of <b>this</b> <b>mode.</b> Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, <b>this</b> <b>mode</b> has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E
5|$|Uncompetitive {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the inhibitor binds only to the enzyme–substrate complex, not to the free enzyme; the EIS complex is catalytically inactive. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> of inhibition is rare and causes a decrease in both Vmax and the Km value.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> game <b>mode</b> {{featured}} a full story told over 21 different cut scenes as the player progressed throughout the game. With {{the inclusion of}} <b>this</b> game <b>mode,</b> NBA Ballers became the first video game officially licensed by a league to contain a story mode.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> {{valuation}} <b>mode</b> {{is typically}} used by local distribution companies (LDCs).

5000|$|FPS mode (Fight, Protect, Survive) - <b>this</b> game <b>mode</b> was {{introduced}} in the 1.1 alpha patch. Two types of mob are spawned in the map: [...] "harvesters" [...] and [...] "wasps". The player is required to kill the mobs to collect gears which are used to buy various items used in the game <b>mode.</b> <b>This</b> game <b>mode</b> is in very early stages of development and is likely to change in future patches.|$|R
5|$|User {{authentication}} mode: <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> {{requires that}} the user provide some authentication to the pre-boot environment {{in the form of}} a pre-boot PIN or password.|$|E
5|$|Another very {{important}} mode is the G mode (G from graphite). <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E
5|$|Challenge mode employs similar {{gameplay}} {{to that of}} the Story mode. The {{difference is}} that the gameplay for Challenge mode is faster-paced, offers more puzzles, and sacrifices any storyline in <b>this</b> <b>mode.</b> It consists of 30 levels and players must fulfill certain conditions before succeeding. Each level lasts only a few minutes, offering more exciting, yet harder, gameplay. The time needed for players to complete a level is recorded in an online leaderboard which can be viewed by other players.|$|E
50|$|Play as Retsu Ichijoji (Gavan), and as Kojiro Aoyama in two stages, in <b>this</b> story <b>mode</b> {{based on}} the Space Sheriff Gavan TV series. The plot is {{followed}} by stills taken from the most important episodes. The player {{has the ability to}} pick up and throw items in <b>this</b> game <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> {{addressing}} <b>mode</b> {{is closely}} related to the indexed absolute addressing mode.|$|R
50|$|The Lydian scale can be {{described}} as a major scale with the fourth scale degree raised a semitone, making it an augmented fourth above the tonic, e.g., an F-major scale with a B rather than B. <b>This</b> <b>mode's</b> augmented fourth and the Locrian mode's diminished fifth are the only modes to have a tritone above the tonic.|$|R
5|$|Dr. Mario {{offers a}} {{multiplayer}} gaming mode {{in which two}} players compete {{against each other in}} separate playing fields. In <b>this</b> <b>mode,</b> the player's goal is to clear their own playing field of viruses before the other player does. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can cause additional capsules to fall onto the opponent's playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all the viruses or if the other playing field fills up. The first player to win three games wins overall.|$|E
5|$|Golden Sun also {{features}} an optional battling mode accessible from the menu screen. In <b>this</b> <b>mode,</b> players can enter {{a team from}} their saved game files into an arena environment where they battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies. Additionally, players can select three of their four characters to fight another player's three-character team. The player does not receive any reward or punishment for participating in these battles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main story, there's also a VR training mode in which the player can test out their sneaking skills {{in a series of}} artificially constructed environments. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> is divided into three main categories (practice, time attack, and gun shooting), each consisting of ten stages. After completing all 30 stages, a survival mission is unlocked in which the player must proceed through all ten gun shooting stages in a row under a seven-minute limit.|$|E
50|$|SMA {{is subject}} to {{structural}} fatigue - a failure mode by which cyclic loading results in the initiation and propagation of a crack that eventually results in catastrophic loss of function by fracture. The physics behind <b>this</b> fatigue <b>mode</b> is accumulation of microstructural damage during cyclic loading. <b>This</b> failure <b>mode</b> is observed in most engineering materials, not just SMAs.|$|R
30|$|Observer <b>Mode</b> <b>This</b> (pessimistic) <b>mode</b> {{assumes that}} dataflows {{are not the}} only {{entities}} performing changes on database objects. Therefore, it resorts to observers to scan the objects to detect modifications, since it is not guaranteed that every update passes through the Monitoring component.|$|R
40|$|Commune avec INSTRU et ELECInternational audienceIn {{the present}} paper, we present {{measurements}} {{that led to}} the discovery of two-proton radioactivity. After the first observation of <b>this</b> decay <b>mode</b> for 45 Fe, new measurements evidenced <b>this</b> decay <b>mode</b> also for 54 Zn and most likely 48 Ni. A new detector based on the time-projection chamber principle allowed now to visualize the two protons directly...|$|R
5|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} for a mechanical part to vibrate {{in a number of}} different modes, however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to <b>this</b> <b>mode.</b> As well as the straightforward longitudinal mode some others which are used include flexural mode, torsional mode, radial mode and drumhead mode.|$|E
5|$|Jetpac Refuelled {{features}} a multiplayer mode {{that can be}} played either offline using a split screen or online via Xbox Live. In <b>this</b> <b>mode,</b> the player has to compete one-on-one in a race to build and refuel their craft before their opponent does. Fuel and rocket pickups can be stolen from opponents by shooting them or by using an EMP blast at close range. Lives are unlimited in multiplayer {{and the winner is}} determined by the highest score. A version of the original 1983 Jetpac is also included in the game.|$|E
5|$|L.A. Noire is an action-adventure neo-noir crime {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Players {{complete}} cases—linear scenarios with set objectives—to {{progress through the}} story. The game also features a mode which allows players to freely roam the open world. In <b>this</b> <b>mode,</b> players can also engage in optional activities. The world features multiple landmarks, which are all based on real monuments from 1940s Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> abort <b>mode</b> {{was never}} needed {{during the entire}} history of the Space Shuttle program.|$|R
50|$|Tower: The {{objective}} of <b>this</b> game <b>mode</b> is {{to knock out}} more enemies than the opponent.|$|R
50|$|Horde game mode is a {{multiplayer}} mode previously {{available in}} Unturned 3. While {{it can be}} acquired {{through the use of}} the Steam Workshop, it is otherwise currently unavailable. In <b>this</b> game <b>mode,</b> players fight off waves of zombies and the points collected by the player can be spent at buy nodes. The player cannot die due to starvation or thirst in <b>this</b> game <b>mode.</b>|$|R
5|$|Laser {{data are}} also used {{horizontally}} in two dimensions. An algorithm provides a real-time position estimation of the robot when enough elements from the landing gears and engines are visible. A confidence index {{is calculated based on}} the number of items collected by lasers. If good data confidence is achieved, the position is updated. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> is particularly used when the robot moves beneath the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in <b>this</b> <b>mode,</b> the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, <b>this</b> <b>mode</b> is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E
5|$|Neither treaty {{made any}} {{provision}} {{as to the}} mode or {{manner in which the}} removal of the Indians or surrender of the reservations was to take place. The grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations, or of the four, as the case would have been under the first treaty. The plaintiff in this case was expelled by force; and unless <b>this</b> <b>mode</b> of removal can be sustained, the recovery against the defendants for the trespass was right, and must be affirmed.|$|E
