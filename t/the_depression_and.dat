5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} {{existed in the}} central Caribbean Sea in late October. It steadily organized, and was classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen on October 31. It moved northwestward, and entered a high-shear environment due to an upper level low situated toward the end of a high pressure system. By November 1, little convection remained as the weak depression turned to the north and crossed Cuba. A burst of convection organized over <b>the</b> <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> brought strong wind gusts to the Florida Keys as it passed through the area on November 2. It continued to the north-northwest, paralleling the Florida west coast, and lost all of its convection on November 3. The system turned to the northeast, and merged with a weak extratropical low over northern Florida on November 4.|$|E

With the help of Edwin O'Malley's political connections, Walter's company received contracts from the New York Telephone Company and the New York City Board of Education to perform geological surveys.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition. The public was angry over the inability of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett and his Conservative (or Tory) government to deal with <b>the</b> <b>Depression,</b> <b>and</b> the Liberals were considered likely to return to office at the next election, due by 1935. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men were impressed with each other, but each felt the other should make the next move. According to Lambert in his diary, Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he {{to run in the}} new riding of Port Arthur.|$|E
5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of <b>the</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>and</b> World War II.|$|E
5|$|As the new-fangled Ford Model Ts {{and other}} early {{automobiles}} increasingly {{took to the}} roads in the 1920s, inland steamship lines in the U.S. initially resisted carrying automobiles on their boats.

5|$|By {{the morning}} of October29, a {{tropical}} wave, tracking towards the west, began to interact with <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> leading to forecasters discussing a possible merger of the two systems. An upper-level anticyclone over the eastern Caribbean produced significant wind shear over the depression, preventing the center from moving under the deep convection. However, a large convective banding feature developed {{to the north of}} the system. Several hours later, hurricane hunters flew through the storm and recorded surface winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a barometric pressure of 999mbar (hPa; 29.5inHg), leading to the upgrade of the depression to a tropical storm. At this time, the storm received the name Katrina and peaked in intensity. By 0000UTC on October30, the center of Katrina made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua at peak intensity. Within three hours, the storm weakened to a depression due to interaction with the mountains of Nicaragua and convection was limited to a small area on the western side of the center of circulation.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression (1929–35) {{led to a}} fall in European copper prices which {{severely}} damaged {{the economy of the}} Copperbelt. In February 1931 the Mkubwa mine was shut down, followed {{over the next few months}} by the Chamishi, Nchanga and Mulfira mines. Construction work at the Roan Antelope and Nkana mines was nearing completion at this time, leading to large-scale unemployment; the mines employed 31,941 people during in 1930, and 6,677 by the end of 1932. Many unemployed African workers remained, instead of returning to their rural homes. During the period between 1931 and 1932, the European population in the region reduced by 25 per cent. In 1935, the Northern Rhodesian administration doubled urban taxes and reduced them in rural areas to counter <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> related losses incurred by the closure of one of the region's four mines. The provincial commissioner implemented the tax in May (retroactive to 1 January) after the signing of the Native Tax Amendment Ordinance, and was aware of the latter.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} began {{a movement}} to the northwest upon formation and {{on the night of}} October 31, the depression ran into a newly-forming upper-level low near the Yucatan Peninsula. The interaction with the upper-level low caused shearing in <b>the</b> <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> broke apart the previous low-level circulation that was developing. By the morning of November 1, the depression {{was nothing more than a}} swirl of low-level clouds near the center of circulation. After this, the depression could no longer attain the circulation it had previously developed. During the period of November 2 and 3, the depression moved to the northeast, crossing over the islands of Jamaica, Cayman and Cuba and then entering the southern parts of the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|The remnant low {{moved to}} the north and later northeast, due to a non-tropical system. The {{convection}} increased and the depression regenerated on August 31. That afternoon, the depression strengthened further into Tropical Storm Lee, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 40mph (65km/h), in between Bermuda and the Azores. There was uncertainty in its intensity, and it quickly weakened to tropical depression status again. Lee moved around the non-tropical low to its west, causing forecasting difficulties with regards to how tropical it remained. Later on September 1, shear again removed the convection of <b>the</b> <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> Lee became a remnant low that survived until September 4 when it was absorbed by a cold front. It never affected land, and there were no reports of damage or fatalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression moved slowly northwestward, with the slow motion persisting for its entire lifetime {{due to the}} storm being embedded within the weakness of a mid-level ridge to its north. Shortly after forming, the storm was located in a marginally favorable environment, with westerly wind shear and dry air approaching <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> leaving the center of circulation exposed from the convection. However, the wind shear subsequently decreased, and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ignacio. The storm quickly organized and developed well-defined banding features and very well-organized upper-level outflow, and by late on August 23 a warm spot formed {{in the center of}} the convection. The warm spot organized into an intermittent eye feature. Early on August 24, Ignacio attained hurricane status, the latest formation of the first hurricane of a season recorded in the East Pacific since reliable satellite observation began in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained multiple cloud swirls within a common center. Banding features increased, though southwesterly wind shear {{and the lack}} of a well-defined circulation prevented initial strengthening. Dry air encountered <b>the</b> <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> as such it developed very slowly; forecasters maintained considerable difficulty in determining a center of circulation. It continued its motion to the west-northwest while tracking around the southern periphery of a deep-layer subtropical ridge to its north. Though convection remained focused near the outer periphery of the system, the overall organized continued to steadily increase, and it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Florence on September 5 while located about 1,120miles (1,800km) east-northeast of Anguilla.|$|E
