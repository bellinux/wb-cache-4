40|$|In this study, <b>burning</b> {{velocities}} <b>of</b> hydrogen-carbon monoxide (H 2 -CO) mixtures, {{which are}} primary constituents of syngas fuels, are measured. The effect of different burner systems, H 2 concentration, and different measurement techniques on <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> H 2 -CO mixtures is also discussed. <b>The</b> <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> H 2 -CO mixtures increase {{with the increase}} in H 2 content in the mixture. When compared with different burner systems using different methods, <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> velocity data almost coincide in the lean condition, but at rich condition the data stray away from each other. <b>The</b> <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> actual syngas compositions (based on different sources of coal) are then measured and analyzed to determine the effects <b>of</b> diluents on <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> syngas mixtures. As diluents, carbon dioxide (CO 2) plays a dominating role on <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> velocity when compared to nitrogen (N 2). Finally, <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> H 2 -methane (CH 4) mixtures are measured to determine the effect H 2 on <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> H 2 -CH 4 mixtures. ...|$|R

Based on division zone combustion theory, a simplified model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> rate <b>of</b> AP/HTPB base bleed propellant under high pressure is established.

5|$|A {{number of}} events {{had taken place in}} and around Jena in the months before the Barker assault, which the media have {{associated}} with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. These events included the hanging of rope nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E

In May 1968, he sent the Guard to Louisville to break up race-related protests that followed peaceful civil rights marches. This action was criticized by civil rights leaders across the state. In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the Guard to quell protests against the Vietnam War at the University of Kentucky, and imposed a curfew that interfered with final examinations.

In addition, Tulsidas venerates the whole Hindu pantheon. The Ramcharitmanas begins with reverence of Ganesh, Sarasvati, Parvati, Shiva, the Guru, Valmiki and Hanuman.
