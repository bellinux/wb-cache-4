5|$|Agoncillo and {{her daughters}} stayed in Hong Kong from 1895 to 1906. She took care of their house, which became an asylum. Their funds had run out because of the heavy {{expenses}} incurred by Don Felipe for his diplomatic activities in France and in the United States. She once had to sell the children's pinafores and their jewels to support her family and <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> voyage back to Manila. The other money was also used to help boost the revolutionary funds. Their support for the revolution made them an impoverished family; however, they gained it back when Don Felipe returned to his profession.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E

After eleven years at the club, 34-year-old Stewart was made redundant {{at the end of}} that season (along with 27 of the 30-man squad). He moved to third-level Partick Thistle, and in his single season in Glasgow helped the club achieve promotion as champions.|$|R
5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt to}} sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory {{were on their way to}} a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E
5|$|The crisis showed Muhammad {{that many}} of his men had reached the limits of their endurance. He sent word to Ghatafan, trying <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> {{defection}} and offering them a third of Medina's date harvest if they withdrew. Although the Ghatafan demanded half, they eventually agreed to negotiating with Muhammad on those terms. Before Muhammad began the order of drafting the agreement, he consulted the Medinan leaders. They sharply rejected the terms of the agreement, protesting Medina had never sunk to such levels of ignominy. The negotiations were broken off. While the Ghatafan did not retreat they had compromised themselves by entering into negotiations with Medina, and the Confederacy's internal dissension had thereby been increased.|$|E
5|$|Zappa's {{interest}} in composing and arranging flourished {{in his last}} high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, arranging and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra. He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album Freak Out! Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting {{the rest of the}} class with juvenile antics. In 1959, he attended Chaffey College but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> college.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} {{white paper}} followed the Bowes Report in February 1959, recommending that an Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that {{were no longer}} able to collect enough fees from tolls <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> upkeep. Further reports followed, and in 1962 the Advisory Committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped, and allocated £20,000 for maintenance and £20,000 to begin restoration. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from Reading to Bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity. It was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the Kennet and Avon Canal Association. The Trust gained charitable status in April and was incorporated under the Companies Act on 6 June 1962. In 1963 the newly formed British Waterways, which was created by the Transport Act of the previous year, and replaced the British Transport Commission as the statutory body for inland waterways, took over the canal and, in partnership with the Trust and riparian local authorities, restoration work began.|$|E

Neither Audrey or Gail are fooled and Lewis offers <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> drinks. He then leaves the pub and heads to Coronation Street. Lewis visits Peter Barlow, apologises for stealing from him and returns the money he took with an extra £1000 as compensation. Lewis then goes to Audrey's salon and he tells her he {{did not mean to}} hurt her. He asks Audrey to drive him to the police station to prove how sorry he is. After he is given bail, Lewis enters the Rovers Return and is punched by Deirdre. Lewis faces hostility from Audrey's grandson, David (Jack P. Shepherd) upon his return to the salon. He begs Audrey for forgiveness but she throws him out. Lewis sends her flowers and Audrey visits his address and finds he is living in a bedsit. David's wife, Kylie (Paula Lane), introduces herself to Lewis and he defends her against Brian Packham's (Peter Gunn) accusations that she is giving her son the wrong food.|$|E
5|$|State schools provide {{textbooks}} free {{of charge}} to their students, while private schools generally require their students <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and {{two and a half}} hours per week to physical education and religion.

5|$|State-owned {{slaves were}} put to work in palaces, offices, workshops, stables, and {{sometimes}} state-owned agricultural fields, while privately owned slaves were employed in domestic services and sometimes farming. However, {{the vast majority of}} non-independent farmers working for wealthy landowners were not hired laborers or slaves, but were landless peasants who paid rent as tenants. It might have been more economically feasible to maintain tenants instead of slaves, since slave masters were obligated to pay an annual poll tax of 240 coins for each slave they owned (the same rate merchants had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> poll tax). Government slaves were not assigned to work in the government's monopolized industries over iron and salt (which lasted from Emperor Wu's reign until the beginning of Eastern Han). Privately owned slaves were usually assigned to kitchen duty while others fulfilled roles as armed bodyguards, mounted escorts, acrobats, jugglers, dancers, singers, and musicians.|$|E
