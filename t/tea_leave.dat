40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{adsorption}} of fluoride ion from aqueous solutions by using fired clay soil, pillared with <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> ash components. The potential of low cost material fired clay soil and fired clay soil pillared with <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> ash components for fluoride removal from aqueous solution was evaluated by using fluoride ion selective electrode. Pillaring of clay soil with <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> ash was done by thoroughly mixing fifteen gram of <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> ash and three hundred gram of clay soil using distilled water and it was aged for 96 hours until it was dried. Untreated clay soil and clay soil pillared with <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> ash components were fired in an electrical furnace at 570 C for 3 hrs. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out {{and the effects of}} pH, contact time, initial adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dose and temperature of the solution were investigated. Adsorption of fluoride by fired clay soil and fired clay soil pillared with <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> ash was observed to sharply increase from pH 4 to 7 then decreased. The maximum adsorption efficiencies obtained were 75 % for fired clay soil and 90 % for fired clay soil pillared with <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> ash components at pH 7 for both adsorbents. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained was 0. 913 mg/g for fired clay soil and 2. 746 mg/g for fired clay soil pillared with <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> ash components. It can be concluded that fired clay soil pillared with <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> ash is a good and cheap adsorbent with high potential for the adsorption and removal of fluoride from fluoride contaminated water and could therefore serve as effective and efficient adsorbent for treatment of drinking waters in terms of high adsorption capacity...|$|E

Obtained results indicate that this is not an enzyme-mediated synthesis, because extract is prepared at high temperature of 90  °C. At this high temperature, the rate of nanoparticles is very high and there is no peak obtained when study was carried out in FTIR [81]. Similar results were obtained by Satishkumar et al.

Synthesis of gold and palladium nanoparticles was also reported by Nadagouda and Verma [56], and they use coffee and <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> extract.

However, Kamp and Marshell found that the plants have limited capacity for the reduction of any metal ions and it depends on the reduction potential of metal species. They were working on the uptake of various silver salt solutions by hydroponically grown B. juncea, and they found that metal nanoparticle formation by plant extract is limited to noble metals. Bar et al.

Samples of the plants were taken when they reached harvesting stage and their agronomical properties (plant height, number of leaves, leaf sheaths length, tillering, leaf area, panicle length, total and milled rice values and 1000 grain weight) were recorded and biochemical (chlorophyll a and b) and physiological analysis (Na, K, Ca, Si amounts in roots) were performed. The results showed that improvements in vegetative characters except leaf number were obtained with trials with MSW, MSW+waste tea leaves+straw or MSW+waste tea leaves+straw+chicken or olive manure including fertilizers, increase in chlorophyll b content was obtained with trials except with mycorrhiza, and decreased root Na levels and increases in chlorophyll a content (biochemical parameter) were obtained particularly with trials with of the mycorrhiza+MSW pair or mycorrhiza+MSW+waste <b>tea</b> <b>leave</b> mixture.
