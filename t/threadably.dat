40|$|An impact micro-positioning actuator. In {{one aspect}} of the invention, a {{threaded}} shaft is <b>threadably</b> received in a nut and the nut is impacted by an impacting device, causing the nut first to rotate relative to the shaft by slipping as a result of shaft inertia and subsequently to stick to the shaft {{as a result of the}} frictional force therebetween. The nut is returned to its initial position by a return force provided by a return mechanism after impact. The micro-positioning actuator is further improved by controlling at least one and preferably all of the following: the friction, the impact provided by the impacting device, the return force provided by the return mechanism, and the inertia of the shaft. In another aspect of the invention, a threaded shaft is <b>threadably</b> received in a nut and the shaft is impacted by an impacting device, causing the shaft to rotate relative to the nut...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} concerns {{an inflatable}} seal assembly adapted {{for use with}} a bayonet quick-disconnect system particularly useful for the insulated transfer of cryogenic consumables in orbit (such as between a space station and a re-supply vehicle). The zero-leak cryogenic coupling includes a polymeric seal clamped to a male bayonet member with two pairs of tightening rings. The tightening rings <b>threadably</b> engage each other in respective pairs around tapered ends of the inflatable seal member so that a wedging action tightens the seal member about the male bayonet. Once in place, the seal may be inflated via an inflation port so that its expansion provides pressure contact with the inside surface of a coaxial female member...|$|E
40|$|Mounting {{systems for}} {{structural}} members, fastening assemblies thereof, and vibration isolation systems including the same are provided. Mounting systems comprise {{a pair of}} mounting brackets, each clamped against a fastening assembly forming a mounting assembly. Fastening assemblies comprise a spherical rod end comprising a spherical member having a through opening and an integrally threaded shaft, first and second seating members {{on opposite sides of}} the spherical member and each having a through opening that is substantially coaxial with the spherical member through opening, and a partially threaded fastener that <b>threadably</b> engages each mounting bracket forming the mounting assembly. Structural members have axial end portions, each releasably coupled to a mounting bracket by the integrally threaded shaft. Axial end portions are threaded in opposite directions for permitting structural member rotation to adjust a length thereof to a substantially zero strain position. Structural members may be vibration isolator struts in vibration isolation systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{vacuum system}} (20) {{includes}} an enclosure (22) having a vacuum-tight wall (26) and an internally threaded aperture (66) {{through the wall}} (26). A tip-off fitting (24) has a base (50) with a bore (52) therethrough, a hollow tube (62) fixed to the base (50) with a vacuum-tight seal, such that an interior (64) of the tube (62) is in communication with the bore (52) in the base (50), and an external thread (58) on {{the exterior of the}} base (50). The external thread (58) on the exterior of the base (50) is dimensioned to <b>threadably</b> engage the internal thread (68) on the aperture (66). There is a disengageable vacuum sealant (70) such as a layer of indium metal between the external thread (58) of the base (50) and the internal thread (68) of the aperture (66). The vacuum system (20) is evacuated through the tip-off fitting (24) and sealed by closing off the hollow tube (62). At a later time, the vacuum system can be brought to atmospheric pressure and then reseated by replacing the tip-off fitting with another tip-off fitting and repeating the evacuation and sealing...|$|E
