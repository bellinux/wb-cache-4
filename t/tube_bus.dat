40|$|Abstract. The corona {{characteristic}} of HVDC <b>tube</b> <b>bus</b> {{is the main}} factor taken into account for choosing <b>tube</b> <b>bus</b> of HVDC converter substation. The intension of corona could affect the electromagnetic environment of converter station and generate audible noise. By establishing the calculation models of electric field strength along the <b>tube</b> <b>bus</b> surface and the electric field strength on ground, the paper computes the corona onset voltage gradient and gives the relation curve of high and electrode spacing of <b>tube</b> <b>bus.</b> If the <b>tube</b> <b>bus</b> in HVDC converter substation is installed at the high and electrode spacing, got by the relation curve, it will not generate corona and its electric field strength will meet the requirements. The control indexes of <b>tube</b> <b>bus</b> corona characteristic parameters for HVDC converter substation are confirmed in combination with calculation results and related standards. Based on the control indexes, the paper gives the collocations of different <b>tube</b> <b>bus</b> types...|$|E

40|$|The thesis at hand {{examines}} {{knowledge transfer}} in cross-border strategic alliances of software companies. The {{purpose of the}} thesis is to provide theoretical foundations for a proposed cluster initiative (Asia Software Competence Project) and a software system innovation, ANIS (Alliance Network Information System). The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the strategic management context and the following three chapters the dimensions of epistemology, ontology and culture as relevant to this thesis. Epistemology is concerned about how knowledge is acquired and processed while the ontological dimension is here used to refer to the different levels of social interaction in an organizational setting (individual, team, organization and interorganizational levels). The third dimension, culture, is a significant source of ambiguity in knowledge transfer in cross-border context. The core contribution of the thesis is the conceptual development through describing the 4 -Tier Tube -model as the model of knowledge transfer and alliance learning in cross-border strategic alliance context.

50|$|The OS has {{calls to}} handle {{reading and writing}} to all I/O (ports and screen memory) and programmers are {{strongly}} advised to use these by the Acorn documentation. The {{reason for this is}} that when a second processor is installed, user software is run from the separate memory map on the far side of the <b>Tube</b> processor <b>bus,</b> and direct access to memory-mapped I/O registers and video memory is impossible. However, for the sake of performance, many apps including many games write directly to main address space for I/O, and hence crash or give you a blank screen if a 6502 second processor is attached. One such performance-critical area is sprite support; the BBC Micro hardware does not support sprites and games must implement sprites in software. In practice, the widespread use of direct access in place of the OS calls very rarely caused difficulties. Second processor units were expensive and very little software was written to make use of them, so few people bought them, and those who did have them could simply switch them off or unplug the cable if a problem arose.|$|R

5000|$|A typical {{alternating}} current furnace {{is powered by}} a three-phase electrical supply and therefore has three electrodes. Electrodes are round in section, and typically in segments with threaded couplings, so that as the electrodes wear, new segments can be added. The arc forms between the charged material and the electrode, the charge is heated both by current passing through the charge and by the radiant energy evolved by the arc. The electric arc temperature reaches around 3000 °C (5000 °F), thus causing the lower sections of the electrodes glow incandescently when in operation. The electrodes are automatically raised and lowered by a positioning system, which may use either electric winch hoists or hydraulic cylinders. The regulating system maintains approximately constant current and power input during the melting of the charge, even though scrap may move under the electrodes as it melts. The mast arms holding the electrodes can either carry heavy busbars (which may be hollow water-cooled copper pipes carrying current to the electrode clamps) or be [...] "hot arms", where the whole arm carries the current, increasing efficiency. Hot arms can be made from copper-clad steel or aluminium. Large water-cooled cables connect the <b>bus</b> <b>tubes</b> or arms with the transformer located adjacent to the furnace. The transformer is installed in a vault and is water-cooled.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the design of}} the Legible London pedestrian wayfinding system. Overseen by Transport for London (TfL), this innovative scheme for enabling walking has developed from an early prototype study in 2007 to become a key part of transport policy in the UK’s capital city (AIG 2006, 2007; Arquati 2008; TfL 2014). An integrated combination of signs, pedestrian focused mapping and other directional information, Legible London has two complementary aims; to help people plan journeys on foot; and to give people the confidence to walk and explore. The scheme consists of a city-wide, consistent, pedestrian navigation system encompassing on-street wayfinding elements supported by identical information in public transport nodes (e. g. <b>tube</b> stations and <b>bus</b> stops) and paper based products as well as ongoing development of the provision of digital mapping information. The current on-street system is comprised of a mixture of information boards, known as ‘liths’ that come in a standardised range of sizes (see Figure 3. 1), directional fingerposts, wall mounted signs and a range of supporting printed maps located in bus stops and inside tube stations. Information on all liths is presented in a hierarchical fashion: a top yellow beacon locates the sign in busy urban environments, directional information is given to nearby points of interest (replicating traditional finger signs), whilst differently scaled ‘planner’ and ‘finder’ maps locate the lith within 15 minute and 5 minute walk scales respectively. A street index also is provided...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Mr. Scogan. [...] "I for one, {{without ever}} having had the {{slightest}} appreciation of painting, have always taken particular pleasure in Cubismus. I like to see pictures from which nature has been completely banished, pictures which are exclusively {{the product of the}} human mind. They give me the same pleasure as I derive from a good piece of reasoning or a mathematical problem or an achievement of engineering. Nature, or anything that reminds me of nature, disturbs me; it is too large, too complicated, above all too utterly pointless and incomprehensible. I am at home with the works of man; if I choose to set my mind to it, I can understand anything that any man has made or thought. That is why I always travel by <b>Tube,</b> never by <b>bus</b> if I can possibly help it. For, travelling by bus, one can't avoid seeing, even in London, a few stray works of God--the sky, for example, an occasional tree, the flowers in the window-boxes. But travel by Tube and you see nothing but the works of man--iron riveted into geometrical forms, straight lines of concrete, patterned expanses of tiles. All is human and the product of friendly and comprehensible minds. All philosophies and all religions--what are they but spiritual Tubes bored through the universe! Through these narrow tunnels, where all is recognisably human, one travels comfortable and secure, contriving to forget that all round and below and above them stretches the blind mass of earth, endless and unexplored. Yes, give me the Tube and Cubismus every time; give me ideas, so snug and neat and simple and well made. And preserve me from nature, preserve me from all that's inhumanly large and complicated and obscure. I haven't the courage, and, above all, I haven't the time to start wandering in that labyrinth." ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to discover the use made by old people of postal and telephone services and also their personal health and social contacts. Main Topics : Section on telephone ownership and use: reason for having telephone installed, whether respondent's telephone bills are subsidised, if so, from what source. (If respondent has no telephone, nearest telephone to his home (6 categories), whether anyone is available to take messages or fetch him to the telephone and whether respondent has ever owned a telephone, is recorded.) Data are given on the use made of telephone during last year (i. e. frequency of use, whether respondent receives more calls than he makes, person to whom he most often speaks on telephone). Any difficulty in actually using a telephone is recorded (6 categories - e. g. deafness, fear of telephones etc.). Finally, if respondent could choose between having an extra $ 20 per annum and having a free telephone, which he would prefer. Use of post: whether respondent writes letters, if so, to whom he most often writes, frequency of writing, whether he receives more personal letters than he sends. The address of the person with whom he is most in postal contact is recorded. Main difficulty respondent experiences when writing letters is recorded (i. e. poor eyesight, illiteracy etc. - 5 categories) and, finally, respondent is asked whether he would like to receive more letters (3 -point scale). Personal physical information: state of eyesight and hearing of respondent is given (4 categories for each), whether he suffers from any disability which makes it difficult to go out (if yes, nature of disability is recorded together with length of time he has suffered). Whether respondent is able to go out unaided, if so, how often. Frequency of use of various methods of transportation (8 categories - e. g. train, bus, invalid carriage etc.), whether the railway station, <b>tube</b> station (London), <b>bus</b> stop, post office, local shopping centre, doctor, are within walking distance of respondent's home. Frequency of visits to clubs, cinema, bingo and places of religious worship are also given (over past year) and, finally, whether respondent would like to go out more often. Social contacts: number of children, brothers and sisters still alive, other relatives and friends respondent is still in contact with, whether he has seen any of them in last week or month, whether any live within a ten-mile radius (information given is precisely defined), respondent is asked whether he would like to see children, relatives or friends more often, also whether he considers neighbours to be friendly (3 -point scale) and whether he has chatted with neighbours in past week - or to any of the people already talked about (i. e. children relatives, friends). The number of these people who have telephones is recorded. Amount of time spent alone (5 categories). Problem considered by respondent to be the greatest facing elderly people (i. e. lack of money, loneliness or boredom). Whether respondent prefers to use telephone or letter for keeping in touch with someone he cannot see regularly. Whether respondent is ever lonely (3 -point scale). Readiness of access to help in case of emergency (9 categories). Finally, respondent's attitudes towards devices for calling help, such as bells, whistles etc. are assessed on a 3 -point scale. Ownership of television, radio, record player, refrigerator, washing machine and motor vehicle recorded. As a 'coda' to the survey, respondents' knowledge of the Samaritan Organization is tested (i. e. whether they have heard of the Samaritans, perception of their role, whether they know where the nearest branch is or know the telephone number) ...|$|R
