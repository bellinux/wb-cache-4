An automatic tape <b>laying</b> <b>machine</b> can shorten the process cycle by stacking prepreg flat and thereafter allow for forming into desired shapes. Forming of stacked prepreg requires knowledge about the uncured properties of prepreg, such as viscosity of the matrix, intra- and interply deformation properties. This study focuses on the interply friction, i. e. the friction at the prepreg-prepreg interface, and how this affects the forming. The conclusions presented here show {{that the difference between}} prepreg material systems is significant. Further, it is concluded that the prepreg-prepreg friction is governed by a combination of Coulomb and hydrodynamic friction, where different mechanical phenomena dominate depending on the test conditions.

The proposed FUZZY P+ID controller was implemented in the constant tension towing winch to substitute for the existing PID controller.

50|$|Since the {{effectiveness}} of a roller depends to a large extent on its weight, self-powered vehicles replaced horse-drawn rollers from the mid-19th century. The first such vehicles were steam rollers. Single-cylinder steam rollers were generally used for base compaction and run with high engine revs in a low gear to promote bounce and vibration from the crankshaft through to the rolls {{in much the same way}} as a vibrating roller. The double cylinder or compound steam rollers became popular from around 1910 onwards and were used mainly for the rolling of hot-laid surfaces due to their smoother running engines, but both cylinder types are capable of rolling the finished surface. Steam rollers were often dedicated to a task by their gearing as the slower engines were for base compaction whereas the higher geared models were often referred to as 'chip chasers' which followed behind the hot tar and chipping <b>laying</b> <b>machines.</b> Some road companies in the United States used steamrollers through the 1950s, and in the UK, some remained in commercial service until the early 1970s.|$|R

The adaptation of the paper mulch to pineapple culture has been a very simple matter, requiring only slight deviation from planting methods already in vogue. A suitable bed of earth is first prepared to receive a row of pineapples; the paper is then applied to this bed in long strips, its edges being held down by a covering of soil; and the pineapple plants are inserted through holes made in the paper at proper intervals. Up to the present time, the preparation of the bed and the laying of the paper has been done by hand and, consequently, at considerable expense. The machine illustrated herewith prepares the bed, lays the paper and covers its edges in one operation and at very moderate expense. It may be drawn by mules or by a light tractor. There are three essential parts to this machine, each part performing a definite function: (1) A plank drag-sled which pulverizes the soil and forms it into a bed of the desired shaped to receive the paper; (2) A flanged roller or spool which is attached {{to the rear of the}} sled and shapes the paper over the bed, tuning its edges down into the furrows made by the sled runners; and (3) Shovels or disks which are placed just back of the flanged ends of the roller and which serve to throw the soil against and over the edges of the paper. The sled may be modified to draw the soil into a bed of any shape desired. The spool should be shaped to conform to the crown of the bed, its barrel being cylindrical if the top of the bed is to be flat and concave if the top of the bed is to be curved"...|$|R

40|$|Prepreg-based {{materials}} {{currently used}} in high-end applications {{as well as}} SMC/BMC-based materials used in automotive body panels {{are not likely to}} lead the future growth in the application of fibre-reinforced composites in primary as well as secondary vehicle structures. Out-of-autoclave techniques based on rapid fibre preforming and part consolidation will drive the structural composites applications in aerospace and automotive sectors. Fibre preforming has been identified as a key bottleneck in the composites supply chain, considering recent growth predictions in civil airframe and automotive markets. Automated Tape <b>Laying</b> <b>machines</b> have modest deposition rates, and global autoclave capacity is not likely to cope with projected growth rates in composites. This paper investigates the potential for near-net preforming using conventional textile technology as well as robotic approaches. Robotic or multi-axial machines have been shown to extend the preforming capability of weaving, braiding and stitching concepts. A multi-axial weaving machine, equipped with automated trimming of non-interlaced tows, can create 3 D woven preforms tapered in width as well as length directions. 3 D preforms with through-thickness reinforcement have been created with a robotic system equipped with dry fibre lay-up and tufting capability. A 9 -axis complex winding machine in conjunction with braiding has been demonstrated for preforming over complex mandrels. KEYWORDS...|$|R
40|$|Automated fiber {{placement}} is {{a manufacturing}} process used for producing complex composite structures. It is a notable leap to the state-of-the-art in technology for automated composite manufacturing. The fiber placement capability was {{established at the}} Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC) Productivity Enhancement Complex in 1992 in collaboration with Thiokol Corporation to provide materials and processes research and development, and to fabricate components {{for many of the}} Center's Programs. The Fiber Placement System (FPX) was developed as a distinct solution to problems inherent to other automated composite manufacturing systems. This equipment provides unique capabilities to build composite parts in complex 3 -D shapes with concave and other asymmetrical configurations. Components with complex geometries and localized reinforcements usually require labor intensive efforts resulting in expensive, less reproducible components; the fiber placement system has the features necessary to overcome these conditions. The mechanical systems of the equipment have the motion characteristics of a filament winder and the fiber lay-up attributes of a tape <b>laying</b> <b>machine,</b> with the additional capabilities of differential tow payout speeds, compaction and cut-restart to selectively place the correct number of fibers where the design dictates. This capability will produce a repeatable process resulting in lower cost and improved quality and reliability...|$|R
40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{rotary machine}} with multi-supporting, such as rotary kiln and rope <b>laying</b> <b>machine,</b> {{is the key}} equipment in the architectural, chemistry, and agriculture industries. The body, rollers, wheels, and bearings constitute a chain multibody system. Axis line deflection is a vital parameter to determine mechanics state of rotary machine, thus body axial vibration needs to be studied for dynamic monitoring and adjusting of rotary machine. By using the Riccati transfer matrix method, the body system of rotary machine is divided into many subsystems composed of three elements, namely, rigid disk, elastic shaft, and linear spring. Multiple wheel-bearing structures are simplified as springs. The transfer matrices of the body system and overall transfer equation are developed, {{as well as the}} response overall motion equation. Taken a rotary kiln as an instance, natural frequencies, modal shape, and response vibration with certain exciting axis line deflection are obtained by numerical computing. The body vibration modal curves illustrate the cause of dynamical errors in the common axis line measurement methods. The displacement response can be used for further measurement dynamical error analysis and compensation. The response overall motion equation could be applied to predict the body motion under abnormal mechanics condition, and provide theory guidance for machine failure diagnosis...|$|R

After extensive research, the 3rd Directorate of the 708th Institute (708所3室) begun design work in October 1963, but reviews revealed that there are some inadequacy in the design, so two new modified design was created in February 1964. The biggest change of the modified designs is that the original cable carrying capacity is limited to 155 tons in a single cargo hold compartment with cable length of 40 km at maximum. In the modified design, this is increased to 270 tons in two cargo hold compartments with cable length of 40 km at maximum. The diameter of the cable remained unchanged at 40 mm. On August 2, 1965, the 6th Ministry approved the design of Type 991. In March 1966, some final modification begun at Wuchang Shipyard, where the ship was planned to be built, and this final modification was completed in June 1966.
