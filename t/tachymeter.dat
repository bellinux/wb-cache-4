50|$|A <b>tachymeter</b> tuh- {{scale is}} a scale {{sometimes}} inscribed {{around the rim}} of an analog watch. It {{can be used to}} compute a speed based on travel time or measure distance based on speed. The spacings between the marks on the <b>tachymeter</b> dial are therefore proportional to 1/t where t is the elapsed time.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} {{performed by}} a <b>tachymeter</b> is independent of the unit of distance (e.g. statute miles, nautical miles, kilometres, metres etc.) {{as long as the}} same unit of length is used for all calculations. It {{can also be used to}} measure an industrial production process in units per hour. A <b>tachymeter</b> is simply a means of converting elapsed time (in seconds per unit) to speed (in units per hour).|$|E
50|$|Some <b>tachymeter</b> {{scales are}} on a rotating, indexed bezel. This allows two {{additional}} modes of use: The <b>tachymeter</b> bezel can be aligned with a free running second hand, and, more subtly, {{can be used to}} find the average speed over longer times/distances. Set the rotary bezel index to the position of the minute hand, note the current mileage/distance. Glance at the position of the minute hand on the <b>tachymeter</b> scale 60 units of distance later, and average speed will be indicated. A little mental math allows interim averages, easiest at 1/4 (15 unit) and other integer values. Alternatively, instead of using minute hand, align index bezel to the second hand and observe passing one unit of distance when position of the second hand will then indicate average speed.|$|E

Subsequently, the unknown nonverticality of the chimney is determined as the deviation of the primary axis of the modelled body from the vertical...|$|R
5000|$|A {{chronograph}} is {{a specific}} type of watch that is used as a stopwatch combined with a display watch. A basic chronograph has an independent sweep second hand; it can be started, stopped, and returned to zero by successive pressure on the stem. Less simple chronographs use additional complications and can have multiple independent hands to measure seconds, minutes, hours and even tenths of a second. In addition, many modern chronographs use moveable bezels as <b>tachymeters</b> for rapid calculations of speed or distance. Louis Moinet invented the chronograph in 1816 for use in tracking astronomical objects. [...] Chronographs were also used heavily in artillery fire in the mid to late 1800s. More modern uses of chronographs involve piloting airplanes, car racing, diving and submarine maneuvering.|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{terrestrial}} geodetic surveying methods, such as precision triangulation, traversing and geometric levelling, {{have been}} present at the displacement monitoring systems {{of the majority of}} the Portuguese concrete and masonry large dams, since the 1940 ’s. In spite of the widespread use of displacement measurement instruments, such as pendulum and rockmeters, geodetic surveying methods continue to be used in the displacement monitoring systems because they provide: i) An independent control of the other methods; ii) A global relation between the dam, its foundation and the surrounding terrain. The Geodetic Measurement Division (GMD) of the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering, which is involved in dam surveillance activity since the 1950 ’s, is responsible for planning and observation of geodetic surveying systems for more than fifty large dams.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for up-to-date tree data in city parks and forests are increasing, {{and an important}} {{question is how to}} keep the digital databases current for various applications. Traditional map-updating procedures, such as visual interpretation of digital aerial images or field measurements using <b>tachymeters,</b> are either inaccurate or expensive. Recently, the development of laser-scanning technology has opened new opportunities for tree mapping and attributes updating. For a detailed measurement and attributes update of urban trees, we tested the use of a multisource single-tree inventory (MS-STI) for heterogeneous urban forest conditions. MS-STI requires an existing tree map as input information in addition to airborne laser-scanning (ALS) data. In our study, the tested input tree map was produced by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and by using a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Tree attributes were either measured from ALS or predicted by using metrics extracted from ALS data. Stem diameter-at-breast height (DBH) was predicted and compared to the field measures, and tree height and crown area were directly measured from ALS data at the two different urban-forest areas. The results indicate that MS-STI can be used for updating urban-forest attributes. The accuracies of DBH estimations were improved compared to the existing attribute information in the city of Helsinki’s urban-tree register. In addition, important attributes, such as tree height and crown dimensions, were extracted from ALS and added as attributes to the urban-tree register...|$|R

50|$|The watch {{models of}} Carl F. Bucherer are {{distinguished}} by their additional functions including the chronograph, flyback, <b>tachymeter,</b> tourbillon {{as well as}} indicators and displays such as big date and day, power reserve, 24 hours, moon phases, three time zones, calendar, and perpetual calendar.|$|E
50|$|For {{events that}} happen either very quickly or slowly, one can adjust the sixty-second <b>tachymeter</b> scale {{commonly}} found on watches. Smaller fractional units {{can be used}} for slower objects, like runners, turtles and snails, but the same X/hour function remains constant. The scale on a watch is only valid for things that happen in 60 seconds or fewer, and the scale is also difficult to resolve for events that take fewer than 10 seconds or so to occur. As an example, if it takes 100 seconds to eat an apple, cutting that number in half allows one to say that it takes 50 seconds to eat half an apple. Using the <b>tachymeter</b> scale one can calculate that 72 half apples (36 whole apples) could be eaten in one hour. Some watches,not common, have 'wraparound' or 'scroll' scales, which extend the readings to lower speeds, typically 45 units.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} <b>tachymeter</b> scale only calculates the average speed.As a second example, {{if it takes}} 20 seconds to travel one unit of {{distance}}, then the average speed on the watch used {{for the purpose of}} the picture only is 180 units of distance per hour (examine the picture of the watch which is here to simplify the idea, actual tachymeters may vary slightly).|$|E
5000|$|The Autavia {{chronograph}} {{was introduced}} in 1962 and featured a rotating bezel, marked in either hours, minutes, decimal minutes (1/100th minute increments), or with a <b>tachymeter</b> scale. All manual-wind Autavias from the 1960s had a black dial, with white registers. Early cases had a screw-back and later models (from and after 1968) had snap-backs. The [...] "Autavia" [...] name had previously been used on Heuer's dashboard timers (described above).|$|E
50|$|Metered bezels: Many chronographs have a bezel, that {{is either}} fixed or can rotate, {{around the outside}} of the dial that is marked to {{specific}} scales to allow rapid calculations. While any wristwatch can have a bezel, the chronograph stop start feature, as well as the rotation of the bezel, allows more complex calculations or repeated measurements for a series of calculations. The most popular meter is for <b>Tachymeter</b> readings: a simple scale that allows rapid calculations of speed. Other bezels feature Telemeter scale, for distance. The watchmaking company Breitling offers a model with a rotating bezel, in conjunction with another, fixed, meter on the dial, scaled for use as a slide rule for more complex calculations.|$|E
5000|$|A tachymeter-equipped watch {{can be used}} {{to measure}} {{distance}} by timing the travel over the distance while the speed is held constant. The <b>tachymeter</b> scale is rotated to align with the second hand {{at the start of the}} length to be measured. When the second hand reaches the point on the scale where the speed indicated equals the speed of the vehicle, one unit of distance (miles if speed is miles per hour, kilometres if kilometres per hour, etc.) has been covered. For example, if you travel at a constant 80 mph (or at 80 km/h), then the distance travelled while the second hand sweeps to [...] "80" [...] (45 seconds) will be exactly 1 mile (or 1 kilometre at 80 km/h).|$|E
5000|$|The Speedmaster was not {{originally}} designed for space exploration. Instead, {{it was introduced}} in 1957 as a sport and racing chronograph following on from the early chronographs of the 1920s and 1930s, including the Omega 28.9 chronograph, which was Omega's first small wrist chronograph, complementing Omega's position as the official timekeeper for the Olympic Games. The first Speedmaster model, the reference CK 2915, was powered by the Omega Calibre 321 movement. This movement was developed in 1946 by Albert Piguet of Lémania, which had been acquired in 1932 by Omega's parent company, Société Suisse pour l'Industrie Horlogère, (SSIH). The [...] "Speedmaster" [...] name was coined from the model's novel <b>tachymeter</b> scale bezel (in brushed stainless steel) and by the convention set by prior Omega brands Seamaster and Railmaster. The model established the series's hallmark 12-hour, triple-register chronograph layout, domed Plexiglas crystal (named Hésalite), and simple, high-contrast index markers; but, unlike most subsequent Speedmaster models, it used Omega's broad arrow hand set. In 1959, a second version, CK 2998, was released with a black aluminum base 1000 bezel and later in 2998-2, <b>tachymeter</b> 500 bezel and alpha hands. This was again updated in 1963 by references ST 105.002, which kept the alpha hands and then {{less than one year}} later ST 105.003 with straight baton hands and ST 105.012, the first Speedmaster with the [...] "Professional" [...] appellation on the dial, with an asymmetrical case to protect the chronograph pushers and crown. All of the early Speedmasters used the same Calibre 321 movement, which was only replaced in 1968/1969 with the introduction of the Calibre 861 movement, used in the [...] "Moon watch". The watches used for Apollo 11's mission were the 1967 [...] "pre-Moon" [...] 321 versions.|$|E
50|$|Mobile lidar (also mobile laser scanning) is {{when two}} or more {{scanners}} are attached to a moving vehicle to collect data along a path. These scanners are almost always paired with other kinds of equipment, including GNSS receivers and IMUs. One example application is surveying streets, where power lines, exact bridge heights, bordering trees, etc. all {{need to be taken}} into account. Instead of collecting each of these measurements individually in the field with a <b>tachymeter,</b> a 3D model from a point cloud can be created where all of the measurements needed can be made, depending {{on the quality of the}} data collected. This eliminates the problem of forgetting to take a measurement, so long as the model is available, reliable and has an appropriate level of accuracy.|$|E
5000|$|In the early-1950s, Heuer {{produced}} watches for the American retailer Abercrombie & Fitch. The [...] "Seafarer" [...] and [...] "Auto-Graph" [...] were chronographs {{produced by}} Heuer {{to be sold}} by Abercrombie & Fitch. The [...] "Seafarers" [...] had special dials—with blue, green and yellow patterns—that showed {{the high and low}} tides. This dial could also be used to track the phases of the moon. Heuer produced a version of the [...] "Seafarer" [...] for sale under the Heuer name, with this model called the [...] "Mareographe". The [...] "Auto-Graph" [...] was produced in 1953 and 1954, and featured a <b>tachymeter</b> scale on the dial and a hand that could be preset to a specific point on the scale. This allowed a rally driver or navigator to determine whether the car was achieving the desired pace, over a measured mile. Advertisements and literature also pointed out that this hand could be rotated to count golf scores or other events.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1968, Omega transitioned {{the caliber}} 321 {{movement}} to the new caliber 861, also designed by Albert Piguet, {{with the introduction of}} the reference 145.022 Speedmaster. The 861 was very similar to the 321, but replaced its column wheel switching mechanism with a cam and increased the beat rate from 18,000 to 21,600 vibrations per hour. Most Speedmaster Professional watches from 1968 to the present have used variants of this movement, including the modern rhodium-plated caliber 1861 and decorated exhibition calibers 863 and 1863. A standard Speedmaster Professional model with Plexiglas crystal, solid caseback with anti-vibration and anti-magnetic dust cover, <b>tachymeter</b> scale, without date or day complications, and powered by a caliber 861-based movement has been continuously produced since. The tritium-powered phosphorescent lume on the hands and index markers of the original watches were replaced {{at the end of the}} 1990s with non-radioactive pigments, but the fundamental design, dimensions, and mechanism of these watches have remained unchanged. In this form, the basic Speedmaster line has remained flight-qualified for NASA space missions and EVAs, after re-evaluation by NASA in 1972 and for use in the Space Shuttle program in 1978. The current such model is reference 311.30.42.30.01.005 (since 2014).|$|E
5000|$|Analog diving watches {{will often}} feature a {{rotating}} , {{that allows for}} an easier reading of elapsed time of under one hour from a specific point. This is used to compute {{the length of a}} dive. (See <b>Tachymeter.)</b> Upon entering the water, the diver aligns the zero on the bezel with the minute (or sometimes second) hand, allowing the elapsed time to be read from the bezel. This saves the diver having to remember the exact water entry moment and having to perform arithmetic that would be necessary if the watch's regular dial was used.On diving watches the bezel is [...] "unidirectional", i.e., it contains a ratchet so it can only be turned anti-clockwise to increase the apparent elapsed time, should the bezel be unintentionally rotated further during the dive. This is an important [...] "fail safe" [...] feature. If the bezel could be turned clockwise, this could suggest to a diver that the elapsed time is shorter than reality, thus indicating a falsely short elapsed time reading, and therefore falsely short saturation period, an assumption that can be highly dangerous.Some diving watch models feature a lockable bezel to minimize the chance of unintentional bezel operation under water.|$|E

More time with a more sophisticated equipment (aerial imagery, <b>tachymeter</b> etc.) will improve the drawing. The main structure measures some 50 x 90 m, i.e. is c. 4000 m2 in surface area. It lies as much as high as 50 m above the surrounding wadi. 100 m to the SW lies a garden (Fig. 1), which supported the population in antiquity. The site is built adjacent to a low area. The west and south flanks are protected by the wadi and its steep slope (see the section in Fig. 1). Walls range up to 2 m in height. Upslope, the houses have walls up to 80 cm in thickness. At key points there are irregularly shaped towers which a thicker wall diameter. The gate construction is not preserved. It leads the visitor into the village via corridors. In the south-east the irregular wall 2 is preserved up to 1 m in height. Further uphill, the heavier wall 3 encloses the core. In its midst les a ruined Umm an-Nar tomb of some 7 m diameter. A large wall (no. 1) thwarts the site from the mountain to the north-east to the wadi in the south-west. This seems to be of recent date. The building of the road and the water in the wadi transsect this wall. It ranges from 60 cm to 2 m in height.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} know how to use a <b>tachymeter</b> to help with {{measuring}} speed and distance traveled, {{it is important to know}} what a <b>tachymeter</b> is. <b>Tachymeter</b> Definition The circular dial seen on many watches is called a <b>tachymeter.</b> It is only installed on analog watches and has a variety of useful functions. The tiny dials and buttons on the sides of the watch operate the measuring scale. The <b>tachymeter</b> is a scale that measures speed. It also has the ability to measure distance travelled and at which speed it was traveled. The scale on this watch design has also been known to be used as a way to measure industrial production lines. To do this, the <b>tachymeter</b> can measure this at units processed per hour. The aim of its design and overall function is to use elapsed time and transfer it into speed. To illustrate, seconds for each unit into units processed each hour. This particular function can also be utilized as a stop watch for races. Watch Designs Watches with this type of scale are often made with stainless steel and come in different colors such as with a rose gold watch strap or even a stainless watch face with nato-style watch bands...|$|E
30|$|Within the {{measurements}} of track axis coordinates (optionally stretch of rails), the problem {{resulting from the}} transformation can be eliminated. Frequently, the track axis is measured with a tachymeter referring to the surveying grid-fixed points. This procedure is performed locally and involves the individual parts of a route. Thus, the coordinates of the prism (set by the crew in the track axis) are determined by a stationary <b>tachymeter</b> (placed on the fixed point). Alternatively, the prisms are stationary (on fixed points) while the <b>tachymeter</b> is moved along the track, at this time the coordinates of the total station are defined [2]. However, the locally measured coordinates require adjustments. As a result, additional errors may appear and the assessment of the geometrical layout of the track becomes problematic, especially for the long sections of the railway route.|$|E
