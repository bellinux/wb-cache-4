At 8:00a.m., Scouts all over the world renewed their Scout promise, with a focus on making the world a better and more peaceful place.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sunrise</b> Dance Ceremony is not {{an ancient}} Yavapai ceremony. Apache and Yavapai often intermarried and adopted {{elements}} of each other's cultures; these two tribes reside together on the Camp Verde and Fort McDowell reservations. <b>The</b> <b>Sunrise</b> Dance is a four-day rite-of-transition for young Apache girls, which typically takes place from March through October. <b>The</b> <b>sunrise</b> dance is an ancient practice, unique to the Apache. It {{is related to the}} myth of the Changing Woman, a powerful figure in Apache culture who is believed to grant longevity. The power of Changing Woman is transferred to the pubescent girl through songs sung by the Medicine Man. A medicine man is joined by other tribal members in singing a series of songs, up to 32 which are believed to have first been sung by Changing Woman.|$|E

5|$|A pure browser, {{the lesser}} kudu feeds on foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs, and herbs. Despite {{seasonal}} and local variations, foliage from {{trees and shrubs}} constitute 60–80% of the diet throughout the year. The lesser kudu is mainly active at night and during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after <b>the</b> <b>sunrise.</b> The lesser kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur {{at any time of}} the year. The lesser kudu inhabits dry, flat, and heavily forested regions.|$|E

5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in <b>the</b> <b>sunrise</b> or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} line-of-sight.|$|E

The crocodile, named Croc, grows, eventually becoming much larger than the Gobbos.|$|E

5|$|NY454 {{continues}} as a four-lane arterial {{through a large}} commercial district, intersecting with CR93 (Lakeland Avenue). There, the highway passes Long Island MacArthur Airport and bends to the east through another large commercial district remaining unchanged for several miles. The route turns to the southeast at Coates Avenue as a four-lane arterial {{for the last two}} miles (3.2km) of NY454. About three miles (4.8km) from Lakeland Avenue, NY454 connects to <b>the</b> <b>Sunrise</b> Highway (NY27) at exit51, a partial interchange in Holbrook. Here, the NY454 designation ends and its right-of-way merges into the eastbound service road of NY27. There is no access to westbound Sunrise Highway from NY454 itself; instead, the connection is made by way of nearby Broadway Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, a {{study of}} how to handle Long Island traffic issues in 2020, was started in 1997 by {{engineers}} from NYSDOT. The preferred alternative in the study would widen several parkways on the island, inserting high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) for buses and carpools. The Meadowbrook would receive a new HOV lane between the Southern and Northern state parkways, while everything south of the Southern State Parkway would remain the same. The Northern State Parkway would get lanes from the Long Island Expressway to the Meadowbrook, and the Southern State would get lanes from the Meadowbrook to <b>the</b> <b>Sunrise</b> Highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{core of the}} Mundo Perdido was an E-Group astronomical complex. The east stairway of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) was {{the observation}} point and the three original temples on the East Platform (5D-84, 5D-86 and 5D-88) were markers used to plot <b>the</b> <b>sunrise</b> on the equinoxes and the solstices.

50|$|Due to {{a normal}} {{atmospheric}} refraction, sunrise occurs shortly before the Sun crosses above the horizon. Light from the Sun is bent, or refracted, as it enters earth's atmosphere. This effect causes <b>the</b> apparent <b>sunrise</b> to be earlier than <b>the</b> actual <b>sunrise.</b> Similarly, apparent sunset occurs slightly later than actual sunset.|$|R
5|$|When {{asked by}} {{the staff of the}} {{magazine}} Animerica if the anime was influenced by Western superheros like Spider-Man or Batman, Taniguchi denied that influence. Instead, he said his inspirations for s-CRY-ed were other works he had produced for Sunrise. The society shown in the series was not meant to be another take on classic superheroes but instead investigate how everyone can adapt to their own situation. While the series is known for the extensive action in its episodes, the director believes everything he wanted viewers to see was presented. To distinguish the HOLY members, <b>the</b> <b>Sunrise</b> staff researched the costumes they could design. Taniguchi said their outfits are meant to resemble prison uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan was shelved, {{the need for a}} highway in western Nassau County still existed. In 1963, the Department of Public Works revived the project; however, the routing was altered to extend from <b>the</b> <b>Sunrise</b> Highway (NY27) north to an intersection with CR101 (Middle Neck Road) in Sands Point. Part of the route would use modern NY101 and the right-of-way of an abandoned Long Island Rail Road line. In 1971, several proposed crossings of the Long Island Sound were studied. One crossing, a bridge connecting Sands Point to New Rochelle to Westchester County, may have become a northward extension of the highway if it was constructed. By 1971, though, hopes had begun to fade on the highway's prospects of becoming reality. Even if construction had begun in that year, the highway would not be open to traffic until 1975. The project was eventually shelved.|$|E
5|$|The good {{preservation}} of the texts in Unas' pyramid shows that they were arranged {{so as to be}} read by the Ba of Unas, as it arose from the sarcophagus thanks to resurrection utterances and surrounded by protective spells and ritual offerings. The Ba would then leave the burial chamber, which incorporates texts identifying the king with Osiris in the Duat, and would move to the antechamber symbolizing the Akhet. Included in the spells written {{on the walls of the}} antechamber of Unas are two utterances known as the Cannibal Hymn, which portrays the pharaoh as flying to heaven through a stormy sky and eating both gods and men. In doing so the king would receive the life force of the gods. At this point the Ba of Unas would face east, the direction of <b>the</b> <b>sunrise,</b> and beyond the pyramid masonry, the false door of the mortuary temple where funerary rituals were performed. Finally, turning left the Ba would join Ra in the sky by passing through the pyramid corridor.|$|E

5|$|Tour dates {{were limited}} to cities in Europe and North America. This {{decision}} caused some resentment among fans {{in other parts of}} the world. Drowned World became the first (and only) Madonna tour to skip over Canada completely. For many weeks prior to the launch of the tour dates, Arthur Fogel from Live Nation himself attempted to book dates in Toronto at the Air Canada Centre between <b>the</b> <b>Sunrise,</b> Atlanta, and Detroit dates, though no free bookings were available. In the end no dates were scheduled in Toronto, to the disappointment of many Canadian fans. Ticket sales were swift in London on April 25, as Madonna sold out her dates at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in record time– six shows in six hours. Madonna made history with the fastest-selling show ever at Earl's Court, as 97,000 tickets were sold.|$|E
5|$|Various {{memorial}} or tourist route designations {{have been}} applied to US23 in the state since the 1980s. The highway {{has been a part}} of the Lake Huron Circle Tour since the creation of the Great Lakes Circle Tours in 1986. The non-freeway section was designated <b>the</b> <b>Sunrise</b> Side Coastal Highway by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2004 as a part of what is now the Pure Michigan Byway Program. Since 2009, it has been called the Huron Shores Heritage Route. The highway has also carried two memorial designations related to war veterans and a third related to local civic leaders since a 2001 consolidation of related legislation in the state. MDOT has listed two of the highway's bridges on its historic bridge list, one of which is also on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Future improvements to the route of US23 include a proposed northerly extension of the freeway from Standish to one of several locations along the Lake Huron shoreline. Another freeway has been proposed in the Flint area that could connect US23 directly to the south end of I-475.|$|E
