5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|Faisalabad is {{recognised}} as {{the centre}} of the textile industry in Pakistan, contributing <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> Pakistans total textile shipments. At the end of June 2012, textile mills employed 20% of the nation's workforce, and generated 1.3trillion rupees ($13.8billion) in textile products, most of which were exported to the US and Europe. While Punjab's economy is driven primarily by agriculture, the textile industry along with leather products and light engineering goods play an important role, with more than 48,000 industrial units spread across Punjab. In an effort to boost bilateral trade, Romania and Turkey have honorary-consulates in Faisalabad which enable trade links with the city.|$|E

5|$|In 1548 Charles {{declared}} an interreligio imperialis (also {{known as the}} Augsburg Interim) through which he sought to find some common ground for religious peace. This effort alienated both Protestant and Catholic princes and the papacy; even Charles, whose decree it was, was unhappy with the political and diplomatic dimensions of what amounted <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> a religious settlement. The 1551–52 sessions convened by Pope Julius III at the supposedly ecumenical Council of Trent solved none of the larger religious issues but simply restated Catholic teaching and condemned Protestant teaching as heresies.|$|E

The mutiny, on 15 February 1915, lasted nearly seven days.

The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required.

5|$|Amidst {{the flames}} and rubble, Arenberg's and Ferdinand's troops tried to storm the castle, but {{found their way}} blocked by masses of debris created by their own explosives. Furthermore, {{although}} close <b>to</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the garrison had perished in the explosion and subsequent collapse of the fortifications, those who remained offered staunch resistance by throwing rocks on the approaching attackers, causing {{a large number of}} casualties. In frustration, 40 or 50 of the attackers tied together two ladders and crawled through the sluice-ways of the garderobe (latrines) that emptied on the hillside, thus gaining access to the interior of the castle. There they killed around 20 of the defenders in fierce fighting; the remaining defenders, approximately 70 men, among them Buchner and Sudermann, the garrison commander and his lieutenant, sought refuge in the castle's keep. In this way, Ferdinand's infantry at last gained unopposed access to the fortress. Storming the castle had taken about two hours.|$|E
