5|$|Coal was {{transported by}} canal and a railway {{connection}} to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Beswick branch built in the early 1900s, {{but most of it}} was used locally, transported by road using horse and carts and motor lorries, much of it destined for the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. The company bought a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive, Bradford, from the Avonside Engine Company of Bristol in 1928 <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> wagons to the colliery siding.|$|E
5|$|Shunt surgery, usually {{performed}} by neurosurgeons, involves {{the creation of}} a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. Generally, a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion—usually due <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by stereotactic surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.|$|E
5|$|When {{delivery}} of C67 stock began in 1977, {{two pairs of}} CO/CP stock motor cars were used as pilot motor cars <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> the new stock at Ruislip Depot, and to marshall the scrap stock displaced by the new units. The C77 stock could be driven under its own power to Hammersmith Depot, as it was commissioned at Ruislip. The D78 stock was different, in that delivery was still to Ruislip, but the commissioning took place at Ealing Common Depot, and therefore pilot motor cars were needed to transfer the stock. Two pairs of CO/CP stock motor cars were allocated {{to do this in}} 1979, with a further three pairs joining them in 1980. New trains were transferred with a pilot motor car at each end, as were trains that were withdrawn for scrapping. The pilot motor cars carried large stencils at both ends, so that they would not accidentally be scrapped until their duties were complete. Three pairs of R stock motor cars were used as pilot motor cars after the R stock was scrapped. Most of the surface stock pilot motor cars were scrapped when the deliveries were complete, although one each of the CO/CP and R stock cars have been privately preserved.|$|E

25|$|One more locomotive, No. 9642, was {{withdrawn}} in 1964 and sold for scrap to Hayes Scrapyard. It {{was used for}} three years <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> other locomotives being scrapped, and was later saved for preservation.|$|E
25|$|As {{a direct}} result, {{terminating}} trains {{no longer need}} <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> {{from one side of}} the station to the other to take up their return workings, reducing turnaround times for terminating trains and improve train service punctuality and reliability.|$|E
25|$|In November 2004, Direct Rail Services (DRS) {{acquired}} four locomotives. They {{were used}} on Anglo-Scottish intermodal services, but never {{on a regular}} basis. In June 2005, the four locomotives were stored. The main reason for their lack of use was {{the need for a}} diesel <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> the train in non-electrified sidings.|$|E

40|$|Idiopathic normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus (iNPH) is {{a condition}} resulting in a symptom triad of gait ataxia, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence. Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus presents a diagnostic and management dilemma such that management involves the placement of a ventricular peritoneal (VP) <b>shunt</b> <b>to</b> which not all patients will respond. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage tests such as the lumbar puncture tap test (TT) provide a prognostic indication of response <b>to</b> <b>shunting.</b> However, determination {{of what constitutes a}} positive response <b>to</b> <b>shunting</b> is not clearly defined. While gait improvement following TT has been identified as a possible prognostic indicator, the efficacy of such measures in this clinical population has not been tested...|$|R
25|$|The shunt-ahead {{signal is}} {{normally}} mounted under the signal governing {{entry to the}} section ahead, and, as its name implies, allows a train <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> forward into the section to clear a set of points without pulling off the main starting signal, which could give a driver the false impression that the section ahead is clear.|$|E
25|$|No. 9642 was {{withdrawn}} in 1964 {{and sent to}} Hayes Scrapyard, near Bridgend. Rather than being scrapped, it was used <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> other locomotives being scrapped. It was due to be scrapped in 1967, but a last minute intervention resulted in its being bought (1968) and restored by the South Wales Pannier Group, becoming {{the first of the}} class to be preserved.|$|E
25|$|As an herbicide, paraquat acts by {{inhibiting}} photosynthesis. In light-exposed plants, it accepts electrons from photosystem I (more specifically Fd, {{which is}} presented with electrons from PS I) and transfers them to molecular oxygen. In this manner, destructive {{reactive oxygen species}} are produced. In forming these reactive oxygen species, the oxidized form of paraquat is regenerated, and is again available <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> electrons from photosystem I to restart the cycle.|$|E
50|$|A shunt turn {{is where}} a {{shunting}} locomotive is allocated <b>to</b> <b>shunting</b> a yard or set of sidings. Some shunt turns required 'trip' working between yards or sidings.|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} {{tolerate}} the constant heat loss in the water, sea turtles have the ability <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> blood away from tissues that are tolerant of low oxygen levels toward the heart, brain, and central nervous system. Other mechanisms include basking on warm beaches and producing heat through their activity and movements of their muscles. In the winter months, turtles living at higher latitudes can hibernate {{for a short period}} in the mud.|$|E
25|$|Copse Road Depot {{was built}} in 1897 by the Blackpool & Fleetwood Tramroad Company with six tracks, capable of housing 18 trams. It was {{originally}} used as a store and service depot. After passing to Blackpool Corporation Tramways {{it was used to}} dismantle old trams. Between 1925 and 1949 a line connected the depot with the railway and was used <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> wagons. The depot is now a car showroom and the substation still feeds the Fleetwood section.|$|E
25|$|The dual-eligible {{population}} comprises roughly 20 {{percent of}} Medicare’s enrollees but accounts for 36 {{percent of its}} costs. There is substantial evidence that these individuals receive highly inefficient care because responsibility for their care is split between the Medicare and Medicaid programs—most see {{a number of different}} providers without any kind of mechanism to coordinate their care, and they face high rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations. Because Medicaid and Medicare cover different aspects of health care, both have a financial incentive <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> patients into care the other program pays for.|$|E
50|$|The Class C2 {{remained}} in use on branch line {{work on the}} South Coast line and was later relegated <b>to</b> <b>shunting</b> work. It was withdrawn from service in 1931.|$|R

5000|$|W. G. Beattie {{ordered the}} Beyer, Peacock-designed 330 class for {{shunting}} work. Prior their arrival the LSWR had relagted old locomotive <b>to</b> <b>shunting</b> duties, a task they were unsuitable for and frequently caused delays.|$|R
25|$|Under {{ordinary}} conditions, {{the colon}} receives between 10% and 35% {{of the total}} cardiac output. If {{blood flow to the}} colon drops by more than about 50%, ischemia will develop. The arteries feeding the colon are very sensitive to vasoconstrictors; presumably this is an evolutionary adaptation <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> blood away from the bowel and to the heart and brain in times of stress. As a result, during periods of low blood pressure, the arteries feeding the colon clamp down vigorously; a similar process can result from vasoconstricting drugs such as ergotamine, cocaine, or vasopressors. This vasoconstriction can result in non-occlusive ischemic colitis.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{first thought}} {{of using a}} diesel {{locomotive}} in the early 1970s, when a small four-wheeled diesel-mechanical locomotive built by Ruston & Hornsby (their class 48DL) was bought second-hand from a quarry. It was intended to regauge it {{and use it as}} a yard shunter at Llanberis. It was sold to the Llanberis Lake Railway in 1978 without being regauged or used on the SMR. It would have been the railway's only locomotive without pinions, and as such would have been of limited use – it is doubtful if it would have had sufficient grip on the grease covered rails <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> a dead steam locomotive. This locomotive has since been dismantled and scrapped.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{practical}} rigs for small proas was invented by Euell Gibbons around 1950 for a small, single handed proa. This rig was a loose footed lateen sail hung from a centered mast. The sail was symmetric across the yard, and <b>to</b> <b>shunt,</b> what was previously the top end of the yard was lowered and became the bottom end, reversing {{the direction of the}} sail. Proa enthusiast Gary Dierking modified this design further, using a curved yard and a boom perpendicular to the yard. This allows a greater control of the sail shape than the traditional Gibbons rig, while retaining the simple shunting method, and {{is often referred to as}} the Gibbons/Dierking rig.|$|E
50|$|The Class C1 {{was used}} on {{suburban}} passenger working until more powerful locomotives became necessary. They were then relegated <b>to</b> <b>shunting</b> work at various depots {{until they were}} withdrawn from service in 1931 and scrapped.|$|R
50|$|In later years, {{they also}} {{served on the}} Reef's {{suburban}} routes, while a few {{were used in the}} same service around Cape Town until they were eventually relegated <b>to</b> <b>shunting</b> work. They were scrapped in 1974.|$|R
50|$|Fürstenwalde (Spree) {{station has}} very {{extensive}} freight facilities. In addition <b>to</b> <b>shunting</b> sidings, {{there are also}} five loading tracks {{just north of the}} passenger station. These were renewed in 2010 and are used for road-rail loading operations.|$|R
25|$|Passenger train {{operations}} were revolutionised, with fixed consist working (as in Europe) introduced {{to eliminate the}} need <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> between services. This saw {{the end of a}} long-standing Victorian Railways tradition that the guard's van be {{at the end of the}} train. An order for 36 N type carriages was placed in 1977 for operation on the Geelong and Ballarat lines, but was extended under the New Deal to 54 carriages in 1981 and subsequently to 57 carriages, with the last being delivered in 1984. The carriages were part of a plan to remove 350 unheated and non air-conditioned wooden carriages (up to 70 years old) from service. The H type carriage conversion contract was placed in March 1983 with Clyde Engineering for 43 carriages, later progressively extended to 59 carriages. The new timetable required around 180 carriages, and by 1985 the majority of the fleet was made up of air conditioned steel bodied cars.|$|E
500|$|A small home {{fleet of}} {{locomotives}} was used <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> the coal wagons {{once they had}} arrived at the stations. Originally this included Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns 0-4-0ST No.20 and No.21, and Sentinel No.25. Engine No.25 was used exclusively at the North station, but was converted to diesel-hydraulic by Thomas Hill of Kilnhurst in 1967, becoming Thomas Hill 188. It returned to the station but was taken out of use in 1983 and scrapped by C F Booth of Rotherham. After the closure of the stations, engine No.21 was sent to be preserved at the Tanfield Railway site, near Sunniside in Gateshead. During the 1970s the steam locomotives were replaced by diesel locomotives. These included a Fowler 0-6-0 and CEGB No. 24 Vanguard 0-4-0 [...] CEGB No. 24 has since been sent to Statfold Barn Railway for preservation.|$|E
500|$|A railway {{to serve}} Deeside was {{authorised}} on 16 July 1846, {{but it was}} decided to wait for the Aberdeen Railway to open first. The company survived after the railway mania as the Aberdeen Railway bought a large number of shares. Interest in the line was restored after Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle, to which the Royal Family made their first visit in 1848, and the Aberdeen Railway was able to sell its shares. Investors were still hard to find, but a [...] line as far as Banchory was ceremonially opened on 7 September 1853; public services began the following day with three trains a day that took about an hour. First class accommodation was available for d a mile, reduced to 1d a mile for third class. Initially services were operated by the Aberdeen Railway to its terminus at Ferryhill, and the Deeside Railway used a horse <b>to</b> <b>shunt</b> wagons at Banchory. In 1854 the Deeside introduced its own rolling stock and ran through to the Aberdeen's Guild Street station which opened the same year.|$|E

50|$|Angus advised Bennett {{that the}} NZR could not spare any WW class {{locomotives}} {{as they were}} indispensable to NZR. He instead offered the WF class 2-6-4T as a suitable design that could be released due to the conversion of locomotives of classes BB (4-8-0) and C (2-6-2) <b>to</b> heavy <b>shunting</b> locomotives. The WF class was by now largely confined <b>to</b> <b>shunting</b> work, except for those allocated to the isolated Picton and Nelson sections.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of right <b>to</b> left <b>shunts</b> at atrial level in 40 patients with an uncomplicated atrial septal defect {{was determined by}} measuring the pulmonary vein to systemic artery oxygen stepdown. In six patients (group 1) a sizeable right <b>to</b> left <b>shunt</b> was found: left atrial oxygen stepdown was {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 7 vol%, mean right <b>to</b> left <b>shunt</b> 0. 67 1 /min/m 2 (range 0. 36 - 1. 0), and arterial oxygen saturation between 84 % and 90. 5 %. The patients in group 1 did not show any differences from those with left <b>to</b> right <b>shunts</b> alone (group 2) as regards sex, cardiac rhythm, heart rate, "a" wave and mean right atrial pressure, end diastolic right ventricular pressure, morphology of diastolic right ventricular pressure curves, pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance ratio, size of the defect, and coexistence of anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. Patients with coexisting right <b>to</b> left <b>shunts</b> were, however, significantly older and had smaller left <b>to</b> right <b>shunts.</b> Thus an appreciable number of patients with uncomplicated atrial septal defects have major right <b>to</b> left <b>shunts</b> which are unrelated to pulmonary hypertension or right heart failure. These shunts may be detected by the usual oximetric techniques and apparently develop with age, which suggests that they result from changes associated with chronic right volume overload...|$|R
