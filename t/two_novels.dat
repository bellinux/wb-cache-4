5|$|Datta (2005) shows that, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} militaristic Boulangism in the late 1880s, the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics and revived in popular culture. Concentrating on two plays and <b>two</b> <b>novels</b> from the period—Victorien Sardou's Madame Sans-Gêne (1893), Maurice Barrès's Les Déracinés (1897), Edmond Rostand's L'Aiglon (1900), and André de Lorde and Gyp's Napoléonette (1913)—Datta examines how writers and critics of the Belle Époque exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends.|$|E
5|$|Grant and Naylor {{wrote the}} first six series {{together}} (using the pseudonym Grant Naylor on the first <b>two</b> <b>novels</b> and later as {{the name of their}} production company, although never on the episodes themselves). Grant left in 1995, to pursue other projects, leaving Naylor to write series VII and VIII with a group of new writers, including Paul Alexander and actor Robert Llewellyn who portrayed the character Kryten.|$|E
5|$|Larsen's {{exploration}} of race was informed {{by her own}} mixed racial heritage and the increasingly common practice of racial passing in the 1920s. Praised upon publication, the novel has since been celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction of race, gender and sexuality, and {{is the subject of}} considerable scholarly criticism. As one of only <b>two</b> <b>novels</b> that Larsen wrote, Passing has been significant in placing its author at the forefront of several literary canons.|$|E

5|$|Palencia-Roth {{notes that}} critics {{have been struck}} by the humorless elegiac style of The General in His Labyrinth; its dark mood and somber message {{is similar to that}} of The Autumn of the Patriarch. Love is a theme common to both Love in the Time of Cholera and The General in His Labyrinth, but the latter is {{considered}} a tragedy. These <b>two</b> <b>novels</b> have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez's work.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina's {{education}} {{has been compared to}} George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, which may have been inspired by her story.

The story of Sabrina's life has been told in Wendy Moore's 2013 book How to Create the Perfect Wife and dramatised in the 2015 BBC Radio 4 play The Imperfect Education of Sabrina Sidney.|$|E

Martin said in March 2012 that the final <b>two</b> <b>novels</b> will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear in the book.|$|E
40|$|Newborn {{looking toward}} novel stimuli {{containing}} a single or <b>two</b> <b>novel</b> dimensions was assessed in two studies. In Study 1, newborns were habituated to a visual stimulus containing stimulus movement and line orientation information. Following habituation, stimuli containing <b>two</b> <b>novel</b> dimensions were attended {{to more than}} stimuli containing a single novel dimension. It was also demonstrated that newborns detect stimulus movement changes. In Study 2, stimuli containing novel colour and line orientation information, following habituation, were attended to across three test trials more than stimuli containing a novel colour only. Colour discrimination was also demonstrated. It was concluded that newborns appear to attend to stimuli containing <b>two</b> <b>novel</b> dimensions differently than those containing a single novel dimension. It was suggested that newborns employ an analytic mode of processing to detect novel dimensions. Further research is required to verify this conclusion and to determine what component is rst attended to...|$|R
