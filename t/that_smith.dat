5|$|Smith {{starred in}} the 2009 short film Together and the 2010 film Womb. In February 2013, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> had signed up to appear in Ryan Gosling's directorial debut Lost River. Smith's directorial debut, the short film Cargese, was aired on Sky Arts in May 2013. Smith had a supporting role, {{as the embodiment of}} Skynet, in Terminator Genisys (2015); he is set to have more screen time in the sixth and seventh films in the series. On 20 November 2014, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> will star in the action-thriller film Patient Zero.|$|E
5|$|Student athletes under Smith {{achieved}} a graduation rate of 96.6% at North Carolina, and {{he established a}} reputation for running a clean program. Although athletes benefited from academic improprieties at the university during Smith's reign, {{there is no evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> was aware of the practice.|$|E
5|$|Accepting his {{discharge}} in 1912, Smith {{emigrated to}} Australia after brief employment in London. He {{lived in the}} Melbourne suburb of Ascot Vale while working for the city's gas company. Retained as a reservist, Smith was mobilised by the British Army after the commencement of hostilities in August 1914. Some sources state <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> {{was present at the}} capture of German New Guinea by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force.|$|E
50|$|Like most Latter Day Saint denominations, the Church of the Firstborn taught <b>that</b> Joseph <b>Smith</b> was {{a prophet}} of God. The church taught <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> {{rightful}} successor {{after his death}} was James J. Strang, and that Strang was succeeded by Joseph Morris.|$|R
25|$|The Lions {{have also}} {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> jersey number, 93, {{will not be}} issued for the 2009 season.|$|R
50|$|Articles of The Times-Picayune stated police {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> {{friends and}} family felt Jonathan Williams killed Hillard Smith.|$|R
5|$|Apologists also cite {{parallels}} between the scenes depicted on the facsimiles and several ancient documents and other Jewish writings, maintaining {{that there is no}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> studied or even had access to these sources. Examples include: the attempted sacrifice of Abraham and his subsequent rescue (a similar story was preserved in a Coptic encomium only translated into English in the 20th century), Abraham teaching the Egyptians astronomy (this is recounted in the aforementioned Coptic encomium, and is mentioned by Eusebius, quoting Pseudo-Eupolemus, in his work Praeparatio evangelica), and God teaching astronomy to Abraham.|$|E
5|$|By early 1844, a rift {{developed}} between Smith {{and a half}} dozen of his closest associates. Most notably, William Law, Smith's trusted counselor, and Robert Foster, a general of the Nauvoo Legion, disagreed with Smith about how to manage Nauvoo's economy. Both also said <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> had proposed marriage to their wives. Believing the dissidents were plotting against his life, Smith excommunicated them on April 18, 1844. These dissidents formed a competing church and the following month, at Carthage, the county seat, they procured indictments against Smith for perjury and polygamy.|$|E
5|$|By some accounts, Smith {{had been}} {{teaching}} a polygamy doctrine {{as early as}} 1831, and there is unconfirmed evidence <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> was a polygamist by 1835. Although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was a rift between Smith and Oliver Cowdery over the issue. Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged {{in a relationship with}} his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, presumably because he had taken Alger as a plural wife.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, writer Anwen Crawford {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> [...] "attitude to genius seems pre-feminist, if not anti-feminist; {{there is}} no democratizing, deconstructing impulse in her work." ...|$|R
50|$|In September 2015, it was {{announced}} by {{a spokesman for the}} Judicial Conduct Investigations Office <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> conduct in connection with the case was being investigated.|$|R
5000|$|A 1975 report {{stated that}} doctors {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> skull was [...] "abnormally soft", {{and that it}} had been fractured several times before his fatal wreck.|$|R
5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the Book of Mormon to be a religious {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers {{view it as a}} companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, akin to a large apocryphal work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> composed the Book of Mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that the work is autobiographical in nature.|$|E
5|$|In February 1828, Martin Harris {{arrived to}} assist Smith by transcribing his dictation. Harris {{also took a}} sample of the {{characters}} to a few prominent scholars, including Charles Anthon. Harris said Anthon initially authenticated the characters and their translation, but then retracted his opinion after learning <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> claimed to have received the plates from an angel. Anthon denied Harris's account of the meeting, claiming instead that he had tried to convince Harris that he was the victim of a fraud. In any event, Harris returned to Harmony in April 1828, and continued as Smith's scribe.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{minutes after}} the restart, Whelan was penalised for an offence {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool area. Winterburn took the {{resulting}} indirect free kick, from which Alan Smith scored with a header. Liverpool's players protested, claiming Smith had not made contact (and thus the goal should have been disallowed, coming directly from an indirect free kick) or that there had been a push by O'Leary. After consulting his linesman, the referee David Hutchinson awarded the goal. After the match, he recalled none of the Liverpool players knew why they had protested, and TV replays confirm <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> made contact.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, writer Anwen Crawford {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> [...] "attitude to genius seems pre-feminist, if not anti-feminist; {{there is}} no democratizing, deconstructing impulse in her work." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{piece of}} Smith's sold for $22,000, and a cufflink {{collector}} told the New York Times <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> cufflinks {{were the most}} expensive pieces in his collection.|$|R
50|$|In {{a letter}} to Brigham Young, dated May 6, 1867, Phelps {{mentioned}} that he believed <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> prophecy refers to Adam and his future arrival at Adam-ondi-Ahman.|$|R
5|$|Smith {{had begun}} his solo career {{while still in}} Heatmiser, {{and the success of}} his first two {{releases}} created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to the release of Mic City Sons, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser's record contract with Virgin meant <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought out by DreamWorks prior to the recording of his fourth album, XO.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{received}} another Championship winner's medal as Cardiff won {{the division}} in April 2013, but {{was restricted to}} three cup appearances during Cardiff's first season in the Premier League. He was released after the Blues' relegation {{at the end of}} the 2013-14 season, having made 27 appearances and scored one goal during his two seasons with the club. On 15 July 2014, it was revealed <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> was training with Championship side Brentford.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{replacement}} was Ron Suart, {{who wanted}} Matthews {{to stay out}} wide, and did not value his contribution in the way <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> had done. Suart limited Matthews to 19 league appearances in 1958–59. Matthews was then used just 15 times in 1959–60, as Suart signed Arthur Kaye to take his place, and local lad Steve Hill also vied for the outside-right position. He enjoyed more games in 1960–61, playing 27 league games as the club narrowly avoiding relegation by the odd point.|$|E
50|$|This {{decision}} effectively {{ended the}} case, {{and let stand}} the decision <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> estate was not entitled to the money {{that had previously been}} awarded to her.|$|R
25|$|It is also {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> imprisonment {{had become an}} embarrassment, and that an escape would be convenient for Boggs {{and the rest of}} the Missouri political establishment.|$|R
500|$|British {{historians have}} {{considered}} <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> refusal to participate probably cost Osborne the battle. William James wrote that his behaviour was [...] "the principle reason that Cybèle, at least, {{was not made}} a prize of by the British". C. Northcote Parkinson considers the action [...] "indecisive" [...] but concurs with James' assessment <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> intervention could {{have resulted in a}} British victory but instead that [...] "the first encounter of the war between the French and English in the East Indies had resulted in what was tantamount to defeat for the latter".|$|R
5|$|Winchester was {{the only}} {{defendant}} to face trial on the charges. Winchester's lawyer argued <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> was guilty of verbal assault against the defendant, and Winchester was found not guilty. The verdict was reported in The Spectator on March 22, 1825. In 1828 Stephenson left Edwardsville, and moved to Galena in Jo Daviess County where he made his home {{for much of the}} rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|Wrexham exited 18-months of {{administration}} {{at the start}} of 2006–07, and started the season with an eight-match unbeaten run, including a 4–1 win over Championship club Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup. However, a 5–0 defeat at Accrington Stanley triggered a run of bad results <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> was unable to turn around. With Wrexham hovering above the relegation zone in 18th place, Smith was dismissed on 11 January 2007. He is one of only 24 people to have managed over 1,000 professional matches in English football.|$|E
5|$|As news of Gen. Robert E. Lee's {{surrender}} on April 9, 1865, {{reached the}} department, soldiers deserted the Confederacy in droves. On April 19, Smith consolidated the District of Arkansas with the District of West Louisiana; the combined district was put under Buckner's command. On May 9, Smith made Buckner {{his chief of}} staff. Rumors began to swirl in both Union and Confederate camps <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> and Buckner would not surrender, but would fall back to Mexico with soldiers who remained loyal to the Confederacy. Though Smith did cross the Rio Grande, he learned on his arrival that Buckner had traveled to New Orleans on May 26 and arranged terms of surrender. Smith had instead instructed Buckner to move all the troops to Houston, Texas.|$|E

Inclined to believe <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> library is "more choice and perfect" than Sir Joseph [Banks'] more extensive library. Not surprised <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> reputation attracted Madame Buonaparte's [Joséphine de Beauharnais (1763 - 1814) 1 st wife of Napoleon Bonaparte] attention; {{would like to see}} the presents she sent him.

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Sports Illustrated {{magazine}} estimated Vick's {{annual income}} between his NFL salary and endorsements at $25.4 million, ranking him just below NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in a listing of highest earning athletes. Vick's finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments and lawsuits. Certified Financial Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise undermined the wealth-building plan <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> had created. Smith's plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was actually an estimated $20million in debt.|$|E
5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen {{by the rest of}} the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted <b>that</b> <b>Smith,</b> who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E
5|$|Menlove Avenue {{suffered}} {{extensive damage}} during the war, and Smith {{and his wife}} often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in their garden. Smith was called up for military service, but was discharged three years later, and subsequently worked in an aircraft factory in Speke {{until the end of}} the war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led his wife to complain <b>that</b> <b>Smith</b> was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money. During 1942–1943, Mimi's sister Julia lived with Lennon at The Dairy Cottage; 120a Allerton Road, Woolton, which was owned by the Smith family.|$|E
50|$|The Lions {{have also}} {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Smith's</b> jersey number, 93, {{will not be}} issued for the 2009 season.The Lions also wore a 93 {{on the back of}} their helmets.|$|R
