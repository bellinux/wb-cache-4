5|$|Chromium is {{a member}} of Group 6, of the {{transition}} metals. Chromium(0) has an electronic configuration of 3d54s1, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> energy of the high spin configuration. Chromium exhibits a wide range of oxidation states, with +3 the most stable; the +3 and +6 states are the most common in chromium compounds, while +1, +4 and +5 are rare.|$|E
5|$|Dnieper delta: This {{small area}} of {{distribution}} in southern Ukraine {{was reported in}} 2005. It is now isolated by steppe from the Danube basin, {{but it has been}} suggested that these areas were connected through marshlands during the last glacial maximum, when the level of the Black Sea was around 100 metres lower than today. This range may also extend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> basins of the Dniester and Bug rivers.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the oldest}} pieces of tornado {{folklore}} {{is the idea that}} tornadoes do most of their damage due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> atmospheric pressure {{at the center of a}} tornado, which causes the house to explode outward.

5|$|The assassinations of Aurelian and Probus {{demonstrated}} that sole rulership was {{dangerous to the}} stability of the empire. Conflict boiled in every province, from Gaul to Syria, Egypt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> Danube. It was too much for one person to control, and Diocletian needed a lieutenant. At some time in 285 at Mediolanum (Milan), Diocletian raised his fellow-officer Maximian to the office of caesar, making him co-emperor.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years after}} his {{tutoring}} had begun, he was sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lower</b> Grammar School at Växjö in 1717. Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants.

Lannerus noticed Linnaeus' interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and his colleagues in the juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> jaw.|$|E
5|$|A {{representative}} {{piece of}} Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply (c. 1450–1400 BC) {{which consisted of}} a cuirass of a complete set made up of several elements of bronze. It was flexible and comfortable enough {{to be used for}} fighting on foot, while the total weight of the armor is around 18kg (about 40lb). Important evidence of Mycenaean armor has also been found in Thebes (c. 1350–1250 BC), which include a pair of shoulder guards, smaller than to those from Dendra, with additional plates protecting the upper arms, attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> edge of the shoulder guards.|$|E
