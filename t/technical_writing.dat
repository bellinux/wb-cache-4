In 1910, he accepted a job offer to work in a machine tool company in Vermont. He continued to write on technical and other matters throughout his life and would develop a broader philosophy of the role of industry in society.

25|$|An {{early and}} {{influential}} {{book about the}} subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, was self-published in 1976 by Bill Kaysing. Despite having no knowledge of rockets or <b>technical</b> <b>writing,</b> Kaysing, a former US Navy officer with a Bachelor of Arts in English, was hired as a senior technical writer in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company that built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket. He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked. The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, {{it would have been easier}} for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.|$|E

[...] Arnold Schoenberg's Theme and Variations and Samuel Barber's Commando March, both from 1943, have extremely prominent, lyrical solos for euphonium; Robert Russell Bennett's Suite of Old American Dances (1949) has brief solos and very active <b>technical</b> <b>writing,</b> and [...] "When Jesus Wept," [...] the second movement of William Schuman's New England Triptych (1956) is largely a euphonium solo and lyrical duet for euphonium and cornet (arranged by the composer from the orchestral original which features bassoon and oboe).

2500|$|Note however, {{that it is}} not {{uncommon}} to express aqueous concentrations—particularly in drinking-water reports intended for the general public—using parts-per notation (2.1ppm, 0.8ppb, etc.) and further, for those reports to state that the notations denote milligrams per liter or micrograms per liter. Although [...] "2.1mg/L" [...] is not a dimensionless quantity, it is assumed in scientific circles that [...] "2.1mg/kg" [...] (2.1ppm) is the true measure because one liter of water has a mass of about one kilogram. The goal in all <b>technical</b> <b>writing</b> (including drinking-water reports for the general public) is to clearly communicate to the intended audience with minimal confusion. Drinking water is intuitively a volumetric quantity in the public’s mind so measures of contamination expressed on a per-liter basis are considered to be easier to grasp. Still, it is technically possible, for example, to [...] "dissolve" [...] more than one liter of a very hydrophilic chemical in 1 liter of water; parts-per notation would be confusing when describing its solubility in water (greater than a million parts per million), so one would simply state the volume (or mass) that will dissolve into a liter, instead.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} that those interested in a Chemistry degree understand the variety of roles available to them (on average), which vary depending on education and job experience. Those Chemists who hold a bachelor's degree are most commonly involved in positions related to either research assistance (working {{under the guidance of}} senior chemists in a research-oriented activity), or, alternatively, they may work on distinct (chemistry-related) aspects of a business/organization/enterprise, including aspects that involve quality control, quality assurance, manufacturing/production, formulation, inspection, method validation, visitation for troubleshooting of chemistry-related instruments, regulatory affairs, [...] "on-demand" [...] technical services, chemical analysis for non-research purposes (e.g. as a legal request, for testing purposes, or for government or non-profit agencies); chemists may also work in environmental evaluation & assessment. Other jobs/roles may include sales and marketing of chemical products and chemistry-related instruments, and/or <b>technical</b> <b>writing.</b> The more experience obtained, the more independence & leadership/management roles these chemists may perform in those organizations. Some chemists with relatively higher experience might change jobs or job position to become a manager of a chemistry-related enterprise, a supervisor, an entrepreneur or a chemistry consultant. Other chemists choose to combine their education and/or experience as a chemist with a distinct credential to provide different services (e.g. forensic chemists, chemistry-related software development, patent law specialists, environmental law firm staff, scientific news reporting staff, engineering design staff, etc.)... In comparison, Chemists who have obtained a Master of Science (M.S.) in Chemistry or in a very related discipline may find chemist roles that allow them to enjoy more independence, leadership and/or responsibility earlier in their careers (with less years of experience than those with a bachelor's degree as highest degree); Sometimes, M.S. chemists receive more complex tasks duties, in comparison with the roles/positions found by chemists with a bachelor's degree as their highest academic degree and with the same or close-to-same years of job experience. Although good chemists without a PhD. degree but with relatively many years of experience may be allowed some applied research positions, the general rule is that PhD. chemists are preferred for research positions and are typically the preferred choice for the highest administrative positions on big enterprises involved in Chemistry-related duties. Some positions, especially research oriented, will only allow those chemists who are PhD. holders. Jobs that involve intensive research and actively seek to lead the discovery of completely new chemical products under specifically assigned monetary funds & resources, or jobs that seek to develop new scientific theories, require a Ph.D. more often than not. Chemists with a PhD. as the highest academic degree are found typically on the R department of an enterprise, and can also hold university positionsΉ as professors. Some smaller colleges, [...] as well as Community Colleges, usually hire chemists with M.S. as professors too (and rarely, some universities who need part-time or temporary instructors, or temporary staff), but when the positions are scarce and the applicants are many, they might prefer PhD. holders instead.|$|E
