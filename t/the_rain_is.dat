In the recent past, rainfall variability in short time periods (about a week) were attributed to desert dust over the Arabian Sea and Western Asia.|$|E

500|$|When Donen and Kelly {{released}} On the Town, they boldly {{opened the}} film with an extravagant musical number shot {{on location in}} New York with fast-paced editing and experimental camera work, thus breaking from the conventions of that time. Their most celebrated film Singin' in <b>the</b> <b>Rain</b> <b>is</b> appropriately a musical about {{the birth of the}} movie musical. The film includes a musical montage that Donen says was [...] "doing Busby Berkeley here, only we're making fun of him." [...] Charness stated that Singin' in the Rains references to Berkeley [...] "marks the first time the Hollywood musical had ever been reflexive, and amused at its own extravagant non-dancing inadequacy, at that" [...] and that Berekeley's [...] "overhead kaleidoscope floral pattern is predominantly featured, as is the line of tap-dancing chorines, who are seen only from the knees down." [...] Charness also stated that the film's cinematography [...] "moves the audience perspective along with the dance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dance in <b>the</b> <b>Rain</b> <b>is</b> the {{follow-up}} to Coulter's third studio album Fear & Freedom (2012), which debuted at number seven on the ARIAAlbumsChart and became her first top-ten album. Coulter {{began working on}} Dance in the Rain shortly {{after the completion of}} Fear & Freedom. As executive producer of Dance in the Rain, Coulter had full control over the songwriters and producers she wanted to work with. She also spent her own money to travel overseas to write and record material for the album. Coulter intended for DanceintheRain to be an honest album and wanted to avoid following a certain sound and concept. She worked on it for two years in various places around the world, including Bali, Brisbane, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Nashville, New York City, Paris, Sweden and Sydney. Stuart Crichton co-produced a majority of the album's songs alongside Coulter. Speaking of the inspiration behind Dance in the Rain, Coulter stated: [...] "Life throws so much at you and I write about it all...I figured I had a lot to say and there were so many things I wanted to express – and I managed to pull it all together for this one album." ...|$|E
