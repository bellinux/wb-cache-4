5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences in the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E
5|$|Xerxes's {{estimated}} <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> at Thermopylae {{coincided with}} both the Olympic Games and the festival of Carneia. For the Spartans, warfare during these periods was considered sacrilegious. Despite the uncomfortable timing, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men. The customary elite young men in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had children. Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Allied Peloponnesian cities, and other forces that the Allies {{picked up on the}} way to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the third}} century BCE and 1534, the islands had come {{under the control of}} {{successive}} dynasties: Mauryas (3rd century BCE - around 185 BCE), Satavahanas (Around 185 BCE - 250 CE), Abhiras and Vakatakas (250 CE - early 5th century), Kalachuris (5th century), Konkan Mauryas (6th and early 7th century), Chalukyas (later 7th century), Rashtrakutas (mid-8th century), Silharas (810 to 1260), Yadavas (late 13th century - 1348), Muslim rulers of Gujarat (1348–1391), and the Gujarat Sultanate (1391–1534). At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> of the Portuguese, Bombay was ruled by Sultan Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate, and was an archipelago of seven islands: Bombay Island (Bombaim), Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). The Salsette group of islands were located east of Bombay, separated by the Mahim Bay. Important strategic towns located near Bombay were; Bassein (Baçaim) to the north, Thana to the east, and Chaul to the south.|$|E
5|$|Bombay, {{now called}} Mumbai, Bombaim in Portuguese, is the {{financial}} and commercial capital of India {{and one of the}} most populous cities in the world. At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> of the Portuguese, current Bombay was an archipelago of seven islands. Between the third century BCE and 1348, the islands came under the control of successive Hindu dynasties. The Muslim rulers of Gujarat, who had been ruling current Thane and Vasai for a few decades, annexed the islands in 1348, that were later governed by the Gujarat Sultanate from 1391 to 1534. Growing apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun, Sultan Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese Empire on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the seven islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of Bassein and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese. The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535.|$|E
5|$|Claudette wobbled to the {{northwest}} over the Gulf of Mexico and gradually restrengthened. Upper-level winds steadily decreased, and Claudette again became a hurricane late on July 14. Just prior to landfall, it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction, striking Port O'Connor, Texas, on July 15 as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 90mph (150km/h) winds. Residents along and inland of the central Texas coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival.</b> The hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of July 15, but instead came ashore before noon. Furthermore, some initial estimates suggested that Claudette had reached Category2 status, with sustained winds of up to 100mph (155km/h); these were based on unofficial observations which were not backed up by official data.|$|E

5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of estimated <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications {{to be able to}} transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Like most seabirds, the {{majority}} of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will skip a breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, {{and some of the}} smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, breed on a nine-month schedule. Among those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher latitudes always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the tropical wedge-tailed shearwater, breed seasonally for reasons unknown. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> at the colony and of lay date.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} optimal selection problems, {{where the}} number N 1 {{of candidates for}} the job is random, and the <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the candidates are uniformly distributed in [0, 1].

In certain special cases, notably when N 1 is geometrically distributed, it had been proved earlier that the optimal policy was of a very simple form; this paper will explain why these cases are so simple by embedding the process in a planar Poisson process from which all the requisite distributional results can be read off by inspection. Routine stochastic calculus methods are then used to prove the conjectured optimal policy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Blackbeard {{instrument}} is a broadband radio receiver on the ALEXIS (Array of Low Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) satellite. It detects and records transient VHF radio signals. During November and December of 1996, the Los Alamos Portable Pulser (LAPP) facility {{was used to}} transmit 31 broadband pulses to Blackbeard to evaluate the instrument's time tagging accuracy. LAPP firing times were {{used in conjunction with}} propagation delays to compute estimated <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (ETOAs) for pulses reaching Blackbeard. ETOAs were compared to Blackbeard reported <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> (RTOAs), which were computed using information returned by Blackbeard and an algorithm presented in this paper. For the 31 pulser shots received by Blackbeard, the mean difference between ETOA and RTOA was 1. 97 milliseconds, with RTOAs occurring later than ETOAs. The standard deviation of the difference was 0. 43 milliseconds. As a result of the study, the algorithm used for accurate Blackbeard time tag studies has been modified to subtract 1. 97 milliseconds from reported <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival.</b> The 0. 43 ms error standard deviation is now used to describe the uncertainty <b>of</b> Blackbeard <b>time</b> tags...|$|R
