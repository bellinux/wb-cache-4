25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> paid ₱353,476 (approximately US$7,080) {{per month}} and ₱ 4,241,640 per annum as of July 1 2016 {{by virtue of}} Executive Order No. 201 series of 2016 as {{authorized}} by Congressional Joint Resolution No. 4 series.

25|$|The {{head of the}} Executive Branch is the President. Although {{also named}} in this first clause, <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> not constitutionally vested with any {{executive}} power. Nonetheless, the Constitution dictates that the President and Vice President are to be elected at the same time, for the same term, and by the same constituency. The framers' intent was to preserve {{the independence of the}} executive branch should the person who was Vice President succeed to the duties of the presidency.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> {{elected in}} the same manner as, but {{separately}} from, the President. Both the President and the Vice President are elected by direct plurality vote where the candidate who garners the highest number of votes, whether a majority or not, wins the election. While candidates usually run in tandem for the offices of President and Vice President, under their own political parties, it is possible and not unusual for candidates from different parties to be elected as President and Vice President.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of each two-year session the House elects a speaker who does not {{normally}} preside over debates but serves as the majority party's leader. In the Senate, <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> the ex officio president of the Senate. In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the President pro tempore. Pro tempore means for the time being and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there's a change in party control. Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore {{at the beginning of a}} new Congress. In both the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.|$|E
