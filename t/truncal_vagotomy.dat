50|$|<b>Truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> (TV) {{includes}} {{division of}} the main trunk of the vagus (including its celiac/hepatic branch) and denervation of the pylorus; therefore, a pyloric drainage procedure, such as pyloric dilatation or disruption (pyloromyotomy or pyloroplasty) or gastrojejunostomy, is needed. This procedure also denervates the liver, biliary tree, pancreas, and small and large bowel.|$|E
50|$|Post-vagotomy {{diarrhea}} {{is a form}} of diarrhea {{which occurs}} in 10% of patients after a <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy,</b> which can range from severe to debilitating in approximately 2% to 4% of patients. However, the occurrence of post-vagotomy diarrhea is significantly reduced after proximal selective vagotomy, specifically when celiac and hepatic branches of the vagus are retained.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} performed in 1987 by Philippe Mouret in Lyon (France), {{there has been}} a real revolution in the field of visceral surgery: more and more operations are performed by this mini-invasive surgical method: lithiasis of the common bile duct, Nissen and Heller procedure, <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomies,</b> abdominal and thoracic, supra-selective vagotomies, hernia, appendectomy, band sections during intestinal occlusion, resection of the colon and rectum, oesophagectomies [...] . In Belgium, more than 3, 000 cholecystectomies have been listed in a national registry in which the modalities and complications of this laparoscopic approach have been scrutinized. During the years to come, there will be an important technological development which will make this procedure easier, safer and quicker. Consequences of this new approach cannot completely be foreseen but there are some drawbacks: possible simplification of well established surgical techniques in order to facilitate the laparoscopic approach, causing a deterioration of the long term results, teaching and training difficulties for young and older surgeons, very costly equipment...|$|R
40|$|Proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV) {{consists}} of denervation {{of the body}} and fundus of the stomach, the antral nerve supply being left intact. It has a low operative morbidity and mortality and there are few postvagotomy side effects. However, the recurrent ulcer rate may be higher than with other operations for duodenal ulcer. Nevertheless it is usually easier to treat post-PGV recurrence than the complications of other gastric acid lowering operations. This study defines those patients in whom we have not performed a PGV. Of 110 operations for duodenal ulcer since 1980, 70 were PGVs while 40 consisted of <b>truncal</b> or selective <b>vagotomy</b> combined either with a drainage procedure or antrectomy. It is our practice not to perform a PGV in those patients with prepyloric ulcers, pyloric stenosis, bleeding or perforated ulcers and recurrent ulcers...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> is a {{treatment}} option for chronic duodenal ulcers. It was once considered the gold standard, {{but is now}} usually reserved for patients who have failed the first-line [...] "triple therapy" [...] against Helicobacter pylori infection: two antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole) and a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole). It is also used {{in the treatment of}} gastric outlet obstruction.|$|E
50|$|SurgicalSurgery is {{indicated}} {{in cases of}} gastric outlet obstruction {{in which there is}} significant obstruction and in cases where medical therapy has failed. Endoscopic balloon therapy may be attempted as an alternative to surgery, with balloon dilation reporting success rates of 76% after repeat dilatons. The operation usually performed is an antrectomy, the removal of the antral portion of the stomach. Other surgical approaches include: vagotomy, the severing of the vagus nerve, the Billroth I, a procedure which involves anastomosing the duodenum to the distal stomach, or a bilateral <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> with gastrojejunostomy.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} vagotomy and gastric {{resection}} on insulin secretion was {{examined by the}} glucagon stimulated C-peptide test in gastrectomy patients (n = 11) without <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and in total gastrectomy patients (n = 10) with <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy.</b> The test was performed twice in each patient: 10 minutes after the midline incision was made and then 60 to 90 minutes later when gastric resection or total gastrectomy was completed, during the reconstructive phase of the operation. Gastric resection without <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> {{was followed by a}} higher increase (48 %) in serum C-peptide concentration caused by glucagon stimulation than total gastrectomy with <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> (13 %). There was a significant (p less than 0. 05) increase in the glucagon stimulated glucose-related C-peptide concentration in patients without <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy,</b> whereas <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> inhibited this increase. These results suggest that <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> will produce a reduction in stimulated insulin secretion in humans...|$|E
40|$|Atropine {{inhibits}} the post-prandial gastrin release after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> in the dog. Whether {{this action}} of atropine {{is due to}} suppression of stimulatory cholinergic fibres in the sympathetic nerves of the stomach and the upper small intestine or due to blockade of intrinsic gastric cholinergic mechanisms is unknown. Conscious dogs were fed a meat meal (35 g/kg body weight) before and after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> plus coeliac and superior mesenteric ganglionectomy. Experiments were repeated {{in the presence of}} atropine (50 micrograms/kg body weight, given as an i. v. bolus 60 min prior to the meal). In another set of dogs, only ganglionectomy was performed and the same experiments were done as in the first set of dogs. <b>Truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> enhanced the post-prandial 120 min integrated plasma gastrin response by 2. 6 times as compared to the response with the vagus nerves intact. Before <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy,</b> atropine enhanced the integrated plasma gastrin response by 2. 6 times; after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> atropine suppressed this response by 2. 3 times. After <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy,</b> with or without atropine, additional coeliac and superior mesenteric ganglionectomy did not alter the integrated plasma gastrin response. With the vagus nerves intact, ganglionectomy alone had no effect on the integrated plasma gastrin response whether or not atropine was given. The finding that atropine suppresses the post-prandial plasma gastrin response to a meal after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and coeliac and superior mesenteric ganglionectomy, i. e. cutting the extrinsic nerves of the stomach and the upper small intestine, suggests the existence of stimulatory cholinergic intrinsic fibres located within the stomach...|$|E
40|$|Three {{groups of}} {{patients}} studied after operations which had cured their duodenal ulcer {{were compared with}} a control group (no operation, n = 8). The surgical procedures included: proximal gastric vagotomy (n = 7), <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and pyloroplasty (n = 7), <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and antrectomy (n = 8). Samples of gastric juice were aspirated half hourly or hourly over 24 hours for measurement of pH, counts of all identified bacteria, nitrite and total N-nitrosocompounds. Although the pH over 24 hours was significantly higher after proximal gastric vagotomy (p less than 0. 05) and <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and antrectomy (p less than 0. 001) than controls, {{there was no difference}} between <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and pyloroplasty and controls. Counts of nitrate reducing bacteria over 24 hours were also significantly higher after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and antrectomy than controls (p less than 0. 1) but no differences were observed between the other groups. Only after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and antrectomy was nitrite over 24 hours significantly increased compared with controls (p less than 0. 01). Despite these higher values after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and antrectomy, there was no significant difference in total N-nitrosocompounds between any of the four groups. Whereas bacterial counts and nitrite increased with pH, no correlation was found between total N-nitrosocompounds and pH. These results provide no evidence that exposure to total N-nitrosocompounds is increased after operations for duodenal ulcer...|$|E
40|$|The motor {{function}} of the gastric tube for esophageal reconstruction, when the esophagogastrostomy was performed after the resection of carcinoma of the lower esophagus and cardia, was disturbed owing to bilateral vagotomy, usually accompanied with those operative procedures. Electromyographic studies were performed on four groups of unanesthetized dogs with non-vagotomy, selective gastric vagotomy, <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> with vagal nerve implantation, respectively, using bipolar needle electrodes into the gastric wall. Basic electrical rhythm (BER) occurred regularly in non-vagotomy and selective vagotomy groups, but irregular patterns were frequently obserbed in <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> groups with or without vagal nerve implantation, two weeks postoperatively. However, after meals, the BER became almost regular {{in all of the}} groups. The conduction velocity of the BER in the <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> group with vagus nerve implantation was faster than that in the <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> group without implantation, two weeks postoperatively. The conduction velocity in the SPV group was as fast as in the non-vagotomy group...|$|E
40|$|From January 1963 to December 1965 {{inclusive}} 192 {{men with}} duodenal ulcer were treated by elective <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and pyloroplasty with one death. Ten subsequent deaths {{were due to}} causes unrelated to the ulcer or operation, and 17 patients became untraceable. The remaining 164 patients have been followed up for five to eight years. The late results have been compared with those obtained in a previous study of patients five to eight years after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and gastroenterostomy, <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and antrectomy, and subtotal gastrectomy respectively for duodenal ulcer...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol {{tolerance}} {{has been}} studied in 10 patients after proximal gastric vagotomy and six patients after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and antrectomy. No difference in alcohol tolerance was found before and after proximal gastric vagotomy, while an increased rate of absorption with higher blood levels of alcohol were found after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and antrectomy...|$|E
40|$|Paired {{oral and}} {{intravenous}} glucose tolerance tests {{were carried out}} in patients who had undergone <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and pyloroplasty, selective vagotomy and pyloroplasty, or highly selective vagotomy {{at least six months}} earlier. Intravenous glucose tolerance was similar in all three groups. Oral glucose elicited significantly higher concentrations of plasma insulin in patients who had undergone selective and highly selective vagotomy than in those treated by <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy.</b> When the same amount of glucose was given intravenously, however, plasma insulin concentrations were similar in all three groups of patients. The insulin secreted in response to intravenous glucose expressed as a percentage of that secreted in response to oral glucose was 112 % for <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy,</b> 51 % for selective vagotomy, and 52 % for highly selective vagotomy. <b>Truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> thus led to a diminished insulin response to oral glucose, which was probably due to impaired release of small-bowel hormones...|$|E
40|$|THE PRESENT EXPERIMENTAL WORK WAS DESIGNED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF <b>TRUNCAL</b> <b>VAGOTOMY</b> ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRGAPYRINE INDUCED ANASTOMOTIC ULCER (CASSIOUMIS 1966). TWENTY ONE MONGREL DOGS WERE DIVIDED IN 4 GROUPS. THREE ANIMALS WERE IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND 6 ANIMALS IN EACH OF THE REMAINING 3 GROUPS. IN EACH ANIMAL OF THE CONTROL GROUP <b>TRUNCAL</b> <b>VAGOTOMY</b> WITH PYLOROPLASTY, ANTRECTOMY, AND GASTROJEJUNOSTOMY WERE PERFORMED. SIXTEEN MONTHS POSTOPERATIVELY AND AUTOPSY, MACROSCOPY OR HISTOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES WERE NOT OBSERVED IN THE STOMACH, DUODENUM AND ANASTOMOSIS. IN THE 2 ND GROUP <b>TRUNCAL</b> <b>VAGOTOMY</b> AND MICKULICZ PYROLOPLASTY WERE FOLLOWED BY INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTIONS OF IRGAPYRINE. AT POST MORTEM EXAMINATION ANASTOMOTIC ULCER AND EROSIONS WERE FOUND IN 2 OF THESE ANIMALS,WHILE IN THE REMAINING 4 HYPERAEMIA AND GASTRIC MUCOSA HYPERTROPHY WERE DUE ONLY CHANGES. <b>TRUNCAL</b> <b>VAGOTOMY</b> WAS COMBINED WITH ANTRECTOMY IN THE 3 RD GROUP. INTRAMUSCULAR IRGAPYRINE IN THIS GROUP WAS FOLLOWED AT POST MORTEM EXAMINATION BY MACROSCOPIC AND HISTOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES IN 2 ANIMALS.

40|$|Duodenogastric reflux of bile {{acids and}} lysolecithin {{in the course}} of a {{standard}} test meal was measured in normal people and in patients with duodenal ulcer before operation and more than one year after highly selective vagotomy, Polya partial gastrectomy, <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and pyloroplasty, and <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and gastrojejunostomy. Before operation, duodenal ulcer patients had significantly higher fasting, post-prandial, and peak bile acid concentrations in the stomach than had normal subjects. After Polya partial gastrectomy, fasting, post-prandial, and peak concentrations of bile acids and lysolecithin were significantly higher than in preoperative duodenal ulcer patients. After highly selective vagotomy, in contrast, bile acid concentrations in the stomach were significantly lower than in preoperative duodenal ulcer patients and post-prandial and peak lysolecithin concentrations were less than half (NS) those recorded in preoperative duodenal ulcer patients. After highly selective vagotomy, bile acid concentrations were also significantly lower than bile acid concentrations after Polya partial gastrectomy, <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and pyloroplasty, and <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and gastrojejunostomy; and post-prandial and peak lysolecithin concentrations were significantly lower than after Polya partial gastrectomy and <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and gastrojejunostomy. Thus, when used in the treatment of patients with duodenal ulcer, highly selective vagotomy keeps `bile' out of the stomach, probably through its effect on gastric smooth muscle, combined with the preservation of an intact antropyloroduodenal segment. In contrast, Polya partial gastrectomy, <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and gastrojejunostomy, and <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and pyloroplasty all lead to a significant increase in reflux of bile acids and lysolecithin into the stomach. The clinical importance of these findings is that both gastritis and, in the long term, gastric carcinoma may prove to be less common after highly selective vagotomy than after partial gastrectomy or vagotomy with a drainage procedure...|$|E
40|$|AN EVALUATION OF THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF ALKALINE REFLUX GASTRITIS IN 585 SYMPTOMATIC POSTOPERATIVE DUODENAL ULCER PATIENTS AFTER <b>TRUNCAL</b> <b>VAGOTOMY</b> AND DRAINAGE, IS PRESENTED. IN 94 PATIENTS (16, 07 %) THE ALKALINE GASTRITIS WAS THESOLE ENDOSCOPIC AND HISTOLOGIC FINDING. THE INCIDENCE OF THE SYNDROME WAS MORE FREQUENT IN PATIENTS WITH <b>TRUNCAL</b> <b>VAGOTOMY</b> AND GASTROJEJUNOSTOMY THAN IN THOSE WITH <b>TRUNCAL</b> <b>VAGOTOMY</b> AND PYLOROPLASTY. THE SYMPTOMATOLOGY DEPENDS ON THE ULCER DISEASE HISTORY, PREOPERATIVELY, AND ON THE PATIENT'S AGE AT THE TIME OFSURGERY. THE SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS DOES NOT ALWAYS MATCH THE DEGREE OF HISTOLOGIC FINDINGS. THE INCIDENCE OF POSTOPERATIVE ALKALINE GASTRITIS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE LOCATION OF GASTROJEJUNOSTOMY AND THE STOMA SIZE OF PYLOROPLASTY.

40|$|An oral glucose {{tolerance}} test was performed in patients who had undergone <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and pyloroplasty, bilateral selective vagotomy and pyloroplasty, or highly selective vagotomy without a drainage procedure {{at least six months}} earlier. The results were compared with those from patients with chronic duodenal ulcer before operation. In all three groups of patients after vagotomy more rapid rates of rise of blood glucose and higher peak concentrations were observed than in patients who were tested before operation. These differences were statistically significant only in patients who had undergone truncal or selective vagotomy with pyloroplasty and were probably due to more rapid rates of gastric emptying after these operations. Plasma insulin concentrations were lower after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> than after selective or highly selective vagotomy, the difference between <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and highly selective vagotomy being statistically significant. <b>Truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> resulted in a diminished insulin response to oral glucose, which could have been due to vagal denervation of the pancreas or, more probably, impaired release of small-bowel hormones which normally augment the pancreatic insulin response...|$|E
40|$|<b>Truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> {{results in}} diminished {{pancreatic}} protein secretion {{in response to}} intraduodenal fat. This diminished secretion may be due, at least in part, to interruption of the vagal reflexes between the intestine and the pancreas that work independently of cholecystokinin (CCK). In five dogs with chronic pancreatic fistulas, plasma CCK concentrations and pancreatic protein secretion {{in response to an}} intestinal stimulant (intraduodenal oleate) and to two exogenous peptides (bombesin and CCK- 33) were compared before and after bilateral <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy.</b> Vagotomy decreased integrated protein secretion by about 50 % in response to intraduodenal oleate. In contrast, protein output in response to parenteral stimuli increased after vagotomy. Integrated output of CCK in response to intraduodenal oleate or to exogenous bombesin or CCK was not significantly affected by vagotomy, but release of pancreatic polypeptide was decreased significantly in response to all stimuli after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy.</b> These data provide evidence that <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> decreases pancreatic protein secretion in response to intestinal stimulants by interrupting enteropancreatic reflexes mediated by the vagus, while maintaining normal (or supranormal) sensitivity of the pancreas to endogenous and exogenous CCK...|$|E
40|$|The antral-duodenal {{contractile}} {{relationship was}} studied in control, after parietal cell vagotomy and <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> conditions using extraluminal strain gage transducers. All conditions were investigated under interdigestive and digestive states and after insulin, bethanechol and histamine. After parietal cell vagotomy, there was minimal alteration of the antral-duodenal relationship {{in both the}} interdigestive and digestive states. The number and amplitude of contractions on both the antrum and duodenum (as reflected by a motility index) were not changed from control by the various stimulants. The one exception was that histamine markedly stimulated the duodenal contractile activity. In the <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> condition, there was a total disruption of the antral-duodenal relationship in the interdigestive and digestive states. There was {{a significant decrease in}} the number and amplitude of contractions occurring on the antrum during the interdigestive and after insulin stimulation. Food was ineffective in stimulating the antrum in 2 of 3 dogs. In contrast, motor activity of the duodenum was minimally influenced by <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy.</b> In conclusion, parietal cell vagotomy has minimal disruptive effects on the antralduodenal relationship while <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> reduces antral contractile activity...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} of 558 men with duodenal ulcer {{who had been}} treated ten to 16 years previously by <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and drainage, <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and antrectomy and subtotal gastrectomy. Of the 558, 65 had died and 111, presumed living, could not be traced, leaving 382 available for assessment. Between 75 and 85 % of the traced patients were considered to have an excellent or very good result, which is a slight improvement on the previously published results in this same group of patients at five to eight years follow-up. Some of {{the side effects of}} operation had diminished slightly in frequency and there had been no significant increase in the incidence of recurrent ulceration since the previous survey. Anemia was an uncommon finding. As between the various forms of operation, <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and antrectomy and subtotal gastrectomy demonstrated significantly better protection against proven recurrent ulcer than did <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and pyloroplasty (p less than 0. 05). Compared with <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and gastroenterostomy, however, the results of both resection operations, though better, did not achieve statistical significance at p - 0. 5 level (p less than 0. 1). In regard to Visick gradings the resection procedures had better scores, but the differences were not significant at the p - 0. 05 level, except for vagotomy and antractomy as compared with vagotomy and pyloroplasty. But it is stressed that in formulating a policy of surgical therapy for duodenal ulcer the greater inherent immediate risks of resection operations need to be borne in mind...|$|E
40|$|Peptic ulcer surgery {{has been}} revitalized by the {{introduction}} of minimal access techniques for surgery of chronic and perforated peptic ulcer. A wide range of vagotomies, including <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy,</b> anterior lesser curve seromyotomy with posterior <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and proximal gastric vagotomy, have been performed laparoscopically. Short-term (two- 24 month) follow-up of laparoscopic anterior seromyotomy with posterior <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> cases has been promising, but long-term follow-up is required to confirm these early good results. Laparoscopic repair of perforated peptic ulcers has also been described. Initial reports of laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy and Billroth II partial gastrectomy have also appeared. These procedures are technically very demanding and are currently being performed in only a few "centers of excellence" around the world. Cost-benefit analyses of medical treatment with proton-pump inhibitors versus laparoscopic vagotomy are necessary to determine which form of treatment is more economical in the long run.

40|$|We {{studied the}} acute effect of transthoracic <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> or sham vagotomy (control) on fasting serum gastrin {{concentrations}} in 22 gastric fistula dogs. A significant (p less than 0. 05) decrease in serum gastrin concentration was detectable within 2. 5 minutes after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy,</b> and by 120 minutes serum gastrin has decreased to 15 +/- 1 pg/mL in the vagotomy {{group compared to}} 28 +/- 3 pg/mL {{in the control group}} (p less than 0. 001).

Thus <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> had a biphasic effect on serum gastrin concentrations in dogs (acute inhibition followed by stimulation).

In six patients studied after proximal gastric vagotomy a variable response was seen. Gastric efferent vagal function was assessed by a combined insulin/pentagastrin gastric secretory test and did not correlate closely with the lower oesophageal sphincteric response to increased intra-gastric pressure. These findings are explicable if it is assumed that <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> interrupts the afferent limb of a reflex arc regulating lower oesophageal sphincteric tone...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} the partial gastrectomy associated to anterior <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> in the absorption and metabolism of iron. METHODS: Eighteen adults male Wistar rats were submitted to the partial gastrectomy associated to anterior <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> (eight animals) and the sham operation (10 animals, control group). The diet consumption and the weight gains of the animals were monitored three times during the week. The animals received supplements of vitamin B 12, for the prevention of the megaloblastic anemia, and a formulated experimental diet orally and denominated AIN- 93 M by 8 weeks. The fecal iron, apparent absorption of the iron, haematocrit, haemoglobin and serum iron were measured after 60 days. RESULTS: The animals undergoing sham operation presented larger statistical averages (p< 0. 05) for the diet consumption, weight gains, apparent absorption of iron, haematocrit, haemoglobin and serum iron compared to the gastrectomized group. However, the excretion of iron in feces was larger in the gastrectomized group (+ 14. 3 %) (p< 0. 05) when compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: Partial gastrectomy associated to anterior <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> showed to be a good experimental model the study of iron metabolism, decreasing the haematocrit, the haemoglobin and the iron absorption, consequently causing anemia...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Serum gastrin {{has been}} {{measured}} in 30 patients following selective gastric vagotomy. Basal serum gastrin was 52 + 5. 7 pg/ml which {{was significantly lower}} than the corresponding level in 50 patients following <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> (84 + 7. 9 pg/ml). After a standard protein meal serum gastrin rose to 136 ± 8. 3 pg/ml at 60 minutes after the meal. The peak rise above basal levels was significantly lower than that achieved in patients who had undergone <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy.</b> These results complement our previous hypothesis that section of extragastric vagal fibres permits the release of additional gastrin above that expected with the diminution of acid secretion, and hence the decrease in inhibition of gastrin release from the antrum. Korman, Hansky, and Scott (1972) suggested that <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> permits the release of gastrin from the antrum and other sites. They postulated that the mechanism for this release is a combination of diminution in gastric acid secretion and removal of an inhibitor to extragastric gastrin release by section of extragastric vagal fibres. The validity of this hypothesis has been examined in patients with duodenal ulcer by comparing gastrin levels following selective gastric vagotomy with those following <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy.</b> If the hypothesis is correct then selective gastric vagotomy by preservation of extragastric vagal fibres should permit the inhibitor to remain active and prevent the release of extragastric gastrin. Material and Methods After an overnight fast, serum gastrin was estimated in 30 patients who had undergone bilateral selective gastric vagotomy and drainage for active duodenal ulcer. The surgical procedure was as reported by Coupland and Cumberland (1971), the operation having been performed from one month to four years previously. Six females and 24 males comprised the grou...|$|E
40|$|Recent reviews have {{documented}} significant delayed gastric emptying following Roux-Y biliary diversion for alkaline gastritis. This study establishes {{the use of}} radionuclide imaging in the experimental model and evaluates the following: (1) gastric emptying following antrectomy with and without vagal denervation; (2) the effect of Roux-Y diversion on gastric and upper gastrointestinal emptying using animals as their own controls; and (3) the role of <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> in the "Roux-Y delayed emptying syndrome. " Upper gastrointestinal emptying was evaluated in 8 dogs using the radionuclide technetium 99 labeled egg white method with continuous visualization by gamma camera. Eight dogs underwent B-II antrectomy without vagotomy and {{were divided into two}} groups. Four underwent vagotomy, re-evaluation, and Roux-Y diversion. Four underwent Roux-Y diversion first, re-evaluation, then <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy.</b> Control dogs retained 65 % +/- 4 % (SEM) and 45 % +/- 6 % of ingested food at 2 and 4 hours, respectively. Following antrectomy only, rapid gastric emptying of radionuclide solid is observed with 35 % +/- 7 %, 16 % +/- 4 % and 7 % +/- 4 % retention and 2, 3, and 4 hours, respectively. Roux-Y antrectomy without vagotomy results in similar rapid gastric emptying. <b>Truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> following B-II antrectomy delays gastric emptying compared to antrectomy only. <b>Truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> and Roux diversion results in varied patterns of gastrointestinal emptying. Significant gastric retention and gastric and Roux limb retention are observed in 25 % of trials. Significant Roux limb retention is observed in 45 % of the group. Prior to vagotomy there is no retention or altered transit in the Roux limb. In general, no delay in gastrointestinal emptying is observed in the absence of vagal denervation. These data corroborate our clinical experience in observing both Roux and gastric retention following radionuclide evaluation in Roux-Y patients...|$|E

40|$|Prolonged (18 - 24 hours) {{recordings}} of the pattern of small intestinal motor activity have been made, using radiotelemetry, in seven patients before surgery for chronic duodenal ulcer, seven after <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy,</b> and four with persistent post-vagotomy diarrhoea. There {{was no difference in}} the pattern of fasting cyclical activity between the three groups but the duration of feeding activity after a standard meal was reduced in asymptomatic <b>truncal</b> <b>vagotomy</b> patients compared with duodenal ulcer controls (p less than 0. 05). In patients with post-vagotomy diarrhoea, the duration of the feeding pattern was further reduced compared with the asymptomatic post-vagotomy patients (p less than 0. 001). It is suggested that altered emptying of food from the stomach in these patients together with duodenal receptor insensitivity is the probable explanation of these changes...|$|E
