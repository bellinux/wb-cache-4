5|$|In 1150, {{it looked}} like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney {{were going to come}} under {{permanent}} Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> and let him reduce their power.|$|E
5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{two-level}} approach involves {{engaging in}} critical reasoning and considering {{all the possible}} ramifications of one's actions before making an ethical decision, but reverting to generally reliable moral rules when one {{is not in a}} position <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> and examine the dilemma as a whole. In practice, this equates to adhering to rule consequentialism when one can only reason on an intuitive level, and to act consequentialism when in a position <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> and reason on a more critical level.|$|E

25|$|Peter and {{the army}} fight the {{animated}} creatures on the White Witch's army. As the battle rages on, the White Witch starts to turn those on Aslan's side to stone. As both sides clash and the Witch prepared to turn yet another of Aslan's army into stone, Edmund uses his sword to break the White Witch's wand. She then stabs the broken half into Edmund. When Peter notices this, he starts to chase the White Witch up the ravine, only for Aslan {{to show up and}} tell him <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back.</b> Reinforcements charge the field as Aslan starts roaring. As they are driving the White Witch's army away, Aslan continues roaring until the ground beneath the White Witch starts to shake and she falls to her death. Her remaining allies are chased from the battlefield by Aslan's army. Edmund and other injured members of Aslan's army are revived by Lucy's cordial.|$|E

500|$|Velázquez's {{portraits of}} the royal family {{themselves}} had until then been straightforward, if often unflatteringly direct and highly complex in expression. On the other hand, his royal portraits, designed to be seen across vast palace rooms, feature more strongly than his other works the bravura handling for which he is famous: [...] "Velázquez's handling of paint is exceptionally free, and as one approaches Las Meninas there is a point at which the figures suddenly dissolve into smears and blobs of paint. The long-handled brushes he used enabled him <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> and judge the total effect." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf {{have to pick up}} the pieces for her in the end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> and let it run its course and be there at the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in a really bad place at the moment".|$|E
500|$|From Acatepeque, the Spanish {{expedition}} {{proceeded to}} Acajutla, on the Pacific coast. On 8 June 1524, {{they met with}} a massed native force, arrayed for battle half a league (approximately [...] ) beyond the settlement. Alvarado's army initially approached close to the waiting warriors, before feigning a retreat towards a nearby hill. The native forces pursued {{for a quarter of}} a league, arriving within bow-shot of the invaders, at which point Alvarado ordered both cavalry and infantry to charge. In the battle that followed, the defending natives were killed to a man. Alvarado described how the natives were so encumbered by their thick cotton armour and their weapons, that when they fell they were unable <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> up to defend themselves. Many Spaniards were wounded in the battle, and Alvarado was seriously injured by an arrow that passed through his leg, he needed much time to recover and was left with a permanent limp. The Spanish rested in Acajutla for five days after the battle, in order to rest and recover from their wounds.|$|E

500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took {{a bit of time}} for us to realize {{that we were going to}} make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E

At 6:36 in the video, an officer tells a male student, [...] "Get back over there or you’re going to get tased, too." [...] The student, wearing a white t-shirt in the video, can be seen [...] "using intense body language" [...] and [...] "talking heatedly and with raised [...] " [...] prior to being confronted.

2500|$|At Whalley Range, Manchester, Peace {{was seen}} by two policemen {{entering}} the grounds of a house on 1 August 1876, about midnight. [...] One of them, PC Nicholas Cock, intercepted {{him as he was}} trying to escape. Peace took out his revolver and warned Cock <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back.</b> The policeman came on. Peace fired, but deliberately wide of him. Cock drew his truncheon, and Peace fired again, this time seriously wounding Cock, who died on 2 August. In the dark, Peace was able to escape, and two brothers, John and William Habron, living nearby, were arrested and charged with the killing of Constable Cock. At Manchester Assizes, John Habron was acquitted for lack of evidence, but William Habron was sentenced to death, later commuted to penal servitude for life. Peace had made a point of attending the trial, to confirm that he was not a suspect, before returning to Darnall.|$|E

Carboy, {{explaining}} {{that he is a}} physician, asks the crowd <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> and steps in to help. After making a quick examination, he writes a prescription, which Eliza takes to be filled. Thomas now revives briefly, and before passing out again, makes a delirious comment that implies that he is of noble birth. Carboy unfastens his patient's jacket, and the crowd are shocked to find that Thomas is a Knight of the Garter. Thomas revives, {{and it turns out that}} he is the Duke of Islington (a joke reference, since Islington was then a working-class Cockney neighbourhood). He had disguised himself as a commoner so that he could search for a humble, virtuous wife without revealing his true rank. [...] Now that his secret is discovered, Thomas makes a garbled but well-received speech and, taking the perceptive crowd's advice, resolves to propose marriage to Eliza as soon as he can change into his [...] "native guise." [...] He exits.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{variations}} of lawn darts, including Traditional and Handly Cup Style. Either variation can be played one-on-one or in teams of two. In the team version the players stand with one member from each team at each end (when throwing, they should be sure <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> well <b>back</b> when the other side is throwing) and toss the darts to a target about 35 ft away (with variation based on the players' skill and the venue in which the game is being played).|$|R

50|$|A flapper is a {{wildland}} firefighting {{tool that}} resembles a broom or a leaf rake with wide, overlapping metal bristles {{in the form of}} a hand fan. It is also called a swatter or a beater. It is designed for extinguishing minor fires in rural areas such as heaths. A flapper is built with a long handle and a series of lamellae which allows firefighters <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> well <b>back</b> from the fire. The lamellae are constructed in either rubber or steel, though practically any other fireproof material could be used.|$|R
2500|$|In cricket, the striker's end stumps and {{the bowling}} crease are [...] apart. The popping creases are [...] {{in front of}} the stumps and thus are [...] apart. The bowler's release point could be perhaps [...] beyond his popping crease (both {{positions}} change every over). The batsman tends to [...] "take guard" [...] or [...] "block" [...] on the popping crease, i.e. he stands [...] in front of his stumps. That nets to a typical distance of about [...] between delivery point and bat. In baseball, the pitcher's release point could be about [...] depending on his delivery style, but the batter also tends <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> or [...] "deep" [...] in the batter's box, to maximise his time to [...] "look the ball over", up to [...] further from the pitching rubber than the point of home plate is. Thus the horizontal distance, from release of the ball by the pitcher/bowler to its arrival at the batter/batsman, is similar in both sports. However, the ball usually travels further in cricket as it normally bounces off the ground first, adding a significant vertical component to the total distance travelled.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the Presence of the Lord {{appeared}} {{to the whole}} community, and God told Moses and Aaron <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> so that God could annihilate the others. Moses and Aaron fell on their faces and implored God not to punish the whole community. God told Moses to instruct the community {{to move away from}} the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and they did so, while Dathan, Abiram, and their families stood at the entrance of their tents. Moses told the Israelites that if these men were to die of natural causes, then God did not send Moses, but if God caused the earth to swallow them up, then these men had spurned God. Just as Moses finished speaking, the earth opened and swallowed them, their households, and all Korah's people, and the Israelites fled in terror. And a fire consumed the 250 men offering the incense. God told Moses to order Eleazar the priest to remove the fire pans — as they had become sacred — and have them made into plating for the altar to remind the Israelites that no one other than Aaron's offspring should presume to offer incense to God. The next day, the whole Israelite community railed against Moses and Aaron for bringing death upon God's people. A cloud covered the Tabernacle and the God's Presence appeared.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{features}} {{may include}} a heated seat, {{which may be}} adjustable from 30°C to 40°C; an automatic lid equipped with a proximity sensor, which opens and closes based on {{the location of the}} user. Some play music to relax the user's sphincter [...] (some Inax toilets, for example, play the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 Frühlingslied by Felix Mendelssohn). Other features are automatic flushing, automatic air deodorizing, and a germ-resistant surface. Some models specially designed for the elderly may include armrests and devices that help the user <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>back</b> up after use. A soft close feature slows the toilet lid down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the toilet lid will close automatically a certain time after flushing. The most recent introduction is the ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms the toilet seat only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have air conditioning below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone {{standing in front of the}} toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).|$|E

This can include personnel wearing arc flash {{personal protective equipment}} (PPE) or modifying the design and configuration of electrical equipment. The best way to remove the hazards of an arc flash is to de-energize electrical equipment when interacting with it, however de-energizing electrical equipment is {{in and of itself}} an arc flash hazard. In this case, one of the newest solutions is to allow the operator <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> far <b>back</b> from the electrical equipment by operating equipment remotely, this is called remote racking.|$|R
