5|$|Prior to the statute's {{enactment}} in 1710, copying {{restrictions were}} {{authorized by the}} Licensing of the Press Act 1662. These restrictions were enforced by the Stationers' Company, a guild of printers given the exclusive power to print—and <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> censor—literary works. The censorship administered under the Licensing Act led to public protest; as the act had to be renewed at two-year intervals, authors and others sought to prevent its reauthorisation. In 1694, Parliament refused to renew the Licensing Act, ending the Stationers' monopoly and press restrictions.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary role}} of the goalkeeper is to block shots at the goal. After saving the ball, the goalkeeper has <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> keep {{possession}} of the ball {{in order to stop}} opposing players regaining possession. They must make sure that whenever the opposition appears to be ready to make a shot on goal, their hands are near or above the surface of the water. They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately in order to retain possession of the ball, often starting the team's counterattack.|$|E

He later ran an insurance business in Ashton-under-Lyne and later supervised industrial cleaning contract work at exhibitions and shows. He returned to former club Stoke City in 1997 {{to work in the}} hospitality department at the new Britannia Stadium. He later also worked as a PA matchday announcer at the ground. He was also appointed welfare officer by the Football Association of Ireland in 2008, giving him <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> look after Irish youngsters who came to the UK to join academy scholarship programmes. His contract with the FAI was not renewed when it expired in 2011.|$|E
5|$|During Michigan's in-home visit, Howard's {{grandmother}} treated Michigan {{head coach}} Fisher, his assistants Mike Boyd and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois Howard (Howard's aunt) and Howard to a soul food dinner. Dutcher had <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> contact Howard {{several times a}} week. Howard grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at his house and using his car once he got a driver's license. During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched Howard practice 28 consecutive days. Dutcher developed {{an understanding of the}} dynamics of Howard's relationship with his grandmother. While other coaches, such as Lute Olsen, almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher understood that she was the key influence on his life, and understood that Kirskey also had sway with Howard. He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp that, which became the young athlete's introduction to Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June 1942, the Wehrmacht {{began its}} {{offensive}} against Soviet forces opposite of Army Group South, codenamed Case Blue. After breaking through Red Army forces by 13 July, German forces encircled and captured {{the city of}} Rostov. Following the fall of Rostov, Hitler split German forces operating in the southern extremity of the southern Russian SFSR {{in an effort to}} simultaneously capture the city of Stalingrad and the Caucasus oil fields. <b>The</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> take Stalingrad was given to the Sixth Army, which immediately turned towards the Volga River and began its advance with heavy air support from the Luftwaffe's Luftflotte 4. On 7 August, two German panzer corps were able to flank and encircle a Soviet force of 50,000 personnel and approximately 1,000 tanks, and on 22 August German forces began to cross the Don River to complete the advance towards the Volga. The following day, the Battle of Stalingrad began when vanguards of the Sixth Army penetrated the suburbs of the city.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 1600, after {{refusing to}} convert to Catholicism, Kepler {{and his family were}} banished from Graz. Several months later, Kepler returned, now {{with the rest of his}} household, to Prague. Through most of 1601, he was {{supported}} directly by Tycho, who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho's (by then deceased) rival, Ursus. In September, Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor: the Rudolphine Tables that should replace the Prutenic Tables of Erasmus Reinhold. Two days after Tycho's unexpected death on October 24, 1601, Kepler was appointed his successor as imperial mathematician with <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> complete his unfinished work. The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court, {{reversing}} the Fifth Circuit, {{held that the}} NLRB decision was appropriate because its interpretation of the NLRA was permissible. The Court explained that the NLRB is entrusted with <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> adapt the NLRA to changing times and {{that as a result}} courts reviewing its decisions only have the authority to reject its interpretations of the NLRA if those decisions are impermissible under it. This also led to the Court's observation that the NLRB can change its interpretation of the NLRA over time and is not required to comply with its earlier decisions.|$|E

5|$|The tunnel {{project is}} a {{public-private}} partnership (PPP or P3), designed to transfer <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> design, build, finance, operate, and maintain the project to the private sector. Ten banks, BNP Paribas, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, RBS Citizens, N.A., Banco Santander, Bayerische Hypo, Calyon, Dexia, ING Capital, Societe Generale, and WestLB, will provide the senior debt financing for the project, which totals $341.5 million. The project attracted three bidding consortia. Under the concession agreement, FDOT will make milestone payments to the concessionaire (Miami Access Tunnel) during the construction period, upon the achievement of contractual milestones. 90% of Miami Access Tunnel's equity is provided by Meridiam Infrastructure Miami LLC (Luxembourg based Meridiam SARL); the remaining 10% by France's Bouygues Travaux Publics SA, operating as Dragages Concession Florida Inc. The Port of Miami Tunnel Project {{was one of the}} first P3s in Florida, and the first availability-based P3 deal in the US, after the Interstate 595 (I-595) renovation project in Broward County.|$|E
5|$|The widespread—mainly German—revolutions of 1848–49 sought {{unification}} of Germany {{under a single}} constitution. The revolutionaries pressured various state governments, particularly those in the Rhineland, for a parliamentary assembly that would have <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> draft a constitution. Ultimately, many of the left-wing revolutionaries hoped this constitution would establish universal male suffrage, a permanent national parliament, and a unified Germany, possibly {{under the leadership of}} the Prussian king. This seemed to be the most logical course since Prussia was the strongest of the German states, as well as the largest in geographic size. Generally, center-right revolutionaries sought some kind of expanded suffrage within their states and potentially, a form of loose unification. Their pressure resulted in a variety of elections, based on different voting qualifications, such as the Prussian three-class franchise, which granted to some electoral groups—chiefly the wealthier, landed ones—greater representative power.|$|E
50|$|The {{third pillar}} {{addresses}} both <b>the</b> state's <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> {{provide access to}} remedy through judicial, administrative, and legislative means, and <b>the</b> corporate <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> prevent and remediate any infringement of rights that they contribute to. Having effective grievance mechanisms in place is crucial in upholding the state's duty to protect and <b>the</b> corporate <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> respect. <b>The</b> UNGPs dictate that non-judicial mechanisms, whether state-based or independent, should be legitimate, accessible, predictable, rights-compatible, equitable, and transparent. Similarly, Company-level mechanisms are encouraged to operate through dialogue and engagement, rather than with the company acting as the adjudicator of its own actions.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the writing, {{and also}} the filming stages of the series, the writers were advised by ex-MI5 {{officers}} who gave insight into how the characters operate and how their personal lives {{would be affected by}} it. Among the advisors were Nick Day, who worked in counter-terrorism in the Security Services, Viktor Abramkin, a UK-based former KGB officer, and Mike Baker, an ex-CIA agent. When including terrorists, the BBC often has <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> portray people with as much balance as possible for both sides. The first series finale was heavily researched, as the episode was based on real life instances in which terrorists agreed to work with the authorities in Colombia. Meanwhile, a scene in which Tom and Patrick strip naked to ensure they are not bugged came from the producers' sources. The sources also advised the producers how to tail targets without being spotted.|$|E
5|$|Until 1976, {{federal tax}} {{incentives}} were virtually non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.|$|E
5|$|Organisationally, {{the commune}} of Pichilemu has a mayor–council form of government. This {{provides}} for a commune-wide elected mayor serving in an executive role, {{as well as a}} city council serving in a legislative role. The mayor, as the highest authority of the commune of Pichilemu, has <b>the</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> direct, manage and supervise the work of the municipality, and legally represents the commune. The mayor is also responsible for administrating the commune's financial resources, and municipal and national goods of public use, presides the local city council, and has the power to delegate his work to other functionaries of the local government, which he may appoint. Additionally, the mayor may give a public account of his gesture to the city council every year, usually in April; an extract of his account may be published to the community. If the mayor dies in office, resigns, or is unable to carry out his/her duties, a councilor may be elected by the city council to replace the former mayor. In the meantime, the municipal secretary may take office as acting mayor. This has happened several times in Pichilemu: following the resignation of René Maturana Maldonado in April 1992, municipal secretary Gustavo Parraguez Galarce took over his office since, at the time, there were no councilors; in November 1998, mayor Jorge Vargas González was convicted of illegally giving a driver's license, and the city council chose councilor Carlos Leyton Labarca until Vargas González resumed his duties in November 1999.|$|E
