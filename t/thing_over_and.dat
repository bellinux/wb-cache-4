He despaired of being [...] "a clerk, a machine, a riding-school hack, eating and drinking and sleeping at fixed hours. I should be like everyone else. And that's what they call living, that life at the grindstone, doing the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again.... I am hungry and nothing is offered to appease my appetite". He announced his intention to become a writer.|$|E
2500|$|Between them, Homme and Oliveri had {{different}} {{opinions on the}} usage of fake radio excerpts between tracks on the album, the former believing it gave the album [...] "fluidity". According to Oliveri, they are a jibe at [...] "how a lot of stations play the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over. We don't get played on the radio, so I figure we should talk shit about them." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you {{get caught up in the}} creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2008 interview, Bakshi {{referred}} to Crumb as a [...] "hustler" [...] and stated, [...] "He goes {{in so many}} directions that he's hard to pin down. I spoke {{to him on the}} phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that château of his in France.... I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, {{if you want to do}} the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over. He should have been my best friend for what I did with Fritz the Cat. I drew a good picture, and we both made out fine." [...] Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.|$|E
2500|$|Oral residue rarely disappears {{quickly and}} never vanishes completely. [...] Speech is {{inherently}} an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts. [...] Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly {{shown in the}} arguments of Socrates against writing in Plato’s Phaedrus. [...] Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman. [...] It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the human mind into mere objects in the physical world. [...] By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what {{they are able to}} think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory. [...] True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds. [...] And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again, no matter how often it is refuted.|$|E
2500|$|... "Even Flow" [...] {{features}} lyrics {{written by}} vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "I {{know it was}} a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it." [...] Drummer Dave Krusen said, [...] "I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation." [...] He added that [...] "it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated, [...] "We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band plays music more {{oriented}} towards '70s guitar-driven {{rock bands}} because, as Wood stated, [...] "etal just becomes the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over. Anyway, I'm {{not really a}} metal dude. None of us are. I'm sure if you studied pictures of 3 Inches of Blood you could pick us out as not really belonging there". Sunny and Bobby were replaced by Justin Hagberg, who had previously played with Pipes in Allfather, a black metal band, and Shane Clark. Roadrunner put out an advertising blitz, and the track [...] "Deadly Sinners" [...] from the band's second release Advance and Vanquish appeared on numerous sampler CDs, compilations, and even three video games (Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Saints Row 2, and Brütal Legend), creating a huge press hype for the band that caused their popularity to skyrocket, with a slot on 2005's Road Rage tour in August (with bands like Machine Head and Chimaira) gaining them many new fans.|$|E
