5|$|Almost {{as soon as}} the war began, {{submarine}} captains indicated {{there were}} problems with <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 14 torpedo and the influence feature of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 6 exploder. Torpedoes would fail to explode, or explode prematurely. Despite these reports, Christie was not fully aware {{of the impact of the}} situation, because his S-boats used the older Mark 10 torpedo, with a contact-only pistol. Christie acknowledged Mark 14s were running deeper than set, but attributed the failures to poor maintenance and errors on the part of the captain and crew. He was convinced <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 6 was satisfactory, and ordered all fleet boats to continue to use it. In November 1942, Christie was ordered to return to Newport as Inspector of Ordnance at the Torpedo Station. Newport had become a bottleneck for torpedo manufacture, and the Bureau of Ordnance wanted to advance development of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 18 electric torpedo. Christie resisted leaving his command at Brisbane, but was considered of more use to resolve the torpedo issue. He was replaced by Captain James Fife. For his service at Brisbane, Christie was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} three unmarked-marked verbal pairs {{that exist}} in the Neo-Aramaic dialects of Christian Barwar and Christian Urmi. Each pair is analyzed for the opposing forms 2 ̆ 7 formal and functional differences, with an emphasis on function. It is argued that {{despite the fact that the}} morphemes affixed to <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> forms are aspectual prefixes, <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> forms 2 ̆ 7 main functional differences from their unmarked counterparts are pragmatic ones. Chapter I presents an introduction to the study, including information about the dialects analyzed and the study itself. Chapter II focuses on <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> forms that signal relationships between events in the discourse. This chapter first explores the unmarked qaṭəl form versus <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> bəd-qaṭəl form, wherein it is argued that <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> form signals to the listener to interpret <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> event in relation to another event in the nearby discourse. The same unmarked qaṭəl form is then presented in opposition to <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> i-qaṭəl form, and it is claimed that <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> form indicates a sequence-final event. Chapter III is an analysis of the unmarked qṭille form versus <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> qəm-qaṭəl form, and it is determined that <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> form is used to represent the event from the point of view of the object. Chapter IV presents concluding remarks...|$|R

5|$|By November 1942, North Carolina had an {{additional}} Mark 4 and a SG surface search radar added. The normal battleship configuration was present aboard North Carolina in April 1944, with SK and SG radars (air and surface search, respectively), a backup SG, and Mark 8s to direct its main battery. All of <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 4s remained for the secondary battery, {{and one of}} the older Mark 3s was still present, possibly as a backup for <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 8s. An SK-2 dish replaced the older SK radar and Mark 12s and 22s superseded <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 4s in September of that year. Aside from never receiving an SK-2, Washington was the recipient of similar upgrades.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the promise}} of the design, many {{operational}} officers were opposed to the use of volatile hydrogen peroxide aboard ship. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 16 went into limited production while work on <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 17 was suspended in 1941, but resumed in 1944. Admiral Ernest King favored focusing research efforts on electric torpedoes so work on the oxygen system was downgraded. As such, the U.S. Navy made no combat use of the oxygen torpedo design during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> II would only cover a forward arc, unlike <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> III. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> III would indicate surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within a quarter of a mile. <b>The</b> <b>Mark</b> III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E

5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II or <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
