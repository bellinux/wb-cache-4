5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from <b>the</b> <b>grasp</b> of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the Tudor rose, the nation's floral emblem, and the Three Lions {{featured on the}} Royal Arms of England. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England {{around the time of}} the Wars of the Roses as a symbol of peace. It is a syncretic symbol in that it merged the white rose of the Yorkists and the red rose of the Lancastrians—cadet branches of the Plantagenets who went to war over control of the nation. It is also known as the Rose of England. The oak tree is a symbol of England, representing strength and endurance.

5|$|Laker to {{this point}} had taken 3/22 from 12.4 overs, having also top-scored in the first innings. All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would {{for most of the}} day. Brown came in at No. 5, but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and looked unaccustomed to playing in the middle order, but Bradman brought him in ahead of Hassett as the new ball was due and Brown was used to {{starting}} his innings against pace bowlers and a new ball. The Australian captain decided to hasten the new ball by using his feet to get to the pitch of the ball to attack the spinners, hitting them through the off side. Yardley removed Lakerwho was bowling effectivelyfrom the attack and took the second new ball, bringing back Bedser and Edrich. However, this move backfired as Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes, and in the first 40 minutes after lunch, 43 runs were added. Yardley brought back his two spinners, and Australia passed England's total before the English captain brought himself on to bowl, trapping Brownwho was attempting to push the ball to mid-onlbw with an off cutter in his first over. This ended a 64-run stand in 58 minutes and Hassett came in at 185/4. The Australian vice-captain came close to being caught when he knocked a ball from Bedser into the air, narrowly evading <b>the</b> <b>grasp</b> of Evans. Following the departure of Brown, the Australian scoring slowed as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once.|$|E

25|$|A forced fumble with 22 {{seconds left}} in the game gave the Mountaineers a 28–27 win over James Madison. The Dukes {{controlled}} the game in practically every statistical category, most notably the time of possession, which was over 40 minutes. James Madison's quarterback, Rodney Landers, led the dukes with 253 yards of total offense. Armanti Edwards accounted for 258 total yards of offense for the Mountaineers. The Mountaineers were down 27–22 with less than two minutes remaining in the game and facing fourth down. Edwards found the end zone after completing a pass to Devon Moore to put the Mountaineers ahead 28–27. On the ensuing possession, the Dukes drove 62 yards down the field to put themselves within easy field goal range. James Madison head coach Mickey Matthews made the decision to run one more play which resulted in a fumble.

500|$|Among the {{prominent}} early Toscas was Emmy Destinn, who sang the role regularly in a long-standing {{partnership with the}} tenor Enrico Caruso. Maria Jeritza, over many years at the Met and in Vienna, brought her own distinctive style to the role, and {{was said to be}} Puccini's favorite Tosca. Jeritza was the first to deliver [...] "Vissi d'arte" [...] from a prone position, having fallen to the stage while eluding <b>the</b> <b>grasp</b> of Scarpia. This was a great success, and Jeritza sang the aria while on the floor thereafter. Of her successors, opera enthusiasts tend to consider Maria Callas as the supreme interpreter of the role, largely on the basis of her performances at the Royal Opera House in 1964, with Tito Gobbi as Scarpia. This production, by Franco Zeffirelli, remained in continuous use at Covent Garden for more than 40 years until replaced in 2006 by a new staging, which premiered with Angela Gheorghiu. Callas had first sung Tosca at age18 in a performance given in Greek, in Athens on 27August 1942. Tosca was also her last on-stage operatic role, in a special charity performance at the Royal Opera House on 7May 1965.|$|E
40|$|When {{grasping}} {{an object}} using three fingered end-effectors, a certain geometrical entity {{can be created}} based on <b>the</b> <b>grasping</b> points and a definition of an auxiliary point.

40|$|One of the {{approaches}} {{to increase the}} dexterity of a robot manipulating system is a design philosophy which consists of multiple robotic mechanisms. Applications of such collection of manipulators {{can be in the}} design of a dextrous end-e ector, a recon gurable xture to locate and grip various sized objects or cooperative robotic arms where through their coordinated motions, they are able to accomplish a given task. Although applications of such design philosophy are endless, there are many problems still remain to be addressed. One of these problems is the control of <b>the</b> contact forces (<b>grasping</b> forces) between <b>the</b> mechanisms and the position of <b>the</b> <b>grasped</b> object. This paper addresses this problem. First, a model of the mechanisms in contact with <b>the</b> <b>grasped</b> object is postulated; second the problem of controlling <b>the</b> <b>grasping</b> forces and <b>the</b> position of <b>the</b> <b>grasped</b> object is formulated in the linear multi-input/multi-output system and nally, a centralized optimal controller is proposed for controlling the desired variables. The results of this paper are demonstrated using two examples. One of the main advantages of the proposed optimal controller is that it also shapes the transient response of <b>the</b> <b>grasping</b> force which is an important consideration in cases when grasping fragile objects. ...|$|R

500|$|Professor Steven B. Lichtman of the {{department}} {{of political science at the}} University of Vermont reviewed the book for the Law and Politics Book Review, and identified Nelson's pluralist theory as a significant contribution.

He praised the author for supporting his model with case history: [...] "As a purely philosophical matter, Nelson’s pluralist framework is certainly intriguing. The model must be more than a mere talking point, though, and Nelson wisely endeavors to show how the pluralist framework can be deployed as a means of resolving actual cases". Lichtman concluded by recommending the work for academic scholars: [...] "Beyond the First Amendment is an intriguing and important contribution to the literature on free speech. While it is likely beyond <b>the</b> <b>grasp</b> of all but the most talented undergraduates, its overview of First Amendment theory is an excellent resource for graduate students beginning to explore the field.

500|$|Australia {{had been}} scoring slowly, {{as they would}} {{throughout}} the day, [...] and following Hassett's entrance, the Australians slowed further as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once. Hassett almost holed out early when he knocked a ball from Alec Bedser {{up in the air}} and it just evaded <b>the</b> <b>grasp</b> of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. Yardley continued to employ leg theory, as he and Charlie Barnett bowled outside leg stump; this tactic stifled the Australian scoring but also limited wicket-taking opportunities. During one over, Bradman did not attempt to hit a single ball and put his hands on his hips to express his displeasure at England’s tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian skipper did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. In the last session, Bradman brought up one of his slowest ever centuries, as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking Australian wickets. Bradman reached stumps on 130. Hassett also batted patiently, with one period of 20 minutes during which his score remained on 30. Australia closed the second day at 4/293 to lead by 128, with Hassett on 41, having combined for an unbroken stand of 108 with Bradman.|$|E
