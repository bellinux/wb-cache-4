40|$|Background and Aims It is {{generally}} known that fertilization is delayed for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> pollination in Fagales.

The number of pollen tubes was reduced from many to one, a fact suggesting that delayed fertilization plays a role for gametophyte selection.

5|$|Movement {{disorders}} {{that may}} develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles), {{and loss of}} movement range and control (in particular {{with a loss of}} movement repertoire). The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>after</b> the initial trauma).

There is a {{secondary}} purpose, or opportunity: both humans and dragons may reproduce (the childbearing of leading women is a theme).

5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, {{if only because}} they could more easily get to the courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in.
