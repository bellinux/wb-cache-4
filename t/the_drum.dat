5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> body (or shell), preparing <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> body with a chisel; {{the texture of the}} wood after carving softened the tone of <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b> In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b> These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E
5|$|Miking a Leslie is also {{important}} in a recording studio, as the choice and positioning of microphones determines the overall recorded sound. A popular recommendation is two Shure SM57s on the horn and a Sennheiser MD421 on <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b> Recording Magazine's Dave Martin suggests a similar setup, with various microphone models used as stereo pairs on the horn but using an Electro-Voice RE20 on <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> instead. Keith Emerson recorded his Leslie using a single mic each on the horn and <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> but with the covers removed.|$|E

5000|$|Similarly, {{the role}} of <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> varies {{a great deal from}} one style of music to another. In some types of music, such as {{traditional}} 1950s-style country music, <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> has a rudimentary [...] "timekeeping" [...] role, and <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> are placed low in the mix by the sound engineers. In styles such as progressive rock, metal, and jazz fusion, the drummers often perform complex, challenging parts, and <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> may be given a prominent placement in the mix; as well, <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> may be often given prominent solo breaks, fills, or introductions that put the spotlight on their technical skills and musicality. In the more experimental forms of free jazz and jazz fusion, <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> may not play the strict [...] "timekeeping" [...] role that is associated with drums in pop music. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> may be used more to create textured polyrhythmic soundscapes. In this type of situation, the main pulse is often provided by the bass player rather than <b>the</b> <b>drummer.</b>|$|R

50|$|Bomba is {{described}} to be a challenge/connection between <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> and <b>the</b> dancer. The dancer produces {{a series of}} gestures to which the primo o subidor drummer provides a synchronized beat. Thus, it is <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> who attempts to follow the dancer, and not the more traditional form of the dancer following <b>the</b> <b>drummer.</b> <b>The</b> dancer must be in great physical shape, and the challenge usually continues until either the dancer or <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> discontinues.|$|R

5|$|Art historians {{disagree}} on when and why onion domes became a typical feature of Russian architecture. Byzantine churches and {{the architecture of}} Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b> In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>drums</b> {{are usually}} simple, with a four quarter-note ride pattern with the snare {{on the third}} beat. Most commonly, <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> plays quarter notes on the crash cymbal or china cymbal. In some {{breakdowns}} where a very slow tempo is used, <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> will play half notes, to give the music a very heavy, slow feel. The guitarist usually follows the rhythm, or [...] "chugs", (chugs being palm muted strokes on the lowest three to four string of the guitar) on <b>the</b> kick <b>drum.</b> In most cases <b>the</b> <b>drummer</b> will use <b>the</b> kick <b>drum</b> to complement <b>the</b> [...] "chugs" [...] of the guitars.|$|R
5|$|Jamal, Muhammad, the Associated Press cameraman, and Shams Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, took cover {{against the}} {{concrete}} {{wall in the}} south-east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost. Jamal, Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum, apparently part of a culvert, that was sitting against the wall. A thick paving stone sat on top of <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> which offered further protection. Abu Rahma hid behind a white minibus parked across the road about 15metres away from the wall. The Reuters and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad's shoulders—the cameras pointing toward the Israeli outpost—before the men moved away. Jamal and Muhammad did not move away, but stayed behind <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> for 45 minutes. In Enderlin's view, they were frozen in fear.|$|E

50|$|North Drums {{were invented}} by Roger North, member of Quill, the Holy Modal Rounders, The Freak Mountain Ramblers and The Clamtones. North created <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> {{for his own}} usage {{sometime}} around 1968.

In 1976, North agreed to let Music Technology Incorporated (MTI) manufacture and market <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> in hopes of higher production. Under MTI management, <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> were now produced via an injection-molded polystyrene process.|$|R

5|$|Special unpitched stops {{also appear}} in some organs. Among {{these are the}} Zimbelstern (a wheel of {{rotating}} bells), the nightingale (a pipe submerged in a small pool of water, creating {{the sound of a}} bird warbling when wind is admitted), and the effet d'orage ("thunder effect", a device that sounds the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in organ building.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{have been}} {{developed}} into {{a broad range of}} percussion instruments that are used in both Japanese folk and classical musical traditions. An early classification system based on shape and tension was advanced by Francis Taylor Piggott in 1909.

5|$|The Karashishi is {{most notably}} found in Japan at the {{entrance}} of Shinto Shrines and are used to either ward-off bad spirits or welcome good spirits. The Karashishi dance in Ikata involves two persons dancing under a single guardian lion costume to the beat of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> of a young boy. Ikata's performers are especially well-known throughout most of the prefecture for their dedication to the dance.|$|E
5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> can be stained as needed.|$|E

50|$|As sacred objects, <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> {{were much}} more than simple musical instruments. They were used in rituals, such as the umuganuro, or for special circumstances.
