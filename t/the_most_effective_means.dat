Throughout the duration of their survival, the group drifted northward until April 1916, when the floe on which they had encamped broke up.

5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>means</b> of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too}} little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.|$|E

40|$|Partial {{differential}} equations are usually classified in to two kinds, steady-state equations, {{where all the}} variables are spatial, and evolutionary equations, which combine differentiations with respect to space and time. The evolutionary equations model systems that undergo change {{as a function of}} time and they have application in wave phenomena, thermodynamics, diffusive processes and population dynamics.
