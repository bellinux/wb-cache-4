25|$|The {{second coming}} of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology. Most Christians believe that death and {{suffering}} will continue to exist until Christ's return. Others believe that suffering will gradually be eliminated prior to his coming, and that the elimination of injustice is our part in preparing for that event.

25|$|The {{right to}} an {{education}} is found in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 13 of ICESCR. The Constitution of Tokelau gives no indication {{to the meaning of}} each individual right, therefore ICESCR can be used to define what the right to education actually means. ICESCR goes into some detail of what the right to education entails. It states all primary education should be free and compulsory. Secondary education should be generally available and accessible to all, as should any higher education. It then goes on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> needs to be development in school systems that are free from discrimination, with set minimum standards and a high level of quality.|$|E

Many reviewers said the mere title demonstrated the crudeness and originality of South Park, then still a relatively new show.

[...] This did not prevent the soldier from shooting Little Bird, after which Wooden Leg clubbed the soldier off his horse.

[...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. [...] "There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>There</b> are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story."

500|$|After the Liberal {{losses in}} the 1910 elections, ILP member and {{journalist}} Henry Brailsford helped organise a Conciliation Committee for Women's Suffrage, which gathered 54 MPs from various parties. The group's Conciliation Bill {{looked to be a}} narrowly defined but still significant possibility to achieve the vote for women. Thus the WSPU agreed to suspend its support for window-breaking and hunger strikes while it was being negotiated. When {{it became clear that the}} bill would not pass, Pankhurst declared: [...] "If the Bill, in spite of our efforts, is killed by the Government, then... I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is an end to the truce." [...] When it was defeated, Pankhurst led a protest march of 300 women to Parliament Square on 18 November. They were met with aggressive police response, directed by Home Secretary Winston Churchill: officers punched the marchers, twisted arms, and pulled on women's breasts. Although Pankhurst was allowed to enter Parliament, Prime Minister Asquith refused to meet her. The incident became known as Black Friday.|$|E
