25|$|While {{political}} liberals {{make up a}} clear {{majority of}} Unitarian Universalists, the UU movement aspires <b>to</b> <b>diversity,</b> and officially welcomes congregants regardless of their political views. Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the Bank of Canada hired The Strategic Counsel for $476,000 {{to create}} an image {{catalogue}} from which banknote images would be drawn.

25|$|In 1960, Misr Helwan was {{the first}} firm to be nationalized by Gamal Abdel Nasser. It began <b>to</b> <b>diversity</b> its cotton sources and products, and in 1975 {{established}} a garment unit to complement its cloth manufactory. In 1976, the United States Agency for International Development contributed $96 million in loans to the Egyptian government, intended to help further modernize the Misr company. The loan caused controversy among American textile manufacturers, faced with losses as global textile markets expanded.|$|E
25|$|There {{is still}} {{debate about the}} causes of all mass extinctions. In general, large extinctions may result when a {{biosphere}} under long-term stress undergoes a short-term shock. An underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and origination rates <b>to</b> <b>diversity.</b> High diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate; low diversity to a persistent increase in origination rate. These presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations (asteroid impacts, etc.) to produce the global effects observed.|$|E

25|$|By 1539, Norfolk {{was seriously}} {{challenging}} the religious {{reforms of the}} King's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell. In that year, King Henry VIII sought to have Parliament put an end <b>to</b> <b>diversity</b> in religious opinion. On 5 May, the House of Lords appointed a committee to consider questions of doctrine. Although {{he was not a}} member of the committee, on 16 May, Norfolk presented six conservative articles of religion to Parliament for consideration. On 30 May, the Six Articles and the penalties for failure to conform to them were enacted into law, and on 28 June, received royal assent.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Lattie F. Coor, president from 1990 to 2002, ASU grew {{through the creation of}} the Polytechnic campus and extended education sites. Increased commitment <b>to</b> <b>diversity,</b> quality in undergraduate education, research, and economic development occurred over his 12-year tenure. Part of Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fundraising campaign: through private donations, more than $500million was invested in areas that would significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of Barrett, The Honors College, and the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.|$|E

25|$|In the US, Good Samaritan {{laws have}} been {{implemented}} to protect bystanders who acted in good faith. Many organizations are including bystander training. For example, the United States Department of the Army is doing bystander training with respect to sexual assault. Some organizations routinely do bystander training with respect to safety issues. Others have been doing bystander training with respect <b>to</b> <b>diversity</b> issues. Organizations such as American universities are also using bystander research to improve bystander attitudes in cases of rape. Examples include the InterAct Sexual Assault Prevention program and the Green Dot program. Others {{have been critical of}} these laws for being punitive and criminalizing the problem they are meant to address.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} of this decade also saw a {{dramatic}} increase in display configurations being deployed, including widescreen canvases, multiple projections and video mapped onto the architectural form. This shift has been underlined by the transition from broadcast based technology - fixed until this decade firmly in the 4x3 aspect ratio specifications NTSC and PAL - to computer industry technology, where the varied needs of office presentation, immersive gaming and corporate video presentation have led <b>to</b> <b>diversity</b> and abundance in methods of output. Compared to the ~640x480i fixed format of NTSC/PAL, a contemporary laptop using DVI can output a great variety of resolutions up to ~2500px wide, and in conjunction with the Matrox TripleHead2Go can feed three different displays with an image coordinated across them all.|$|E
25|$|This {{timeline}} of {{the evolutionary}} history of life represents the current scientific theory outlining the major events {{during the development}} of life on planet Earth. In biology, evolution is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes give rise <b>to</b> <b>diversity</b> {{at every level of}} biological organization, from kingdoms to species, and individual organisms and molecules, such as DNA and proteins. The similarities between all present day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species, living and extinct, have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.|$|E

500|$|Indian {{journalist}} and LGBT-rights activist Ashok Row Kavi praised Dostana: [...] "I am glad, {{for the first}} time in Indian popular cinema, gays were not turned into caricatures and made fun of. What the film has done is to bring to notice gays as a concept in [...] Indian family." [...] Its depiction of a homosexual character's acceptance by his mother was seen as encouraging acceptance of gay people. According to a Daily News and Analysis article, [...] "gay talk" [...] went mainstream in Bollywood with the film: [...] "Films like Dostana are playful and funny [...] bring sexuality as a dinner-table conversation piece. Bollywood is open <b>to</b> <b>diversity</b> in terms of subjects, including sexuality, and the audiences are ready to accept diversified subjects".|$|E

500|$|Similar to Disney's Aladdin (1992) and Pocahontas (1995) before it, Mulan {{begins with}} an opening song that {{establishes}} the film's location, setting and cultural characteristics, in this case [...] "Honor to Us All". The song attempts to deconstruct the idea that women are only good for looking attractive and getting married. According <b>to</b> <b>Diversity</b> in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability (2013) author Johnson Cheu, {{the power of the}} Matchmaker's decision [...] "emphasizes the necessity of heterosexual approbation in order to secure a place in society." [...] The musical number highlights Mulan's greatest dilemma; her own individuality constantly contradicts against society's expectations of young women. Consequence of Sounds Dominick Suzanne-Mayer cited [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] as an example of Mulan spending {{a significant portion of the}} film at the mercy of other characters, framing [...] "her preparation rituals for courtship as a gauntlet of demands from... her entire village" [...] while [...] "instructing her about how important it is for her to be complacent and attentive." ...|$|E

40|$|Inflated {{reputation}} {{fraud is}} a serious problem in online auction. Recent work suggested that neighbor diversity is an effective feature for discerning fraudsters from normal users. However, there exist many different methods <b>to</b> quantify <b>diversity</b> in the literature. This raises the problem of finding the most suitable method <b>to</b> calculate neighbor <b>diversity</b> for detecting fraudsters. We collect four different methods <b>to</b> quantify <b>diversity,</b> and apply them <b>to</b> calculate neighbor <b>diversity.</b> We then use these various neighbor diversities for fraudster detection. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that, although these diversities were calculated differently, their performances on fraudster detection are similar. This finding reflects the robustness of neighbor diversity, regardless of how the diversity is calculated...|$|R
