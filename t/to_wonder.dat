5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history {{at the age of}} 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young roguish prince, Fiyero, {{has arrived}} at Shiz. Galinda is charmed when Fiyero shares his life {{philosophy}} ("Dancing Through Life").

Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to invite her to the party, but she convinces him instead to ask Nessarose out of pity, leaving her free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose is delighted and tells her sister how she and Boq {{are meant to be}} together and how Galinda helped it happen.

5|$|On December 12 the Dukes faced {{off against}} another local rival, Robert Morris. In a 59–54win, B.J. Monteiro again {{led the team}} with 17points. Monteiro's {{continued}} high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether the approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back to the bench, or if someone else would lose their starting position. Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points.|$|E

5|$|The {{first issue}} of the merged {{magazine}} appeared in June 1930, still on a monthly schedule, with Lasser as editor. The volume numbering continued that of Science Wonder Stories, therefore Wonder Stories is sometimes regarded as a retitling of Science Wonder Stories. Gernsback had also produced a companion magazine for Science Wonder Stories, titled Science Wonder Quarterly, the {{first issue of}} which was published in the fall of 1929. Three issues were produced under this title, but after the merger Gernsback changed the companion magazine's title <b>to</b> <b>Wonder</b> Stories Quarterly, and produced a further eleven issues under that title.|$|E

It is eventually revealed that Mulder is working as a mole in the group, and he is trying to stop them before they are able to use a biological weapon—that may have been created by members of the US government—which causes rapid degeneration of human flesh.|$|E

5|$|While {{long-term}} {{psychological and}} neurological studies {{have yet to}} yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, {{a few studies have}} provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users. A UCLA study led some <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's functional MRI scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of plant {{material}} is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of Ficus species, Leucopogon species, Exocarpos species, a cycad Macrozamia riedlei, a mistletoe Lysiana exocarpi, Astroloma humifusum, A.pinifolium, Myoporum insulare, Enchylaena tomentosa and Coprosma quadrifida. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as Pyracantha angustifolia and P.fortuneana, and Cotoneaster species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various stone fruit of the genus Prunus, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong {{has been identified as}} the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies monilifera), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, A.pinifolium is especially popular, and one observer noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether the plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.|$|E
5|$|As Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin, Olbricht {{refuses to}} {{mobilize}} the Reserve Army until he knows without a doubt that Hitler is dead (if Hitler isn't dead, Olbricht will be arrested for having the reserve army mobilized without Fromm's permission). Behind Olbricht's back, Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway. With Operation Valkyrie underway, Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup. As Army soldiers begin {{to take control of}} Berlin's government ministries, including SS headquarters, mid-level officers relaying the orders begin <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> which side they should be fighting for. Rumors reach Berlin that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Meanwhile, Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive. The General refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. Major Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler.|$|E

5|$|Before Cyrus and {{his army}} crossed the Aras River to {{battle with the}} Armenians, he {{installed}} his son Cambyses II as king in case he should not return from battle. However, once Cyrus had crossed the Aras River, he had a vision in which Darius had wings atop his shoulders and stood upon the confines of Europe and Asia (the known world). When Cyrus awoke from the dream, he inferred it as a great danger to the future security of the empire, as it meant that Darius would one day rule the whole world. However, his son Cambyses was {{the heir to the}} throne, not Darius, causing Cyrus <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if Darius was forming treasonable and ambitious designs. This led Cyrus to order Hystaspes to go back to Persis and watch over his son strictly, until Cyrus himself returned. Darius did not seem to have any treasonous thoughts as Cambyses II ascended the throne peacefully; and, through promotion, Darius was eventually elevated to be Cambyses's personal lancer.|$|E
5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes to {{investigate}} the facility Sheriff Frass mentioned. Before breaking in, he and Scully discuss the odd behavior of the roaches, with Scully hypothesizing that the roaches could be an invasive species. Inside the facility, which resembles a typical house, Mulder sees the walls rippling and is quickly surrounded by roaches. He is then confronted by Dr. Bambi Berenbaum (Bobbie Phillips), a researcher from the Department of Agriculture who is studying cockroaches to develop more effective methods of pest control. Berenbaum has great interest in insects and, incidentally, believes that some UFOs are actually insect swarms flying through electrically charged airspaces. Yet another death occurs in Mulder's hotel, with the individual being found covered in roaches that quickly flee. At this point, Mulder believes that the individual simply died of fright, though Scully begins <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> {{what is going on}} and decides to head up there herself.|$|E
