5|$|Soon after Flight 825 took off, a {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas scored a hit on its {{starboard}} wing with a Soviet-made Strela-2 surface-to-air infrared homing missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing. An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of Karoi was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> look for water before the guerrillas arrived.|$|E

25|$|Many Hungarian émigrés, {{some of them}} Jewish, were {{artists and}} writers working in Paris {{at the time of}} the occupation. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> Paris in the 1920s and 1930s to escape {{repression}} in their homeland. Many joined the Résistance, where they were particularly active in the regions of Lyon, Grenoble, Marseille and Toulouse. Jewish resisters included Imre Epstein in the Hungarian group at Toulouse; György Vadnai (future Lausanne rabbi) at Lyon; the writer Emil Szittya at Limoges. Also participating were the painter Sándor Józsa, the sculptor István Hajdú (Étienne Hajdu), the journalists László Kőrös and Imre Gyomrai; the photographers Andor (André) Steiner, Lucien Hervé and Ervin Martón. Tamás Elek (1924–1944), Imre Glasz (1902–1944) and József Boczor (1905–1944) were among 23 resisters executed for their work with the legendary Manouchian Group.

She soon realises that he is the killer.

Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in – on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others go to bed and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn up. Like the police inspector, he fails to believe a word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E

500|$|In {{the region}} of Dragačevo, western Serbia, people told of the vilovit men, who would {{disappear}} {{at the sight of}} hail clouds, reappearing bloody and with torn clothes after the storm was over. Asked where they had been to, they would only answer that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> fight against those who led the hail clouds toward their village. The adjective vilovit means [...] "having a vilas properties" [...] or [...] "vila-like". The name vila denotes Slavic nymphs or fairies, female anthropomorphic spirits of woods, mountains, clouds, and waters, who had magical powers. In {{the region of}} Tamnava, north-western Central Serbia, the vilovit men were also called vetrenjaks. An early mention of vetrenjaks is found in a short story by Serbian writer Milovan Glišić, published in 1875. In the story, men from Krnić and nearby villages talk about a battle their vetrenjaks fought on a hill to repel a hail storm brought by alien vetrenjaks. They uprooted oaks and beat each other with them, their bodies turning black and blue from the blows. The defenders were victorious and moved the storm to a mountain, away from their fields.|$|E
500|$|Auxiliary Units were a {{specially}} trained and secret organisation that [...] {{would act as}} uniformed commandos to attack the flanks and rear of an enemy advance. They were organised around a core of regular army 'scout sections', supported by patrols [...] of 6 - 8 men recruited [...] from the Home Guard. Although [...] approval for the organisation had been given in June 1940, recruiting only began in early July. Each patrol was a self-contained cell, expected to be self-sufficient. There was, however, no means of communicating with them once <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> ground, which greatly reduced their strategic value. Each patrol was well-equipped and was provided with a concealed underground operational base, usually built in woodland and camouflaged. [...] Auxiliary Units were only expected to operate during an organised military campaign, with an expected lifespan of 14 days. [...] They were not, therefore, intended to operate as a long term resistance organisation. [...] The latter was {{the responsibility of the}} Secret Intelligence Service Section VII, which would have only begun to expand its operations once the country had actually been occupied, thus confining knowledge of its existence only to those men and women who would have been available at the time.|$|E
