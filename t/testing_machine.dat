500|$|... "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase" [...] is the twenty-fourth {{episode of}} the eighth season of The Simpsons. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 11, 1997. The episode centers on fictional pilot episodes of non-existent television series derived from The Simpsons, and is a parody of the tendency of networks to spin off characters from a hit series. As such it includes references to many different TV series. The first fictional spin-off is Chief Wiggum P.I., a cop-drama featuring Chief Wiggum and Seymour Skinner. The second is The Love-matic Grampa, a sitcom featuring Moe Szyslak who receives dating advice from Abraham Simpson, whose ghost is possessing a love <b>testing</b> <b>machine.</b> The final segment is The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour, a variety show featuring the Simpson family except for Lisa, who has been replaced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{capability}} to withstand non-contact underwater explosions (UNDEX) {{is an important}} aspect to be emphasized {{in the design of}} modern warships, and shock testing is one of the efficient methods to qualify the ability. A brief history on the research of shock testing of naval shipboard equipment as well as major means in evaluating anti-shock performance of warship equipment is introduced first in this paper. Three prevailing shock test methods: UNDEX testing, virtual shock trial and land-based test with shock <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> are presented with the focus on the advances in shock <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> in US and Europe. Comparison of current shock testing facilities is also given. Moreover, some new concepts of shock <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> are reviewed as well, and three major directions of the development of shock <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> are concluded. The first trend is that shock <b>testing</b> <b>machines</b> are required to generate positive and negative shock pulse to simulate real UNDEX environment made up of shock wave followed by bubble pulse and structural whipping. The second is that shock <b>test</b> <b>machines</b> can <b>test</b> heavy equipments, and the last is that shock pulses can be controlled and customized conveniently. ...|$|R

40|$|Methodologies used in {{industry}} for designing transport aircraft composite fuselage structures are discussed. Several aspects of the design methodologies are based on assumptions from metallic fuselage technology which requires that full-scale structures be tested with the actual loading conditions to validate the designs. Composite panels which represent crown and side regions of a fuselage structure are designed using this approach and tested in biaxial tension. Descriptions of the state-of-the-art test facilities used for this structural evaluation are presented. These facilities include a pressure-box <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> and a D-box test fixture in a combined loads <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> which {{are part of a}} Combined Loads Test System (COLTS). Nonlinear analysis results for a reference shell and a stiffened composite panel tested in the pressure-box <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> with and without damage are presented. The analytical and test results are compared to assess the ability of the pressure-box <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> to simulate a shell stress state with and without damage. A combined loads <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> for <b>testing</b> aircraft primary structures is described. This <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> includes a D-box test fixture to accommodate curved stiffened panels and the design features of this test fixture are presented. Finite element analysis results for a curved panel to be tested in the D-box test fixture are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{heavy-duty}} shock <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> {{is developed}} {{to satisfy the}} newly-built shock resistance standard and simulate accurately the actual underwater explosive environments with increased testing capability. The mathematical model for the shock <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> is created to predict its dynamic performance and analyze its mechanism. Then numerical simulation is carried out to evaluate the prospective capability of the shock <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> under different shock velocity inputs. The double protection system incorporating the stroke limit of the accumulator piston and the unloading circuit can effectively prevent the secondary collision in the testing process. The simulation results have demonstrated that the shock <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> proposed in this paper can produce nearly the same shock acceleration waveform as the new shock resistance standard BV 043 / 85 and MIL-S- 901 D. Moreover, this shock <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> can be regulated conveniently to adjust to {{a different type of}} equipment and be extended easily to suit more severe shock environments and heavier equipment.

40|$|The Swedish weight {{sounding}} <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> (SWS <b>test</b> <b>machine)</b> {{used in the}} in-situ ground investigation method, is easy to move, shortens test time, {{is simple}} to use for testing, and less expensive compared to mechanical boring test. However, this method cannot be used in dense sand layers and stones/cobblestones layers. An in-situ ground investigation machine, NSWS (Nippon Screw Weight System) that enables identification of super soft zones and has the functions for controlling hydraulics and pneumatics of loading, and for segmentation of measuring interval was developed by utilizing the measuring system (using load and rotational penetration resistance) of the SWS <b>test</b> <b>machine.</b> In this paper, we report {{a case in which}} the NSWS <b>test</b> (<b>machine)</b> was used for identifying the subsidence locations on the river bank made up mainly of cobble-mixed gravels. Specifically, the NSWS <b>test</b> (<b>machine)</b> was used for cobble-mixed gravel layers in the initial investigation stage with the purposes of identifying the area loosened due to ground subsidence and assessing its impact to the dam's body. In addition to the measurement results of the amount of load, the penetration rate and the number of rotations, the area loosened due to ground subsidence was identified by paying attention to the scuttle frequency considering subsidence frequency specific to a NSWS <b>test</b> (<b>machine)</b> as a parameter. The test result was verified by boring measurement, and the loosened area was relatively small at the subsidence locations. Moreover, at an early stage, it was determined that the impact on the dam's body was not devastating...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The direct {{verification}} of Rockwell <b>testing</b> <b>machines</b> comprises four parts such as test force, indenter, depth measuring device, and testing cycle {{as seen in}} ISO 6508 - 2. Among them, the {{verification of}} testing cycle is generally carried out by using a stopwatch on industrial sites, which is not so reliable. In addition to this, most of commercial hardness <b>testing</b> <b>machines</b> produced nowadays are automatically controlled by the embedded software, which makes {{it much more difficult}} to calibrate the testing cycle. It implies that even though hardness <b>testing</b> <b>machines</b> are advanced more, the calibration of the testing cycle does not keep up with their advancement. To overcome this problem, an on-site calibration system was developed to calibrate the testing cycle of both the automatically controlled as well as manually controlled Rockwell hardness <b>testing</b> <b>machines.</b> The calibration system is composed of load cell, indentation depth measuring apparatus and embedded clock. Using this system, measurement of test force, application velocity of test force, and indentation depth are possible simultaneously in real time, which enhances the efficiency and reliability of calibration procedure...|$|R
