5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the <b>tow</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{imprisoned in}} a holding cell, but escapes by {{crawling}} through an air vent. Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear pool reactor. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat as the entire lair explodes. After the boat runs out of fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a Royal Navy ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's <b>tow</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|E

50|$|Volunteers, generous donors, and fundraisers have, {{over the}} decades, {{provided}} {{improvements to the}} hill. <b>Rope</b> <b>tows,</b> snow making equipment, a Sno-Cat, snowmobiles, warming hut (with outdoor fire pit), hillside sound system, and a first aid station {{are now part of}} the hill. Recent additions include terrain features for a snowboard park. As of the end of 2010, the hill maintained 5 <b>tow</b> <b>ropes</b> and 7 groomed runs.|$|R
5|$|In an aerotow a powered {{aircraft}} {{is attached}} to a glider with a <b>tow</b> <b>rope.</b> Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{would use}} approximately 350 gliders for the operation, {{the majority of}} which would transport 6th Airlanding Brigade. This number included thirty-four Hamilcars; four would land in landing zone 'N' between 03:00 and 04:30 {{in support of the}} operations of 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade, and would carry four 17-pounder anti-tank guns and their transport vehicles and crews. The other thirty would land at approximately 21:00 in landing-zone 'W' as part of a reinforcement lift. Twenty of the Hamilcars would carry Tetrarch light tanks and their crews which belonged to 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, four more carried three Rota trailers without crews, and another three carried Universal Carriers with their crews. The last three carried two Universal Carriers converted to accommodate a 3-inch mortar, one Universal Carrier which carried a slave battery, sixteen motorcycles and a jeep. The four Hamilcars which were to land in support of 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades took off from Tarrant Rushton at 02:10 on 6 June and were due to land at approximately 03:30; however, only two landed successfully. One suffered a broken <b>tow</b> <b>rope</b> shortly after it took off, although it was able to land safely at an airfield in England; the other reached the Normandy coast, but the <b>tow</b> <b>rope</b> was disconnected too early and it landed a considerable distance away from the landing zone. When dawn broke, it was discovered by German forces and attacked; four of the crew and passengers were killed and one captured, but the rest managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|The largest ship wrecked on the Doom Bar is {{believed}} to be the Antoinette, an 1874 barque of 1,118 tonnes. On New Year's Day 1895, she set sail from Newport in South Wales with a cargo of coal for Brazil, but foundered near Lundy Island, losing parts of her mast. She was towed by a steam tug towards Padstow but struck the Doom Bar and the <b>tow</b> <b>rope</b> either broke, or had to be released. Her crew of fourteen and several men who had attempted to salvage her were rescued by lifeboats from Port Isaac and Padstow, following which she rapidly sank.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of {{extensive}} training, the airborne force took off in two aircraft–glider combinations {{on the night of}} 19 November 1942. Both managed to reach the Norwegian coast, but neither was able to reach their objective. The first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the <b>tow</b> <b>rope</b> snapping and the first glider crash–landing, with its towing aircraft returning to base; three airborne troops were killed outright, with the survivors captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons; the aircrew and some airborne troops were killed outright, and those who survived were taken prisoner. None survived for very long, being executed as a result of Adolf Hitler's Commando Order, which stated all Commando personnel were to be immediately executed upon capture. At the end of the war, Wehrmacht personnel were tried and condemned to death for their part in the executions.|$|E
5|$|Two aircraft, each towing one glider, left Scotland on {{the night}} of 19 November 1942. All managed to reach the Norwegian coast, but none were able to reach their objective. The first pair {{suffered}} from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the <b>tow</b> <b>rope</b> snapping and the first glider crash-landing, with its towing aircraft returning to base; eight airborne troops were killed outright, four were severely injured and five unhurt. The survivors were captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons; the aircrew and several men were killed outright, and those who survived were taken prisoner. None of the prisoners survived for very long, being either poisoned or executed as a result of Adolf Hitler's Commando Order, which stated that all British Commandos personnel were to be killed immediately when captured.|$|E
5|$|When {{the parts}} for a Hamilcar were {{completed}} and the glider was erected, it was flown to RAF North Luffenham in Rutland {{to have its}} specific cargo placed on board, {{and it was then}} flown to RAF Tarrant Rushton, which had been selected as the Hamilcar training and operational base in November 1943. It was not possible to tow the glider empty, so any empty gliders usually carried Universal Carriers or concrete blocks as ballast. Training with the Hamilcar appears to have taken place primarily at RAF Tarrant Rushton, and began sometime between the end of 1943 and the first months of 1944. Hamilcar training began with dual instruction, where an instructor accompanied the pilots for several hours, and then moved onto flying solo flights. Most of this training consisted of 'circuits and bumps', where the pilots practised controlling the glider as it took off from an airfield under tow, and then landing it after the <b>tow</b> <b>rope</b> was detached; cross-country navigation was also practised. It was common practice for members of airlanded units to be inside the gliders as cargo when training took place, although there is evidence that tank crews only acted as cargo for one or two flights, probably due to the risk of accidents which might cost the lives of specialised troops and equipment. Those flights that tank crews did experience usually consisted of gliders landing on carefully marked airfields instead of the open countryside to minimise the risks involved, and also make recovery of the glider easier. Accidents do not seem to have been a common occurrence. During training by 'C' Squadron of the Glider Pilot Regiment, part of the Army Air Corps, which specialised in flying Hamilcars, over 2800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew. Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries, with seven pilots killed during the training.|$|E
50|$|Cable {{skiing is}} a way to water ski (or wakeboard), in which the skier's rope and handle are pulled by an electrically-driven cable, whereas {{traditionally}} a waterskier is pulled by a motorboat. The mechanism consists of two cables running parallel to one another with carriers between them every 80 metres. The carriers are metal tubes that can hook up <b>tow</b> <b>ropes</b> with riders. <b>Tow</b> <b>ropes</b> are detached and attached at the same time without slowing the system down, which is a main reason for its high efficiency. With a main cable of 800 metres long, 10 riders can waterski or wakeboard at the same time. The speed of the main cable can be up to 38 mph (61 km/h), and slalom skiers can reach much higher speeds. The most common speed is 19 mph (31 km/h), which suits wakeboarders best.|$|R

50|$|During {{the days}} before the collision, the Ady Gil engaged Japanese whaling vessels during their hunt. The crew <b>towed</b> <b>ropes</b> in an attempt to foul the {{propellers}} of the Japanese ships and used a spud gun to fire capsules of foul-smelling butyric acid which taints the whale meat the whalers get from their hunts.|$|R
5|$|All fifteen Hamilcars which {{participated in}} the first lift on 17 September arrived over the landing zones safely, but {{problems}} were experienced {{when they came in}} to land. Two of the gliders landed on soft ground, which caused them to rapidly decelerate; this, combined with the majority of their equipment being {{in the front of the}} gliders, resulted in them flipping onto their backs. Three of the pilots were killed and the fourth was badly wounded and later taken prisoner, and several passengers were wounded; the 17-pounder anti-tank guns on board the gliders were damaged beyond repair. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully, although one overran the landing zone and hit a railway embankment; this damaged the two Universal Carriers being carried by the glider, although both were later salvaged. The lift on 18 September was delayed for several hours due to poor weather conditions, and the glider force did not take off until approximately 11:00. En route to the landing zones, one Hamilcar was forced to cast off and land at an airfield in England after its tow aircraft developed engine trouble, and another ditched in the English Channel when its tug developed engine troubles as well; both had been carrying 17-pounder anti-tank guns. The rest of the Hamilcars encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, with several being hit. As a result, one Hamilcar landed short of the landing zone after being hit in the wing, and another was forced to make an emergency landing far from the landing zone after being hit; the stores, pilots and passengers were captured by German forces shortly after the glider landed. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully. The third lift on 19 September did not take place due to weather problems, and because several of 1st Airborne Division's landing zones had been overrun. Finally on 21 September the weather cleared, but due to 1st Airborne Division's deteriorating situation it was decided that the 878th Aviation Engineer Battalion would not be delivered. As such, only a single Hamilcar accompanied 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade when it set off for its drop near the town of Driel; this was the same Hamilcar which had been forced to land in England on 19 September when its tug had experienced engine trouble. However, the <b>tow</b> <b>rope</b> between the glider and tug snapped over Belgium, and it was forced to land near Ghent.|$|E

500|$|On {{a second}} {{attempt to find}} the correct area, the {{combination}} flew into thick clouds approximately [...] northwest of Rjukan, and ice began to form on both aircraft and glider, {{as well as the}} <b>towing</b> <b>rope</b> connecting the two.

[...] Shortly after releasing the glider, the aircraft broadcast a second message, [...] "Glider in sea", indicating the air crew's belief that the glider had crashed.

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 13 June Archbold encountered the French privateer lugger Espeigle some five or six leagues NNW of Cap Fréhel. Espeigle was a small, open privateer lugger with a crew of 12 men armed with small arms. She {{had been out of}} Saint-Malo for 18 days without taking anything. Eling captured Espiegle after a chase of about an hour. Eling was short-handed, being 17 men below complement, so Archbold decided to take Espeigle into port. However, as a <b>tow</b> <b>rope</b> was being passed to Espeigle, she got under Elings bow and Eling sank her.|$|E
25|$|Under Captain Littlehales, {{while serving}} with the Channel Fleet, Centaur {{and her sister}} ship, Mars, {{collided}} off the Black Rocks during the night of 10 March.

25|$|Clara Clarita {{came into}} the {{possession}} of the New York Harbor Protective Company in 1870, when she was converted into a fireboat. In August 1870, Clara Clarita was towing a burning ferryboat out of harm's way when the <b>tow</b> <b>rope</b> burned through, allowing the ferry to collide with a schooner {{and set it on}} fire. In a later landmark ruling, the courts ruled that although the damage was caused by the ferry not the tug, and {{regardless of whether or not}} the schooner was anchored improperly, the tug was still at fault through negligently using a rope rather than a chain to tow the ferry.|$|E
50|$|Originally, most docking {{was done}} for {{practical}} purposes. For example, a draft horse used for hauling large loads might have had its tail docked {{to prevent it from}} becoming entangled in <b>tow</b> <b>ropes,</b> farm machinery, or harness; without docking, it could be dangerous to the horse, painful if the tail were tangled, and inconvenient to the owner to tie up the horse's tail for every use.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, skiing {{as a group}} {{operation}} {{began with}} the assembly of neighborhood ski clubs. These clubs constructed <b>rope</b> <b>tows</b> and warming huts. Buckhorn Ski Club is the last remaining club-owned self operated ski facility in California. In 1948, the Santa Monica Ski Club and the G.
