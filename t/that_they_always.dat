5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E
25|$|Pain during {{receptive}} {{anal sex}} among gay men (or {{men who have}} sex with men) is formally known as anodyspareunia. In one study, 61% of gay or bisexual men said they experienced painful receptive anal sex and that it was the most frequent sexual difficulty they had experienced. By contrast, 24% of gay or bisexual men stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> experienced some degree of pain during anal sex, and about 12% of gay men find it too painful to pursue receptive anal sex; it was concluded that the perception of anal sex as painful is as likely to be psychologically or emotionally based as it is to be physically based. Factors predictive of pain during anal sex include inadequate lubrication, feeling tense or anxious, lack of stimulation, as well as lack of social ease with being gay and being closeted. Research has found that psychological factors can in fact be the primary contributors to the experience of pain during anal intercourse and that adequate communication between sexual partners can prevent it, countering the notion that pain is always inevitable during anal sex.|$|E

Risks were listed as death due to cerebral haemorrhage or infection; epilepsy; and personality changes. A text book of the day went into more detail about personality changes, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> occurred to greater or lesser extent and left the patient with diminished judgement, childish behaviour, carelessness, loss of ambition, and generally living at a lower level than previously. There was also the possibility of intellectual deterioration. Overall in the Board of Control survey six per cent of patients had died (half of them directly {{as a result of the}} operation); 36 per cent had left hospital and 58 per cent remained in hospital (often described as quieter or easier to nurse). Patients who were depressed and had not been ill for long were much more likely to have left hospital than those who had a schizophrenic illness and had been in hospital longer.|$|E
25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E

500|$|After {{looking at}} agriculture, Cochrane {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} animals and genetic engineering. The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered, he suggests, makes no sense, as live animals are not engineered, and embryos have no interests, so cannot have rights. Instead, Cochrane considers whether animals have a right {{not to have been}} engineered, arguing {{that it is not the}} case <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> do, and that if [...] "genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well-being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species, then it is ordinarily permissible." [...] Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim; first, the notion that genetic engineering instrumentalizes animals, second, the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant, third, that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character (see virtue ethics) and fourth, that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals. Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle. Cochrane considers whether animals may ever have a right not to have been engineered. He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living. He then rejects some reasons for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities, but concludes that they do, as engineered animals have an interest [...] "in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well-being", an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right. However, Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism, as he is concerned not with equal capacities between members of a species, but equal opportunities for well-being. Finally, Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering nonsentient, non-conscious livestock, arguing that, ordinarily, there is no wrong in engineering nonconscious entities.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{said of the}} Pink Panther films, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, {{though it may be}} because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic {{self-absorption}} that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny." [...] Film critic Elvis Mitchell has said that Sellers {{was one of the few}} comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: [...] "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching." [...] His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is [...] "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are." [...] Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that [...] "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism". This combination of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was [...] "the sole representative of humanity". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a [...] "balance between character and absurdity". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could [...] "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".|$|E

[...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very off center in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can’t help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that’s definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought to a screeching halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if ignorance is bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could not help but smile as Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of the edge off the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends". She felt that Isaac and Miria [...] "represent this duality perfectly." [...] Tarbet also described them as part Bonnie and Clyde and part Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E
