40|$|Recently, relay attacks {{has renewed}} interest, {{not least because}} {{of the rise of}} NFC {{applications}} in smartphones. In the context of the NFC ecosystem, relay attacks allow an attacker to lull an NFC reader by making it believe that the legitimate user is in its vicinity. The idea of such attacks is simple: forwarding the NFC commands intended for the Secure Element (SE) inside the closest smartphone to another far away SE. The invention relates to a method of detecting relay attacks. Unlike existing solutions based on distance bounding, our invention is based on the Trusted Execution Environment (<b>TEE)</b> <b>that</b> runs inside the smartphone. In our invention, we define specific mechanisms allowing TEE to verify whether a particular NFC response has been indeed computed by the Secure Element of the bounded smartphone. In addition, we enhance the TEE features by giving it control over the NFC communication, so that it can block NFC responses from being sent to the NFC reader. Thus, we prevent relay attacks by making the TEE blocking any NFC response that was not produced by the SE running inside its bounded mobile device...|$|E

40|$|We discuss {{entanglement}} entropy of gapped {{ground states}} in different dimensions, obtained on partitioning space into two regions. For trivial phases without topological order, {{we argue that}} the entanglement entropy may be obtained by integrating an `entropy density' over the partition boundary that admits a gradient expansion in the curvature of the boundary. This constrains the expansion of entanglement entropy {{as a function of}} system size, and points to an even-odd dependence on dimensionality. For example, in contrast to the familiar result in two dimensions, a size independent constant contribution to the entanglement entropy can appear for trivial phases in any odd spatial dimension. We then discuss phases with topological entanglement entropy (<b>TEE)</b> <b>that</b> cannot be obtained by adding local contributions. We find that in three dimensions there is just one type of TEE, as in two dimensions, that depends linearly on the number of connected components of the boundary (the `zeroth Betti number'). In D > 3 dimensions, new types of TEE appear which depend on the higher Betti numbers of the boundary manifold. We construct generalized toric code models that exhibit these TEEs and discuss ways to extract TEE in D >= 3. Comment: 16. 5 pages, 10 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{transfer}} {{line for the}} solenoid currently has a dead branch on it. Issues regarding the solenoid {{transfer line}} also apply to the VLPC transfer line. Issues {{that need to be}} addressed are: (1) What is the heat load on the branch? (2) Would it be a good idea to run the LN 2 radiation shield on the branch? (3) What are the thermal acoustic oscillation parameters of a dead headed branch? A simple remedy, although not analyzed was to install a jumper with a flow restriction at the end of the helium piping to allow a small flow to pass from supply to return. Thus eliminating a stagnant gas volume in which pressure pulses would develop. (4) Do we need to have a vapor trap to keep liquid from sloshing back and forth from the cold end to the warm end? (5) Comment: The <b>tee</b> <b>that</b> passes the 2 -phase return into the nested LHe supply/return pipe should be pointed up so that the volume of transfer line acts sort of like a phase separator full of liquid. It is very difficult to predict the behavior of the dead ended branch. Therefore the conservative thing to do is to keep the Branch cold as in option A. Use a valve inside the bayonet box for the LHe. Due to space constraints, use a valve and u-tube arrangement for the LN 2. The additional heat leak from keeping the section cold is very reasonable. The heat load to LHe is 0. 8 W or 2. 3 W and to LN 2 is 13 W or 71 W when the detector is run in the collision hall or assembly hall respectively. To prevent thermal acoustic oscillation from occurring in the dead ended female bayonets, we can install male bayonet vacuum plugs. The heat load to the system and behavior of such an arrangement will not provide any surprises, unlike a dead ended branch. It also allows flexibility's such as running the helium refrigeration plant without the detector for tests or for precooling the return lines during cooldown, just to name a few. The LHe control valves should have actuators and be able to be remotely controlled. The LN 2 valves can be simple manual valves that will probably not be adjusted after their initial setting...|$|E
