5000|$|Kroehl {{applied for}} a patent around March 1854 for a flange forming machine. It is {{described}} in Scientific American as an improvement in machinery for bending flanges on wrought iron beams.

25|$|Epulis fissuratum (also termed {{inflammatory}} fibrous hyperplasia, denture-induced fibrous inflammatory hyperplasia, denture injury tumor, denture epulis, denture induced granuloma, and granuloma fissuratum) is {{a benign}} hyperplasia of {{fibrous connective tissue}} which develops as a reactive lesion to chronic mechanical irritation produced by <b>the</b> <b>flange</b> of a poorly fitting denture. More simply, epulis fissuratum is where excess folds of firm tissue form inside the mouth, {{as a result of}} rubbing on the edge of dentures that do not fit well. It is a harmless condition and does not represent oral cancer. Treatment is by simple surgical removal of the lesion, and also by adjustment of the denture or provision of a new denture.|$|E

25|$|Generally {{speaking}} partial dentures {{tend to be}} held {{in place}} by the presence of the remaining natural teeth and complete dentures tend to rely on muscular co-ordination and suction to stay in place. The maxilla very commonly has more favorable denture bearing anatomy as the ridge tends to be well formed and there is a larger area on the palate for suction to retain the denture. Conversely, the mandible tends to make lower dentures less retentive due to the displacing presence of the tongue and the higher rate of resorption, frequently leading to significantly resorbed lower ridges. Disto-lingual regions tend to offer retention even in highly resorbed mandibles, and extension of <b>the</b> <b>flange</b> into these regions tends to produce a more retentive lower denture. An implant supported lower denture is another option.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first micromachined {{double-sided}} contactless WR 03 pin-flange adapter for 220 - 325 GHz based on gap waveguide technology. The pin-flange adapter {{is used to}} avoid leakage at the interface of two waveguides even when a gap between them is present and can be fitted onto any standard WR 03 waveguide flange. Tolerance measurements were performed with gaps ranging from 30 - 100 mu m. The performance of <b>the</b> micromachined pin <b>flange</b> {{has been compared to}} a milled pin flange, a choke flange and to standard waveguide connections. <b>The</b> micromachined pin <b>flange</b> is shown to have better performance than the standard connection and similar performance to <b>the</b> milled pin <b>flange</b> and choke <b>flange.</b> <b>The</b> benefits of micromachining over milling are the possibility to mass produce pin <b>flanges</b> and <b>the</b> better accuracy in the 2 D design. Measurements were performed with and without screws fixing <b>the</b> <b>flanges.</b> <b>The</b> <b>flanges</b> have also been applied to measure two devices, a straight rectangular waveguide of 1. 01 inch and a ridge gap resonator.

40|$|In railway infrastructure, the gr ade {{is usually}} {{predetermined}} a nd so {{the design of}} bridges is constrained to meet the railway grade. Because of this, rail overpass bridges are very often {{in the form of}} half-through girders, in which the headroom limita tion requires that the I-section beams that form the half-through girders are loaded at the level of <b>the</b> tension <b>flange,</b> rather than at <b>the</b> compression <b>flange</b> level in more conventi onal bridges. Half-through girder bridges are in general comprised of two parallel I-secti on beams joined by a concrete deck at <b>the</b> bottom/tension <b>flange</b> level as ill ustrated in Figure 1. Loading the beam at <b>the</b> tension <b>flange</b> level through <b>the</b> deck results in <b>the</b> top <b>flange</b> being subjected to compression, and <b>the</b> top <b>flange</b> is not braced against overall buckling. <b>The</b> compression <b>flange</b> of <b>the</b> I-section is restrained only by the stif fness of the usually flexible web and <b>the</b> tension <b>flange</b> is provided with continuous torsional restrain t through its connection to the concrete deck.

40|$|The {{value of}} the {{inductance}} for the termination of a parallel-plate simulator has previously been chosen {{on the basis of}} an analysis which considered coplanar flanges to extend beyond the terminating admittance sheet. <b>The</b> <b>flanges</b> were introduced to facilitate that analysis, the underlying assumption being that the solution with <b>the</b> <b>flanges</b> is not significantly different from the solution without <b>the</b> <b>flanges.</b> In this note we test this assumption by using a wedge Green’s function that allows us to vary the angle of one <b>flange</b> while <b>the</b> other remains coplanar. We find that the effect of coplanar flanges is small if we compare that case to the case where <b>the</b> <b>flanges</b> are alternately removed; however, there is a flange orientation of interest that can make a considerable difference in the choice of the inductance. This orientation corresponds to the simulator resting on a perfectly conducting ground. Our results are summarized in a table of normalized inductance values for various slope angles of the terminating admittance sheet as well as various physically significant flange orientations for each slope angle. We also present the appropriate graphs that lead to this choice of inductance values. L. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} web crippling tests on cold-formed unlipped channels with flanges restrained (fastened) as well as channels with <b>flanges</b> unrestrained (unfastened). <b>The</b> tests were performed under end and interior two-flange loading conditions specified in the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures, namely end-two-flange and interior-two-flange loading conditions. The concentrated load was applied by a bearing plate at <b>the</b> top <b>flange</b> of <b>the</b> channels, and the reaction force applied by an identical bearing plate at <b>the</b> bottom <b>flange</b> of <b>the</b> channels. The bearing plates acted across <b>the</b> full <b>flange</b> widths of <b>the</b> channels. <b>The</b> <b>flanges</b> of <b>the</b> channels were either bolted {{to one or two}} bearing plates for <b>the</b> specimens with <b>flanges</b> restrained. <b>The</b> web crippling test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the North American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and American Iron and Steel Institute Specification for cold-formed steel structures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the North American Specification using the unfastened design rules are generally conservative, but unconservatively predicted using the fastened design rules, even when <b>the</b> <b>flanges</b> of <b>the</b> specimens were restrained. The design strengths predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard and American Iron and Steel Institute Specification are unconservative. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} cutting a {{roll-formed}} steel section to specified length {{may lead to}} cross section distortion and may cause initial geometric imperfection.
