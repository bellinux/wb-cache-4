500|$|For Homme by David Beckham, Beckham {{wanted to}} create a modern, {{masculine}} fragrance that reflected his own personal style. Additionally, he designed the scent with Victoria's preferences in mind, as the scent is something that she has to [...] "put up with" [...] being on him.

So we just had to dig in and put everything to the side and really work on something ... we had no idea that it would turn out as good as it did. It was a great experience It took me about a good two weeks to put all of the ideas that we had together. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the video is that we went in knowing we were gonna shoot the video onstage a few times. I was actually able to get my camera crew onstage" ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and then do it. That's <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There {{are just going to}} be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E

500|$|King {{has since}} been {{critical}} of his performance, which he describes as his [...] "most lackluster". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as [...] "probably the odd man out at that point", he stated he [...] "didn't participate as much because of that". [...] Hanneman said: [...] "We go through dry spells sometimes, but <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> having two guitar players that can write music {{is that you are}} never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell." [...] King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels [...] vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and [...] "added too much singing". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: [...] "There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally. Again, I was probably wanting something else." ...|$|E

He added that Aden is a strong character and he enjoyed making him [...] "believable". Lasance said that he did not want Aden to turn into a [...] "good guy". <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Aden is the fact [...] "he never quite shakes off the bad-boy image" [...] despite his [...] "different facets".|$|E
500|$|On February 12, 2012, both Aldean and Clarkson {{performed}} {{the song in}} front of a stage outfitted with giant clock innards at the 54th Grammy Awards. Todd Martens of Los Angeles Times thought that [...] "the duo looked like they were on the set of [...] "Hugo"." [...] As their performance neared its end, Aldean's microphone suddenly went out. Sarah Wyland of Great American Country felt that Aldean was professional in handling the technical problem by continuing to sing the song with Clarkson. However, Natalie Maines, the lead vocalist of the Dixie Chicks, lambasted Aldean's performance in her Twitter account, writing [...] "Well <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> his mic going out is suddenly the song got a lot more in tune."

5000|$|The {{movie was}} a minor {{financial}} flop, but a moderate critical success. It maintains a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

500|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic {{awarded the}} DVD {{three out of}} five stars and stated, [...] "for anyone but the most devout fans of Beyoncé, this will be overkill, and it doesn't have {{as much of the}} playfulness such as the {{pleasing}} diversions as the [...] set."

You'll get tired just watching it." [...] Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald awarded it three out of five stars, stating that <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the DVD is that it has a [...] "wider range of songs", nevertheless {{they do not have the}} same [...] "rump-rattling power" [...] of the songs in The Beyoncé Experience simply because some songs are too short in duration, for instance [...] "Bootylicious". Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly wrote that although Beyoncé showed an emotional side of herself during the DVD, [...] "Still, the shows go on in their high-heeled, wonderfully choreographed glory." ...|$|E
