5|$|The {{cessation}} of menstrual cycles {{at the end}} of a woman's reproductive period is termed menopause. The average age of menopause in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. Menopause before age 45 is considered premature in industrialised countries. Like the age of menarche, the age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Josquin likely {{learned his}} craft {{in his home}} region in the North, in France, and then in Italy {{when he went to}} Milan and Rome. His early sacred works emulate the contrapuntal {{complexity}} and ornamented, melismatic lines of Ockeghem and his contemporaries, {{but at the same time}} he was learning his contrapuntal technique he was acquiring an Italianate idiom for his secular music: after all, he was surrounded by Italian popular music in Milan. By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of text with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> otherwise have been.|$|E

25|$|On {{completion}} of the canal, the owning company was constantly short of cash, and inevitably income did not reach the levels predicted at the stage of promoting the canal. In addition, serious problems {{with the state of}} the newly finished works were discovered, although in the circumstances of a locally promoted scheme with novel technological aspects, the canal as built was better engineered <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been. The chains on the inclined planes were constantly breaking, the rails broke, and other mechanical failures were frequent, and physical damage from careless boat handling was also common.|$|E
25|$|Food is {{prepared}} {{as if for}} an oven or stove top. However, because food cooks faster when it is in smaller pieces, food placed inside a solar cooker is usually cut into smaller pieces <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> otherwise be. For example, potatoes are usually cut into bite-sized pieces rather than roasted whole. For very simple cooking, such as melting butter or cheese, a lid may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered tray or in a bowl. If several foods are to be cooked separately, then they are placed in different containers.|$|E
25|$|Henan {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1938, when the Imperial Japanese Army captured Kaifeng, the government led by Chiang Kai-shek bombed the Huayuankou dam in Zhengzhou {{in order to}} prevent the Japanese forces from advancing further. However, this caused massive flooding in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. In 1942 Henan was hit by a great famine resulting from a mix of drought, locusts and destruction caused by the war. Grain requisition policies were continued by Chinese and Japanese authorities despite the shortage of food, making the death toll far greater <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been otherwise.|$|E

25|$|When he {{was able}} to turn to the {{specifics}} of the case, Olinger reminded the justices that Hogan had agreed that, other than Doyle's contact with WSAI, the board had ample reason not to renew his contract. The rest of the argument focused on the jurisdictional issues. Olinger said that the difference between Doyle's salaries at Mt. Healthy and Miami Trace was too small to reach the $10,000 threshold. Pressed by one of the justices, he admitted that he was not taking into account the difference it might have made {{over the course of several}} years of employment; however he said it was entirely possible that Doyle's potential top salary step at his new school would be higher <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be at Mt.

25|$|Darwin's {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} (published in 1859) spurred scientific interest in chimpanzees, as in much of life science, leading eventually to numerous studies of the animals in the wild and captivity. The observers of chimpanzees {{at the time were}} mainly interested in behaviour as it related to that of humans. This was less strictly and disinterestedly scientific <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> sound, with much attention being focused on whether or not the animals had traits that could be considered 'good'; the intelligence of chimpanzees was often significantly exaggerated, as immortalized in Hugo Rheinhold's Affe mit Schädel (see image, left). By the end of the 19th century, chimpanzees remained very much a mystery to humans, with very little factual scientific information available.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{there was}} {{considerable}} support for Australia's involvement in Vietnam, and all Australian battalions returning from Vietnam participated in well attended welcome home parades through either Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane or Townsville, even during the early 1970s. Regardless, as {{opposition to the war}} increased service in Vietnam came to be seen by sections of the Australian community in less than sympathetic terms and opposition to it generated negative views of veterans in some quarters. In the years following the war, some Vietnam veterans experienced social exclusion and problems readjusting to society. Nevertheless, as the tour of duty of each soldier during the Vietnam War was limited to one year (although some soldiers chose to sign up for a second or even a third tour of duty), the number of soldiers suffering from combat stress was probably more limited <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> otherwise have been.|$|E

25|$|This gallery aims to {{tell the}} story of Keighley. It also, in passing, helps to retain a sense of local {{identity}} in the populace, who continue to return from far away to re-live the pleasures of their childhood by seeing again the exhibits which they remember from long-ago visits to the Museum. This is the gallery to which they bring their grandchildren. It is therefore a more important gallery <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> first appear. It includes the Keighley Hen Pecked Club's peace box. This is an adult-sized wooden rocking cradle, supposedly for soothing nagging wives instead of babies. It had humorous rules and was displayed in galas, but it is not known whether it was used. The club used to meet at the Royal Hotel, Damside, and was started by Henry Hargreaves Thompson, who was landlord in 1861. The pub became the Royal Oak in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors {{generally}} live {{on their}} own, {{and do not}} interact with any other snakes unless they want to mate. They are nocturnal, but they may bask during the day when night-time temperatures are too low. As semi-arboreal snakes, young boa constrictors may climb into trees and shrubs to forage; however, they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. Boa constrictors strike when they perceive a threat. Their bite can be painful, especially from large snakes, but is rarely dangerous to humans. Specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily. Like all snakes, boa constrictors in a shed cycle are more unpredictable, because the substance that lubricates between the old skin and the new makes their eyes appear milky, blue, or opaque, so that the snake cannot see very well, causing it to be more defensive <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be otherwise.|$|E

[...] Timmermann continued to praise the track, saying it felt [...] "infinitely more genuine and thoughtful than" [...] any other track on Breakout and that the small-time teen drama fit Cyrus' voice. [...] "It sounds far less ludicrously melodramatic <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have delivered by less forceful pipes", he concluded. George Lang of The Oklahoman thought {{the inclusion of the}} song's remix on Breakout was used to cover more musical genres in order to appeal to a wider fanbase. In 2008, the track was listed as a [...] "Winning Song" [...] by Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI).|$|E
50|$|Critiques {{of income}} {{inequality}} often {{refer to a}} casual chain linking unequal growth to a lessened economy. Unequal growth concentrates wealth in a small amount on consumers who can only buy so many things. As a result, {{the vast majority of}} people are left with little extra cash for goods and services thus less things are bought and the economy generates less capital <b>than</b> <b>it</b> otherwise <b>might.</b>|$|R

30|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation of}} these results is that the clinician tended to assess images of the quality that {{he was used to}} viewing as adequate and images with fewer counts than he was used to as less than adequate.

500|$|At Brownlee's instigation, the Greenfield {{government}} had implemented a Debt Adjustment Act, which allowed farmers in Alberta's drought-stricken southeast to access credit counselling services {{and provided a}} way to settle creditors' claims without ruining farmers or resorting to litigation. [...] At the time, Brownlee had wanted to extend it province-wide, but had been dissuaded by the opposition of moneylenders. [...] In 1928, as premier, Brownlee tried again.

[...] Brownlee felt that these threats were disingenuous, noting that similar measures already existed to protect merchants. [...] However, it was a prosperous time for farmers, and so mobilized support for the legislation was in shorter supply <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been during a time of economic hardship; Brownlee, newly disillusioned with bankers, withdrew the bill.|$|E

Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– rating but slightly criticized the way Fox was using Duchovny, sardonically writing, [...] "I don't know if you're aware of this, but David Duchovny stars in The X-Files. Did you know that? Because they've really been keeping it under wraps at Fox." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating. Keegan called the episode a [...] "homage to fandom" [...] and described the tone as [...] "warm [...] fuzzy." [...] Because of this, he concluded that [...] "verall, this was an episode that dealt with the emotional needs of the audience {{in a way that was}} less effective <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been." ...|$|E
2500|$|Information theory {{leads us}} to believe {{it is much more}} {{difficult}} to keep secrets <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> first appear.

[...] The security of all such methods currently comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time.|$|E

2500|$|Norrie {{argues that}} the {{necessity}} of using dry farming techniques created special risks and the farmers responded by using summer fallow rather than the risky but more productive use of substitute crops or the planting of wheat every year.
