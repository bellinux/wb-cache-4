40|$|One {{regression}} test selection <b>technique</b> proposed for object-oriented programs is the Class firewall {{regression test}} selection <b>technique.</b> The selection <b>technique</b> selects test cases for regression test, which test changed classes and classes {{that depend on}} changed classes.

40|$|Purpose: We {{developed}} an inverse <b>technique</b> for tissue morcellation by modifying the conventional upward <b>technique</b> and then examined its safety and efficiency. Materials and Methods: From July 2008 to December 2010, {{a total of}} 389 consecutive patients treated with holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) were enrolled in this study. For tissue morcellation, we used an upward <b>technique</b> for an initial series of 84 patients and an inverse <b>technique</b> for a consecutive series of 305 patients. We com-pared efficiency and safety between the inverse <b>technique</b> and the upward <b>technique.</b> Results: There {{were no significant differences}} in mean age or prostate volume between the two groups. The mean morcellation efficiency was higher in the inverse <b>technique</b> group. The incidence of severe bladder injury was significantly higher in the upward <b>technique</b> group. Regarding the site of bladder injury, 7 and 4 cases of bladder injury occurred in the bladder dome and posterior wall, respectively, in the upward <b>technique</b> group. In the inverse <b>technique</b> group, however, the site of bladder injury was limited to the trigone. We divided our clinical series of patients into the upward <b>technique</b> group and three inverse <b>technique</b> groups on the basis of the timing. The mean morcellation efficiency was significantly higher in all three inverse <b>technique</b> groups than in the up-ward <b>technique</b> group. However, there was no significant difference in mean morcella-tion efficiency between the three inverse <b>technique</b> groups. Conclusions: In conclusion, the inverse <b>technique</b> might be a more effective, safer, and more excellent method of morcellation than the conventional upward <b>technique.</b> Key Words: Holmium; Lasers; Prostate; Prostate hyperplasia This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licens...|$|R
