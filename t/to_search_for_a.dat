5|$|Alder {{was born}} September 17, 1773, in Gloucester, New Jersey, to Bartholomew Alder and Hannah Worthington. The family moved in 1775 to Wythe County, Virginia, where Alder's father died {{about a year}} later. In May 1782, Jonathan, at eight years old, was sent out with his brother David <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> couple of horses that ran away.

The Indian group also captured Alder's neighbor, Mrs. Martin, and her young child.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They {{tend to be more}} expensive than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, several {{searches}} {{of the waters}} around North Stradbroke and Moreton Islands failed to reveal Centaurs location. It was believed that she had sunk {{off the edge of}} the continental shelf, to a depth at which the Royal Australian Navy did not have the capability <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vessel of Centaurs size. Some parties also believed that Rippon's calculated point of sinking was inaccurate, either intentionally or through error.|$|E

5|$|When Alexander was 13, Philip began <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> tutor, and {{considered}} such academics as Isocrates and Speusippus, the latter offering to resign {{to take up}} the post.

This behavioural ‘switch’ {{is thought to be}} caused by pheromones alone, rather than by sperm transfer, as {{seems to be the case}} in other insects. Egg-laying in N. vitripennis occurs in the same fashion in all known species of Nasonia, where a mated female drills into and deposits her eggs under the puparum of fly larvae.|$|R

5|$|Wong Nai Siong, a Christian scholar from Gutian County, Fujian {{province}} of China, learnt about Sarawak and the White Rajahs through his son-in-law, Dr Lim Boon Keng.

Previously, in September 1899, he had searched fruitlessly in Malaya and Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E
5|$|Alphonse {{is one of}} {{the protagonists}} from the series {{alongside}} his older brother Edward. Alphonse loses his entire body while he and Edward are trying to revive his mother Trisha using alchemy. Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. Edward later becomes an alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> method to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which would allow them to restore their physical forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter; having been trained by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot feel anything because he has no body, he is nearly invincible as long as the blood mark made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced.|$|E

5|$|By 2000, Gas Powered Games {{had begun}} <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{publisher}} for the game. Taylor claims that multiple publishers {{were interested in}} the game, but he was convinced by Ed Fries to partner with the newly established Microsoft Game Studios. Although Microsoft's publishing wing was established in part to publish games for the newly announced Xbox console, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not strongly consider bringing the game to the console. Taylor believes that this was due {{to the size of the}} game itself, as well as the small market for role-playing games on consoles at the time. Dungeon Siege was initially planned for release in the third quarter of 2001, before being delayed to the following year, and Gas Powered Games spent the added time tuning and polishing the game and expanding the game's items and multiplayer features. Dungeon Siege was released for Microsoft Windows on April 5, 2002, and for MacOS on May 2, 2003 by Destineer.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's last {{movie in}} 1935 was Ceiling Zero, his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien {{received}} top billing, {{which was a}} clear breach of Cagney's contract. This, combined {{with the fact that}} Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute dragged on for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt in a position to offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.|$|E
5|$|France {{declared}} war on Britain in February 1793, and Gibraltar was recommissioned under Captain Thomas Mackenzie in May 1793. In September she was refitted {{at a cost of}} £17,485 before joining the Channel Fleet under Richard Lord Howe. As part of this fleet, Gibraltar, on 2May 1794, accompanied the East and West India and Newfoundland convoys along the Channel as far as Lizard Point. Howe then divided his force, sending eight ships-of-the-line and four or five frigates to escort the convoys further. The remaining 26 ships-of-the-line, including Gibraltar, set off <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large Franco-American grain convoy known to be heading to France.|$|E

5|$|In 1793 at the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, Curtis returned to Queen Charlotte and joined Lord Howe {{at the head of the}} Channel Fleet. In May 1794, Howe led the fleet to sea <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> French grain convoy and after a month of fruitless searching, discovered that the French Atlantic Fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse had left harbour and was sailing to meet the convoy. Howe gave chase and gradually closed on Villaret's rearguard, fighting two inconclusive actions during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794. On 1 June 1794, Howe caught the French fleet and brought them to battle in the battle of the Glorious First of June. The action was hard fought and Curtis' ship was heavily engaged, fighting several French ships of the line simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, {{with the}} help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian, founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. In 1906, {{convinced}} he could resolve the conundrum of Uranus's orbit, he began an extensive project <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> trans-Neptunian planet, which he named PlanetX, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. The X in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter, as opposed to the Roman numeral for 10 (at the time, PlanetX would have been the ninth planet). Lowell's hope in tracking down PlanetX was to establish his scientific credibility, which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on the surface of Mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization.|$|E
