50|$|The pin pallet {{escapement}} {{was widely}} used as it had many {{of the advantages of}} the lever escapement but was easier to manufacture. The pallets in a traditional lever escapement have two angled faces, the locking face and the impulse face, which engage the escape <b>wheel</b> <b>teeth.</b> They must be adjusted to precisely correct angles for the escapement to function. In the {{pin pallet escapement}} these faces are designed into the shape of the escape <b>wheel</b> <b>teeth</b> instead, eliminating the need for costly adjustments. However, the metal pins used instead of pallets have much higher friction than jewelled pallets, and combined with the looser manufacturing tolerances this made pin pallet timepieces less accurate. The metal pins also wear more quickly. Pin pallet timepieces are usually too cheap to justify repairing, and are usually thrown away when they break down or wear out.|$|R
