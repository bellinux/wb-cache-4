5|$|In an {{election}} held on September 19, 1995, {{the residents of}} King County voted against a 1-percentage-point sales tax increase to fund {{the building of a}} replacement stadium. As a result, the ownership group set an October 30 deadline for local leadership <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plan to finance a new stadium, or they would put the team up for sale.|$|E

5|$|Moffat {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} the dream split to Nye, who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real. Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old people as a child, but he made clear that he did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{asserted}} that the film's music mainly lifted {{to the success of}} Bandslam from reviews, especially the ska version of Everything I Own, that the film is full of unexpected pleasures set to a surprisingly retro soundtrack. Similarly, Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter emphasized the effect of the film's music-driven comedy set against the backdrop of a high school battle of the bands competition which manages <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fresh backbeat for the familiar alienated teen refrain, boosted by a talented cast and authentic soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{assumed that}} the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison {{failed to show up}} in autopsies, they were forced <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters {{would have been able to}} acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi trying <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
5|$|This year, {{the first}} ever EA Sports Jersey Creator Contest was held to design the jerseys for both the rookie and the sophomore team. The contest called for the {{participants}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> computer-generated jersey design that would replace the individual team jerseys worn by the players during the Rookie Challenge. Of 12,000 participants, 18-year-old Tim Ahmed, a freshman at Baruch College, won the contest. Ahmed won a free trip to Phoenix {{and a chance to}} meet players. This marks {{the first time that a}} fan-designed uniform has ever been worn during an NBA game or NBA event. The Sophomores wore fan-designed white jerseys and the Rookies wore fan-designed purple jerseys in the game.|$|E
5|$|Trying <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{better way}} to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out {{through a series of}} ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|E

5|$|Bethe left Germany in 1933, {{moving to}} England after {{receiving}} an offer {{for a position}} as lecturer at the University of Manchester for a year through Sommerfeld's connection to William Lawrence Bragg. He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because his parents were Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German, {{and did not have}} to eat English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in nuclear physics. After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the photodisintegration of deuterium, Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This they did on the four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester. Bethe would investigate further in the years ahead.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to having}} severe PTSD and {{being unable to}} do her job {{correctly}} anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally and she ultimately decides {{to go to work}} after helping the victim of a school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child, and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton (Scott Foley), Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did everything possible. Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times, and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful, and Yang evolves into an aware and well-rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on.|$|E
5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E

5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E
