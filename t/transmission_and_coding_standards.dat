40|$|A {{key issue}} for {{successfully}} interconnecting musicians in real-time over the Internet is minimizing the end-to-end signal delay for <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>coding.</b> Anyhow, {{the variance of}} transmission delay ('jitter') occasionally causes some packets arrive too late for playback. To avoid this problem previous approaches are working with rather large receive buffers while accepting larger delay. In this paper the authors will present a novel solution that keeps buffer sizes and delay minimal. On the network layer the authors are using a highly optimized audio framework called 'Soundjack' <b>and</b> on the <b>coding</b> layer the authors are working with an ultra low-delay codec for high-quality audio. The authors analyze and evaluate a modified <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>coding</b> scheme for the Fraunhofer Ultra-Low-Delay (ULD) audio coder, {{which is designed to}} be more resilient to lost and late arriving data packets...|$|R

It required us to face the questions scientifically such as the procurement, management, resources sharing, evaluation and etc. in agricultural scientific instruments. Because {{of the lack of}} unified classification <b>and</b> <b>code</b> <b>standards,</b> it greatly limited the scientific procurement, efficient management, resources sharing evaluation in agricultural scientific instruments. Therefore, the existing classification <b>and</b> <b>code</b> <b>standards</b> cannot meet the demand also.
