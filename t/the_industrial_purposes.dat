So, most of environmental researches have been focused on industrial wastewater treatment and the possibility of its reuse for <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>purposes</b> in order to save water consumption and decrease water pollution [1]. However, in order to recycle the treated industrial wastewater or even discharge clean wastewater to the external environment, the industrial wastewater should be completely free from the heavy metals to avoid their enormous risks on the vital life or even on the industrial machining system. Among the various heavy metals, cadmium ion is a well-known toxic metal, considered as a priority pollutant, and its adverse effects are well documented [2]. On the other hand, nuclear energy is getting more and more widely used around the world nowadays as a clean and promising energy source [3].|$|E

Microbial lipases are preferred than {{the animal and}} plant lipases because of their stability, specificity and unique properties. Microbial lipases are excreted {{by a variety of}} bacteria, fungi and yeasts. Lipases are used in various industries (pharmaceutical, food, detergent, oil, paper etc). At present the demand of industries for lipases are very higher, therefore we have to increase the production of enzyme form indigenous microbial strains in order to fulfill the various applications in industries. Normally microbial strain produces little amount of lipases to meet the cellular requirements but for <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>purposes,</b> the amount of lipases can be enhanced by the optimization technique. Different parameters (carbon sources, nitrogen sources, pH, temperature and incubation period) can be optimized in order to increase productivity of lipase.

40|$|The goal of {{engineering}} cyanobacteria to produce of high-value compounds, like biofuels, comes with many challenges. Physiological {{characteristics such as}} growth rate, culture heterogeneity, and nutrient storage can impact the facility of using specific organisms for targeted chemical production. In addition, an increasing body of evidence suggests that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are prevalent in cyanobacteria. The unicellular genus Cyanothece consists of diazotrophic cyanobacteria that can fix atmospheric N 2 in addition to CO 2. Cyanothece strain PCC 7822 is {{the only member of}} this genus that is amenable to genetic modification. This strain stores a significant amount of nutrients in intracellular granules, extrudes exopolysacchrides making macromolecule isolation difficult and cells to aggregate. Also, {{little is known about the}} expression dynamics of metabolic pathways that could be used for biofuel production. In order to further develop this strain for <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>purposes,</b> an integrated approach was applied consisting of three main areas; physiology – how cells grow and store carbohydrates under different conditions; gene expression – utilizing transcriptomics and proteomics to understand how different metabolic reactions occur within the cell; and genetics – monitoring the effects of different genetic modifications in order to generate novel metabolic capabilities. ^ Nitrate and phosphate levels in BG- 11 growth media were reduced and flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy were used to determine the effects on various physiological properties. Reducing these nutrient concentrations led to a decrease in intracellular storage, improved the growth rate, and increased culture homogeneity. Global metabolic dynamics were quantitated during standard growth conditions at four time points across a 24 hour light-dark cycle through a parallel transcriptomics and proteomics investigation. This is the first time such a study has been described for Cyanothece 7822. In addition, glycogen biosynthesis mutants were generated to study the enzymatic basis for variation in carbohydrate storage among cyanobacterial species and to test whether or not altering the structure of stored sugar granules can influence the production of downstream compound. ...|$|E

Owing to its considerable fiber amount it has been used as dietary fiber supplement. Psyllium has a strong gelling ability, even at low temperature, enabling its use as a gelling agent in the food industry. This work is part of a project to developing jellies enriched with fiber, honey and propolis, aiming to increase these products intake, with evident health benefits. The chemical characterization of psyllium was performed, with the following results (in dry matter) : total ash 2. 5 %, fat content 3. 4 % and total protein 1. 4 %. After qualitative acid hydrolysis polymeric sugars were quantified (in dry matter) : glucan 7. 3 %, xylan 61. 1 % and arabinan 22. 9 %. This means that total fiber content is about 90 %, being soluble fiber predominant, and allows classifying psyllium hemicellulose as an arabinoxylan. Psyllium functional properties were evaluated by water-binding capacity and swelling determination: 27. 1 g/g and 36. 9 ml/g, respectively. These properties are important in the food industry, but under certain circumstances may limit the food type that can be enriched with this fiber.
