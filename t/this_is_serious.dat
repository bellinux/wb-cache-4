5|$|TISM (an acronym of <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Serious</b> Mum) were a seven-piece {{anonymous}} alternative {{rock band}} from Melbourne, Australia. The group were formed on 30 December 1982 by vocalist/drummer Humphrey B. Flaubert, bassist/vocalist Jock Cheese and keyboardist/vocalist Eugene de la Hot Croix Bun, and enjoyed a large underground/independent following. Their third album, Machiavelli and the Four Seasons, reached the Australian national top 10 in 1995.|$|E

500|$|By 1985 {{the band}} were playing {{regularly}} around Melbourne and soon released a 10-track demo composed of selections from their recordings followed by their début single, [...] "Defecate on My Face" [...] (1986), a 7" [...] vinyl record packaged in a 12" [...] sleeve with all four sides glued shut. This song {{is also found}} (but is unlisted) on the EP Form and Meaning Reach Ultimate Communion as a country version. Their next single, [...] "40 Years – Then Death" [...] (1987), was released on transparent vinyl in a clear plastic sleeve with no cover art or labels. <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Serious</b> Mum's first radio-friendly single, despite the obscure packaging, was received well.|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>serious,</b> the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E

They haven't any grudge against you, but you're a sheep herder for me, and that is bad business just now. If you've killed a man they'll come a-rippin' up here about daylight with a warrant. You can't get justice in this country. You'll face a cowboy jury and it'll go hard with you. There's just one thing to do: you've got to git right close to where the west winds come from and do it quick. Throw the saddles on Bone and Rusty, and we'll hit the trail.

I was overborne, and I regret to say I stopped and listened. Marian did not utter a word, but speaking rapidly on her fingers, as we all had learnt to do for poor Tom, she said impressively, [...] "For God's sake, not a sound. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>serious.</b> We must and ought to hear it out."

50|$|The {{consequences}} of <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>serious.</b> Each palace had an abbot (dansa) {{and the actual}} abbot-ruler (dansa chenpo) had only nominal superiority.
