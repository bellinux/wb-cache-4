When people ask me which E.T. they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 E.T. If you notice, when we did put out E.T. we put out two E.T.s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version. I always tell people <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> '82 version.|$|E

5|$|Whereas Milian's {{previous}} albums had pop and R stylings, she {{was encouraged}} by Island Def Jam to target a new audience and release an urban record. Explaining the change, Milian {{said that one of}} her main problems was that previous releases would often find mainstream success, but would be relatively unsuccessful on urban radio. As an R artist, she wanted to build her core audience–a true fan base that would support her through time–to increase her career's longevity. The main purpose of her genre change was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> streets and add to her core audience.|$|E

5|$|Ever 17 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the game's story. At certain points, they get to make a choice, which affects the {{direction}} of the story, leading to eleven possible different endings. The whole plot is not revealed in just one ending; instead, the player has to play through the game multiple times, with each playthrough revealing new information. After playing through the game once, the player is able to fast-forward past text to decision points; they can also choose to start from a point further into the game, so {{that they do not have}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the game for each playthrough.|$|E

Max travels back to the time at which she took the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a dreamscape nightmare. Max and Chloe finally return to the lighthouse and confront the fact that Max brought the storm into existence by availing herself of the time travel abilities in the first place. The only way to prevent it is for Max <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beginning and allow Chloe to be killed by Nathan. Max must make a choice: sacrifice Chloe's life to save Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Arcadia Bay in order to spare Chloe.|$|E

5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year. Since 1996, European Summer Time {{has been observed}} from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union. Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, almost two-thirds of the year. The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the right <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they {{agree that it is}} better to watch things than to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E
