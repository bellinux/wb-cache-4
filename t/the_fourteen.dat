5|$|Most of {{the common}} pleas court judges up for {{re-election}} were endorsed by both parties, but in the one contested race, Democrat John Morgan Davis defeated incumbent Republican Thomas Bluett.

5|$|Moussa Souleiman {{competed in}} the men's 5000 meters, where he {{finished}} thirteenth out of <b>the</b> <b>fourteen</b> athletes in his heat, failing {{to advance to the}} next round. The medals in the event went to athletes from Germany, Kenya, and Ethiopia.|$|E
50|$|The medial {{break in}} the alexandrine, though it may do well enough in French, becomes {{intolerable}} in a language with such a tyrannous stress-accent as ours: the line struts. <b>The</b> <b>fourteener</b> has a much pleasanter movement, but a totally different one: the line dances a jig.|$|R

5|$|Ten of <b>the</b> <b>fourteen</b> {{participating}} nations earned medals, {{in addition}} to three medals won by mixed teams, i.e. teams made up of athletes from multiple nations.

5|$|Before troop {{transportation}} began, all of {{the ships}} were hastily refitted. Of <b>the</b> <b>fourteen</b> ships, four, including Montanan and Dakotan, were designated to carry animals and other cargo; the other ten were designated to carry troops. Ramps and stalls were built on the four ships chosen to carry livestock. Gun platforms were installed on each ship before docking at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the guns were put in place. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.|$|E
5|$|By definition, modern {{democratic}} constitutional monarchies are parliamentary, {{as there}} is no elected head of state who could assume non-ceremonial competences; of the twenty one republican member states of the European Union, only one is a presidential republic (Cyprus) and five are semi-presidential republics (France, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Romania). These six (semi-)presidential republics elect their president by direct popular vote. Among <b>the</b> <b>fourteen</b> parliamentary republics, half do the same (namely Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia and Slovenia), whereas in the remaining seven (Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia and Malta), the president is elected by parliament or other special representative body such as the German Bundesversammlung.|$|E
5|$|Fighting would rage across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia for {{the next}} four years. On 8 January 1918, United States President Woodrow Wilson issued a {{statement}} that became known as <b>the</b> <b>Fourteen</b> Points. In part, this speech called for the Central Powers to withdraw from the territories they had occupied, {{for the creation of a}} Polish state, the redrawing of Europe's borders along ethnic ("national") lines, and the formation of a League of Nations. During the northern-hemisphere autumn of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse. The German military suffered a decisive defeat on the Western Front, while on the Home Front the Imperial German Navy mutinied, prompting uprisings in Germany which became known as the German Revolution. The German government attempted to obtain a peace settlement based on <b>the</b> <b>Fourteen</b> Points, and maintained it was on this basis that Germany surrendered. Following negotiations, the Allied Powers and Germany signed an armistice, which came into effect on 11 November while German forces were still positioned in France and Belgium.|$|E

5|$|Following the purges and {{subsequent}} recoveries, {{gaps in the}} Doctor Who archive are spread unevenly through its first eleven seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and The Web of Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of <b>the</b> <b>fourteen</b> stories comprising his first two seasons, only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World are complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E
5|$|However, {{losses were}} also high. Five of <b>the</b> <b>fourteen</b> Group commanders (Gruppenkommandeure) of II./JG 1 {{were killed in}} action while serving with II./JG 1. The notable losses were Oberleutnant Rohwer, and Hauptmanns Kijewski, Wickop, Seegatz and Dähne. During early 1944, prior to D-Day, II./JG 1 was led by one of its four {{experienced}} formation commanders. These were Hauptmann Segatz, Major Bär, and Oberleutnants von Kirchmayr and Eder. Yet the unit suffered heavy losses (along with most other wings in the West) of 48 pilots killed, 23 wounded, and 158 aircraft destroyed for 164 confirmed victories. Of these, 119 were USAAF four-engined bombers.|$|E
5|$|None of <b>the</b> <b>fourteen</b> {{stations}} east of Cincinnati {{had seen}} Amtrak service before. Tri-State Station (named {{for the states}} of Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia) in Catlettsburg, Kentucky replaced an existing stop at Ashland. Amtrak built new stations at Roanoke and Bluefield. The remaining stops all used existing Norfolk & Western stations, {{with varying degrees of}} refurbishment and renovation. Two cities, Petersburg and Lynchburg, Virginia, had additional rail service at different stations. Amtrak's Florida-bound trains used the ex-Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Petersburg station, while the Southern Railway's remaining trains used Kemper Street station in Lynchburg.|$|E

5|$|Pokiri was {{released}} on 28 April 2006, to positive critical feedback, and collected a distributor's share of 420 million. The film grossed 660 million worldwide and remained the highest-grossing Telugu film for three years, until it was surpassed by Magadheera in 2009. The film {{was also one of}} <b>the</b> <b>fourteen</b> southern Indian films to be screened at the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA) Film festival in 2006. The film won four Nandi Awards and two Filmfare Awards. The film's success catapulted D'Cruz into stardom and brought recognition to Jagannadh as a writer and director.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri was {{scheduled}} for a worldwide release on 21 April 2006. Due to delays in post-production activities, the film's release was postponed to 28 April 2006, clashing {{with the release of}} Bangaram and Veerabhadra. The film received an 'A' (Adults only) certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification for containing obscene sequences and excessive violence. Dil Raju Sri Venkateswara Creations, Mallikharjuna films and Great India films acquired the theatrical distribution rights of Nizam, Ceded and overseas regions respectively. Pokiri was one of <b>the</b> <b>fourteen</b> southern Indian films that were screened at the IIFA film festival 2006 held at the Dubai International Convention Centre in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.|$|E
5|$|The project {{presented}} {{a variety of}} specific challenges. Because its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on acoustics first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a shoebox auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and Vienna Musikverein. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect Johann Balthasar Neumann, especially the Basilica of <b>the</b> <b>Fourteen</b> Holy Helpers. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the Paris Opéra designed by Charles Garnier.|$|E
