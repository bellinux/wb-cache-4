5|$|Some mathematicians (e.g., Isaac Newton) used exponents {{only for}} powers greater than two, preferring to {{represent}} squares as repeated multiplication. <b>Thus</b> <b>they</b> would write polynomials, for example, as ax + bxx + cx3 + d.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thus</b> <b>they</b> {{decided that}} the {{position}} in Australia was not affected at all by the position in the United Kingdom, and for Australian purposes, the United Kingdom has no legislative power over Australia.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{positions}} were nominally {{appointed by the}} Emperor and their holders were answerable directly to him. Nevertheless, from 1936 the Japanese Army and Navy held, effectively, a legal right to nominate (or refuse to nominate) their respective ministers. <b>Thus,</b> <b>they</b> could prevent the formation of undesirable governments, or by resignation bring about the collapse of an existing government.|$|E

5|$|Anderlecht {{finished}} the 1978–79 Belgian First Division in second place, four points behind champions Beveren. <b>Thus,</b> <b>they</b> would {{compete in the}} 1979–80 UEFA Cup. Liverpool {{finished the}} 1978–79 Football League in first place, eight points clear of second-placed Nottingham Forest. Their domestic championship triumph meant they would compete in the European Cup the following season.|$|E
5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and <b>thus</b> <b>they</b> exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|Digimon Racing is {{a racing}} video game that {{utilizes}} characters and elements from Digimon {{as well as}} those of traditional racing games. The game follows a group of Digimon competing in a racing tournament within the Digital World, home to all Digimon. The purpose of the grand prix is to determine who is the best racer; <b>thus,</b> <b>they</b> use specially designed karts that equate all contestants in terms of ability.|$|E
60|$|So Mr. George led the way, and Rollo followed, {{down the}} path by which they had come up. As <b>they</b> <b>thus</b> walked down <b>they</b> {{continued}} the conversation which they had commenced in the pavilion.|$|R

5|$|For centuries, the Bedouin {{tracked the}} ancestry of each horse through an oral tradition. Horses of the purest blood {{were known as}} Asil and {{crossbreeding}} with non-Asil horses was forbidden. Mares were the most valued, both for riding and breeding, and pedigree families were traced through the female line. The Bedouin {{did not believe in}} gelding male horses, and considered stallions too intractable to be good war horses, <b>thus</b> <b>they</b> kept very few colts, selling most, and culling those of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide {{exists in}} about 250 {{crystalline}} forms. The polymorphism of SiC {{is characterized by}} a large family of similar crystalline structures called polytypes. They are variations of the same chemical compound that are identical in two dimensions and differ in the third. <b>Thus,</b> <b>they</b> can be viewed as layers stacked in a certain sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was debated in the days immediately following the fire. Public speculation led {{to the arrest of}} Crocker and Warren, the occupants of the warehouse. The Daily-Tribune reported that the explosions could not have occurred without the presence of gunpowder in addition to the saltpeter, and <b>thus</b> <b>they</b> were suspected of possessing gunpowder, which would have led to a murder charge. However, later inquiry released Crocker and Warren of all charges as no evidence of gunpowder was discovered.|$|E
25|$|Leptons are spin- particles. The spin-statistics theorem <b>thus</b> {{implies that}} <b>they</b> are fermions and <b>thus</b> that <b>they</b> {{are subject to}} the Pauli {{exclusion}} principle: No two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time. Furthermore, it means that a lepton can have only two possible spin states, namely up or down.|$|R

5|$|The {{content of}} MFGM in dairy {{products}} {{varies depending on}} the processing involved. During dairy processing such as churning or decreaming, the MFGM is disrupted and preferentially distributed into aqueous phases such as buttermilk, butter serum, or certain type of whey. <b>Thus</b> <b>they</b> {{can be a good}} source of MFGM for addition into food products.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers {{were not}} allowed the luxury of sound stages; <b>thus,</b> <b>they</b> had to find {{abandoned}} buildings or landmarks to use. The exteriors of the climactic airport scene were shot at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport, while the interior scenes were shot at the Pennsylvania Convention Center (formerly, Reading Terminal). Filming at the psychiatric hospital was done at the Eastern State Penitentiary.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} batches of double deckers have {{a height of}} , too tall to meet many height {{standards}} set by the provincial Ministry of Transportation. <b>Thus,</b> <b>they</b> are restricted to routes which avoid low bridges and underpasses. In particular, they are found exclusively on routes on the Highway 407 and Highway 403 corridors, providing service between Peel and York Regions.|$|E

5|$|The {{other type}} of solids is weak {{molecular}} crystals (e.g., fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are held together essentially by physical forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds). Since these solids are held together by weak forces, a very low input of energy is required to break them, <b>thus</b> <b>they</b> are termed “low energy”. Depending {{on the type of}} liquid chosen, low-energy surfaces can permit either complete or partial wetting.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are areas}} of relatively low {{pressure in the}} troposphere, with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level. The environment {{near the center of}} tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, <b>thus</b> <b>they</b> are characterized as “warm core” systems.|$|E
5|$|Zobel and Carson {{helped to}} {{establish}} the nature of noise in electric circuits, concluding that—contrary to mainstream belief—it is not even theoretically possible to filter out noise entirely and that noise {{will always be a}} limiting factor in what is possible to transmit. <b>Thus,</b> <b>they</b> anticipated the later work of Claude Shannon, who showed how the theoretical information rate of a channel is related to the noise of the channel.|$|E

5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; <b>thus,</b> <b>they</b> give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in 2003 with the {{original}} intention of releasing the game for the PlayStation 2. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio to develop a launch title for the PlayStation Portable. Due to time constraints, the Cambridge studio was given only a year to develop the game, <b>thus</b> <b>they</b> decided to remake the original MediEvil. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release, with critics mainly praising the game's humor, voice talent and graphics but was criticized for lack of innovation and cumbersome camera controls.|$|E
5|$|During his {{dictatorship}} from 82 BC until 80 BC, Lucius Cornelius Sulla {{restored the}} old Servian Organization to this assembly. Sulla died in 78 BC, and in 70 BC, the Consuls Pompey Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus repealed Sulla's constitutional reforms, including his {{restoration of the}} Servian Organization to this assembly. <b>Thus,</b> <b>they</b> restored the newer organization that had originated in 241 BC. The organization of the Centuriate Assembly was not changed again until its powers were all transferred to the Roman Senate by the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, {{after the fall of}} the Roman Republic in 27 BC.|$|E
