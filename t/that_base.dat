5|$|The colony faced {{numerous}} difficulties {{during its}} brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From <b>that</b> <b>base,</b> La Salle led several expeditions {{to find the}} Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only {{with help from the}} French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1946, however, she was {{converted}} into an experimental ship to test infrared {{equipment for the}} Bureau of Ships. She had her armament removed and her hospital facilities converted to work spaces for test equipment. At that time, she was redesignated E-PCER-852. She completed the conversion in May 1946. In September 1947, the Bureau of Ships shifted the infrared test program to the Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London, Connecticut, and E-PCER-852 operated from <b>that</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1942, she was {{attached}} to Submarine Forces, Southwest Pacific, and operated independently out of Brisbane as a target for the submarines out of Fremantle. She then gave submariners practice in making approaches and battle surfacing. With the beginning of the Buna-Gona offensives in New Guinea, Tulsa escorted PT boats to take part in that campaign and operated between Milne Bay, New Guinea, and Cairns, Australia. When the PT boat base at Kana Kopa, on the southeastern shores of Milne Bay, was established in November 1942, Tulsa brought in much-needed equipment to aid in the operations being-conducted from <b>that</b> <b>base.</b> But five days before Christmas 1942, Tulsa grounded on an uncharted pinnacle and damaged her ASDIC gear, necessitating a return to yard facilities for repairs.|$|E
25|$|A formal {{training}} establishment was also {{created by the}} Air Service on February 25, 1920, when the War Department authorized the establishment of service schools. Flying training, originally at Carlstrom Field in Florida and March Field in California, moved to Texas, divided between the 11th School Group (primary flying training) at Brooks Field and the 10th School Group (advanced flying training) at Kelly Field. A technical school for mechanics was located at Chanute Field, Illinois. The Air Service Tactical School was set up at Langley Field, Virginia, to train officers for higher command and to instruct in doctrine and the employment of military aviation. The Engineering Division created an air engineering school at McCook Field and moved it to Wright Field when <b>that</b> <b>base</b> was established in 1924.|$|E
25|$|Luttrell wrote a {{note and}} asked that it {{be taken to the}} American base at Asadabad. Because Gulab had {{previously}} met the Marine commander based at Nangalam, he asked an older man named Shina, of another part of the village of Salar Ban, to make the trek with the note to <b>that</b> <b>base</b> instead. This required a longer journey down the trails of the Shuryek valley to Matin, where he then hired a cab to drive the Pech road to Nangalam. Gulab gave Shina 1,000 Afghanis (about twenty U.S. dollars). When Shina reached the base in Nangalam {{in the middle of the}} night he met with the commander and related the story about a wounded American soldier in their village.

At the end of the war, as the Communists succeeded to power through the Provisional Government of National Union, Kham Ouane Boupha was appointed Deputy Minister of Defense on 9 April 1974. He was promoted to become Minister of Defense on 12 May 1975 and served as such for many years, even while he was also Minister of Justice. He retired from cabinet rank in 2006, becoming a Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|With {{the capture}} of Madang, the Allies finally {{effectively}} secured the Huon Peninsula; nevertheless, the Allies were unable to prevent the Japanese defenders from withdrawing and, as a result, they were unsuccessful in completely destroying them. Following the fall of Madang, {{the remnants of the}} Japanese 18th Army eventually withdrew to the Wewak area with the intention of falling back to Hollandia. <b>That</b> <b>base</b> fell before they could arrive after the Allies launched Operations Reckless and Persecution, and consequently they remained in the Wewak area. US forces from the 41st Infantry Division subsequently landed at Aitape and in mid- to late 1944, US and Japanese forces clashed during the Battle of Driniumor River. In late 1944, the Australian 6th Division arrived to relieve the US garrison, and the Australian forces subsequently launched the Aitape–Wewak campaign, fighting a campaign to secure the airfield and then clear the Japanese from the inland areas patrolling through the Torricelli and Prince Alexander mountain ranges.|$|E
25|$|The Pakistan {{high command}} was {{fully aware that}} the IAF {{considerably}} outnumbered the PAF eastern detachment, and that they held the qualitative edge {{as well in the}} eastern theater. Pakistani planners had anticipated the PAF being neutralized within 24 hours of the IAF commencing combat operations over East Pakistan. There was only one fully functional, extended combat-capable airbase (at Tejgaon near Dhaka) in all of East Pakistan, as all satellite air bases lacked the service facilities for sustaining prolonged operations. The PAF had plans to deploy a squadron of Shenyang F-6 planes at Kurmitola (now Shahjalal International Airport) in 1971. These planes were temporarily deployed but ultimately withdrawn because, although the runway was functional at <b>that</b> <b>base,</b> the base was not fully functional enough to support the planes, and the lack of infrastructure meant PAF could not deploy any additional planes. This marginalization and neglect of East Pakistani defenses since 1948 had hamstrung the PAF Eastern contingent in 1971, when its capabilities were put to the test.|$|E

25|$|Signals Troop and Tracking Troop were {{specialised}} sub-units that interpolated into Support Group or Base Group {{and worked}} with all the Commandos. Signals Troop focused on front line communications in support of special operations and airborne forces, but also provided other essential services (exchange of classified information, etc.) for the Battalion. A high percentage of Signals Troop had served {{in one or more}} Commandos before being selected and trained (in-house) as communicators. During the early planning stages for proposed changes to Support Group, it was accepted <b>that</b> <b>Base</b> Group was more suitable as the cynosure for all signals (military). The troop headquarters section was relocated to the RLI Joint Operations Command (JOC), and a team of specialist operators — properly cross-trained as proficient riflemen for combat duties — was attached to and deployed with each of the Commandos. So Signals Troop was scattered but still functioned as the vital organ that connected all the detachments in the network.|$|E
25|$|As for irrational numbers, none of {{them have}} a finite {{representation}} in any of the rational-based positional number systems (such as the decimal and duodecimal ones); this is because a rational-based positional number system is essentially nothing but a way of expressing quantities as a sum of fractions whose denominators are powers of the base, and by definition no finite sum of rational numbers can ever result in an irrational number. For example, 123.456 = 1 × 102 + 2 × 101 + 3 × 100 + 4 × 1/101 + 5 × 1/102 + 6 × 1/103 (this is also the reason why fractions that contain prime factors in their denominator not in common with those of the base do not have a terminating representation in <b>that</b> <b>base).</b> Moreover, the infinite series of digits of an irrational number does not exhibit a strictly repeating pattern; instead, the different digits often succeed in a seemingly random fashion. The following chart compares the first few digits of the decimal and duodecimal representation of several of the most important algebraic and transcendental irrational numbers. Some of these numbers may be perceived as having fortuitous patterns, making them easier to memorize, when represented in one base or the other.|$|E
