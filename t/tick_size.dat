40|$|In Switzerland, the {{existence}} of a mandatory minimum par value inhibited many companies from splitting their stocks as they already traded at their minimum par value. These Swiss companies could split their stocks only after the legal minimum par value was lowered in July 1992 and again in May 2001. These two events provide rare opportunities to distinguish between stock splits that signal a permanent increase in stock price and splits that are merely a reaction to a regulatory change and thus have other motives. The significant return differences between the two samples are in line with the hypothesis that splits are a means to send positive signals to the stock market. Furthermore, while trading volumes remained largely unaffected after stock splits, relative <b>tick</b> <b>sizes</b> generally increased after a stock split, and bid-ask spreads often increased after a stock split.

40|$|Measuring intraday {{volatility}} {{is one of}} {{the more}} difficult tasks facing financial researchers and practitioners. There are a number of efficient methods of estimating volatility. However, the efficiency of volatility estimators decreases as the kurtosis of the return distribution increases, and intraday data are widely known to have thick tails. This paper introduces new methods of estimating historic volatility using the trading range. These estimators differ from existing range-based estimation techniques in two ways. First, these estimators are derived under the binomial model. Prior research has assumed a diffusion process. Because of minimum <b>tick</b> <b>sizes,</b> intraday data may be better modeled by the binomial model. Second, existing estimators are derived from the second sample moment of observed ranges or returns. The estimators introduced here rely on lower sample moments. Using lower sample moments mitigates the problem cause by thick tails in the return distribution, resulting in more efficient estimates. In empirical tests, these estimators provide more accurate variance forecasts than either the traditional closing price estimator or the Parkinson range-based estimator.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} use of price intensities to {{estimate}} volatilities based on high-frequency data. We interpret the conditional proba-bility for the occurrence of a price event within a certain time horizon as a risk measure which allows us to obtain an estimator of the conditional volatility per time. This kind of volatility estimation solves the problem of an appropriate ag-gregation level by dening explicitly price events. To consider grouping caused by the nontrading period overnight we use a categorical duration model. This model allows us {{to take into account}} that durations which occur overnight can only be registered by a lower and an upper bound. The use of price durations based on dierent <b>tick</b> <b>sizes</b> makes it possible to investigate volatility patterns depending on dierent aggregation levels. Seasonalities are taken into account by including regressors based on a exible Fourier form based on intraday and time to maturity seasonalities. Testing for serial correlation and controlling for unobservable heterogeneity permits us to check for misspecication on dif-ferent aggregation levels. Empirical results are based on intraday transaction data of Bund Future trading at the LIFFE in London...|$|R
50|$|Payment {{for order}} flow was a {{practice}} pioneered by Bernard Madoff, {{and the practice}} has long been controversial. However, on February 27, 2009, after years of opposing payment for order flow, the New York Stock Exchange sought permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow payment for order flow on its electronic exchange(s).The NYSE is proposing to pay for limit orders {{in order to put}} more cash into the market. This contrasts with the traditional model of payment for order flow that pays only for market orders. Payment for order flow has become less lucrative on a per share basis because of the decline in the <b>tick</b> <b>size</b> and the bid/ask spread. When stocks traded on 1/8ths of a dollar, payments for order flow were much larger than they became after 2001 when the <b>tick</b> <b>size</b> in U.S. markets fell to one cent. Larry Harris reports that in 1997, 24% of E-Trade's transaction revenue came from payment for order flow, but that by the second quarter of 2001 such payments accounted for only 15% of transaction revenue.|$|E

40|$|In Chapter 1, I {{find that}} stock {{characteristics}} do predict a stock's time-varying liquidity beta, i. e. its sensitivity to market, with the effect varying {{according to the}} assumed holding period using data on 30 small, medium, and large cap stocks between 1997 and 2002. I also find that liquidity is a priced factor for stock return even after controlling for market and stock measures of risk such as estimates of market volatility and stock level volatility. In order to mitigate problems arising from a small panel, I also test the returns model with ARCH errors on a larger sample of 2000 stocks. Chapter 2 accounts for endogenous liquidity in a standard asset pricing model. Loss of liquidity, especially during times of crises, needs to be incorporated into models of financial assets so as to forecast returns correctly. To identify the effect of endogenous stock liquidity on stock returns, an instrument is constructed from the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ's decimalization program, which shrunk <b>tick</b> <b>sizes</b> from one-sixteenth of a dollar to one-hundredth of a dollar. Decimalization led {{to an increase in}} liquidity by allowing for narrower bid-ask spreads. Using daily price and quote data on U. S. common stocks, I find that as stocks becomes more illiquid, their future expected returns increase. In Chapter 3, I propose two related measures for algorithmic trading constructed from the Disclosure of Order Execution Statistics data in order to study the effect of algorithmic trading on stock liquidity. The first is the average time taken to fill an order once it arrives in the market, known as fill time, and the second is the proportion of orders executed within ten seconds of order arrival at the NYSE. Since the decision to use algorithms in trading is an endogenous one, I use the NYSE's introduction of autoquotes in 2003 to identify the causal effect of algorithmic trading on a stock's liquidity. Using IV estimation, I find that a one second decrease in fill time narrows spreads by two basis point...|$|R
