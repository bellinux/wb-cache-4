500|$|In 1649, in {{response}} to the expressions of royal concern shown over its welfare, the university community addressed Philip IV, saying that the University [...] "requests Your Royal Highness <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> her within your Royal Solicitude, because she has been, from her very beginnings, a fruit of your royal bounty, and from the desire that she should grow and progress ever through efforts so Royal and so Catholic." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{considered}} the U.S. model {{of that time}} to be more amicable because it had both [...] "sharp distinction and actual cooperation" [...] between church and state, {{what he called a}} [...] "historical treasure" [...] and admonished the United States, [...] "Please to God <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> it carefully, and do not let your concept of separation veer round to the European one." [...] Alexis de Tocqueville, another French observer tended to make the same distinction, [...] "In the U.S., from the beginning, politics and religion were in accord, and they have not ceased to be so since." ...|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we're working on something, the lyrics take a while to work on and [...] come to me and say 'I've had these ideas, use them if you want' and if there's something I like, I'll stick it in with my own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' and I might use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E
