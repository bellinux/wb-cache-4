5|$|In the Main Story Epilogue, Lady {{returns to}} the Devil May Cry Office to settle up. Claiming that Dante and Trish only {{escalated}} the situation by unwittingly providing the Devil Arms that were key to Sanctus’ plan, she gladly pays them next to nothing. But as Trish answers a call for a new job, Dante gets Lady back for it by allowing her to <b>tag</b> <b>along</b> without getting paid. It’s clear {{that none of them}} are {{in it for the money}} anyway, as all three charge into the night guns blazing.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) {{is in the}} holosuite {{playing a}} secret agent program in the 1960s. Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) intrudes and convinces Bashir to let him <b>tag</b> <b>along.</b> Meanwhile, Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), Lt Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn), Lt. Cmdr. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell), Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), and Chief Petty Officer Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) are on a runabout, {{returning}} to Deep Space Nine. As they arrive they find that their vessel has been sabotaged and that a warp core breach is imminent. Lt. Cmdr. Michael Eddington beams them out, but the ship is destroyed during transport and Eddington is forced to store their patterns while he repairs the transporter, but doing so uses {{almost all of the}} station's memory, putting many station systems off-line. Their physical patterns end up in the computer controlling the holosuite, where they appear as characters in Bashir's program.|$|E
5|$|While the {{scientists}} argued over classifications and nomenclature, they also returned west for more fossils. Marsh made his last trip backed by Yale in 1873, {{with a large}} group of thirteen students accompanying him, protected by a group of soldiers who wanted to make a show of force to the Sioux tribe. Due to concerns over his more lavish and expensive expeditions in years past, Marsh had the students pay their own way, and the trip cost Yale only $1857.50, far less than the $15,000 (over $200,000 in modern currency) that Marsh had claimed for the previous expedition. This excursion would prove to be Marsh's last: {{for the rest of the}} Bone Wars, Marsh preferred to enlist the services of local collectors. Though he had enough bones to study for years, the scientist's appetite for more would grow. Cope was even more prolific in his collecting that season than he was in 1872, although Marsh's penchant for cultivating collectors of his own meant that at Bridger his rival was persona non grata. Tired of working under Hayden, Cope found a paying job with the Army Corps of Engineers, but was limited by this federal association; while Cope had to <b>tag</b> <b>along</b> on surveys, Marsh could collect wherever he pleased.|$|E

500|$|Barney Googles {{popularity}} persisted {{into the}} Depression era; in 1933, Fortune magazine reported DeBeck's weekly earnings at $1200. [...] In {{the spring of}} 1933, DeBeck hired 16-year-old Fred Lasswell as an assistant after seeing his work on a poster. He wanted a letterer for Barney Google, and Lasswell's lettering impressed him. Lasswell started by doing chores for DeBeck, as well as taking on lettering and other duties on the strip. DeBeck undertook educating Lasswell in cartooning, having him attend schools, copy the works of masters like Gibson and May, and copy line-for-line the artwork from DeBeck's own comics. Lasswell moved in with the DeBecks, and would <b>tag</b> <b>along</b> with them wherever they moved. He would take over his mentor's strip after his death and continue it into the 21st century.|$|E
500|$|... — A {{friend of}} both the Hero and Kiefer, Maribel is the {{daughter}} of the mayor of Fishbel. Unlike Kiefer, who has steadfastly refused to let his social status influence how he looks upon other people, Maribel tends to be a bit condescending, even bossy. Despite this, she has a kind, sentimental side and gets along well with her friends, and occasionally accompanies them on their adventuring, even if she sometimes has to pressure them into letting her <b>tag</b> <b>along.</b> Maribel is primarily a magic user: with low starting physical statistics, and an early lack of powerful weapons available for her use, it takes {{a good deal of time}} before she can do anything approaching the amount of physical damage inflicted by some of the other characters. On the other hand, Maribel has access to a variety of damaging attack spells relatively early on. She is forced to leave the party when her father falls ill, but unlike Kiefer, she can rejoin them later on.|$|E

500|$|As {{the group}} {{attempts}} to enter Dr. Totenkopf's lair, one scientist is electrocuted {{by the defense}} system. A hologram of Totenkopf appears, speaking about his hate for humanity and his plans to rebuild it as a new master race. Dex disables the defenses and the group discovers Totenkopf's mummified corpse inside with {{a scrap of paper}} clutched in his hand: [...] "forgive me". He had died 20 years prior, but his machines continued his plan. Joe decides to sabotage the rocket from the inside while the others escape. Polly tries to <b>tag</b> <b>along,</b> but Joe kisses her and then knocks her out. Polly recovers, following Joe and luckily saving him from Dr. Jennings' assassin, a female robot. Joe and Polly then board the rocket. Before the rocket reaches 100km, when its second stage is scheduled to fire and thereby incinerate the Earth, Polly pushes an emergency button that ejects all the animals in escape pods. Joe tries to disable the rocket only to be interrupted by the same robot. He jolts the robot with its electric weapon and then uses it on the controls, disabling the rocket. They use the last pod to save themselves as the rocket safely explodes.|$|E

2500|$|Disdain {{for certain}} types of culture. Sir Humphrey thinks Hacker to be a {{cultural}} philistine who is unaware {{of the importance of}} protecting Britain's artistic heritage.
