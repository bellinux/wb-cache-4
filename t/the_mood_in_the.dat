5|$|On February 2, 2010, Phaneuf {{made his}} Toronto Maple Leaf debut, leading all Maple Leafs players in time on ice and ended {{the night with}} a fight and given second star of the game honours. He would record his first point, an assist, four nights later {{in a game against}} the Ottawa Senators and scored his first goal as a Leaf on April 7, 2010, on Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers. Phaneuf was named an {{alternate}} captain in Toronto nine games after being acquired after Mike Komisarek suffered a season-ending injury. While Phaneuf struggled offensively to begin his tenure in Toronto – he played 25 games in Toronto before scoring his first goal – then-Leafs Head Coach Ron Wilson credited him with creating a positive change in <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Toronto dressing room.|$|E

5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E

25|$|Pietersen {{opened the}} second day, 80 minutes late thanks to rain, with nightwatchmen Hoggard, the latter {{putting on his}} normal single figures, this time 3 runs, but holding the line for 36 balls. Once normal play resumed with Paul Collingwood England {{continued}} to dominate, setting their targets high with a 69 partnership before Collingwood gloved Murali to short leg for 238/5 {{and was replaced by}} skipper Andrew Flintoff who was surprisingly tame. Pietersen went on to hit three 4s in as many balls before hitting a reverse-sweeper 6 but then being bowled lbw by Murali, achieving three Test centuries in consecutive Tests. After the departure of their number four, England crumbled hopelessly from 290/6 to 295 all out just before tea. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English camp was swiftly revitalised by the hot drinks as Hoggard bowled Upul Tharanga for a golden duck, having been bowled for nothing in the first innings. Two more men went to see the tourists at 43/3 with a 111 run deficit and before the close of play Geraint Jones redeemed his missed catch to Thilan Samaraweera by stumping soon after, unbeaten opener Michael Vandort remained at the crease for 30 when play closed at 7:30 due to the missed play earlier. After persistent rain over Birmingham, play was started at 4:45 and the fifth wicket held up for 125, helping them take the lead. Both batsmen fought off good efforts by Panesar and Plunkett but eventually it was Hoggard who made the only breakthrough on a day where Sri Lanka stood tall for a short day at 194/5.|$|E

Bono wrote the song's lyrics as this character, composing a sequence of [...] "single-line aphorisms". He developed the persona into a leather-clad egomaniac, describing his outfit as having Lou Reed's glasses, Elvis Presley's jacket, and Jim Morrison's leather pants. To match the character's dark fashion, Bono dyed his naturally brown hair black.|$|E

Although she gave birth to five children in ten years, both she and Richard believed that she should not be [...] "a household machine." [...] Thus a servant was hired to help with the children as Pankhurst involved herself with the Women's Suffrage Society. Their daughter Christabel was born on 22 September 1880, {{less than a year after}} the wedding. Pankhurst gave birth to another daughter, Estelle Sylvia, in 1882 and their son Francis Henry, nicknamed Frank, in 1884. Soon afterwards Richard Pankhurst left the Liberal Party. He began expressing more radical socialist views and argued a case in court against several wealthy businessmen. These actions roused Robert Goulden's ire and <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house became tense. In 1885 the Pankhursts moved to Chorlton-on-Medlock, and their daughter Adela was born. They moved to London the following year, where Richard ran unsuccessfully for election as a Member of Parliament and Pankhurst opened a small fabric shop called Emerson and Company.|$|E
500|$|The {{absence of}} the pillar was regretted by some who felt the city had lost {{one of its most}} {{prominent}} landmarks. The Irish Literary Association was anxious that, whatever future steps were taken, the lettering on the pedestal should be preserved; the Irish Times reported that the Royal Irish Academy of Music was considering legal measures to prevent removal of the remaining stump. Reactions among the general public were relatively light-hearted, typified by the numerous songs inspired by the incident. These included the immensely popular [...] "Up Went Nelson", set to the tune of [...] "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" [...] and performed by a group of Belfast schoolteachers, which remained {{at the top of the}} Irish charts for eight weeks. [...] An American newspaper reported that <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city was one of gaiety, with shouts of [...] "Nelson has lost his last battle!" [...] Some accounts relate that the Irish president, Éamon de Valera, phoned The Irish Press to suggest the headline: [...] "British Admiral Leaves Dublin By Air"—according to the senator and presidential candidate David Norris, [...] "the only recorded instance of humour in that lugubrious figure".|$|E
500|$|In February 1991, U2 {{moved the}} album's {{recording}} sessions to the seaside manor Elsinore in the Dublin suburb of Dalkey, renting {{the house for}} ₤10,000 per month. The band nicknamed the house [...] "Dog Town" [...] for the [...] "tackiness" [...] of its exterior dog kennels, and the location was credited as such in the album notes. Lanois' strategy to record in houses, mansions, or castles was something he believed brought atmosphere to the recordings. Dublin audio services company Big Bear Sound installed a recording studio in the house, with the recording room in a converted garage diagonally beneath the control room. Video cameras and TV monitors were used to monitor and communicate between the spaces. With Elsinore located {{within walking distance of}} Bono's and the Edge's homes, the sessions there were more relaxed and productive. The band struggled with one particular song—later released as the B-side [...] "Lady With the Spinning Head"—but three separate tracks, [...] "The Fly", [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] and [...] "Zoo Station", were derived from it. During the writing of [...] "The Fly", Bono created a persona based on an oversized pair of black sunglasses that he wore to lighten <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio. The character, also named [...] "The Fly", evolved into a leather-clad egomaniac meant to parody rock stardom.

500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It {{was the first time}} we sort of jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks in a way we hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. <b>The</b> <b>mood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E
