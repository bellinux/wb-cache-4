The episode marked the first appearance of recurring guest actor Cheech Marin. It first aired on February 28, 2007, in the United States on ABC, with an estimated 12.78 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews, with many praising its humor but still noting that little was learned concerning the show's overall mythology.|$|E

They held on to a 14-9 lead with an interception in the endzone by safety Will Allen in the final seconds. Even though they were undefeated, the Buckeyes were heading into the Fiesta Bowl as 2 touchdown underdogs. But <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of motivation from strong leaders like 3x All-American safety Mike Doss.|$|E
500|$|Conan {{received}} fair-to-good {{ratings from}} critics. In 2008, review aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings selected around 80 reviews and calculated average scores of 69 (out of 100) and 70% for the game, respectively. [...] Most critics {{agreed that the}} game's best selling point was its variety in combat. [...] <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun with its easy-to-learn controls, skill customization, and most of all, the varied brutal depictions of Conan's kills. [...] TeamXbox said that the combat system [...] "blossoms into a complex string of commands that will reward the user (with gore) for pressing the right buttons at the right time". The pounding, militaristic orchestra tunes accompanying the action further enhanced the critics' experience with the game.|$|E

During the interview, Rollins also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because days prior to the incident, record producer Rick Rubin – who was {{a fan of the}} Rollins Band – had requested to hear the then newly recorded album, The End of Silence, and parked his Rolls-Royce outside their Venice Beach house while carrying a cell phone. Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood, Rollins suspected that this would bring trouble because of the implication that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money in the home. He even wrote in his journal the night of Rubin's visit: [...] "My place is going to get popped." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Veeck hired Lemon {{to succeed}} Paul Richards as the Chicago White Sox manager on November 16, 1976. Lemon {{took over a}} Chicago team that {{finished}} in last place in the AL West in 1976. [...] "Bob {{is the type of}} manager we need {{at this stage of the}} game", Veeck said. During spring training of 1977, Lemon said, [...] "I think we'll surprise a few people." [...] White Sox shortstop Alan Bannister quickly noticed a difference. Comparing Richards to Lemon, Bannister said, [...] "He'd post the lineups 10 minutes before the game, and only then we'd find out who was playing and where. Lemon's made it a serious operation." [...] As late as August 14, the White Sox were in first place in the AL West. The White Sox finished with a 90–72 record, a 26-game improvement. The team finished third in AL West and Lemon won his second Manager of the Year Award. [...] "The fans got behind us after about three weeks. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to do with our success", Lemon said after being winning the award.|$|E

Mania stats that most of the main anime characters are mostly visually appealing, though still stereotypical, designs and claims [...] "the most interesting looking character" [...] is Konami with Miyuki close behind. Mania goes further and claims that Miyuki actually fills the costume better cosplaying as a [...] "Magical Girl" [...] than Mii.|$|E

They became fast friends and began collaborating on experimental radio pieces, the first of which they sent to Ira Glass for a proposed Flag Day episode of This American Life.

2500|$|During 2001, after a low key tour {{supporting}} Texas, {{they took}} a long summer break, in North Devon, to write new material for their fifth album. The self-financed sessions were deliberately performed at arms length from their record label and the music industry in general, and Reef enjoyed the opportunity {{to return to their}} earlier, more basic approach to making music. In an interview to the BBC Jack said [...] "It's a harder sound, like when we first came out - a deep sound, heavy, I really like that." [...] Whilst <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of new material, Sony forced Reef to only use around a third of this material as part of a greatest hits offering entitled Together - The Best of Reef released in January 2003. Jack Bessant denounced the complete lack of support from Sony and Kenwyn House called the release [...] "a kiss of death." [...] Many fans felt the new material had been some of their best work for some time.|$|E

2500|$|Originally named Dead Lesbian {{and then}} the Fibrillating Scissor Sisters, the final two words of the latter being derived from the lesbian sexual act tribadism, the band was founded in 2000 after friends Jake Shears and Scott [...] "Babydaddy" [...] Hoffman (who had met in 1999 in Lexington) both moved to New York City, enjoying its open and gay-friendly ethos. They began {{producing}} music together, with Babydaddy composing music and Shears writing lyrics. The duo released a couple of singles to little success and began appearing at underground clubs on New York's Lower East Side. On a trip to Disneyland, the pair met Ana [...] "Ana Matronic" [...] Lynch at a screening of Michael Jackson's Captain EO. During a subsequent teacup ride, they discovered that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in common.

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for The Loudest Engine {{took place at}} the Killers' Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas, from September to October 2010. The album was recorded with a Studer A820 2" [...] 24-track reel-to-reel analogue tape machine. 00:07, c 3:00, d 1:25, e3:23. After Joel insisted that the album be recorded to tape, Stoermer sought and acquired the recording unit. The band decided to not record anything that they could not perform live, referring to their last album Radio Wars, which was very electronically oriented. Members of the band stated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more freedom than ever before in the studio, {{which is one of the}} reasons they chose Stoermer as a producer. They knew as a musician that he understood the importance of letting a band just play music instead of pressuring them to push their instrument or sound elsewhere. Stoermer researched autobiographies of record producers, including the book, Recording The Beatles, to use as technical reference points for recording the album.|$|E

The priest at Er-Heb was doing all right, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of pending cases about land to show me, and some men from another village had been firing arrows at night.

6000|$|The ship-keeper dodged {{about the}} quarter-deck, out of hearing, {{and trying to}} keep out of sight. At the same time, taking {{advantage}} of the open doors with skill and prudence, he could see the captain and [...] "that girl" [...] the captain had brought aboard. The captain was showing her round very thoroughly. Through the whole length of the passage, far away aft in the perspective of the saloon the ship-keeper had interesting glimpses of them as they went {{in and out of the}} various cabins, crossing from side to side, remaining invisible for a time in one or another of the state-rooms, and then reappearing again in the distance. The girl, always following the captain, had her sunshade in her hands. Mostly she would hang her head, but now and then she would look up. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to say to each other, and seemed to forget they weren't alone in the ship. He saw the captain put his hand on her shoulder, and was preparing himself with a certain zest for what might follow, when the [...] "old man" [...] seemed to recollect himself, and came striding down all the length of the saloon. At this move the ship-keeper promptly dodged out of sight, as you may believe, and heard the captain slam the inner door of the passage. After that disappointment the ship-keeper waited resentfully for them to clear out of the ship. It happened much sooner than he had expected. The girl walked out on deck first. As before she did not look round. She didn't look at anything; and she seemed to be in such a hurry to get ashore that she made for the gangway and started down the ladder without waiting for the captain.|$|E
6000|$|A lot of {{accounts}} have been settled here tonight for me; I have held grudges {{against some of}} these people, but they have all been wiped out by the very handsome compliments that have been paid me. Even Wayne MacVeagh--I have had a grudge against him many years. The first time I saw Wayne MacVeagh was at a private dinner-party at Charles A. Dana's, and when I got there he was clattering along, and I {{tried to get a}} word in here and there; but you know what Wayne MacVeagh is when he is started, and I could not get in five words to his one--or one word to his five. I struggled along and struggled along, and--well, I wanted to tell and I was trying to tell a dream I had had the night before, and it was a remarkable dream, a dream worth people's while to listen to, a dream recounting Sam Jones the revivalist's reception in heaven. I was on a train, and was approaching the celestial way-station--I had a through ticket--and I noticed a man sitting alongside of me asleep, and he had his ticket in his hat. He was the remains of the Archbishop of Canterbury; I recognized him by his photograph. I had nothing against him, so I took his ticket and let him have mine. He didn't object--he wasn't in a condition to object--and presently when the train stopped at the heavenly station--well, I got off, and he went on by request--but there they all were, the angels, you know, millions of them, every one with a torch; they had arranged for a torch-light procession; they were expecting the Archbishop, and when I got off they started to raise a shout, but it didn't materialize. I don't know whether they were disappointed. I suppose <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of superstitious ideas about the Archbishop and what he should look like, and I didn't fill the bill, and I was trying to explain to Saint Peter, and was doing it in the German tongue, because I didn't want to be too explicit. Well, I found it was no use, I couldn't get along, for Wayne MacVeagh was occupying the whole place, and I said to Mr. Dana, [...] "What is the matter with that man? Who is that man with the long tongue? What's the trouble with him, that long, lank cadaver, old oil-derrick out of a job--who is that?" [...] "Well, now," [...] Mr. Dana said, [...] "you don't want to meddle with him; you had better keep quiet; just keep quiet, because that's a bad man. Talk! He was born to talk. Don't let him get out with you; he'll skin you." [...] I said, [...] "I have been skinned, skinned, and skinned for years, there is nothing left." [...] He said, [...] "Oh, you'll find there is; that man is the very seed and inspiration of that proverb which says, 'No matter how close you skin an onion, a clever man can always peel it again.'" [...] Well, I reflected and I quieted down. That would never occur to Tom Reed. He's got no discretion. Well, MacVeagh is just the same man; he hasn't changed a bit in all those years; he has been peeling Mr. Mitchell lately. That's the kind of man he is.|$|E
