5|$|The YF-23 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Supercruise requirements called for prolonged supersonic flight {{without the use of}} afterburners. Northrop drew on its experience with the B-2 Spirit and F/A-18 Hornet to reduce the model's susceptibility to radar and infrared detection. The USAF initially required the aircraft to land and stop within , which meant the use of <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the runway length requirement to , so <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> were no longer needed. This allowed the aircraft to have smaller engine nacelle housings. The nacelles were not downsized on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers.</b> This type {{is used on}} the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating a door that pivots down into the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.|$|E
50|$|According to Airbus, the {{aircraft}} was properly maintained. The most recent A Check, or maintenance check, on {{the aircraft}} was on 1 June 2006, Sibir said. A C Check, which involves {{a more thorough}} overhaul, was carried out 12 July 2005 in Frankfurt.According to the final results of the investigation, the accident was not caused by the left engine <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser's</b> non-deployment; the <b>thrust</b> reverser in question was deactivated in line with Minimum Equipment List (MEL) requirements prior to the accident.|$|R
40|$|With rapid {{development}} of new composite material and manufacturing, innovative engineering solutions are supplied to the advanced nacelle, such as integrated propulsion system(IPS), carbon-fiber composite inner skin by single-piece molding process，which offers a reduction in fuel burn and less noise produced by engines. The advanced nacelle has an O-duct thrust reverser demonstrator whose composite structure {{is in the form}} of an “O” as opposed to the traditional “D-duct”. A comparative study is to be conducted to investigate the differences between the latest O-duct and conventional D-duct in numerical approaches. To focus on the quantitative analysis of <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser’s</b> operation, this paper mainly uses CATIA/Digital Mock Up(DMU) to simulate under deployment and stowed conditions of two different thrust reverser. After comparing the structural weight, the design models of blocker door are built for kinematic analysis of relevant mechanism and simulation. The results show that simplified design and elimination of multiple interfaces generates weight saving, O-duct improves airflows within the engine, meanwhile D-duct has excellent cost effective and maintainability...|$|R

25|$|The BAe 146 is a jetliner {{specifically}} designed for short runway operations. Equipped with four Avco Lycoming ALF502R-5 geared turbofan engines, the aircraft is designed for flat landings, where the main and nose landing gears hit the runway nearly simultaneously.

25|$|The ONS 2010 Annual Business Survey {{states that}} 30.3% {{of jobs in}} the British {{aerospace}} industry are based in Lancashire. The main private employer in the county is BAE Systems Military Air & Information who have two sites east and west of Preston for the manufacture of military aircraft. Samlesbury (4000 employees) makes air-frames; the front fuselage, canards and tailfin of the Eurofighter. Warton, BAE Systems' main site (former English Electric, then BAC), in Bryning-with-Warton (6500 employees). BAE builds a Eurofighter every two weeks (takt time). Rolls-Royce make turbofan blades in Barnoldswick (950 employees). Nearby Weston EU manufacture components in Foulridge (250) and engine maintenance contractor Euravia are in Kelbrook (100). Safran Aircelle make engine nacelles and <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> in Burnley (800), and mostly make <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> for the Trent 700. GE subsidiary Unison Engine Components (320), are the largest of several others in the area.|$|E
25|$|A {{preliminary}} {{report on the}} accident was released by CIAIAC on 6 October 2008. Flight data recorders showed that the aircraft had taken off with flaps at 0°, and that the alarm for that abnormal takeoff configuration had not sounded. The report hinted at no other cause of the accident. Both the engines and <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> were excluded as causes of the accident.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory was}} that the thrust {{reverser}} of the No. 2 (right side) engine activated during the climb , since one of the <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> was seen {{to be in the}} deployed position in the wreckage. The investigation concluded that the position of the thrust reverser was a result of the accident, not a cause of it. If the reverser deployed during takeoff, and not as a result of impact, {{it has been suggested that}} the plane would have yawed suddenly to the right. Aircraft engineer Alberto Garcia dismissed this suggestion, pointing out that the MD-82 has tail-mounted engines positioned close to each other and to the plane's longitudinal axis, so that any yaw from asymmetric thrust would be small. <b>Thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> are normally employed just after touch down to reduce braking distances. Examination of the aircraft's maintenance logs showed that the thrust reverser on the right-side engine had been deactivated pending repair. It had been wired shut, and tape placed over the cockpit control to alert the crew. The MD-82 is permitted to fly with just one operable thrust reverser.|$|E
25|$|Scavengers took engine <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers,</b> cockpit avionics, {{and other}} {{components}} from the crashed 757, using Colombian military and private helicopters {{to go to}} and from the crash site. Many of the stolen components re-appeared as unapproved aircraft parts on the black market in Greater Miami parts brokers. In response, the airline published a 14-page list stating all of the parts missing from the crashed aircraft. The list included the serial numbers of all of the parts.|$|E
25|$|Design curiosities of the Tu-134 {{included}} a sharp wing sweepback of 35 degrees, compared to 25–28 degrees in its counterparts. The engines on early production Tu-134s lacked <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers,</b> {{which made the}} aircraft {{one of the few}} airliners to use a brake parachute for landing. The majority of onboard electronics operated on direct current. The lineage of early Soviet airliners could be traced directly to the Tupolev Tu-16 strategic bomber, and the Tu-134 carried over the glass nose for the navigator and the landing gear fitted with low-pressure tires to permit operation from unpaved airfields.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} engine nacelles incorporated <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> {{taken from}} the 727 outboard nacelles. They proved to be relatively ineffective and tended to lift the aircraft up off the runway when deployed. This reduced the downforce on the main wheels thereby reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} wheel brakes. In 1968, an improvement to the thrust reversal system was introduced. A 48-inch tailpipe extension was added and new, target-style, <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> were incorporated. The thrust reverser doors were set 35 degrees away from the vertical to allow the exhaust to be deflected inboard and over the wings and outboard and under the wings. The improvement became standard on all aircraft after March 1969, and a retrofit was provided for active aircraft. Boeing fixed the drag issue by introducing new longer nacelle/wing fairings, and improved the airflow over the flaps and slats. The production line also introduced an improvement to the flap system, allowing increased use during takeoff and landing. All these changes gave the aircraft a boost to payload and range, and improved short-field performance. In May 1971, after aircraft #135, all improvements, including more powerful engines and a greater fuel capacity, were incorporated into the 737-200, giving it a 15% increase in payload and range over the original -200s. This became known as the 737-200 Advanced, which became the production standard in June 1971.|$|E
25|$|On 29 August 1990, C-5A 68-0228 crashed {{following}} an engine failure shortly after take-off. The aircraft {{took off from}} Ramstein Air Base in Germany in support of Operation Desert Shield. It was flown by a nine-member reserve crew from the 68th Airlift Squadron, 433rd Airlift Wing based at Kelly AFB, Texas. As the aircraft started to climb off the runway, one of the <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> suddenly deployed. This resulted in loss of control of the aircraft and the subsequent crash. Of the 17 people on board, only four survived the crash. All four were in the rear troop compartment. The sole crew member to survive, Staff Sgt. Lorenzo Galvan, Jr., was awarded the Airman's Medal for his actions in evacuating the survivors from the wreckage.|$|E

500|$|Neither pilot aboard Flight 159 {{initially}} saw {{how close}} DAL 379 {{was to the}} runway.

[...] As the Boeing 707 passed the Delta plane, the pilots heard a loud bang which coincided with a movement of the flight controls and a yawing motion of the aircraft. Thinking he had hit the DC-9, Flight 159's first officer attempted to abort the takeoff, and both pilots attempted to use their aircraft's <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers,</b> brakes, and spoilers to stop the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The enquiry report {{submitted}} by the Civil Aviation Ministry said that Glušica slept for over 90 minutes during the flight. The Air India Express IX 812 [...] carrying 166 people from Dubai including the crew, crashed while negotiating a tricky landing at Mangalore city's [...] "table-top" [...] airport overlooking a ravine. The American National Transportation Safety Board says {{it was the first}} instance of snoring recorded on a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). Analysis of the accident revealed that had the pilot [...] "deployed détente reverse thrust and applied maximum manual braking at touchdown", the aircraft could have been stopped within the paved overrun area of the runway.

The engine's <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> direct engine exhaust air upwards and forward, reducing the chances of foreign object damage by ingestion of runway debris, and providing enough reverse thrust to back the aircraft up on the ground while taxiing. The <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> can also be used in flight at idle-reverse for added drag in maximum-rate descents.

2500|$|The Lauda {{aircraft}} was traveling {{at a high}} speed when the <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> deployed, causing the pilots to lose control of the aircraft. James R.

A thrust reverser deploying in flight {{might not have been}} survivable, anyway. But a thorough test would have informed the FAA and Boeing that <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> deploying in midair was such a dangerous occurrence that Boeing needed to install a positive lock that would prevent such an event." [...] As a result of their findings during the investigation process of Lauda Flight 004, additional safety features such as mechanical positive locks were mandated to prevent thrust reverser deployment in flight.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main problem}} facing the Il-86 project {{was the lack}} of a {{suitable}} engine. It was never resolved. By the close of the 1960s, the USA and the UK had turbofans with bypass ratios of 4 or 5 to 1. The first Soviet large turbofan, the Lotarev D-18T, did not appear before the mid-1980s. The Soloviev D-30, originally intended for the Il-86, was the most advanced Soviet civil aeroengine. It had a bypass ratio of 2.4 to 1 and aerodynamic clamshell <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers.</b> It failed to attain the required thrust, however: [...] "only after the lapse of three years that were spent on preparing the advanced development project did it become clear that these engines would not provide the necessary take-off performance." [...] The less-advanced Kuznetsov NK-8 series engine, adopted on March 26, 1975, had a bypass ratio of 1.15 to 1 and drag-inducing grilles over its cascade <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers.</b> Both these engines had high specific fuel consumptions and were noisy. Being ultimate developments of smaller engines, they could not offer growth to future Il-86s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{touched down}} on the wet runway at [...] over the target airspeed. Furthermore, it touched down [...] from the runway threshold, [...] beyond the 1000–1500ft range established by the Southwest Airlines FOM.

2500|$|As {{evidence}} {{started to}} point towards the <b>thrust</b> <b>reversers</b> {{as the cause}} of the accident, simulator flights were made at Gatwick Airport which appeared to show that deployment of a thrust reverser was a survivable incident. Lauda said that the thrust reverser could not be the sole cause of the crash.
