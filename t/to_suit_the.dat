5|$|Armies facing {{service in}} {{different}} theatres may need several different camouflage uniforms. Separate issues of temperate/jungle and desert camouflage uniforms are common. Patterns can {{to some extent}} be adapted to different terrains by adding means of fastening pieces of vegetation to the uniform.

Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> <b>the</b> local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, most of Mayfair {{was built}} on with prestigious housing <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> <b>the</b> upper class; unlike some nearby areas of London, it has never lost its {{affluent}} status. The decline of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century led to Mayfair becoming more commercial instead of residential, with many former homes converted into offices for major corporate headquarters, embassies and other businesses. There remains a substantial quantity of luxury residential property, upmarket shops and restaurants, and modern hotels along Piccadilly and Park Lane in particular. Mayfair's prestigious status has been commemorated by being the most expensive property square on the London Monopoly board.|$|E

He achieved this in part by creating an eponymous trust whereby some of his Irish property {{was used for the}} purpose of financing the education of children and provided scholarships for the most promising of those to continue their studies at Trinity College, Dublin. However, there have been claims that this trust was intended primarily to protect his interests in land, of which some was obtained by dubious interpretation of law.|$|E
5|$|Gediminas' origins are unclear, {{but recent}} {{research}} suggests that Skalmantas, an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and {{could be considered the}} dynasty's founder. Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages <b>to</b> <b>suit</b> <b>the</b> goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.|$|E

Most of the fuel burned outrather than spilling into the soil, so the impact on surrounding land and the water table was limited.|$|E

Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy live loads, such as large amounts of heavy files that tenants had on their floors.|$|E
