However, {{while it may}} be possible for wild specimens <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>that</b> long, they are thought to have shorter lifespans in general due to the threats of predation, habitat loss, disease, and other biological and environmental factors.|$|E
25|$|Mass-production of memorabilia {{copies of}} artworks {{commissions}} {{for the tournament}} demonstrated {{that it was not}} only upper-class Britain that took notice. Tories eyed antique armour and dreamed of courtly love, and Queen Victoria twice noted in her diary that she had discussed the tournament with Lord Melbourne and although her view was that the event would be a foolish amusement, the choice of the Duchess of Somerset as Queen of Beauty was to her liking. With only two months <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>that</b> tragic figure, Lady Flora Hastings, wrote in 1839 to her mother {{on the subject of the}} upcoming Eglinton Tournament, expressing her concern that one of the knights might be killed in the violent sport.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy hosts {{a long-running}} quiz show called What Do Kids Know? and is dying of cancer; {{he has only}} a few months <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> <b>That</b> night the newest child prodigy on the show, Stanley Spector, takes the lead as the show begins. He is hounded by his father for the prize money and demeaned by the {{surrounding}} adults, who refuse to let him use the bathroom during a commercial break. When the show resumes, he wets himself and freezes, humiliated when everyone realizes what happened. As the show continues an inebriated Jimmy sickens, and he orders the show to go on after he collapses onstage. But after Stanley's father berates him for freezing on air, Stanley refuses to return for the final round.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, {{and the band}} stayed at the Sunset Marquis Hotel during the sessions. [...] Nimrod took four months to record; Armstrong partially attributed the lengthy recording time to spending [...] "a little too much time" [...] playing pool and foosball during the sessions. [...] The recording schedule, which lasted from noon to {{two in the morning}} every day, became frustrating for the group members, who began drinking heavily. [...] Bassist Mike Dirnt recalled, [...] "One night one of us was walking down the halls knocking on people's doors while naked." [...] Another incident involved drummer Tre Cool throwing his hotel room television set out of his window. [...] Armstrong noted, [...] "There was a lot of glass. [...] You have <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>that</b> arrogant lifestyle every now and then." [...] To keep the band focused, Cavallo enlisted his father and manager Pat Magnarella to supervise the group.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson {{felt that it}} served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. [...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>that</b> I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, {{on the edge of my}} seat. And the appearance of the caped figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was as dramatic as could be." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1875, the English trader Thomas Keam escorted Hopi {{leaders to}} meet President Chester A. Arthur in Washington D.C. Loololma, village chief of Oraibi at the time, was very {{impressed}} with Washington. As he concluded that education allowed the whites <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>that</b> way, he returned wanting a formal school to be built for Hopi children. [...] In 1886, twenty Hopi leaders signed a petition sent to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs requesting that a school be built on their land. [...] In 1887, a federal boarding school was established at Keams Canyon for Hopi children.|$|E

[...] Fondane noted that Rodion, with his [...] "painfully Romanian style of writing" [...] at a time when Zionism was still [...] "vague", could only opt in favor of erasing his own Jewish identity.

We continue to strive for lasting peace and security for the people of Israel, including through our commitment to the goal of two states living side-by-side in peace and security."

2500|$|According to {{orthodox}} classical revolutionary Marxism, profits {{can only}} arise from surplus labor, and therefore, {{it is argued}} that the direct source of all capitalist profits is the exploitation of wage labor. This principle is often called the [...] "Fundamental Marxist Theorem" [...] by mathematical Marxists: a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of positive profits is that surplus value is positive. It is an interpretation which certainly makes sense {{from the point of view}} of Capital, Volume I where Marx assumed, for the sake of argument and for the sake of simplicity, that the prices at which the inputs and outputs of capitalist production are traded are equal to their value. In Capital, Volume I, Marx aimed to show, that even if all commodities were fairly traded on the basis of equal exchange, exploitation could nevertheless occur within capitalist production, and that if more value did not come out of production than went into it, it would be impossible to explain economic growth. The reason was simply that workers together could produce much more value than they needed themselves <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> <b>That</b> was, according to Marx, exactly the reason why the owners of capital hired those workers.|$|E

Six years later, Rucker signed to Capitol Nashville as a country music singer, releasing the album, Learn <b>to</b> <b>Live</b> <b>that</b> year. Its first single, [...] "Don't Think I Don't Think About It", made him the first black artist to reach {{number one on the}} Hot Country Songs charts since Charley Pride in 1983. (Ray Charles hit number one in March 1985 in a duet with Willie Nelson with Seven Spanish Angels). It was followed by two more number one singles, [...] "It Won't Be Like This for Long" [...] and [...] "Alright" [...] and the number three, [...] "History in the Making." [...] In 2009, he became the first black American to win the New Artist Award from the Country Music Association, and only the second black person to win any award from the association. A second album, Charleston, SC 1966, was released on October 12, 2010. The album includes the number one singles, [...] "Come Back Song" [...] and [...] "This".|$|E
