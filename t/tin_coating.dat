However, it could be alloyed with lead and copper to make pewter or alloyed with copper alone to produce bronze. Today's tinplate is mild steel electroplated with tin.

In order to apply <b>TiN</b> film <b>coating</b> for dental implant, pure Ti and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy were fabricated and then surface of manufactured alloy was <b>coated</b> with <b>TiN</b> film using arc ion plating. The electrochemical behaviors of <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> dental implant fixture were investigated using various electrochemical methods. The surface morphology of <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> fixture showed lower roughness than that of non <b>coated</b> fixture. <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> layer showed the columnar structure.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Physics, İzmir, 2007 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 58 - 62) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishx, 62 leavesWettability, {{defined as}} the ability of any solid surface to be wetted when in contact with a liquid, {{is one of the}} most important properties of biomaterials since highly wettable surfaces are expected to disclose better adhesion of the cells. The wettability characteristics of a biomaterial. s surface can be improved by surface modification techniques. In this study, wettability characteristics of <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> CoCrMo orthopedic alloy materials were investigated. CoCrMo alloys were <b>coated</b> with <b>TiN</b> using physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique at 550 C for 6 h. The <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> layer microstructure,roughness, thickness, and composition were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Wetting studies involved contact angle and surface tension measurements using distilled water and simulated body fluid (SBF) as test liquids. The contact angles of the coated and uncoated CoCrMo alloys were investigated by the sessile drop method and the surface tension of the test liquids was measured by the ring method. The XRD results show the PVD <b>coated</b> <b>TiN</b> films had (111) preferred orientation, while the SEM analysis indicated quite uniform <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> layers (about 3 m thick) with a columnar growth mode. The AFM results indicated much higher roughness values for the <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> surfaces compared to the uncoated ones. The experimental results show the contact angle values for the <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> samples is lower than the uncoated ones suggesting better wetting for the coated layer. Based on the contact angle and the surface tension values, the work of adhesion values were estimated and it was found that the <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> layers has better adhesion ability compared to the uncoated CoCrMo alloy. The lower contact angles for the <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> samples were attributed mainly to the rougher surfaces associated with the <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> surfaces in comparison with the relatively smooth surface of the uncoated samples. Also, based on the EDX analysis results, the surface oxygen content on the coated surface may be another factor contributing to the better wettability characteristics of the <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> CoCrMo alloy compared to the uncoated alloy...|$|R

By contrast, with a traditional tin can, the opposite of a protective effect occurs: because the tin is more noble than the underlying steel, when the <b>tin</b> <b>coating</b> is broken, the steel beneath is immediately attacked preferentially.|$|E

Various cutting speeds, up to an increase of 40 % of the tool manufacturer‘s recommended speed were investigated. Thirty cuts (passes) were carried out for each inserts at the speeds investigated. After every five cuts (passes), microscopic pictures of the tool wear profiles were taken in order to monitor the progressive wear on the rake face and, on the flank of the insert. The power load was monitored for each cut using an on board meter on the machine. Results obtained confirmed advantages of cutting at all speeds investigated using EDMed coated inserts in terms of reduced tool wear.

40|$|Background/purpose: Although {{the effect}} of {{experimental}} surface modifications on various properties (e. g., fatigue, wear) on coated files have been tested in the past, there is no report for the coating quality of commercially available <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> files. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the surface and cross section of <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> endodontic files. Materials and methods: <b>TiN</b> <b>coated</b> nickel–titanium endodontic files (EasyShape) were surface and cross-sectionally analyzed via scanning electron microscopy backscattered electron imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis in spot, area, and line scan modes. Results: Surface imaging revealed parallel oblong regions with higher mean atomic contrast, a finding attributed to increased Ni content. Cross-sectional analysis showed that the coating’s average total thickness was 0. 31  μm and consisted of a thin layered film. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed the presence of Ti, Ni, N, and O in the coating, whereas only Ni and Ti were identified in the bulk of the file. Ti and O showed their peak compositions at the bulk/coating and coating/surface interfaces, respectively, whereas N displayed a rather constant content within the coated region. The N and O contents started increasing inner to the coating/bulk interface, denoting possible diffusion of both elements to the subcoating region. Conclusion: Surface and bulk characterization showed no uncoated areas of the files tested. Apart from Ti, Ni, and N, oxygen was also identified within the coating region...|$|R
