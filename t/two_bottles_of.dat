5|$|Baccano! is a 2007 anime series {{directed}} by Takahiro Omori and produced by Brain's Base and Aniplex. The 16 episodes are {{adapted from the}} light novels {{of the same name}} written by Ryohgo Narita and illustrated by Katsumi Enami. Told in out-of-order sequences, the story spans three consecutive years of Prohibition-era America during which three seemingly unconnected events occur: <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> immortality elixir are passed around Manhattan by gangsters believing it is alcohol, a supposed monster massacres members of two gangs attempting to hijack the transcontinental train Flying Pussyfoot, and a man is tracked down by his sister and a gang. The first thirteen episodes aired in Japan from July 26, 2007 to November 1, 2007 on WOWOW, a Japanese pay-per-view station, and the final three were released direct-to-DVD. The series made its North American television debut when it started airing on the Funimation Channel after the channel transitioned to HD in September 2010.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1943, in {{preparation}} for the Battle of Kursk, Hitler visited the Eastern Front at Smolensk. Originally the plan was for certain officers to shoot Hitler collectively at a signal given in the officers' mess during lunch. However, that plan was cast aside. Instead a second plan devised by General Henning von Tresckow's Nazi resistance group was carried out. Upon leaving, staff officer Heinz Brandt, who was traveling in Hitler's entourage, agreed to take a box containing <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> cognac to Colonel Helmuth Stieff who was stationed at Hitler's headquarters. The package was given to Brandt by Tresckow. The cognac bottles were actually a bomb placed into a casing, with a timer fuse. The plane took off with both Hitler and Brandt on board, but it arrived safely at the Wolf's Lair field headquarters in East Prussia. The bomb most likely failed to detonate because the extremely low temperatures in the unheated luggage compartment of the plane prevented the fuse from operating properly.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E

25|$|Poor Sir Ed, {{who is a}} quiz of {{the first}} magnitude, and who I believe had not given a dinner for twenty years before, was all bustle and anxiety during {{the whole of the}} entertainment.

25|$|A month later, he {{returned}} and asked Connolly {{if he was}} still interested in doing business. Connolly said yes, but {{that he would not be}} able to sell him any as he had gotten some bottles of P2P elsewhere and was busy making another batch. Three days later, Shapiro returned with a search warrant. Among other items, he seized <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> P2P, one an empty 500-g container, the other a partially full 100-g one (not the one he had originally given them).

25|$|In 2001, {{while serving}} his prison sentence, Sajal Barui {{showed signs of}} an alleged kidney ailment and was {{transferred}} to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital for examination. On 15 September 2001 he escaped from the hospital and was at large until early 2003. On the night of his escape, Sajal Barui hosted a beer party to which he invited the two police constables that had been put on guard to watch him. He often offered beer to the constables after it had been smuggled in by his girlfriend, so they did not suspect his motives. On that night, however, he spiked the <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> beer with sleeping pills and watched them fall asleep. He then {{walked out of the}} hospital unhindered.|$|E

500|$|In {{one scene}} of the episode, Homer sprays <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> lighter fluid onto his grill, causing viewers to {{anticipate}} an explosion when Homer throws a match on it. When he does release the match, however, the grill barely ignites. A similar scene appears in an older episode of The Simpsons, [...] "Treehouse of Horror", although in that episode, Homer uses a single bottle of lighter fluid and causes an explosion. Mirkin enjoyed the joke enough to reuse parts of it in [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", adding new twists to further enhance the comedic effect. The old sketches from [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] were used to help the animators animate the scene.|$|E
500|$|After {{the war he}} went up to St John's College, Cambridge, {{to study}} {{theology}} and was subsequently ordained as an Anglican priest in 1953. He realised that he had lost his faith and made an error in his career; he later admitted that during one sermon, [...] "I didn't believe a word I was saying". He was released from the church in 1958 and took up a position as a drama critic with the Stratford-upon-Avon Herald. It was whilst at the Heraldâ€”aged 33â€”that Gardner realised he was an alcoholic, drinking <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> gin a day. He overcame his addiction and produced his first book as part of his therapy: the autobiographical Spin the Bottle, published in 1964. Critic and scholar John Sutherland says that of all the books Gardner published, [...] "it's the one that most deserves to survive." ...|$|E
500|$|Exteriors {{were later}} {{directed}} by Griffith and Welles over two successive weekends, with $279 worth of rented equipment. Griffith and Welles paid {{a group of}} children five cents apiece to run out of a subway tunnel. They were also able to persuade winos to appear as extras for ten cents apiece. [...] "The winos would get together, two or three of them, and buy pints of wine for themselves! We also had a couple of the winos act as ramrodsâ€”sort of like production assistantsâ€”and put them in charge of the other wino extras." [...] Griffith and Welles also persuaded a funeral home to donate a hearse and coffinâ€”with a real corpse insideâ€”for the film shoot. Griffith and Welles were able to use the nearby Southern Pacific Transportation Company yard for an entire evening using <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> scotch as persuasion. The scene in which a character portrayed by Robert Coogan is run over by a train was accomplished by persuading the railroad crew to back the locomotive away from the actor. The shot was later printed in reverse. Griffith and Welles spent a total of $1,100 on fifteen minutes worth of exteriors.|$|E

5|$|Fur-bearing trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland.

Another theory says that it is due to four jugs - or <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> - <b>of</b> hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.|$|R
500|$|It {{is unclear}} when Kujau {{produced}} his first Hitler diary. Stiefel says Kujau {{gave him a}} diary on loan in 1975. Schulze puts the date as 1976, while Kujau says he began in 1978, after a month's practice writing in the old German gothic script Hitler had used. Kujau used one of a pile of notebooks he had bought cheaply in East Berlin, and attempted to put the letters [...] "AH" [...] in gold on the frontâ€”purchasing plastic, Hong Kong-made letters from a department store, he inadvertently used [...] "FH" [...] rather than [...] "AH". He took the black ribbon from a genuine SS document, and attached it to the cover using a German army wax seal. For the ink he bought <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> Pelikan inkâ€”one black, one blueâ€”and mixed them with water so it would flow more easily from the cheap modern pen he used. Finally he sprinkled tea over the pages and bashed the diaries against his desk {{to give them an}} aged look. Kujau showed the first volume to Stiefel, who was impressed and thought it a genuine Hitler diary; Stiefel wanted to buy it, but when the forger refused, the pair agreed that the collector could have it on loan.|$|E
500|$|The Marines, {{especially}} Latham, taught Reckless battlefield {{survival skills}} such as how not to become entangled in barbed wire and to lie down when under fire. She learned to run for a bunker upon hearing the cry, [...] "incoming!" [...] The platoon called it her [...] "hoof training" [...] and [...] "hoof camp". The horse was initially kept in a pasture near the encampment. Reckless had a gentle disposition and soon developed such a rapport with the troops that she was allowed to freely roam about the camp and entered tents at will, sometimes sleeping inside with the troops, and even lying down next to Latham's warm tent stove on cold nights. She was fond {{of a wide variety}} of foodstuffs, entertaining the platoon by eating scrambled eggs and drinking Coca-Cola and beer. Food could not be left unattended around her. She was known to eat bacon, buttered toast, chocolate bars, hard candy, shredded wheat, peanut butter sandwiches and mashed potatoes. However, Mitchell advised the platoon that she not be given more than <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> Coke a day. [...] Her tastes were not confined to foodstuffs; she once ate her horse blanket, and on another occasion ate $30 worth of Latham's winning poker chips.|$|E
500|$|Five {{bungalows}} {{were originally}} {{added to the}} gardens in 1915 to provide for families who could return each year with their own staff. [...] As of 2015, the hotel has 23 bungalows set out across the gardens. Bungalows 14-21 are known as [...] "Bachelor's Row", due to their association with film stars and their affairs, including Warren Beatty and Orson Welles. In 1990, a private pool and Jacuzzi were added to Bungalow No. 5 to accommodate businessman Walter Annenberg. No.5 had been a favorite of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton who had [...] "a standing room service order for <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> vodka at breakfast, and two more at lunch". [...] Taylor also liked No.3, where she stayed during her marriage to Eddie Fisher. Marilyn Monroe favored No. 1 and No. 7. [...] No.1, the most secluded of the bungalows, features an interior described by CNN as [...] "creamy, lush and traditional, decorated {{in the manner of}} one's wealthy grandparents". No. 7 has become known as [...] "the [...] "Norma Jean". Dietrich ordered a [...] by [...] bed added to No. 10, the bungalow where John Lennon and Yoko Ono stayed in the 1970s.

500|$|According to {{the author}} Raymond Benson, Moonraker is a deeper and more introspective book than Fleming's {{previous}} work, which allows the author to develop the characters further. As such, Bond [...] "becomes something more than... cardboard figure" [...] {{that he had been}} in the previous two novels. The start of the book concentrates on Bond at home and his daily routines, which Fleming describes as [...] "Elastic office hours from around ten until six,... evenings spent playing cards in the company of a few close friends,... or making love, with rather cold passion, to one of three similarly disposed married women." [...] This lifestyle was largely modelled on Fleming's own, which the journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees as showing [...] "a sourness" [...] in the author's character. According to Chancellor, two of Bond's other vices were also displayed in the book: his fondness for gamblingâ€”illegal except in private members clubs in 1955â€”and excessive drink and drug taking, neither of which were frowned upon in post-war upper class circles. In preparation for beating Drax at cards, Bond consumes a vodka martini, a carafe of vodka shared with M, <b>two</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>of</b> champagne and a brandy; he also mixes a quantity of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, into a glass of the champagne. According to The Times journalist and historian Ben Macintyre, to Fleming the alcohol consumption [...] "meant relaxation, ritual and reliability". Benzedrine was regularly taken by troops during the war to remain awake and alert, and Fleming was an occasional consumer.|$|E
500|$|Burke met {{two women}} in early April: Mary Paterson (also known as Mary Mitchell) and Janet Brown, in the Canongate area of Edinburgh. He bought the two women alcohol before {{inviting}} them back to his lodging for breakfast.

After his brother left for work, Burke and the women finished the whisky and Paterson fell asleep at the table; Burke and Brown continued talking but were interrupted by McDougal, who accused them of having an affair. A row broke out between Burke and McDougalâ€”during which he threw a glass at her, cutting her over the eyeâ€”Brown stated {{that she did not}} know Burke was married and left; McDougal also left, and went to fetch Hare and his wife. They arrived shortly afterwards and the two men locked their wives out of the room, then murdered Paterson in her sleep. That afternoon the pair took the body to Knox in a tea-chest, while McDougal kept Paterson's skirt and petticoats; they were paid Â£8 for the corpse, which was still warm when they delivered it. Fergussonâ€”one of Knox's assistantsâ€”asked where they had obtained the body, as he thought he recognised her. Burke explained that the girl had drunk herself to death, and they had purchased it [...] "from an old woman in the Canongate". Knox was delighted with the corpse, and stored it in whisky for three months before dissecting it. When Brown later searched for her friend, she was told that she had left for Glasgow with a travelling salesman.|$|E
