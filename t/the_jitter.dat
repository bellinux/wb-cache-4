30|$|The results {{listed above}} {{can be used}} for {{computing}} <b>the</b> tracking <b>jitter.</b> <b>The</b> tracking <b>jitter</b> {{is one of the most}} used metrics for determining the quality of estimates produced by tracking loops. More specifically, <b>the</b> tracking <b>jitter</b> quantifies <b>the</b> residual amount of noise present in the final loop estimate, in this case the code delay [17]. <b>The</b> tracking <b>jitter</b> is directly proportional to the standard deviation of the tracking error defined as the difference between true and estimated tracking parameters.

40|$|Bang-bang {{phase-locked loops}} (BBPLLs) are hard {{nonlinear}} systems {{due to the}} nonlinearity introduced by the binary phase detector (BPD). In <b>the</b> presence of <b>jitter,</b> <b>the</b> nonlinear loop is typically analyzed by linearizing the BPD and applying linear transfer functions in the analysis. In contrast to a linear PD, the linearized gain of a BPD depends on <b>the</b> rms <b>jitter</b> and <b>the</b> type of <b>jitter</b> (either non-accumulative or accumulative). Previous works considered the case of nonaccumulative reference clock jitter and showed that the BPD gain is inversely proportional to <b>the</b> rms <b>jitter</b> when <b>the</b> latter is small or large. In this brief we {{consider the case of}} accumulative DCO jitter and derive an asymptotic closed-form expression for the BPD gain which becomes exact in the limit of small and large <b>jitter.</b> Contrary to <b>the</b> reference clock <b>jitter</b> case, <b>the</b> BPD gain is constant for small DCO jitter and is inversely proportional to <b>the</b> square of <b>jitter</b> for large DCO jitter; in the latter case, <b>the</b> timing <b>jitter</b> has a normal-Laplace distribution...|$|R

50|$|In {{the above}} inequalities, a single {{parameter}}, J, {{is used to}} account for jitter. This parameter must be an upper bound for the difference in jitter over all source register/destination register pairs. However, if {{the structure of the}} clock distribution network is known, different source register/destination register pairs may have different jitter parameters, and a different jitter value may be used for the hold constraint in contrast to the value for the setup constraint. For example, if the source register and destination register receive their clock signals from a common nearby clock buffer, <b>the</b> <b>jitter</b> bound for that hold constraint can be very small, since any variation in that clock signal will affect the two registers equally. For the same example, <b>the</b> <b>jitter</b> bound for the setup constraint must be larger than for the hold constraint, because jitter can vary from clock tick to clock tick. If the source register receives its clock signal from a leaf buffer of the clock distribution network that is far removed from the leaf buffer feeding the destination register, then <b>the</b> <b>jitter</b> bound will have to be larger to account for the different clock paths to the two registers, which may have different noise sources coupling into them.|$|E

40|$|Bang-bang {{phase-locked loops}} (BBPLLs) are {{inherently}} nonlinear systems {{due to the}} binary phase detector (BPD). While they are typically used for clock and data recovery, the ongoing trend toward digital loop implementations has resulted in several digital BBPLLs (DBBPLLs) suitable for frequency synthesis. This brief investigates the effect of nonaccumulative reference clock jitter (due to white phase noise) in second-order DBBPLLs, comparing <b>the</b> output <b>jitter</b> with that of first-order DBBPLLs. For small clock <b>jitter,</b> <b>the</b> nonlinear loop behavior is modeled as a two-dimensional Markov chain, and <b>the</b> output <b>jitter</b> is smaller than but close {{to that of a}} first order loop. For large clock <b>jitter,</b> <b>the</b> BPD nonlinearity is linearized, and <b>the</b> output <b>jitter</b> is larger than that of a first order loop; it is proportional to clock jitter and inversely proportional to the square root of the stability factor—the ratio of the proportional path gain to the integral-path gain of the digital loop filter...|$|R
