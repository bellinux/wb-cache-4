40|$|Monte Carlo {{methods are}} {{frequently}} used for neutron and radiation transport. These methods have several advantages, such as relative ease of programming {{and dealing with}} complex meshes. Disadvantages include long run times and statistical noise.

40|$|To induce <b>transport,</b> <b>detailed</b> balance must be broken. A common {{mechanism}} is to bias the dynamics with a thermodynamic fuel, such as chemical energy. An intriguing, alternative strategy {{is for a}} Maxwell demon to effect the bias using feedback. We demonstrate that these two different mechanisms lead to distinct thermodynamics by contrasting a chemical motor and information motor with identical dynamics. To clarify this difference, we study both models within one unified framework, highlighting {{the role of the}} interaction between the demon and the motor. This analysis elucidates the manner in which information is incorporated into a physical system. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, new conclusion, added supplemental materia...|$|R

We argue that conventional exciton transport models give about {{an order of magnitude}} shorter estimates for the exciton propagation length which suggest that there are other possible explanations of the experimental results.
