5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{recession}} which began in 1893, and which continued through 1896, ruined many Americans. Contemporary estimates were an unemployment rate as high as 25%. The task of relieving the jobless fell to churches and other charities, as well as <b>to</b> <b>labor</b> unions. Farmers went bankrupt; their farms were sold to pay their debts. Some of the impoverished died of disease or starvation; others killed themselves.|$|E

5|$|Although Kennan {{regarded}} the Soviet Union as {{too weak to}} risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western Europe, which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and <b>to</b> <b>labor</b> unions in Western Europe in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned <b>to</b> <b>labor</b> in state-owned mines. Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry mines in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and sent them to the mines of Palestine. On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E

40|$|Using a small open {{economic}} model, I {{investigate the}} effects of changes in unskilled foreign workers' accessibility <b>to</b> the <b>labor</b> market on their inflow into a small open economy and their participation <b>to</b> the <b>labor</b> market. I assume that legal and illegal unskilled foreign workers move between a small open economy {{and the rest of}} the world due to difference in real-consumption wages (nominal wages divided by the consumer price index). However, even if unskilled foreign workers migrate to a small open economy, only a few of them can enter the labor market because of the impediments to unskilled foreign workers participation <b>to</b> the <b>labor</b> market. I show that the inflow of unskilled foreign workers into a small open economy depends on their accessibility <b>to</b> the <b>labor</b> market and it becomes smaller as unskilled foreign workers have more access <b>to</b> the <b>labor</b> market. I also show that the policy authority's utility increases (decreases) as unskilled foreign workers have more access <b>to</b> the <b>labor</b> market, if the ratio of legal unskilled foreign workers is high (low) and unskilled foreign workers' accessibility <b>to</b> the <b>labor</b> market is low (high) ...|$|R

5|$|During British Mandate rule in Palestine, al-Birwa {{was home}} to local power brokers, who {{mediated}} disputes in neighboring villages. Al-Birwa became a center of rebel operations during the 1936–1939 revolt against British rule. By the 1940s, many of the village's agrarian inhabitants lost their lands due to debt, and shifted <b>to</b> <b>labor</b> jobs in nearby cities, such as Haifa. However, {{the majority of the}} residents—men and women—continued to engage in farming, selling their olives, grains and other crops in the markets of Acre. Al-Birwa was captured by the Israelis in early June 1948, after which its local militia recaptured the village. Al-Birwa was then permanently occupied by the Israelis in late June. Afterward, its inhabitants, including future Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, fled to nearby villages or Lebanon. The Jewish communities of Yas'ur and Ahihud were established on al-Birwa's lands in 1949 and 1950, respectively.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>labor,</b> the ACLU {{also led}} efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools. The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York {{public schools in}} 1921. The ACLU, working with the NAACP, also supported racial discrimination cases. The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923. There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not {{make an effort to}} defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, government search and seizure issues, right to privacy, or wiretapping.|$|E
50|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Australian Democrats, the Greens vote has continued to grow.

5|$|In the 1973 state election, the LM largely ran a {{separate}} campaign from the LCL as a whole. The {{majority of the}} LCL's metropolitan candidates were also within the LM, and {{it was hoped that}} enough seats would be gained so that not only would the LCL return to power, but that the LM would be able to overpower the conservative faction in the House of Assembly and re-elect Hall as leader. To do this, they needed to capture at least three marginal Labor seats in Adelaide. This also meant the conservatives in the LCL would be better off losing <b>to</b> <b>Labor</b> if they wanted to maintain their hold on the party, as Labor's vulnerable seats were in all in the city, and a Labor loss meant a LM gain. The LCL campaign chairperson explicitly said that she would prefer losing if it meant keeping control of the party. While the LM ran an innovative campaign, the LCL itself faltered, losing support in the country to {{a separate}} Country Party and <b>to</b> <b>Labor</b> in metropolitan Adelaide. One LM seat held by a rural member was lost to the Country Party. The LM were branded by the LCL conservatives as being the reason behind the LCL's defeat. The LM saw itself as a more modern and appropriate alternative to the LCL, more in tune with urban mainstream, but {{there was no evidence that}} urban LM candidates were more popular than conservative LCL candidates in Adelaide. LM members made up the majority of urban LCL candidates, but were unable to wrest any Labor seats in Adelaide.|$|E
5|$|Patton was {{regarded}} as more moderate than most coal operators in his relationship <b>to</b> <b>labor</b> unions. Most of his mine workers were not unionized, {{and those who were}} generally belonged to the Southern Labor Union rather than the more confrontational United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Members of the UMWA local at Shelby Gap maintained that Patton was arrested for clipping a striking miner on a picket line with his pickup truck in the late 1970s. Local law enforcement officials claim no recollection of the incident, and there is no record of an arrest warrant against Patton or an actual arrest.|$|E
5|$|Playford {{went into}} the 1965 {{election}} confident that he would build upon his previous result. Labor was continuing its practice of concentrating on individual seats: this time the effort was invested in the electorates of Barossa and Glenelg. In Barossa, northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate; in Glenelg, a younger generation of professionals and their families were settling. On election day, 6 March, both seats fell <b>to</b> <b>Labor</b> with substantial swings. The LCL lost power {{for the first time}} in 35 years. In seats that were contested by both parties, Labor led on the primary vote with 52.7 to 43.3%. Playford stayed up on the night to see the result, and conceded defeat at midnight. He appeared calm when announcing the loss to the public, but wept when he told his family of it. Playford had been premier for 26 years and 126 days.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after taking}} the leadership, Whitlam reorganised the ALP caucus, {{assigning}} portfolios and turning the Labor frontbench into a shadow cabinet. While the Liberal-Country Coalition had a huge majority in the House of Representatives, Whitlam energised the party by campaigning intensively to win two by-elections in 1967: first in Corio in Victoria, and later that year in Capricornia (Queensland). The November half-Senate election saw a moderate swing <b>to</b> <b>Labor</b> and against the Coalition, compared with the general election the previous year. These federal victories, in which both Whitlam and Holt campaigned, helped give Whitlam the leverage he needed to carry out party reforms.|$|E
5|$|The LCL had governed, {{primarily}} {{under the}} stead of Sir Thomas Playford, for 32 years, and finally lost <b>to</b> <b>Labor</b> in 1965. A {{year and a}} half later, when Playford retired, Steele Hall was elected to replace him. A young farmer from a rural constituency, Hall had never conflicted with the party line, and was expected to uphold the existing LCL principles, having spoken out in support of the Playmander and the restrictive Legislative Council before. However, when the LCL was returned to office in 1968 under his leadership, with the help of malapportionment, Hall was under pressure. Labor had led the LCL 52.0 to 43.8% on primary votes, but owing to the Playmander, both ended with 19 seats and an independent supported the LCL and returned them to power. Large protests against the Playmander broke out, and there were strong calls for reform.|$|E

Dozens of streetcars were vandalized, some were completely destroyed, the overhead electric cables that powered the cars were cut, and passengers were threatened to not to ride the cars.
