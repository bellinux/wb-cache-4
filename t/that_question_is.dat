500|$|One {{film critic}} {{described}} the numerous influences: [...] "From his infelicitous name to his physical clumsiness, Norville Barnes is a Preston Sturges hero {{trapped in a}} Frank Capra story, and never should that twain meet, especially not {{in a world that}} seems to have been created by Fritz Lang – the mechanistic monstrousness of the mailroom contrasted with the Bauhaus gigantism of the corporate offices perfectly matches the boss-labour split in Metropolis (1927)." [...] An interviewer proposed that the characters represent capitalism versus labour economics. Joel Coen replied: [...] "Maybe the characters do embody those grand themes you mentioned, but <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> independent of whether or not we're interested in them – and we're not." [...] The Hudsucker Proxy presents various narrative motifs pertaining to the Rota Fortunae and visual motifs concerning the shape of circles. This includes Moses' monologue at the beginning, the Hudsucker Clock, Mussburger's wristwatch, the inventions of both the hula hoop and frisbee, as well as Norville and Amy's conversation about Karma.|$|E

2500|$|Kirk adamantly opposed libertarian ideas, {{which he}} saw {{as a threat to}} true conservatism. In Libertarians: the Chirping Sectaries Kirk wrote that the only thing libertarians and conservatives have in common is a detestation of collectivism. [...] "What else do conservatives and libertarians profess in common? The answer to <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> simple: nothing. Nor will they ever have.".|$|E

2500|$|Anderson is [...] With her English {{accent and}} background, she was mocked and felt {{out of place}} as a {{teenager}} in the American Midwest and soon adopted a Midwestern accent. To this day, she easily shifts between her American and English accents. In May 2013, during an interview with BlogTalkRadio, Anderson addressed the matter of her national identity: [...] "I've been asked whether I feel more like a Brit than an American and I don't know what the answer to <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is.</b> I know that I feel that London is home and I'm very happy with that as my home. I love London as a city and I feel very comfortable there. In terms of identity, I'm still a bit baffled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Derek Chavis of the Baltimore Sun {{gave the}} episode a more {{negative}} review, saying [...] "While {{it seems the}} productions of each number are getting bigger, the show’s spirit gets smaller. Does Ryan Murphy think that because American Horror Story is amazing he can slack off on Glee? I hope not. It was officially announced recently that Glee will end after next season (Season 6) so let’s end this show as great as we started it, shall we?" [...] Lauren Hoffman of Vulture gave the episode a 2 out of 5, signaling mixed to negative reviews, saying [...] "The main problem with last night’s episode is that “Are you a Katy or a Gaga?” isn’t a particularly interesting question. I’m not even sure what <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> asking. Lady Gaga and Katy Perry certainly aren’t the same , but they’re not exactly polar opposites." [...] Despite negative reviews of the episode's theme, she did comment positively on Adam Lambert's role, calling his audition [...] "undeniably great." ...|$|E
2500|$|The contestants {{must first}} play a {{preliminary}} round, called [...] "Fastest Finger First" [...] (or, in the U.S. version, simply [...] "Fastest Finger"), {{where they are}} all given a question and four answers from the host and are asked to put those four answers into a particular order; in the first series of the British version and in pre-2003 episodes of the Australian version, the round instead required the contestants to answer one multiple-choice question correctly as quickly as possible. The contestant who does so correctly and in the fastest time goes on to play the main game for the maximum possible prize (often a million units of the local currency). In the event that two or more contestants are tied for the fastest time, those contestants play another question to break the tie. If no one gets the question right, <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> discarded and another question is played in the same manner. If any contestants are visually impaired, the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music begins.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are these}} four ways of {{answering}} questions. Which four?

2500|$|The Labour Party came {{to power}} in 1997 with a {{manifesto}} saying, [...] "We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote animal welfare, including a free vote in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned." [...] A new private member's bill, introduced by Michael Foster MP, received a second reading with 411 MPs voting in support, but failed due to lack of parliamentary time. The Burns Report in 2000 concluded that forms of fox hunting [...] "seriously compromise the welfare of the fox", but (in line with its remit) did not draw any conclusion on whether hunting should be banned or should continue. In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, Lord Burns also stated that [...] "Naturally, people ask whether we were implying that hunting is cruel... The short answer to <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area." [...] Following the Burns inquiry, the Government introduced an 'options bill' which allowed each House of Parliament to choose between a ban, licensed hunting, and self-regulation. The House of Commons voted for a banning bill and the House of Lords for self-regulation. The 2001 general election was then called and the bill ran out of parliamentary time.|$|E

60|$|<b>That</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{only one}} of a long list that they asked me about art and literature.

60|$|We {{are in a}} civil war. In {{such cases}} there always is a main {{question}}, {{but in this case}} <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> a perplexing compound--Union and slavery.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, three “what is” <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> {{split into}} ten new questions.

The “behavior” annotation was not suitable for <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> split into only two ones.|$|R
