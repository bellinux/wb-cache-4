The code is a three character code stamped in a pad just above the starter flange. This transmission was available in several gear ratios for different engines and vehicles, so it's important to get a transmission with the same code or another code know to be the same gear ratios. If the gear ratios are not the same the <b>transmission</b> <b>controller</b> will assume the transmission is slipping and go into fail safe mode.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{areas of}} failure on this {{transmission}} include damage to plastic internals due to fluid over-temperature conditions, internal fluid pressure leaks from torn piston diaphragms, worn piston bores for solenoids in aluminum valve body, {{and the resulting}} worn clutches and bands. Occasionally, the plastic speedometer drive gear will break and fall off of the differential carrier and the speedometer will stop working. To repair this, the transmission must be removed and the differential disassembled far enough to replace the plastic gear. With age, the resistance in the wiring and/or electrical terminals between the valve body and <b>transmission</b> <b>controller</b> can increase. The additional resistance may prevent the computer from reading the faint pulses from the transmission speed sensors. Any missing sensor signal causes the transmission to go to [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "limp" [...] mode. This mode keeps the transmission in Third gear and the gear indicator in the instrument panel indicates all gears are selected simultaneously.|$|E

50|$|Children's ITV went to air on Monday 3 January 1983, between 4 pm and 5.15 pm each weekday afternoon, {{the extra}} fifteen minutes being filled by {{a repeat of}} one of the pre-school {{programmes}} shown at lunchtime the same day. Initially featuring a different presenter each month (usually from children's television), the links were pre-recorded in advance in a small studio at a London facility called Molinare, using a single locked-off camera. The first set design was a rocket ship and was used for the first few months. The concept was eventually retired, and the set and style of presentation used began to reflect the artist presenting that month or the programme that he/she fronted. By 1984, the links were still being recorded, but using a common, stylized set known as Network Control. The exterior of this fictitious location also featured in the animations and stings. Technical considerations often left the system flawed. With each programme coming from a different playout source (usually from that of the originating ITV company), and each link being pre-recorded (played out by Central), things often went wrong on air: programmes would be rolled early and the links would be cut short. Programmes would also fail to appear and the presenter would be left on screen. Because each link was recorded for the slot available, the presenter would hold the final pose for a few moments so that the <b>transmission</b> <b>controller</b> at Central had something to leave on screen just in case. Pre-recording the links also meant that late schedule changes could not be easily referenced.|$|E

40|$|QoS-guaranteed fuzzy <b>transmission</b> <b>controller</b> for dynamic TDMA {{protocol}} in {{multimedia communication}} systems F. -C. Ren, C. -J. Chang and R. -G. Cheng Abstract: The paper proposes a QoS-guaranteed fuzzy <b>transmission</b> <b>controller</b> (FTC) for the dynamic TDMA protocol in multimedia communication systems. The dynamic TDMA protocol adopts a mini-slot technique for reducing contention cost, and the mini-slots are further partitioned into multiple MAC regions that users can access with their respective quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The FTC mainly contains a Sugeno self-tuning fuzzy MAC threshold controller and a fuzzy access controller. The former applies a position-gradient-type reasoning method to properly determine the MAC regions; the latter employs max-min inference fuzzy logic {{to determine the}} access probabilities of users for enhancing dynamic TDMA efficiency under the QoS constraint. Simulation {{results show that the}} dynamic TDMA protocol with FTC can always guarantee the QoS requirement of real-time packet loss probability, regardless of the non-real-time traffic loads. Furthermore. it achieves higher system utilisation and less non-real-time packet delay compared to previously proposed PRMA, IPRMA and FRMA protocols. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{transmission}} {{systems of}} tomorrow must incorporate advanced {{hardware and software}} technologies to increase safe utilization of existing facilities to increase reliable long-distance power transfer. However, while hardware technologies can provide the muscle for improved transmission system capabilities, software technologies are also needed to provide the intelligence to use these hardware technologies safely, securely, and effectively. To prevent system failures, future transmission systems must incorporate a combination of advanced hardware and software technologies to increase the safe utilization of existing facilities to increase reliable longdistance power transfer. Improvements are also needed in system-wide monitoring and distributed computer-based control to determine and react to system conditions quickly. Technologies such as these can protect the grid not only against traditional threats to reliability (such as storms and other natural events), but also against deliberate disruptions. Employing robust <b>transmission</b> <b>controllers</b> effectively requires a close development relationship between power electronics engineers and computer scientists such that the hardware development, algorithm development, system assessment, and software development are coordinated to ensure optimal performance.

40|$|Abstract- In today’s {{electric}} power system, {{solid state power}} electronics technology plays more and more important roles {{and the demand for}} mega-watt level power ratings is increasing. The development of mega-watt power converters strongly depends on the state-of-the-art of power semiconductor technology. The Emitter Turn-off Thyristor (ETO) is a new emerging high power semiconductor switch which combines the advantages of Gate Turn-off Thyristor’s (GTO) high voltage and current capability and MOS easy gate control. Its superior control characteristics combined with its high speed, wider RBSOA, higher controllable maximum current, forward current saturation capability, its on-device current sensing and low cost make the ET 0 the most promising power device in high power, smart control applications. Future, ETO switches under development will also pack with additional features that no-competing technologies offer, including built-in voltage, current and temperature sensing capability, control-power self-generation capability and high-voltage current saturation capability. These capabilities make ETO a very promising power semiconductor device to reduce the cost of converter-based <b>transmission</b> <b>controllers</b> while improving the controller output power, dynamic performance, and operating reliability...|$|R

Each gear pair is supported by bearings on the shaft to ensure {{that at least one}} gear of the pair can rotate around the shaft without restriction. Originally, all the gear pairs of n-ratio are mounted together with the fake mating state. It means that, at first, all the gear pairs mounted on the transmission shaft can rotate around the shaft with no restriction yielding the support of the rotational bearings. In application, the proper transmission ratio I close to the ratio of the most-used speed to the most desirable speed with an arbitrary case of propulsion can be matched by the <b>transmission</b> <b>controller.</b> If the ratio interval of the n-ratio automatic transmission is relatively narrow, the effect will be relative well.|$|E

40|$|We address throughput/energy aware {{opportunistic}} {{transmission control}} in broadcast networks, under incomplete channel state information. The channels are modeled as i. i. d two-state Markov chains and the <b>transmission</b> <b>controller</b> makes transmit/idle {{decisions based on}} past 1 -bit feedback from the broadcast users. With a reward structure that captures the trade-off between sum throughput gain (transmit) and energy savings (idle), we formulate the transmission control problem as an infinite horizon, discounted reward, partially observable Markov decision process. For special cases of the system parameters, we show that the optimal control policy is either greedy or partially greedy. For the general case, we follow an indirect approach towards the control problem. We first establish thresholdability properties of the optimal control policy in a two-user broadcast. We then extrapolate these properties to the general broadcast and propose a simple threshold control policy. Extensive numerical results suggest near-optimal performance of the proposed policy. In addition, the proposed threshold policy is easy to implement with complexity being polynomial {{in the number of}} broadcast users...|$|E
