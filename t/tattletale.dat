[...] "He couldn't have found out about me himself; he isn't smart enough. It must be that someone has told him. And nobody knows that I have been over there but Sammy Jay. It must be he {{who has been the}} <b>tattletale.</b> I think I'll visit Paddy by {{daylight}} tomorrow, and then we'll see!" ...|$|E
60|$|Now Sammy {{had flown}} {{down to the}} green Meadows to tell Old Man Coyote how Paddy was doing all his work on land in the daytime. But when Old Man Coyote began to call him a <b>tattletale</b> and accuse him of having warned Paddy, and to {{threaten}} dreadful things, he straightway forgot all his anger at Paddy and turned it all on Old Man Coyote. He called him everything he could think of, {{and this was a}} great deal, for Sammy has a wicked tongue. When he hadn't any breath left, he flew over to the Green Forest, and there he hid where he could watch all that was going on.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the trouble}} with some smart people {{is that they are}} never able to believe that others may be as smart as they. Old Man Coyote didn't know that {{the first time he had}} visited Paddy's pond he had left behind him a {{footprint}} in a little patch of soft mud. If he had known it, he wouldn't have believed that Paddy would be smart enough to guess what that footprint meant. So Old Man coyote laid all the blame at the door of Sammy Jay, and that very morning, when Sammy came flying over the Green Meadows, Old Man Coyote accused him of being a <b>tattletale</b> and threatened the most dreadful things to Sammy if ever he caught him.|$|E
