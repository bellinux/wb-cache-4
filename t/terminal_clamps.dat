40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{description}} of an induction machine principles {{for both of}} motor and generator operations. Then is been described {{a special kind of}} an induction generator working into an isolated system. The construction of an induction generator was designed with two stator winding connection due to possibility of the variable number of pole pairs. Also there is an excitation capacity design for self-excitation. Last part of this work contains the measurement of an induction generator with different values of excitation capacity and both <b>terminal</b> <b>clamps</b> connection...|$|E
50|$|The Euroblock is a {{solderless}} connector {{that uses}} screw <b>terminals</b> to <b>clamp</b> connecting wires. Once the wires are installed, the entire assembly is plugged into a matching socket {{in the electronic}} device. Euroblocks are more convenient than the terminal strips they replace as the signal cables can be quickly disconnected from or connected to the electronic device, rather than unscrewing and re-screwing each wire individually.|$|R
50|$|However, {{with the}} {{clamping}} plate type of screw terminal {{this time is}} reduced, since it is necessary only to insert the stripped wire between the terminal and the rear clamping plate then tighten the connection, using the screw to clamp the wire between the <b>terminal</b> and the <b>clamping</b> plate, without any need properly to wrap it around the screw head.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Poma's grips, Doppelmayr grips are double {{position}} grips. When {{the chair}} enters a terminal, the angled roller is pushed {{down by a}} metal strip, which opens a grip jaw. The jaw remains open until the chair reattaches to the cable upon departing the <b>terminal.</b> Grip <b>clamping</b> force is measured {{just prior to the}} double position grips reattaching to the haul rope while a carrier (chair) is exiting the terminal, in contrast to Poma's grips, in which grip force can be measured as the grip travels through the contour. Insufficient grip force triggers an alarm and brings the lift to a halt before the carrier reaches the first breakover tower after the terminal. Because of this design, most Doppelmayr detachable lifts are designed to allow operation in reverse. This allows a grip force-alarmed grip and carrier to be backed into the terminal for inspection or removal.|$|R
5000|$|Dickinson and Purich {{recognized}} that prompt ATP hydrolysis {{could explain the}} forces achieved during actin-based motility. [...] They proposed a simple mechanoenzymatic sequence known as the Lock, Load & Fire Model, in which an end-tracking protein remains tightly bound ("locked" [...] or clamped) onto {{the end of one}} sub-filament of the double-stranded actin filament. After binding to Glycyl-Prolyl-Prolyl-Prolyl-Prolyl-Prolyl-registers on tracker proteins, Profilin-ATP-actin is delivered ("loaded") to the unclamped end of the other sub-filament, whereupon ATP within the already <b>clamped</b> <b>terminal</b> subunit of the other subfragment is hydrolyzed ("fired"), providing the energy needed to release that arm of the end-tracker, which then can bind another Profilin-ATP-actin to begin a new monomer-addition round.|$|R
40|$|The {{isolated}} chick ciliary neuron calyx synapse preparation {{was used}} to test cysteine string protein (CSP) action on presynaptic N-type Ca 2 + channels. Endogenous CSP was localized primarily to secretory vesicle clusters in the presynaptic nerve terminal. Introduction of recombinant CSP into the voltage <b>clamped</b> <b>terminal</b> resulted in a prominent increase in Ca 2 + current amplitude. However, this increase could not be attributed to a change in Ca 2 + channel kinetics, voltage dependence, prepulse inactivation, or G protein inhibition but was attributed to the recruitment of dormant channels. Secretory vesicle associated endogenous CSP may {{play an important role in}} enhancing Ca 2 + channel activity at the transmitter release site...|$|R
40|$|ATP has {{recently}} {{been identified as a}} fast neurotransmitter in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Several studies have suggested that ATP can also affect the release of classical neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine with which it is co-released. We have searched for ATP receptors on a cholinergic presynaptic nerve terminal using the calyx-type synapse of the chicken ciliary ganglion. ATP was pulsed onto the <b>terminals</b> under voltage <b>clamp</b> and induced a short latency cation current that exhibited inward rectification and marked desensitization. This current was not seen with adenosine but was mimicked by several sterically restricted ATP analogs and was blocked by suramin. ATP-activated single ion channels exhibited prominent flickering and had a conductance of approximately 17 pS. Our results demonstrate a ligand-gated P 2 X-like purinergic receptor on a cholinergic presynaptic nerve terminal...|$|R
40|$|The calcium {{current of}} a ‘giant’ {{synaptic}} terminal (the calyx of Held) was studied using two-electrode voltage clamp in slices {{of the rat}} brainstem. In terminals with a long axon (length > 100 μm), the passive current transient decayed bi-exponentially following voltage steps. In terminals with a short axon (length < 30 μm), the slow component was reduced or absent. These terminals also had small slow calcium tail currents following long depolarizing voltage steps, suggesting that these are largely due to axonal calcium channels. <b>Terminals</b> were voltage <b>clamped</b> with action potential waveform commands. At both 24 and 36 °C the calcium current began shortly after {{the peak of the}} action potential and ended before the terminal was fully repolarized. The calcium current during the repolarization phase was 69 ± 1 % (n = 3) of maximal, judged from the increase in this current when a plateau phase was added to the action potential waveform. A Hodgkin-Huxley m 2 model, based on the measured activation and deactivation of the calcium current, reproduced both the time course and the amplitude increase of the calcium currents during the different action potential waveforms well. The fast gating of the calcium channels in the terminal ensures that they are effectively opened during the repolarization phase of an action potential. This implies that the distance between open calcium channels is minimized, which is in agreement with the view that multiple calcium channels are needed to release a vesicle in this synapse...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} direct electrophysiological recordings from Drosophila peptidergic synaptic boutons in situ, {{taking advantage of}} a mutation, ecdysone, which causes an increase in size of these <b>terminals.</b> Using patch- <b>clamp</b> techniques, we have analyzed voltage-dependent potassium currents at the macroscopic and single-channel level. The synaptic membrane contained at least two distinct voltage-activated potassium currents with different kinetics and voltage sensitivity: an I(A) -like current with fast activation and inactivation kinetics and voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation; a complex delayed current that includes a slowly inactivating component, resembling the I(K) described in other preparations; and a non-inactivating component. The I(A) -like current in these peptidergic boutons is not encoded by the gene Shaker, because it is not affected by null mutations at this locus. Rather, synaptic I(A) has properties {{similar to those of the}} Shal- encoded I(A). Single-channel recordings revealed the presence in synaptic membranes of three different potassium channel types (A 2, K(D), K(L)), with biophysical properties that could account for the macroscopic currents and resemble those of the Shal, Shab, and Shaw channels described in heterologous expression systems and Drosophila neuronal somata. A 2 channels (6 - 9 pS) have brief open times, and like the macroscopic I(A) they exhibited voltage- dependent steady-state inactivation and a rapidly inactivating ensemble average current profile. K(D) channels (13 - 16 pS) had longer open times, activate and inactivate with much slower kinetics, and may account for the slowly inactivating component of the macroscopic current. K(L) (44 - 54 pS) channels produced a noninactivating ensemble average and may contribute to the delayed macroscopic current observed. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
