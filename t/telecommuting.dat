This text may be printed {{and placed in the}} patient's record and/or retained only in its electronic format. Medical transcription can be performed by MTs who are employees in a hospital or who work at home as <b>telecommuting</b> employees for the hospital; by MTs working as <b>telecommuting</b> employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work offsite under contract to a hospital, clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for the providers of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or <b>telecommuting</b> as employees or contractors. Hospital facilities often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their database gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of allergies, and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate healthcare delivery regardless of geographical distance or location.|$|E

50|$|Remote office {{centers are}} usually located in close {{proximity}} to where people live; they are generally distributed throughout suburban and near-suburban locations.

25|$|In the United States, {{suburban}} infrastructure evolved {{during an}} age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels, {{which has led to}} transportation-dependent systems of living. Zoning reforms that allow greater urban density as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation. The use of <b>telecommuting</b> by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy, as many Americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day.|$|E
25|$|More {{comprehensive}} mitigations include better {{land use}} planning through smart growth to {{reduce the need for}} private transportation, increased capacity and use of mass transit, vanpooling and carpooling, bus rapid transit, <b>telecommuting,</b> and human-powered transport from current levels. Rationing and driving bans are also forms of reducing private transportation. The higher oil prices of 2007 and 2008 caused United States drivers to begin driving less in 2007 and to a much greater extent {{in the first three months}} of 2008.|$|E

Virtual volunteering is also known as cyber service, telementoring, and teletutoring, as well as various other names.

25|$|<b>Telecommuting</b> is the {{performance}} within a traditional worker and employer relationship {{when it is}} facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, videoconferencing, and voice over IP (VOIP) so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home. It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As broadband Internet connections become commonplace, more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal communication networks.|$|E

Although all operations, sales support and marketing and the bulk of employees are located in the headquarters in Atlanta, Kenny declined to move there, and continues to live and work from his home in Boston, visiting Atlanta once or twice per quarter. This is counter to general company policy which discourages <b>telecommuting</b> for the majority of employees. Later in 2012, The Weather Channel's holding company changed its name from The Weather Channel Companies to The Weather Company. The company also purchased competing weather service and website Weather Underground the same year.

40|$|This study {{uses the}} 20 th cycle of Statistics Canada 2 ̆ 7 s General Social Survey {{to explain why}} some recent, working elder-caregivers modify {{participation}} in paid labour, using findings to propose and evaluate policy options designed to keep elder-caregivers as engaged {{as possible in the}} labour force. Regression analysis of 18 variables reveals (1) intense elder-caregiving activity, (2) added elder-caregiving expenses, and (3) not having access to flexible workplace arrangements corresponds to reduced work hours. Four proposed policy options proposed to counter work-hour reduction are evaluated according to five criteria including: effectiveness, equity, cost to government, stakeholder acceptability and administrative complexity. Options include the status quo, a non-refundable tax credit for employers permitting working eldercaregivers to <b>telecommute</b> or work a condensed workweek; expanding the Compassionate Care Benefit criteria; and, expanding the current Caregiver Tax Credit criteria. Policy analysis suggests the Federal government offer a non-refundable tax credit to employers permitting working eldercaregivers to <b>telecommute</b> or work a condensed workweek and expand the Compassionate Care Benefit eligibility criteria...|$|R
50|$|Sales {{engineers}} {{may spend}} 20% to 70% {{of their time}} traveling, and they may work a flexible schedule due {{to the needs of}} the sales organization they support. Most sales engineers <b>telecommute</b> or spend a limited amount of time in the office.

2500|$|<b>Telecommuting</b> {{is another}} way {{organizations}} can help reduce stress for their workers. Employees defined <b>telecommuting</b> as [...] "an alternative work arrangement in which employees perform tasks elsewhere that are normally done in a primary or central workplace, {{for at least some}} portion of their work schedule, using electronic media to interact with others inside and outside the organization." [...] One reason that <b>telecommuting</b> gets such high marks is that it allows employees more control over how they do their work. Telecommuters reported more job satisfaction and less desire to find a new job. Employees that worked from home also had less stress, improved work/life balance and higher performance rating by their managers.|$|E
2500|$|For individuals, <b>telecommuting</b> {{provides}} {{alternatives to}} daily commuting and long-distance air travel for business. Technologies for <b>telecommuting,</b> such as videoconferencing, e-mail, and corporate wikis, continue to improve, {{in keeping with}} the overall improvement in information technologies ascribed to Moore's law. As the cost of moving human workers continues to rise, while the cost of moving information electronically continues to fall, presumably market forces should cause more people to substitute virtual travel for physical travel. Matthew Simmons explicitly calls for [...] "liberating the workforce" [...] by changing the corporate mindset from paying people to show up physically to work every day, to paying them instead for the work they do, from any location. This would allow many more information workers to work from home either part-time or full-time, or from satellite offices or Internet cafes near to where they live, freeing them from long daily commutes to central offices. However, even full adoption of <b>telecommuting</b> by all eligible workers might only decrease energy consumption by about 1% (with present energy savings estimated at 0.01–0.04%). By comparison, a 20% increase in automobile fuel economy would save 5.4%.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that automobiles could be powered by the following forms of energy: 60% by grid electricity, 20% by biofuels, and 20% by direct solar.

5000|$|In 2005, {{the median}} home price reached $100,000 {{for the first}} time ever, over a 40% {{increase}} since 2000.

40|$|AbstractThere {{are strong}} {{interactions}} between energy consumption at home, in the office, {{and in the}} traffic system. For example, workers can <b>telecommute,</b> saving the energy {{at the office and}} in the transport system, {{but on the other hand}} increasing energy consumption at home. As an alternative measure, making working hours less flexible and thus forcing everybody to be at the workplace at the same time reduces the energy consumption of the office building. Both measures in addition have traffic congestion consequences. This paper discusses these policies based on a simple analytical model as well as based on a simulation model which includes a sophisticated simulation of the transport system...|$|R
