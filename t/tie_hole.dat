50|$|All {{support systems}} {{have to be}} height {{adjustable}} to allow the formwork to be placed at the correct height and to be removed after the concrete is cured. Normally adjustable metal props similar to (or the same as) those used by beam slab formwork are used to support these systems. Some systems combine stringers and supports into steel or aluminum trusses. Yet other systems use metal frame shoring towers, which the decks are attached to. Another common method is to attach the formwork decks to previously cast walls or columns,thus eradicating the use of vertical props altogether. In this method, adjustable support shoes are bolted through <b>holes</b> (sometimes <b>tie</b> <b>holes)</b> or attached to cast anchors.|$|R

50|$|The matches {{culminated in}} one of the single most {{dramatic}} putts in the history of golf. With only one match remaining to be completed, between Hale Irwin for the United States and Bernhard Langer for the Europeans, the United States team led by one point. Irwin and Langer came to the last <b>hole</b> <b>tied.</b> To win the cup, the American team needed Irwin to win or tie the match by winning or <b>tying</b> the <b>hole.</b> The Europeans could keep the cup with a win by Langer. Both players struggled on the hole, and found themselves facing a pair of putts; Langer had a six-foot, side-hill par putt, and Irwin had a generally uphill, 18-inch putt for bogey. To the surprise of his teammates, Langer conceded Irwin's bogey putt, leaving himself in a must-make position. Langer missed his putt, the match was halved, and the U.S. team took back the cup.|$|R

50|$|In the playoff, Von Elm and Burke {{were still}} <b>tied</b> after 36 <b>holes,</b> with Von Elm making a birdie on the 36th to extend it. In the era prior to sudden-death, 36-hole playoffs were {{required}} to break ties, so another was held the following day.|$|R

40|$|In August, 1999, two {{separate}} incidences of "unusual" cracking were found by routine liquid penetrant non destructive inspection in F 111 engine (TF 30) titanium alloy compressor discs in quick succession. Cracking {{occurred in the}} <b>tie</b> rod <b>holes</b> of the discs which had never previously been reported. Due to the potentially serious consequences of in-flight failure of engine compressor discs, the fleet was grounded until the nature and significance of the cracking was determined. The cracks were forced fractured and subjected to fractographic analysis, the information from which providing the "key" in determining the cause and significance of the cracking {{and the likelihood of}} fleetwide implications. The analysis was interesting due to the unusual aspect ratio of one of the cracks, and the presence of cadmium which it was thought may have been significant in the incidence of cracking. Fractography and metallography was also used to aid {{in the development of a}} suitably sensitive eddy current non destructive inspection technique for specific inspection of <b>tie</b> rod <b>holes</b> in compressor discs during future overhauls. This paper will describe the circumstances of the incidences of cracking, the safety concerns, the details of fractographic analysis, and the development of the eddy current procedure...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} common methods for {{settling}} ties is by means of a playoff, whereby those players who have tied for the lead replay a set number of <b>holes.</b> If still <b>tied</b> after those <b>holes</b> then further sudden death holes may also be played until a winner emerges.|$|R
50|$|The {{winner of}} each match scores a point for their team, with ½ a point each for any match that is <b>tied</b> after 18 <b>holes.</b> The {{winner of the}} Fightmaster Cup will be the {{association}} who scores the most points following the twenty-four matches over the three days.|$|R

50|$|In match play, each hole is won by {{the team}} whose member has the lowest score on that hole, and that team is awarded a point for the hole. If the teams <b>tie</b> for a <b>hole,</b> the point for the hole is divided between the teams. At {{the end of the}} match, the team with the most points wins.|$|R
50|$|The {{competition}} involves various {{match play}} matches between players {{selected from the}} two teams of 8, either singles and foursomes.

50|$|The format {{was similar}} to that later used for the 2017 ISPS Handa World Super 6 Perth. There were 54 holes of stroke-play over three days with a cut being made at the top-50 and <b>ties</b> after 36 <b>holes.</b> After 54 holes, the field was reduced again to a fixed 32. Ties for 32nd place were {{determined}} by a sudden-death playoff.|$|R
50|$|The {{strength}} in North's game was putting, {{and he needed}} only 114 putts over 72 <b>holes,</b> <b>tying</b> the record set by Billy Casper in 1966.

50|$|The {{competition}} involves various {{match play}} matches between players {{selected from the}} two teams of 8, either singles, foursomes, or (starting in 2008) fourball.

5000|$|The {{amount of}} the bet is established—often $2 or $5 -- for each nine with a third bet for the overall 18-hole match. Points are {{calculated}} by scoring each hole as a separate match. The player with the lowest score on a hole wins a point. If the scores <b>tie</b> for a <b>hole,</b> {{this results in a}} [...] "push," [...] or no points won or lost.|$|R
3000|$|The {{idea behind}} this {{operationalization}} is that higher ranked brokers {{play a more}} important role in building global bridges, given the modular structure of the network and our choice to use modules as the group partition. A node playing the liaison role, for instance, bridges more structural holes at the mesolevel (i.e. it creates ties across communities) than a node playing a coordinating role (i.e. where <b>ties</b> span <b>holes</b> that are internal to the same community). Gatekeepers are lower ranked than representatives because we assume {{them to have a}} more passive role in information exchange - although arguably this depends on the actual dynamics of communication.

5000|$|... 1982: Ron Streck {{comes to}} the 72nd <b>hole</b> <b>tied</b> with Lanny Wadkins but three putts to {{seemingly}} lose by one shot. After play is finished, Streck is assessed a two-shot penalty for moving a tree branch in his face on the 70th hole. The penalty drops Streck into a four-way tie for second along with Andy Bean, David Graham, and Craig Stadler and costs him over $14,000 in prize money.|$|R
