5|$|From 1936, NSB took {{delivery}} of Class 65 multiple units, replacing El 1 {{as the primary}} hauler on the electrified commuter rail network. Class 65 were the first that were optimized for local traffic, with wide doors and turnable seats. NSB took {{delivery of}} 49 units until 1952, although they were also used outside the commuter rail network. The Østfold Line was upgraded to double track and put into service in four sections: from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924, from OsloØ to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929, from Ljan to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and from Kolbotn to Ski on 14 May 1939. The Østfold Line was also <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line</b> to be electrified, which opened in sections between 1936 and 1940. NSB took into use El 8 locomotives on the line.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1944 General Sir Harold Alexander, {{commanding}} the Allied Armies in Italy, launched Operation Diadem, which finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line and forced the Tenth Army to withdraw. In the process, a gap opened up between the Tenth and Fourteenth Armies, threatening both with encirclement. For this failure, Kesselring relieved von Mackensen of his command, replacing him with General der Panzertruppe Joachim Lemelsen. Fortunately for the Germans, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, obsessed with the capture of Rome, failed {{to take advantage of}} the situation and the Tenth Army was able to withdraw to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line</b> of defence, the Trasimene Line, where it was able to link up with the Fourteenth Army and then conduct a fighting withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|In total, {{during the}} {{operation}} approximately 4,000 men {{and more than}} 600tons of equipment and supplies were dropped by the Americans at Sukchon and Sunchon on 20 October and the days that followed, including twelve 105mm howitzers, 39 jeeps, 38 1/4-ton trailers, four 90mm antiaircraft guns, four 3/4-ton trucks, as well as ammunition, fuel, water, rations, and other supplies. Although sound in concept, the operation may have had more chance of success had a complete airborne division been employed. The following morning US 1/187 RCT captured the high ground north of Sukchon and established a blocking position on the main highway running north. However, strong North Korean rearguard forces held <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line</b> of hills to the north. While at Sunchon, American troops from US 2/187 RCT had heard reports {{that a number of}} American prisoners had been murdered nearby by their North Korean captors as the KPA retreated. It became apparent that the train carrying the prisoners north from Pyongyang had halted in a railway tunnel on the 20th to conceal itself as US 187 RCT jumped into the area, and that while there, many of the men aboard had been shot by the North Korean soldiers guarding them as they waited for their evening meal. Sixty-six bodies were later recovered, {{as well as those of}} seven more who were found to have died of disease or malnutrition. Twenty-three starving and emaciated American survivors were found nearby; however, many were badly wounded and two later died. The American paratroopers were subsequently ordered to return to Pyongyang.|$|E

25|$|All X# {{executive}} code {{should be}} placed in functions defined by the 'function' keyword. Unlike C, X# does not support any formal parameter declaration in the header of the functions, so the conventional parentheses after the function name are omitted.

25|$|Also nonbreaking hyphen, {{non-breaking hyphen}} and {{no-break}} hyphen. This character looks {{identical to the}} regular hyphen, but it is treated as a letter by word processors, namely that the hyphenated word will not be divided at the hyphen should this fall at {{what would be the}} end of a line of text; instead, the whole hyphenated word either will remain in full at the end of the line or will go in full to the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line.</b> The non-breaking space exists for similar reasons.|$|E

25|$|In poetic layout, parashah {{divisions}} are typically indicated by a blank line {{for an open}} parashah. The gaps {{in the middle of}} lines are not considered parashah divisions, and each scribe formatted the verses as he saw fit for aesthetic and practical reasons. An exception to this rule, however, is for the introductory titles of many individual psalms which are followed by formal parashah breaks, often by continuing the text at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line.</b> These formal breaks will be indicated in the list of parashot for Psalms.|$|E
25|$|If it {{is desired}} to save memory, the storage {{can be reduced}} to one array plus 3 line buffers. One line buffer is used to {{calculate}} the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line.</b> The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a toroidal array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell model}} {{was able to}} qualitatively explain many of the mysterious {{properties}} of atoms which became codified in the late 19th century in the periodic table of the elements.

Atoms tend to get smaller toward the right in the periodic table, and become much larger at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line</b> of the table. Atoms {{to the right of the}} table tend to gain electrons, while atoms to the left tend to lose them. Every element on the last column of the table is chemically inert (noble gas).|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{hyphenation}} based on pronunciation, foreign compounds may be hyphenated at their boundary, if the prefix or suffix is widely recognized, e.g. fotog-ráfia (by syllables) or foto-gráfia (by elements). The elements are also {{taken into consideration}} in compound names (e.g. Pálffy , hyphenated as Pál-ffy, rather than *Pálf-fy). Sometimes different ways of hyphenation reflect different words (e.g. me-gint ‘again,’ a single word hyphenated by syllables, cf. meg-int ‘admonish,’ a compound with a verbal prefix, hyphenated by elements). Hyphens {{are not to be}} repeated at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line,</b> except in specialized textbooks, as a way of warning for the correct form.|$|E
25|$|Matrices {{released}} from the magazine, and spacebands {{released from}} the spaceband box, drop down into the assembler. This is a rail that holds the matrices and spacebands, with a jaw on the left end set to the desired line width. When the operator judges that the line is close enough to full, he raises the casting lever {{on the bottom of}} the keyboard to send the line to the casting section of the linotype machine. The remaining processing for that line is automatic; as soon as the finished line has been transferred to the casting section, the operator can begin composing <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line</b> of text.|$|E
25|$|The 105-day war had a {{profound}} and depressing effect in Finland. Useful international support was minimal, arrived late, and the German blockade prevented most armament shipments. At {{the end of the}} war, the situation of the Finnish army on the Karelian Isthmus had been the subject of some debate. The orders were already given to prepare a retreat to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>line</b> of defence in the Taipale sector. The estimates of how long the enemy could have been held in these kinds of retreat-and-stand operations varied from a few days to a couple of months, most averaging around a few weeks.
