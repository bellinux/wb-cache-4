5|$|A manga adaptation, {{illustrated}} by Yukiko Sumiyoshi and titled Tomoyo After: Dear Shining Memories, was serialized in Fujimi Shobo's shōnen manga magazine Dragon Age Pure between April 20 and October 20, 2007. The story {{is based on}} the visual novel version <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>it,</b> though instead of the story being told from Tomoya's point of view, the manga is told from Tomoyo's perspective. A single tankōbon volume was released in Japan on December 8, 2007 containing four chapters.|$|E

The Cayuga County section of former NY31B was transferred to the county one year later on April1, 1981, and designated as CR31B for the state route <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|An Air manga was {{serialized}} in the Japanese {{computer game}} magazine Comptiq between August 10, 2004 and February 10, 2006. The individual chapters were later collected into two separate volumes published by Kadokawa Shoten. The story {{was adapted from}} the visual novel version <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>it,</b> and was illustrated by Japanese artist Yukimaru Katsura. Between the two volumes, there are 15 main chapters (nine in volume one and six in volume two), and two bonus chapters included {{at the end of}} each volume. The manga version goes through the Dream and Air arcs in detail while the Summer arc is only touched upon briefly throughout the manga. The main focus is on Misuzu's story with Kano and Minagi serving as minor characters in comparison. However, Minagi's story is explained in the bonus installment at the end of volume two.|$|E

Horrillo fell more than , and nearly {{died as a result}} of his injuries. After spending five weeks in hospitals in both Italy and his native Spain, Horrillo eventually recovered, though the day on the Culmine di San Pietro was his last as a professional cyclist, as he retired before the 2010 season began.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{changes to the}} ethnic {{composition}} of Slavonian counties occurred between censuses conducted in 1991 and 2001. The 1991 census recorded a heterogenous population consisting mostly of Croats and Serbs—at 72 percent and 17 {{percent of the total}} population respectively. The Croatian War of Independence, and the ethnic fracturing of Yugoslavia <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>it,</b> caused an exodus of the Croat population followed by an exodus of Serbs. The return of refugees since the end of hostilities is not complete—a majority of Croat refugees returned, while fewer Serbs did. In addition, ethnic Croats moved to Slavonia from Bosnia and Herzegovina and from Serbia.|$|E

5|$|When Oppenheimer reorganized the {{laboratory}} in August 1944 {{to focus on}} the development of an implosion-type nuclear weapon, Wilson became head of R (Research) Division. As such he had four groups reporting to him: the Cyclotron Group (R-1), still headed by himself; the Electrostatic Group (R-2), headed by John H. Williams; the D-D (Deuterium-Deuterium) Group (R-3), headed by John H. Manley; and the Radioactivity Group (R-4), headed by Emilio G. Segrè. In March 1945, R Division acquired the additional responsibility of developing instrumentation for the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. Wilson helped stack boxes of explosives for the 100-ton test <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>it.</b> At Los Alamos, he was also active in community affairs, serving on the town council.|$|E
5|$|Although written {{during the}} Twelfth dynasty, Ipuwer only survives from a Nineteenth dynasty papyrus. However, A {{man and his}} Ba is found on an {{original}} Twelfth dynasty papyrus, Papyrus Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, although they are unique in that the fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of dialogue. In Ipuwer, a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing the miserable state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either {{as a warning to}} kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>it.</b> In A man and his Ba, a man recounts for an audience a conversation with his ba (a component of the Egyptian soul) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.|$|E
5|$|Schmittou {{and team}} owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to {{purchase}} the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association, with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. In order {{to prove to the}} team's Nashville banks, which would back the purchase, that the move was financially viable, Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a Double-A team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision, the banks were not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation. The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team instead. Schmittou wanted to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, a combination of the league's disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team became the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried {{on the history of the}} Double-A team <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>it.</b> The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the Stars were established as an entirely-new franchise.|$|E

5|$|The decisive {{victory of}} the Ethiopian Empire over the Kingdom of Italy in the 1896 Battle of Adwa, during the First Italo-Ethiopian War, made a {{profound}} impact on the historiography of Italy and Ethiopia. It was not lost to the collective memory of Italians, since the Italian capture of Adwa, Tigray Region, Ethiopia in 1935, during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, was hailed as an act that avenged their previous humiliation and defeat. Historiography about Ethiopia throughout much of the 20th century focused primarily on this second invasion and the Abyssinian Crisis <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>it,</b> in which Ethiopia was depicted as being relegated to the role of a pawn in European diplomacy. The Ethiopian courtier (i.e. blatta) and historian Marse Hazan Walda Qirqos (1899–1978) was commissioned by the Selassie regime to compile a documentary history of the Italian occupation entitled A Short History of the Five Years of Hardship, composed concurrently with the submission of historical evidence to the United Nations War Crimes Commission for Fascist Italy's war crimes. Coauthored by Berhanu Denque, this work {{was one of the first}} vernacular Amharic histories to cover the Italian colonial period, documenting contemporary newspaper articles and propaganda pieces, events such as the 1936 fall of Addis Ababa and the 1941 British-Ethiopian reconquest of the country, and speeches by key figures such as Emperor Selassie and Rodolfo Graziani (1882–1955), Viceroy of Italian East Africa.|$|E
