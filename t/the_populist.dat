5|$|Weaver privately {{supported}} Bryan's {{quest for}} the Democratic nomination in 1896, which their convention awarded him on the fifth ballot. When <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> convention gathered the next month in Chicago, they divided between endorsing the silverite Democrat and preserving their new party's independence. Weaver backed the former course, holding the issues the party stood for to be of more importance than the party itself. A majority of delegates agreed, but without the enthusiasm that had marked their convention of four years earlier. At the same time, Weaver joined with anti-fusionists to keep <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> platform from deviating from the party's ideological principles. Against the fusion candidate stood Republican William McKinley of Ohio, a hard-money conservative. Bryan succeeded in uniting the South and West, Weaver's longtime dream, but with the more populous North solidly behind McKinley, Bryan lost the election.|$|E
5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near complete control over the government. Despite the vast reach of their powers, however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>populist</b> agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the sans-culottes, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Hancock did {{not long}} survive his electoral opponent. After the election, he {{remained}} on duty as {{commander of the}} Division of the Atlantic. He attended Garfield's inauguration and served loyally under him and Arthur. In 1885, he visited the Gettysburg battlefield, the site of his most famous triumph two decades earlier. Hancock died the following year, after an abscess in his leg became infected. Weaver survived both of his more popular opponents, returning to Congress for {{four years in the}} 1880s, and running for president again as the nominee of <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> Party in 1892.|$|E
50|$|Relations {{between the}} socialists and <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> {{continued}} to sour {{over the next}} several years, with Berger declaring {{at the time of the}} November 1896 elections that socialists should support <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> at <b>the</b> polls only until a national political party was established for the working class.|$|R
50|$|Goodwyn (1976) and Postel (2007) {{reject the}} notion that <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> were traditionalistic and anti-modern. Quite the reverse, they argue, <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> aggressively sought self-consciously {{progressive}} goals. Goodwyn criticizes Hofstadter’s reliance on secondary sources to characterize <b>the</b> <b>Populists,</b> working instead with the material generated by <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> themselves. Goodwyn determined that the farmers’ cooperatives {{gave rise to a}} Populist culture, and their efforts to free farmers from lien merchants revealed to them the political structure of the economy, which propelled them into politics. <b>The</b> <b>Populists</b> sought diffusion of scientific and technical knowledge, formed highly centralized organizations, launched large-scale incorporated businesses, and pressed for an array of state-centered reforms. Hundreds of thousands of women committed to Populism seeking a more modern life, education, and employment in schools and offices. A large section of the labor movement looked to Populism for answers, forging a political coalition with farmers that gave impetus to the regulatory state. Progress, however, was also menacing and inhumane, Postel notes. White Populists embraced social-Darwinist notions of racial improvement, Chinese exclusion and separate-but-equal.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the more}} notable uses of this meaning is found in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Emerald City in this story {{is a place where}} {{everyone}} wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to <b>the</b> <b>populist</b> interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, L. Frank Baum, to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of new forces of urban factions, rural voters, and others, engaging in continued conflict {{with each other for}} their own interests, meant that the problem of effective governance awaited resolution. <b>The</b> <b>populist</b> government of the Gracchi had come to an end by violence; and this provided a brutal precedent that would be followed by many other rulers of Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{adopted in}} Omaha was ambitious for its time, {{calling for a}} graduated income tax, public ownership of the railroads, telegraph, and telephone systems, government-issued currency, and the unlimited coinage of silver (the idea that the United States would buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins) at a favorable 16-to-1 ratio with gold. The Republicans nominated Harrison for re-election, and the Democrats put forward ex-President Cleveland; as in 1880, Weaver was confident of a good showing for the new party against their opponents. Harrison had shown some favor to the free silver cause, but his party largely supported the hard-money gold standard; Cleveland was solidly for gold, but his running mate, Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, was a silverite. Against these, <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> Party stood alone as undisputed partisans of soft money, which Weaver hoped would lead to success in rural areas. Further, as labor disturbances broke out in Homestead, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, Weaver hoped urban laborers would rally to <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> cause.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Armenian <b>Populist</b> Party (Հայ Ժողովրդական Կուսակցություն) was a {{political}} party founded in March 1917 in Russian Armenia. Its members had previously belonged to the Russian Kadet party. <b>The</b> <b>Populists</b> had a liberal programme and drew their support from middle-class Armenians in Tbilisi and Baku.|$|R

5|$|By 1920, due {{in large}} part to the city's {{economic}} prosperity, Cleveland became the nation's fifth largest city. The city counted Progressive Era politicians such as <b>the</b> <b>populist</b> Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to energize a city after the Great Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, {{support for}} the {{introduction}} of direct election for the Senate had substantially increased, and reformers worked on two fronts. On the first front, <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> Party incorporated the direct election of senators into its Omaha Platform, adopted in 1892. In 1908, Oregon passed the first law that based the selection of U.S. senators on a popular vote. Oregon was soon followed by Nebraska. Proponents for popular election noted that ten states already had non-binding primaries for Senate candidates, in which the candidates would be voted on by the public, effectively serving as advisory referenda instructing state legislatures how to vote; reformers campaigned for more states to introduce a similar method.|$|E
5|$|Despite the loss, Weaver still {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> cause would triumph. He {{agreed to be}} nominated one last time for his old 6th district House seat on a Democratic-Populist fusion ticket. As he had ten years earlier, Republican John Lacey defeated Weaver. In 1900, Weaver attended a convention of fusionist Populists in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the party having split {{on the issue of}} cooperation with the Democrats. The fusionists backed Bryan, the Democratic nominee, but he lost again to McKinley, this time by a greater margin. The following year, Weaver was elected to office for the last time as the mayor of his hometown, Colfax, Iowa.|$|E

50|$|In 1896, the {{two parties}} held {{separate}} state conventions to allow <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> to nominate presidential electors pledged to Democrat William J. Bryan. At the Republican state convention in Raleigh on May 16, 1896, Russell was nominated for Governor of North Carolina on the seventh ballot over former U.S. Representative Oliver H. Dockery. Disgruntled, Dockery convinced <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> to run a separate statewide slate of candidates,with William A. Guthrie for Governor and Dockery for Lieutenant Governor.|$|R
50|$|During the 1890s, North Carolina {{witnessed}} a political revolution as <b>the</b> newly formed <b>Populist</b> Party {{joined with the}} Republicans to unseat conservative Democrats. Focusing on political transformation, electoral reform, and new economic policies to aid poor and struggling farmers, <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> and their coalition partners took power at all levels in the only southern state where Populists gained statewide office. For a brief four years, <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> and Republicans gave an object lesson in progressive politics in which whites and African Americans worked together {{for the betterment of}} the state and the lives of the people.|$|R
5|$|During {{the post-war}} Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a {{constitution}} which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. <b>The</b> <b>populist</b> Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883. It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia {{to include a}} poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor European Americans. Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded {{due to a lack}} of political representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.|$|E
5|$|Jorge Remes Lenicov {{resigned}} in April, alongside ministers De Mendiguren and Capitanich. Peronist governors, legislators, and union leaders {{met at the}} Quinta de Olivos, amid rumors that Duhalde would appoint <b>the</b> <b>populist</b> Daniel Carbonetto as minister of economy. They gave their full support {{to the president and}} the economic policies instrumented so far. As a result, Duhalde appointed the conservative Roberto Lavagna. Lavagna was the Argentine ambassador to the European Union, and switched offices with Remes Lenicov. He was suggested by Governor Carlos Ruckauf and supported by Alfonsín. He stabilised prices and the exchange rate with tight fiscal and monetary policies, and prevented the crisis from growing into an hyperinflation. The recovery also benefited from the idle capacity of the economy.|$|E
5|$|One {{factor that}} helped Tillman and his {{movement}} in the 1890 campaign was the organization of many South Carolina farmers {{under the auspices of}} the Farmers' Alliance. The Alliance, which had spread through much of the agricultural South and West since its origin in Texas, sought to get farmers to work together cooperatively and seek reform. From that organization would come the People's Party (better known as the Populists). Although <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> Party played a significant role in the politics of the 1890s, it did not do so in South Carolina, where Tillman had already channeled agricultural discontent into an attempt to take over the Democratic Party. The Alliance in South Carolina generally backed Tillman, and its many local farmers' organizations gave Tillman new venues for his speeches.|$|E
50|$|In the Senate, Democrats made minor gains, but Republicans kept {{control of}} <b>the</b> chamber. <b>The</b> <b>Populists</b> joined <b>the</b> Senate {{for the first}} time, electing two Senators.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his tenure}} with <b>the</b> <b>Populists,</b> Butler was an {{advocate}} of [...] "Fusion", meaning outright cooperation with the North Carolina Republican Party {{as a means to}} achieve some of the more important goals of his party. While some Populists disliked what they saw as a compromise made on some of their core beliefs, Butler saw short-term success, as <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> and Republicans together polled a larger vote than the Democrats in the election of 1892, and swept both houses of the legislature in the Election of 1894.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Populists</b> {{hoped to}} bypass black Republican politicians, who they viewed as corrupt, by {{directly}} appealing to black farmers via the Colored Alliance. However, the Colored Alliance was in rapid decline and black Republican politicians and newspapers were largely critical of <b>the</b> Southern <b>Populists,</b> whose claims {{of support for}} black civil rights were largely rhetorical and disingenuous.|$|R
5|$|The {{election}} {{resulted in}} a breakthrough for <b>the</b> <b>populist</b> True Finns, which came head-to-head with the three big parties, while every other parliamentary party in mainland Finland, excluding Åland, lost popularity. The National Coalition Party (NCP) also ended up as the biggest party {{for the first time}} in its history. The total turnout rose to 70.5% from 67.9% in the previous election; and corruption scandals also {{resulted in a}}n anti-incumbency vote. The incumbent, Centre Party-led coalition, which included the NCP, Green League and Swedish People's Party (SPP), lost its majority by two seats and their Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party signaled that her party would then sit in opposition.|$|E
5|$|The first {{election}} in Delta County occurred on October 6, 1870, to establish {{control in the}} newly formed county. Cooper held its first {{election in}} 1881, establishing an aldermanic government. Around that time, the first county courthouse was built in Cooper. Delta County, in addition to Cooper, voted for the Democratic Party in every presidential election from its incorporation in 1870 until 1968. However, <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> Party won numerous local and county government positions during the 1890s and the early 1900s. In the 1970s, politics in Delta County shifted, {{and most of the}} county began voting for the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Tory {{preparations}} {{for an upcoming}} election campaign were thrown into disarray in August 1956 when Drew fell ill. Tory leaders felt that the party needed vigorous leadership with a federal election likely to be called within a year. In September, Drew resigned. Diefenbaker, who had failed in two prior bids for the leadership, announced his candidacy, as did Tory frontbenchers Davie Fulton and Donald Fleming. Diefenbaker, a criminal defence lawyer from Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, was on <b>the</b> <b>populist</b> left of the PC party. Those Tory leaders who disliked Diefenbaker and his views, and hoped to find a candidate from Drew's conservative wing of the party, wooed University of Toronto president Sidney Smith as a candidate. However, Smith refused to run.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Populists</b> had 43 of the 204 {{representatives in}} the Armenian National Congress of October 1917 {{and two of the}} 15 seats in the {{subsequent}} Armenian National Council.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{treatment}} of <b>Populists</b> by <b>the</b> Democratic Party {{led to a}} division in the party. On May 17, 1899, Populist Party leaders met in St. Louis and issued an address calling for a [...] "Middle of the Road" [...] policy, in which the party would decline future fusion efforts. The statement was primarily aimed at the party's national chairman, U.S. Senator Marion Butler of North Carolina, who had been elected to the Senate through fusion with North Carolina Republicans, and was already working for the re-nomination of William J. Bryan by <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> in 1900. <b>The</b> pro-fusion leaders of <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> fought back in early 1900. The first state party known to have split was the Nebraska party, which divided during its state convention on March 19. Both factions appointed delegates to the national convention, scheduled for Cincinnati. Ultimately, <b>the</b> Fusion <b>Populists</b> decided to hold a separate national convention when {{it became apparent that}} <b>the</b> Ohio <b>Populists</b> did not favor fusion, and were working to organize a convention which would not nominate Bryan, but an independent ticket.|$|R
50|$|In 1898 Veatch {{ran for the}} United States Congress as {{a fusion}} {{candidate}} of the Democrats and <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> against incumbent Republican Thomas H. Tongue, losing by 2,037 votes.|$|R
5|$|Ex-Confederates {{were usually}} a safe voting bloc for the Democrats, {{but many of}} them deserted Goebel because he had, in 1895, {{approached}} and quickly killed his main local political opponent, the grandson of Revolutionary War General and US Congressman Thomas Sandford, the esteemed banker and former Confederate colonel John Sandford, in what he declared was an act of self-defense. On the other hand, blacks had historically been a safe bloc for the Republicans, but Taylor had alienated many of them by not strongly opposing the Separate Coach Bill, which would have racially segregated railroad facilities. Goebel also risked losing support to minor party candidates. Besides John Y. Brown, the dissenting Democrats' nominee, <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> Party nominated a candidate, drawing votes from Goebel's populist base. To unite his traditional base, Goebel convinced William Jennings Bryan, a hero to most populists and Democrats, to campaign for him. As soon as Bryan finished his tour of the state, Governor Bradley reversed course and began speaking in favor of Taylor. While Bradley insisted that his motives were to defend his administration, journalist Henry Watterson believed Taylor had promised to support Bradley's senatorial bid if elected.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Bradley carried {{the vote of}} many Gold Democrats. He also drew a number of votes from those who sympathized with {{the views of the}} American Protective Association, an anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic organization. Some {{estimates}} placed the organization's membership at 14,000 in Louisville alone; it also had strength in the urban centers of Paducah, Lexington, Ashland, Covington, and Frankfort. Democrats were also hurt by economic factors, including the national economic problems and a severe drought in the state. Bradley was elected the first Republican governor of Kentucky, defeating Hardin by a vote of 172,436 to 163,524. Pettit, <b>the</b> <b>Populist</b> candidate, drew 16,911 votes, most of them from Democrats in western Kentucky. Turnout in the election was 85%. More votes than potential voters were registered in 18 counties, nine of which went for Bradley and nine for Hardin.|$|E
5|$|Relations had {{apparently}} warmed between Tyndall and Jordan, for they met {{up after the}} latter {{was released from prison}} in 1968, and Tyndall again met with Jordan in Coventry in 1972, there inviting him to join the NF. However, a poor showing in the February 1974 general election resulted in Tyndall being challenged by two groups within the party, the 'Strasserites' and the 'Populists', the latter of whom were largely Powellite ex-members of the Conservative Party. <b>The</b> <b>Populist</b> challenge was successful and in October 1974 Tyndall was replaced as chairman by John Kingsley Read. Tyndall then used Spearhead as a vehicle to criticise rival factions with the NF. As a result, he was expelled from the party during a disciplinary tribunal in November 1975. Tyndall took the issue to the high court, who overturned the expulsion. The 'Populists' then left the party, splitting to form the National Party in January 1976, which for a short time proved more electorally successful than the NF. Back in the party and with his main rivals gone, Tyndall regained the position of chairman.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the next}} decade, Russell practiced law and {{remained}} {{active in the}} Republican party. Then in the 1890s, <b>the</b> new <b>Populist</b> Party appeared. Though in most of <b>the</b> U.S., <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> were allied with the Democrats, they allied with the Republicans in North Carolina, as common foes of the dominant Democratic Party organization. The alliance ran [...] "fusion" [...] candidates for many offices.|$|R
50|$|On January 16-16, {{there were}} {{large-scale}} student protests. Although the protests were somewhat spontaneous in nature, they coalesced through the organizing of several political organizations: The communist “Student Cooperation Committee,” the Progressive Democrats, <b>the</b> <b>Populists,</b> <b>the</b> Kurdish Democrats, {{and the student}} wings of the National Democratic Party and the Independence Party.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the convention, former Congressman Charles A. Towne of Minnesota was {{considered}} the favorite for the vice presidential nomination, as both <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> and <b>the</b> Silver Republican Party backed Towne. Other names mentioned as possible candidates include former New York Senator David B. Hill (who declined to be nominated) and John W. Keller, an obscure commissioner from New York City. However, former vice President Adlai Stevenson won the nomination with the help of allies of Bryan, who wanted to keep Hill off of the ticket. The choice of Stevenson alienated <b>the</b> <b>Populists</b> and Silver Republicans, who had planned to nominate the Democratic ticket.|$|R
