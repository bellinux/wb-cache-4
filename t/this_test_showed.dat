2500|$|The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act of 1992 created {{funding and}} {{government}} support for mitigation of the dams on the Elwha. [...] While fish ladders were proposed as a possibility, they were ultimately ruled {{out for the}} reasons above. [...] The major problem raised with regard to removal of the two dams was the approximately 34 million cubic yards of sediment that had built up behind the dams. [...] Of that 34 million, 28 million was behind the Glines Canyon Dam, while 6 million was behind the Elwha Dam. [...] Releasing all of this sediment at once would have devastating effects on the remaining habitats downstream from the dams, as well as along beaches at the coast. [...] A drawdown experiment {{was conducted on the}} Glines Canyon Dam to assess the erosion of the sediments from Lake Mills. [...] The lake was drawn down [...] over one week and then allowed to remain stable for one more week. [...] <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> that the river would rapidly cut into the existing delta as soon as the lake level dropped, creating a deep, narrow channel. [...] A new delta immediately began to form at the new lake level. [...] Once the lake level was held steady, the channel migrated laterally along the existing delta. [...] This test resulted in a sediment erosion model in which gradual drawdown of the lake would result in a greatly decreased sediment load downstream. [...] Using this model, the plan was to drain the lake gradually over a two-year time period, allowing much of the sediment to remain in the old lake basin.|$|E

One was a wing designed using laminar flow airfoils which were developed co-operatively by North American Aviation and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). These airfoils generated very low drag at high speeds. During the development of the NA-73X, a wind tunnel test of two wings, one using NACA 5-digit airfoils and the other using the new NAA/NACA 45-100 airfoils, was performed in the University of Washington Kirsten Wind Tunnel.

In a few tests Turiel had asked his test groups if they would hit their friend. They all said no because they would get in trouble. He then offered the idea that if they wouldn't get in trouble would they do it and most said no because they knew the other person would get hurt and that would be wrong. <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> that society creates standards for us and teaches us the right and wrong from interactions with other people and how they follow societal rules.|$|E
50|$|Myricetin {{also has}} been shown to inhibit the act of genetic {{mutation}} as exhibited by the Ames test. <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> that myricetin was more effective in preventing mutagenesis initiated by certain carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo(a)pyrene, dibenzo(a,h)pyrene, and dibenzo(a,i)pyrene) as compared to others in which it was less effective in preventing against mutagenesis (benzo(a)pyrene 4, 5-oxide and the bay-region diol-epoxides of benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, and benzo(c)phenathrene). This data shows that myricetin is not unilaterally able to reduce the carcinogenic activity of all polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or even the more specific subclass of benzo(a)pyrenes. It is to be noted that myricetin’s exact biochemical activity is still not fully understood. Clearly there is a multifaceted, complex system involved in the anticarcinogenic activity displayed by myricetin that does not apply equally to all carcinogens of the same subfamily.|$|E
50|$|The pool-type reactor {{design of}} the EBR-II {{provides}} passive safety: the reactor core, its fuel handling equipment, and many other systems of the reactor are submerged under molten sodium. By providing a fluid which readily conducts heat from the fuel to the coolant, and which operates at relatively low temperatures, the EBR-II takes maximum advantage of expansion of the coolant, fuel, and structure during off-normal events which increase temperatures. The expansion of the fuel and structure in an off-normal situation causes the system to shut down even without human operator intervention. In April 1986, two special tests were performed on the EBR-II, in which the main primary cooling pumps were shut off with the reactor at full power (62.5 megawatts, thermal). By not allowing the normal shutdown systems to interfere, the reactor power dropped to near zero within about 300 seconds. No damage to the fuel or the reactor resulted. The same day, this demonstration was followed by another important test. With the reactor again at full power, flow in the secondary cooling system was stopped. This test caused the temperature to increase, since there was nowhere for the reactor heat to go. As the primary (reactor) cooling system became hotter, the fuel, sodium coolant, and structure expanded, and the reactor shut down. <b>This</b> <b>test</b> <b>showed</b> that it will shut down using inherent features such as thermal expansion, even if the ability to remove heat from the primary cooling system is lost.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes the {{application}} of 3 different kinds of feature extractors to recognize & classify 5 models of vehicles. These feature extractors are Fast Fourier transform, discrete wavelet transform & discrete curvelet transform. To justify the correct amount of each feature extractor, we perform each of the mentioned transforms to input images, precisely. The classifier used in this paper is called k nearest-neighbor. The results of <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>show,</b> that the right recognition rate of vehicle’s model in this recognition system, {{at the time of}} using curvelet transform (Notice, all curvelet coefficients) is 100 %. For decreasing the dimension of feature vectors more & choosing the best features we’ve used interclass variance criteria to infraclass variance criteria. As a result of this performance, the size of feature vectors will be extremely decreased. Then, we perform our final impact feature vectors (The best Curvelet coefficients or the best wavelet coefficients or the best Fourier coefficients) to the KNN Classifier. Also, the results of <b>this</b> <b>test</b> <b>show,</b> the right recognition rate of vehicle’s model in this recognition system, at the time of using 0. 1 of all curvelet coefficients is 100 %.
