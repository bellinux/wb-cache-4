Following the decline in the membership of traditional non-conformist societies, the town has seen the establishment of numerous evangelical free churches in more recent years.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explore the {{relationship}} between urbanization, modernization and the past in England, particularly for the period c. 1700 - 1900. It does so from a cultural perspective, examining the way that towns looked and were represented, with an emphasis upon the built environment, visual imagery, spectacle and written and printed texts, such as <b>town</b> <b>guides</b> and histories. Modernizing tendencies are examined in the first instance, but then their interplay with the past is explored, for example in the urban use of classical and gothic architecture. The central conclusion of the paper is that modernity and the past, both which agendas English towns pursued vigorously during the period, should be seen not as mutually exclusive categories of experience, but as interconnected and complementary discourses. The evidence suggests that modernization in towns and cities, far from driving out the past, engendered greater dependence upon it. Non peer reviewe...|$|R

5000|$|The Arkansas River {{was named}} a “gold medal” trout stream in January 2014.

[...] The Denver Post quoted Stu Pappenfort, a river ranger with the Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area, as saying, “When I was a kid and we used to come out here fishing, we skipped over the Arkansas and went to the Taylor and the Gunnison. The heavy metals really impacted the size of the fish. There was a good number of them, but not the ones you wanted to hold up in the picture. So we skipped over it.” As a result of the clean up efforts and the Gold Medal designation, there were over 100,000 anglers fishing the Arkansas between Leadville and Parkdale in 2012.|$|R

40|$|Background: Field school research, {{which begins}} by {{considering}} community partners as pedagogues and thus exploring their perspectives on student learning, is uncommon. Photovoice {{is a method}} for self-expression of such marginalized voices. Purpose: Describe the photovoice to photodocumentary process and present results of its evaluation. Methodology/Approach: We employed photovoice with the local guides who accompany community health research field school students in Cape <b>Town.</b> <b>Guides</b> were prompted to take photographs of what students may not see or understand about their community. These were discussed at three workshops and developed into a photodocumentary {{for inclusion in the}} curriculum. Twenty-one students completed an open-ended questionnaire. These, and student/staff discussions, were thematically analyzed. Findings/Conclusion: Students reported learning about cultural practices which otherwise would not be visible to them. They felt greater connection to their guides who they saw in a new light, and became aware of how topic-specificity drew attention away from overarching characteristics of community life. Questions raised might be better explored through facilitated discussion rather than question-and-answer sessions alone. Implications: Field schools depend on academic–community partnerships. Photovoice can create space for community partner reflection on student learning and the co-creation of effective pedagogical tools valued by students...|$|R
