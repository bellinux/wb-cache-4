5|$|Kehoe {{drove up}} to the school about half an hour after the explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck.</b> Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored in his truck, killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a retired farmer), and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader.

25|$|The two {{vehicles}} {{with the group}} of whites pulled off the freeway and into the motel parking lot.

The group repeatedly beat Anderson and robbed him, the district attorney said, citing reports from witnesses. Video from a motel security camera shows the perpetrators entering and leaving the picture frame; it did not capture the beating. One witness reported that one of the perpetrators yelled, “white power,” when returning <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck</b> after the beating.|$|E

When he finally thought he had outrun it, he decided {{it was safe to}} leave his truck. Soon after, he was struck by a lightning bolt. Sullivan stated that he actually saw the bolt that hit him. The lightning set his hair on fire, moved down his left arm and left leg and knocked off his shoe. It then crossed over to his right leg just below the knee. Still conscious, Sullivan crawled <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck</b> and poured the can of water, which he always kept there, over his head, which was on fire.|$|E
25|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck {{up to the front}} of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling his words and was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a clevis pin, Roberts walked out <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck</b> and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the back of his pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and ran toward a nearby farm to get help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if the women got away.|$|E
500|$|Three endings are available. In the [...] "Good" [...] ending, Alessa {{uses the}} Flauros to {{manifest}} {{a baby with}} half of her soul, stopping the ritual, and her spirit manifestation carries the baby {{to the outskirts of}} the town, seeing Travis off as he returns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck</b> and cheerfully drives away from Silent Hill.

2500|$|Jones then unfurled a large, square banner {{with white}} hand-lettering that read: [...] "HMO's {{are in it}} for the money!! Live free, love safe or die." [...] Jones had made the banner {{specifically}} for the occasion and displayed it for the news helicopters to see. As it was pretty windy on the interstate at the time, Jones weighted the banner down with a container to stop it blowing away. Jones continued to make obscene gestures and returned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck</b> several times to pet his dog. This was all broadcast on live television by news helicopters recording the event live. As it was a Thursday afternoon, it was witnessed by many children, whose after-school cartoons had been interrupted in order to broadcast the incident. As authorities prepared to negotiate with him, Jones suddenly returned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck</b> and sat in the front seat. Intending to take his own life, Jones ignited a Molotov cocktail inside his truck. The vehicle suddenly burst into flames and was set ablaze. Jones got out of the vehicle however and ran across the freeway as he was engulfed in flames and smoke, with his hair, pants and socks all on fire. Jones tried to pat out the flames, managing to peel off his pants, socks and underwear. He continued to wander about, naked from the waist, looking dazed and disoriented. He then walked {{to the edge of the}} freeway gesturing angrily. It appeared as if he was about to jump off the freeway, however, he changed his mind and backed away from the edge, before returning to his ablaze truck. Moments later, at around 3:50p.m., he retrieved his shotgun from the back of the truck and then walked back across the freeway. He placed the shotgun beneath his chin, pulled the trigger and committed suicide. He then fell to the ground with the cameras still rolling and playing the event live to viewers watching at home. Jones died at the age of forty, roughly two weeks after his birthday.|$|E

2500|$|There are no legally {{recognized}} inherited grazing rights, preemptive rights, special rights, or grandfathered public-domain land-use rights {{held by the}} Bundy {{family or}} Bundy's ancestors. Bundy lost his special-rights arguments in the United States v. Bundy cases. Bundy had only base property and normal AUM grazing-allotment permits, like the permits {{of thousands of other}} ranchers throughout the western United States. The court found that Bundy and his father actually first began grazing their cattle on the Bunkerville Allotment in 1954 and used it for several years. They paid for cattle grazing again from 1973 until 1993, when Bundy paid the last fees for his final grazing application for the period from December 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. On January 24, 1994, the Bureau of Land Management delivered a Proposed Decision Order to Remove and Demand for Payment to Bundy by placing it on the dashboard of Bundy's vehicle {{while he was in the}} vehicle. BLM officials allege that Bundy became agitated, descended from his truck and accused the BLM of harassing him. He then returned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck,</b> threw the proposed order out of the window and drove away. One of Bundy's sons then picked up the document, tore it to pieces and threw it on the ground. On February 17, 1994, the BLM issued a final decision canceling Bundy's range-grazing permit. Bundy subsequently informed the BLM in several administrative notices that he intended to graze cattle [...] "pursuant to my vested grazing rights". Bundy failed to demonstrate the existence of any such special rights when given an opportunity to do so in court.|$|E
