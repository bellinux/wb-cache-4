5|$|The screenplay's early drafts {{suggested}} a {{four and a}} half-hour film with a potential budget of $40 million – double what Stone had agreed to with Warner Bros. The director knew film mogul Arnon Milchan and met with him to help finance the film. Milchan was eager {{to work on the}} project and launch his new company, Regency Enterprises, with a high profile film like JFK. Milchan made a deal with Warner Bros. <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> money for the film. Stone managed to pare down his initial revision, a 190-page draft, to a 156-page shooting script.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, an October {{snowstorm}} in Salida, Colorado, destroyed Sunday's tent—a special disaster because revivalists {{were typically}} paid with a freewill offering {{at the end}} of their meetings. Thereafter he insisted that towns build him temporary wooden tabernacles at their expense. The tabernacles were comparatively costly to build (although most of the lumber could be salvaged and resold {{at the end of}} the meetings), and locals had <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> money for them in advance. This change in Sunday's operation began to push the finances of the campaign to the fore. At least at first, raising tabernacles provided good public relations for the coming meetings as townspeople joined together in what was effectively a giant barnraising. Sunday built rapport by participating in the process, and the tabernacles were also a status symbol, because they had previously been built only for major evangelists such as Chapman.|$|E

25|$|When General Bell first {{sent me to}} Victor I {{offered him}} certain {{evidence}} {{in regard to the}} perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and asked me if I had a man in whom I could place absolute confidence. I called in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force them <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in the morning. I told General Reardon that I {{was under the impression that}} most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so that such a plan would be impracticable. He then said to me that the same end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to accompany me, I took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take Sergeant Walter and look over the ground in the rear of the Findlay mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his reason to be that the mine owners had promised <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> necessary money the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in giving me directions regarding the shooting up of the Vindicator shaft house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were the only ones who knew anything about the plan.|$|E
500|$|The second part, titled [...] "Partition", is {{preceded by}} the sound of paparazzi camera clicks and a window {{whirring}} up, which separates it from the first part [...] "Yoncé". [...] "Partition" [...] has a fractured production and is lyrically about the female protagonist having sex with her romantic interest in the backseat of a limousine. Caitlin White, writing for The 405, highlighted that the song details a romantic relationship in which women do not act as sexual objects during sexual intercourse but rather use [...] "the physical act of love as a form of agency", from which they derive pleasure. [...] "Partition" [...] gained significant attention for its explicit lyrics, with frequent references made to the opening lines of the first verse in which Beyoncé asks her driver <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> partition.|$|E
500|$|Years later, Barnes {{wrote about}} the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting {{position}} that didn't appeal to me.

My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting... If I were to become an Australian Test opening batsman I would have to conform to standard. I would have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> shutters...

500|$|The squad {{was one of}} {{the first}} to start the stage 1 team time trial. Viganò crashed at one point and {{finished}} almost three minutes behind his teammates, but the squad still managed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> day's winning time, finishing with the necessary five riders together four seconds the better of defending Vuelta champion Vincenzo Nibali's [...] squad. Fuglsang was the rider who crossed the line first, making him the first wearer of the race leader's red jersey. He said after the stage that the team had not pre-determined who would cross the line first, as is customarily the case in advance of a team time trial. It had simply been Fuglsang's turn to ride on the front when the finish line came. He said would try to ride for the overall classification, with Bennati and Cancellara to hunt for stage wins in the sprints and individual time trial, respectively. Bennati contested the sprint finish the next day, taking sixth behind Christopher Sutton. Since Fuglsang also finished at the front of the race, combined stage finishes meant that Bennati would take the red jersey for stage 3. Solo stage winner Pablo Lastras claimed the jersey the next day, but Fuglsang and Monfort continued to be well-placed in the overall standings.|$|E
500|$|Japan's {{national}} anthem is deemed the world's most controversial {{due to its}} post-war history. Schools have been the center of controversy over both the anthem and the national flag. The Tokyo Board of Education {{requires the use of}} both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs. In 1999, several teachers in Hiroshima refused <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> anthem while the Hiroshima Education Board demanded that they do so. As the tension arose between them, a vice-principal committed suicide. A similar incident in Osaka in 2010 also occurred, with 32 teachers refusing to sing the song in a ceremony. In 2011, nine more teachers joined the rebellion, along with another eight in 2012. Hashimoto Toru, the mayor of Osaka, slated the teachers as [...] "It was good that criminals [...] who are intent on breaking the rules [...] have risen to the surface [...] ". Some have protested that such rules violate the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the [...] "freedom of thought, belief and conscience" [...] clause in the Constitution of Japan, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their employees have an obligation to teach their students how to be good Japanese citizens. Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor Shintarō Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the Hinomaru and [...] "Kimigayo". After earlier opposition, the Japan Teachers Union accepts the use of both the flag and anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{invented the}} dye, Perkin was still {{faced with the}} {{problems}} of raising the capital for producing it, manufacturing it cheaply, adapting it for use in dyeing cotton, gaining acceptance for it among commercial dyers, and creating public demand for it. He was active in all of these areas: he persuaded his father <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> capital, and his brothers to partner with him to build a factory; he invented a mordant for cotton; he gave technical advice to the dyeing industry; and he publicised his invention of the dye. Public demand was increased when a similar colour was adopted by Queen Victoria in England and by Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, in France, and [...] when the crinoline or hooped-skirt, whose manufacture used a large quantity of cloth, became fashionable. Everything fell into place: with hard work and lucky timing, Perkin became rich. After the discovery of mauveine, many new aniline dyes appeared (some discovered by Perkin himself), and factories producing them were constructed across Europe.|$|E
