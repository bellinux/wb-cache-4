5|$|To {{combat the}} {{perceived}} threat of brucellosis transmission to cattle, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds {{back into the}} park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 1996–97, <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. Animal rights activists argue {{that this is a}} cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> and elk herds throughout Yellowstone.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} was {{a mobile}} pillbox {{that could be}} driven out onto the airfield. This was known as <b>the</b> <b>Bison</b> and consisted of a lorry with a concrete armoured cabin and a small concrete pillbox on the flat bed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bisons</b> {{have existed}} {{in some form}} since 1877, {{most of that time}} playing in {{professional}} baseball's second tier; exceptions have included <b>the</b> 1879-85 <b>Bisons,</b> who played in the major leagues {{as a member of the}} National League, and <b>the</b> 1979-84 <b>Bisons,</b> who played at the third-tier Double-A level. <b>The</b> <b>Bisons</b> did not play from June 1970 through the 1978 season.|$|R

5|$|They {{encountered}} Native Americans, {{who would}} sometimes demand provisions for passage, but none were given {{and none of}} the incidents ended with violence. The travelers' stores were supplemented by shooting bison, which roamed the Great Plains in huge numbers. Despite being a source of food, <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> were a danger as their stampedes could destroy property and kill irreplaceable stock. In southeastern Idaho, the California Trail separated from the Oregon, and Buck and some {{of the rest of the}} party split off there; they settled in California and remained friends with Meeker until their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the finest megafauna wildlife habitat in the lower 48 states. There are almost 60 species of mammals in the park, including the gray wolf, coyote, the threatened Canadian lynx, and grizzly bears. Other large mammals include <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> (often referred to as buffalo), black bear, elk, moose, mule deer, white-tailed deer, mountain goat, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, and cougar.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{plays a role}} {{in various}} mythologies and {{creation}} myths of Native American folklore. It is variously credited for having brought fire to humanity, releasing <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> into the world, and of having slain monsters by petrifying them. The Maidu creation myth has the coyote introducing work, suffering, and death to the world. Zuni folklore has the coyote bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachinas. Some tribes, such as the Chinook, Maidu, Paiute, Pawnee, Tohono O'odham, and Ute portray the coyote as the companion of the creator. In the Paiute creation myth, the coyote was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by piling soil on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham flood myth has the coyote helping Montezuma survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the Great Mystery creates humanity, the coyote and Montezuma teach people how to live. The Crow creation myth portrays Old Man Coyote as the creator. In Navajo mythology, the coyote was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. The Navajo coyote brings death into the world, explaining that without death, too many people would exist, thus no room to plant corn.|$|E
50|$|Although superficially similar, {{a number}} of {{physical}} and behavioural differences are seen between <b>the</b> European <b>bison</b> and <b>the</b> American <b>bison.</b> <b>The</b> European <b>bison</b> has 14 pairs of ribs, while <b>the</b> American <b>bison</b> has 15. Adult European bison are (on average) taller than American bison, and have longer legs. European bison tend to browse more, and graze less than their American relatives, due to their necks being set differently. Compared to <b>the</b> American <b>bison,</b> <b>the</b> nose of <b>the</b> European <b>bison</b> is set further forward than the forehead when the neck is in a neutral position.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> European <b>bison</b> {{arose from}} <b>the</b> steppe <b>bison,</b> without fossil {{evidence}} of other ancestral species between <b>the</b> steppe <b>bison</b> and <b>the</b> European <b>bison,</b> though <b>the</b> European <b>bison</b> might have arisen from the lineage {{that led to}} American bison if that lineage backcrossed with <b>the</b> steppe <b>bison.</b> Again, <b>the</b> web of relationships is confusing, but some evidence shows <b>the</b> European <b>bison</b> is descended from bison that had migrated from Asia to North America, {{and then back to}} Europe, where they crossbred with existing steppe bison.|$|R
50|$|However, on October 1, 1925, <b>the</b> <b>Bisons</b> {{managed to}} wrestle Jim Kendrick from his {{contract}} with the Hammond Pros and signed him to play for Buffalo. In 1925 <b>the</b> <b>Bisons</b> were led by former Columbia University star and Buffalo native Walter Koppisch. Prior to Kendrick joining <b>the</b> team, <b>the</b> <b>Bisons</b> were already 0-2 on the season. Kendrick's first game with Buffalo came on Sunday, October 4, 1925, against the Rochester Jeffersons. With Kendrick in <b>the</b> line-up, <b>the</b> <b>Bisons</b> tied <b>the</b> Jeffersons and the Akron Pros in their next two games. A week later <b>the</b> <b>Bisons</b> defeated <b>the</b> Columbus Tigers, 17-6. However tragedy struck the team {{just a few days}} later when, team captain Walter Koppisch was injured in a car accident and was advised to sit out a few games to allow his injuries to heal.|$|R
25|$|By the 1850s the fur trade had {{expanded}} across the Great Plains, and <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> robe trade began to decline. The Métis {{had a role}} in the depopulation of <b>the</b> <b>bison.</b> Like the Indians, the Métis had a preference for cows, which meant that <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> had trouble maintaining their herds. In addition, flood, drought, early frost, and the environmental impact of settlement posed further threats to the herds. Traders, trappers, and hunters all depended on <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> to sustain their way of life. The Métis tried to maintain their lifestyle through a variety of means. For instance, they often used two wheel carts made from local materials, which meant that they were more mobile than Indians and thus were not dependent on following seasonal hunting patterns.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Bison</b> women's {{softball}} team won the Summit League tournament in Macomb, Illinois, becoming the school's third team to appear in an NCAA tournament in the calendar year. In its opening game in May, <b>the</b> <b>Bison</b> upset 9th-ranked Oklahoma, 1–0, in an 11-inning game that spanned two days due to a weather delay. <b>The</b> <b>Bison</b> won the regional with victories over Tulsa, 3–2 and 4–1, {{to advance to the}} Super Regional (Sweet Sixteen) of the tournament, where they were eliminated.|$|E
25|$|After the {{introduction}} of horses, newly nomadic First Nations groups could now lance or shoot bison, speeding up the rate of <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> hunt. <b>The</b> <b>bison</b> hunt became highly commercialized and capitalistic, valuing quick profits over long-term sustainability. Isenberg argues that cultural and ecological interactions between Native Americans and Euroamericans in the Great Plains {{were responsible for the}} near-extinction of <b>the</b> <b>bison.</b> Cultural and ecological interactions created new forms of bison hunters: mounted Indian nomads and Euroamerican industrial hideman. These hunters, combined with environmental pressures, nearly extinguished <b>the</b> <b>bison.</b> Isenberg also explains that {{the introduction}} of horses facilitated bison hunting and competed with bison for scarce water and forage. Industrialization also played a role, with the expansion of railroads, commercial hunting, and the fur trade market.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, {{there were an}} {{estimated}} 30 million bison on the Great Plains. However, the lucrative robe trade accelerated overhunting of the plains bison by indigenous groups and white settlers alike. <b>The</b> <b>bison</b> on the western plains were last {{to be affected by}} white American expansionism, but by the 1850s even those herds were diminished. Westward migration of domesticated animals and people destroyed grazing grounds, and drought and new diseases exacerbated the decline. The plight of <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> was largely seen as the superiority of man over nature until the early 19th century. Historian Andrew Isenberg argues that the rise of capitalist ideology drove indigenous and white hunters alike to compete for every last animal, and that a multitude of factors – disease, drought, westward expansion, commercialization and industrialization of hunting, colonialism, and the introduction of domestic animals from Europe – caused the near-extinction of <b>the</b> <b>bison.</b> Ironically, others point out that <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> depletion was a problem of the tragedy of the commons, the opposite of capitalism: <b>The</b> <b>bison</b> were communal property, not private property, therefore they were abused and squandered.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bison</b> men's and women's basketball| {{teams have}} played since 1970 in a venue that was known before 2016 as <b>the</b> <b>Bison</b> Sports Arena. Following a $41 million {{renovation}} that nearly doubled the facility's seating capacity, the venue will be renamed the Sanford Health Athletic Complex, with the basketball arena called The Scheels Center, {{beginning with the}} 2016-2017 season.|$|E
25|$|Many Aboriginal {{groups had}} become nomadic bison hunters in {{response}} to Euroamerican westward expansion and economic development, which had made the robe trade highly lucrative. The collapse of <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> population on the Great Plains eliminated {{the primary source of}} wealth of these groups in addition to destroying their lands and livelihoods. While white and indigenous hunters both contributed to the culling of <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> population, white hunters tended to be far more destructive in their hunting techniques. While Aboriginal hunting groups participated in <b>the</b> <b>bison</b> hunt in order to support themselves, Euroamericans were actively trying to clear the plains of bison populations to make way for settlers and domesticated animals.|$|E
50|$|Since {{their return}} to Triple-A {{baseball}} in 1985, <b>the</b> <b>Bisons</b> have qualified for the playoffs several times. In 2004, although <b>the</b> <b>Bisons</b> were 10 games behind the first-place team in June, <b>the</b> <b>Bisons</b> won their division. Buffalo won its first-round playoff, against the Durham Bulls, and advanced to the Governors' Cup Finals, {{in which they had}} home field advantage over the Richmond Braves. The remnants of Hurricane Ivan caused major flooding problems in Richmond and the entire series was played in Buffalo. <b>The</b> <b>Bisons</b> defeated <b>the</b> Braves in four games and won the Governors' Cup for the second time since 1998. In 2005, Buffalo won the North Division and played the Indianapolis Indians in the first round, winning the first two games in Indianapolis, but losing all three remaining games. With many of its players shuffled to the Cleveland Indians throughout the final months of <b>the</b> season, <b>the</b> <b>Bisons</b> failed to qualify for the playoffs in 2006. In 2007, Buffalo again failed to clinch a playoff spot, marking the first time since Buffalo was parented with the Pittsburgh Pirates that <b>the</b> <b>Bisons</b> missed <b>the</b> playoffs in back-to-back seasons.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bison</b> {{football}} team, which since 1993 {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Fargodome, was a dominant force in Division II. They have won 13 NCAA National titles. Eight were at the Division II level (1965, 1968, 1969, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, and 1990) before moving up to Division I-AA (now FCS) in 2004 where they have won five national championships (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015). NDSU is the only team at any level of NCAA football to have won five straight national championships. The program was the winningest {{in the history of}} the NCAA Division II North Central Conference, with 17 outright championships and 27 total league football titles. The program has also been quite successful since moving up to the D1 FCS classification. In 2006 <b>the</b> <b>Bison</b> posted a 10–1 record that included a win over FBS Ball State. During a 2006 game against FBS Minnesota, NDSU led for much of the game, but a last-second field goal attempt was blocked by Minnesota, resulting in a 10–9 loss. The following season, <b>the</b> <b>Bison</b> won their first Great West Football Conference championship and achieved the number 1 ranking in major FCS polls for a majority of the season. During this season the 2007 Bison football team defeated FBS members Central Michigan University and the University of Minnesota.
