40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to {{determine the influence of}} aspect ratio, boundary-layer control by means of slots and porous surfaces, Reynolds number, and tunnel end-wall condition upon the performance of airfoils <b>in</b> <b>cascades.</b> A representative compressor-blade section (the NACA 65 -(12) (10) of aspect ratios of 1, 2, and 4 has been tested at low speeds <b>in</b> <b>cascades</b> with solid and with porous side walls. Two-dimensional flow was established <b>in</b> porous-wall <b>cascades</b> of each of the three aspect ratios tested; the flow was not two-dimensional in any of the solid-wall cascades. Turbine-blade sections of aspect ratio 0. 83 were tested <b>in</b> <b>cascades</b> with solid and porous side walls and blade sections of aspect ratio 3. 33 were tested <b>in</b> <b>cascades</b> with solid wall. No particular advantage was observed in the use of porous walls for the turbine cascades tested...|$|R
