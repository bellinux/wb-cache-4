5|$|In a {{dramatic}} reading at the Grand Théâtre de Québec on September 6, {{the final version}} of the Sovereignty Bill was unveiled. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> be tabled in the National Assembly awaiting the result of the referendum.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, the Philippine Senate {{passed a}} bill declaring waling-waling (Vanda sanderiana) as the {{national}} flower alongside Sampaguita. A similar bill in the House of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. Normally, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> become law after being signed by the President. However, it was vetoed by President Benigno Aquino III. The veto did not grant the waling-waling as the second national flower due to the confusion that it would create.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> defense <b>would</b> {{intercept}} Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco 5 {{times in}} this game, as Flacco completed only 50% {{of his passes}} in the game. Despite the 5 turnovers, the game was still somewhat close, but <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> win <b>the</b> game 23-20.|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>bills</b> seek to {{prohibit}} state governments from co-operating with the NSA in various ways: <b>the</b> Utah <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> prohibit provision {{of water to}} NSA facilities; <b>the</b> California <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> prohibit state universities from conducting research for the NSA; ...|$|R
5|$|Chances <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> {{be passed}} ended in November 2004 when House Republicans in the Pennsylvania General Assembly {{decided not to}} bring the bill to a vote. Later that year, Governor Rendell {{released}} US$30 million from the Redevelopment Assistance Budget to Liberty Property Trust. Through the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, Comcast received US$12.75 million that included a US$4-million opportunity grant, US$6.75 million in job-creation tax credits, and US$2 million in job training assistance. Despite the failure to gain KOZ status, the project received US$42.75 million in financial incentives from the state.|$|E
5|$|During the transition, many {{or most of}} the {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.|$|E
5|$|HB 3466 {{would have}} {{increased}} penalties {{for possession of}} under an ounce of marijuana from an infraction (traffic ticket-like offense) to a Class A misdemeanor, the worst non-felony offense, with a fine of $100 to $1,000 per gram, up {{to a maximum of}} $5,000. The bill also would have created a new crime—being under the influence of marijuana—punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have passed according to the positions of state senators, but was blocked on a technical basis which prevented it from coming to the floor the same day it was read—which allows public input—unless overridden by a vote.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the last}} time the Bengals {{defeated}} <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> until Week 4 of the 2011 season. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> go on to win 10 straight against them.|$|R
5000|$|Legislators {{in several}} states {{introduced}} bills based upon a model act, written by anti-surveillance activists, called the [...] "Fourth Amendment Protection Act".The bills seek to prohibit state governments from co-operating with the NSA in various ways: <b>the</b> Utah <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> prohibit provision of water to NSA facilities; <b>the</b> California <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> prohibit state universities from conducting research for the NSA;and <b>the</b> Kansas <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> require a search warrant for data collection.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> trail 24-10 in {{the fourth}} quarter, but they {{would come back to}} tie the game after Marquise Goodwin caught a 40-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Thad Lewis and force overtime. In the extra period, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> get <b>the</b> ball first, but would be forced to punt after they went 3 and out. The Bengals would return the punt 39 yards to set them up in field goal range. A couple of plays later, Mike Nugent would kick the game winning 43-yard field goal to end the game.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's {{statement that he}} intended to bring the bill to a vote before the full Senate, the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more attention than civil unions and <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance. Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have little chance of success.|$|E
5|$|On March 29, Confederate {{president}} Jefferson Davis {{called on}} the Confederate Congress to pass a conscription bill. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> require a three-year term of service for all able-bodied white men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35. At first, the bill was unpopular, but as the military situation grew more desperate for the Confederacy, both houses quickly passed it. Still, the measure caused some to question Davis' military decisions; among them was Burnett, usually one of Davis' staunchest allies. In an April 19, 1862 address to the legislature, Burnett denounced Davis' preference for those who were, like Davis himself, graduates of West Point. The speech drew such a vigorous positive response from the gallery that some of the most zealous had to be removed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> 1970 Buffalo <b>Bills</b> {{season was}} <b>the</b> 11th {{season for the}} club and their first in the National Football League. The team looked to improve on its 4-10 record from 1969 and make {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 1966. However, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> started out on the wrong foot, losing 4 of its first 5 games. After winning 2 {{straight}} road games against the Patriots and Jets and suffering a blowout loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> and Colts played to a 17-17 draw in week 9, Buffalo's first tie since 1968. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> then lose 5 straight to end the season and finish the season 3-10-1, in fourth place in the AFC East. Their week 5 game against the Miami Dolphins would start a stage of futility in which <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> lose 20 straight games to <b>the</b> Dolphins. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> not beat <b>the</b> Dolphins at any point during the 70s and would not beat Miami again until 1980. This would become known as [...] "The Streak".|$|R

50|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> hosting <b>the</b> 0-6 Chargers, it {{was widely}} {{expected}} that <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>would</b> {{get back on track}} upon returning home for their Week 7 matchup. However, what ensued was a hard-fought victory rather than a dominant one.|$|R
5|$|On May 9, 1921, {{striking}} of the Morgan dollar resumed at the Philadelphia Mint {{under the}} recoinage {{called for by}} the Pittman Act. The same day, Congressman Vestal introduced the Peace dollar authorization bill as a joint resolution. Vestal placed his bill on the Unanimous Consent Calendar, but Congress adjourned for a lengthy recess without taking any action. When Congress returned, Vestal asked for unanimous consent that the bill pass on August 1, 1921. However, one representative, former Republican leader James R. Mann (Illinois) objected, and numismatic historian Roger Burdette suggests that Mann's stature in the House ensured that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> not pass. Nevertheless, Vestal met with the ANA {{and told them that}} he hoped Congress would reconsider when it met again in December 1921.|$|E
5|$|The King {{sought a}} divorce, but his advisors {{suggested}} that any divorce proceedings might involve {{the publication of}} details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured {{the introduction of the}} Pains and Penalties Bill, under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at Westminster Abbey, on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she thought she had been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|The silver coinage issue had {{not been}} much {{discussed}} in the 1888 campaign and Harrison {{is said to have}} favored a bimetallist position. However, his appointment of a silverite Treasury Secretary, William Windom, encouraged the free silver supporters. Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but at its own value, not at a fixed ratio to gold. This failed to facilitate a compromise between the factions. In July 1890, Senator Sherman achieved passage of a bill, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, in both houses. Harrison thought that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply, a problem that would persist until the second Cleveland administration resolved it.|$|E
25|$|All three {{representatives from}} Nevis, {{including}} {{the leader of}} the opposition in the Nevis Island Assembly, objected to the introduction of these <b>bills</b> into <b>the</b> National Assembly in Saint Kitts, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>would</b> affect <b>the</b> ability of Nevis to develop its offshore financial services sector and that <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>would</b> be detrimental to the Nevis economy. All the representatives in opposition in the National Assembly shared the conviction that <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> if passed into law, would be unconstitutional and undermine the constitutional and legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration, as well as result in the destruction of the economy of Nevis.|$|R

5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have eliminated the Joint Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 2016, James Reilly, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, {{announced}} that the Irish Government had approved {{the publication of the}} Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> amend the Adoption Act 2010 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill are to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they have cared for the child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless of marital status to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. The bill also allows for the adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in the adoption process, among many other reforms to the adoption system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill was signed into law by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. The commencement order was signed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, on 18 October and the law went into effect the following day.|$|E
5|$|Once {{passed by}} the Senate, a bill {{is sent to the}} House of Delegates for consideration. If the House also approves the bill without amendment, it is sent to the Governor. If there is amendment, however, the Senate may either reconsider the bill with {{amendments}} or ask {{for the establishment of a}} conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber. Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the Governor, it may either be signed or vetoed. If it is signed, it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation, usually October 1 of that year. If it is vetoed, both the Senate and the House of Delegates must vote by a three-fifths majority to overturn the veto. They may not, however, overturn a veto in the first year of a new term, since <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have been passed during the previous session. Additionally, joint resolutions and the budget bill may not be vetoed, although the General Assembly is constitutionally limited in the extent to which it may influence the latter; it may only decrease the Governor's budget proposal, not increase it.|$|E
50|$|In August 1982, Treen vetoed twenty-four <b>bills</b> {{passed by}} <b>the</b> {{legislature}} {{on the premise}} that most would have added expense to the already strained state budget.

5000|$|In March 2017, {{state legislators}} {{in both the}} Maine state House and Senate began writing {{legislation}} that would preserve retail net metering. <b>The</b> <b>bills</b> <b>would</b> make it temporary in the short term. In early 2017, the Maine Public Utilities Commission approved new limits that will eventually phase out net metering, beginning in 2018. <b>The</b> House <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> [...] "fully save retail net metering." [...] A group called the Maine Environmental Priorities Coalition supports the legislation. <b>The</b> Senate <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> reinstate net metering while regulators examine [...] "how advanced metering can help better determine {{the costs and benefits}} of rooftop solar." [...] The solar industry is supporting that bill. In February 2017, a group called the Natural Resources Council of Maine [...] "vowed to continue fighting new net metering restrictions." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} threatened another dissolution if {{the bill}} for the Parliament Act were not passed, and followed through on their threat when opposition in the Lords did not diminish. The general election of December produced little change from January. The calling of a second dissolution of parliament now {{seems to have been}} contrary to the wishes of Edward VII. Edward had died in May 1910 while the crisis was still in progress. His successor, George V, was asked if he would be prepared to create sufficient peers, which he would only do if the matter arose. This would have meant creating over 400 new Liberal peers. The King did, however, demand that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>would</b> have to be rejected at least once by the Lords before his intervention. Two amendments made by the Lords were rejected by the Commons, and opposition to the bill showed little sign of reducing. This led Asquith to declare the King's intention to overcome the majority in the House of Lords by creating sufficient new peers. The bill was finally passed in the Lords by 131 votes to 114 votes, a majority of 17. This reflected a large number of abstentions.|$|E

50|$|Running back O.J. Simpson {{would have}} a stellar year, despite <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> poor team record. Simpson would rush for 742 yards on 183 attempts.
