40|$|This {{research}} {{is intended to}} validate the measurement model of organization reputation, strategic leadership, and organization culture as a resources-based view. The essence of the measurment model as follow as: (1) <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> good employer is <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> organization reputation will be; (2) <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> ability to think strategically is <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> strategic leadership is; and (3) <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> freedom to grow and to fail is <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> organization culture is. The measurement model based on theoretical framework successfully reaches convergent validity and composite reliability. This measurement model of intangible asset in the organization base of resource based view {{to be used in}} advanced research on corporate entrepreneurship. The revalidation of measurement model in wider context and population, for example the small business sector, becomes the agenda of the future research. For practical purpose, the usage of measurement model indicators can be accomplished...|$|R

5|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1897, United States President William McKinley signed {{the treaty of}} annexation for the Republic of Hawaii, but it failed to pass in the United States Senate after the Kūʻē Petitions were submitted by Kaulia, Kalauokalani, John Richardson and William Auld as evidence of <b>the</b> <b>strong</b> resistance of the Native Hawaiian community to annexation. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because they were asking {{for the restoration of}} the queen and the delegates. The petitions were used as evidence of <b>the</b> <b>strong</b> resistance of the Hawaiian community to annexation and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by means of a joint resolution called the Newlands Resolution, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

40|$|We {{have now}} tested the Finch Committee's Hypothesis that Green Open Access Mandates are {{ineffective}} in generating deposits in institutional repositories. With data from ROARMAP on institutional Green OA mandates and data from ROAR on institutional repositories, {{we show that}} deposit number and rate is significantly correlated with mandate strength (classified as 1 - 12) : <b>The</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> mandate, the more <b>the</b> deposits. <b>The</b> <b>strongest</b> mandates generate deposit rates of 70 %+ within 2 years of adoption, compared to the un-mandated deposit rate of 20 %. The effect is already detectable at the national level, where the UK, which has the largest proportion of Green OA mandates, has a national OA rate of 35 %, compared to the global baseline of 25 %. The conclusion is that, contrary to the Finch Hypothesis, Green Open Access Mandates do have a major effect, and <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> mandate, <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> effect (the Liege ID/OA mandate, linked to research performance evaluation, being <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> mandate model).

5|$|Determined {{to avoid}} battle, Lacrosse turned southeast, hoping {{to use his}} wider spread of sail to outrun his {{opponent}} in <b>the</b> <b>strong</b> winds. Pellew, however, manoeuvred to cut the Droits de l'Homme off from the French coast, at this stage still unsure {{of the nature of}} his opponent. As the chase developed, the weather, which had been violent for the entire preceding month, worsened. An Atlantic gale swept the Ushant headland, driving a blizzard eastwards and whipping the sea into a turbulent state, making steering and aiming more difficult. At 16:15, two of Droits de l'Hommes topmasts broke in <b>the</b> <b>strong</b> winds. This dramatically slowed the French ship, and allowed Pellew, who had recognised his opponent as a French ship of the line, to close with Droits de l'Homme.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop and}} analyze {{a model of}} {{strategic}} redistricting. Two parties choose optimal redistricting plans for their respective territory.

We show that in the unique equilibrium, parties maximally segregate their opponent’s supporters but pool their own supporters into uniform districts. We show that <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> a party gets, the more it segregates. Hence, of the two competing par-ties, ceteris paribus, <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> party segregates more than the weaker one. Finally, we show that if the district level uncertainty is sufficiently small, <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> party chooses polarizing policies while the weaker party accommodates <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> party’s supporters...|$|R
