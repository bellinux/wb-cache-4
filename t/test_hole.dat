5000|$|The Alba Regia cave is {{the third}} deepest cave in the country. Its {{exploration}} was begun in 1975 and due to the hostile environment it took {{for quite a long}} time. In October, the entrance <b>test</b> <b>hole,</b> which depth is almost five meters, was dug. Exploratories went along the next 30 metres through strait routes full of scree. Then, beyond some crannies, they reached the so-called [...] "Explorer branch" [...] of the cave in which the first stalagmites could be seen. At the bottom of the <b>test</b> <b>hole,</b> sunk in extremely difficult circumstances, the channel was opened on 24 October. The air temperature of the inner passages of Cave Alba Regia is about 7 degrees lower than the Hungarian average 8,1-8,5°C. During the exploration, the strong enrichment of carbon dioxide in some passages became apparent. It is Istvan Eszterhas who collects and converses the wildlife of the cave that was wholly closed until its discovery. He started trapping in 1976, and even in that year he could differentiate between 21 species. In 1977, the number of cave creatures increased to 56, and in 1979, it was as high as 70. The cave can be visited only with a permission and a professional guide.|$|E
50|$|For leach line testing, {{a minimum}} of three test holes are drilled, most {{commonly}} six to eight inches in diameter.

50|$|System tests {{could be}} {{conducted}} {{in one of two}} ways: In a coded pull station, there is either a <b>test</b> <b>hole</b> on the front (usually activated with an Allen wrench) or a test switch on the inside. Turning the switch one way causes the notification appliances to sound continuously (or in the case of single-stroke bells, ding once). Turning it the other way and then activating the pull allows a silent test to be done in which the station's mechanical parts are checked to ensure proper function. Once pulled, the station would do at least four rounds of code before resetting itself. Coded pulls were typically used in new fire alarm systems until roughly the 1950s, and then occasionally into the 1970s. Until the early 1990s, some panels were made with an extra zone to accommodate any existing coded pull stations. Nowadays, coded pull stations are very rare and almost never seen in working fire alarm systems.|$|E

40|$|In 1930, the Conservation and Survey Division of the University of Nebraska and the U. S. Geological Survey began {{a program}} of {{cooperative}} groundwater studies in Nebraska. Since then test drilling by use of rotary drilling equipment has been {{an integral part of}} that program. This report contains logs of all the test holes drilled in the county under the program as well as those drilled by the Conservation and Survey Division with financial assistance from other government agencies. The map in this report shows the location of all test holes drilled in the county since 1930. Present techniques of test-hole logging and sampling include use of drilling mud suitable to drilling conditions, timing by stopwatch of the drilling of each 5 -foot increment of depth, and removal of all cuttings from the <b>test</b> <b>hole</b> at intervals of 5 feet or less. During the drilling of the hole, cuttings from each interval are examined immediately; samples representing each 5 -foot interval and each recognizable change in material are retained. After samples are washed, they are described lithologically and the color is evaluated by comparison with standard color charts. The samples then are dried, stored, and cataloged. Beginning in September 1951, the test holes have been logged electrically. All samples are processed and kept on open file in the offices of Conservation and Survey Division, 113 Nebraska Hall, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, 68588. This publication is one of a series being issued to make more readily available the record of test holes drilled since 1930. The series of publications is made on a county basis and includes, with some exceptions, logs of all test holes drilled in each of the counties. The logs have not been reviewed for conformance with editorial standards and nomenclature. The method whereby the altitude of the land surface at test-hole sites was determined is indicated in the heading of each log, as follows: a = altimeter, h = hand leveling, I = spirit leveling, t = estimated from topographic map. The test-hole records accurately reflect subsurface conditions only at the locations where the test holes were drilled. Interpretive data reflecting probable subsurface conditions between test-holes are being compiled for publication in county reports and are available for inspection {{in the office of the}} Conservation and Survey Division. Each <b>test</b> <b>hole</b> is identified by a number assigned in the field (for example # 3 -B- 67, # 41 - 79), and most are also identified by a number indicating its location within the land divisions of the U.
