500|$|In August 2007, Microsoft {{issued its}} Game Content Usage Rules, a license {{intended}} {{to address the}} legal status of machinima based on its games, including the Halo series. Microsoft intended the rules to be [...] "flexible", and, because it was unilateral, the license was legally unable to reduce rights. However, machinima artists, such as Edgeworks Entertainment, protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's fictional universes (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works. Compounding the reaction was the license's statement, [...] "If you do any of these things, you can expect to hear from Microsoft's lawyers who will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to stop distributing your items right away." ...|$|E

Your doctor <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease and gives you levodopa, a 60 -year-old {{treatment}} that temporarily relieves your symptoms.

5000|$|When a judge {{calls an}} {{argument}} [...] "ridiculous" [...] or [...] "frivolous," [...] {{it is absolutely}} the worst thing the judge could say. It means that the person arguing the position has absolutely {{no idea of what}} he is doing, and has completely wasted everyone's time. It doesn't mean that the case wasn't well argued, or that judge simply decided for the other side, it means that there was no other side. The argument was absolutely, positively, incompetent. The judge is not <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were [...] "wrong." [...] The judge is <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are out of your mind.|$|R

Because I will never, ever, ever jump again. I'm through."

2500|$|That same day, Wurzelbacher also {{appeared}} on Good Morning America. Diane Sawyer {{asked him if}} he was taking home $250,000 now, Wurzelbacher said with a laugh [...] "No, not even close." [...] Sawyer asked Wurzelbacher, [...] "And the McCain camp, some people have said did they contact you and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were {{going to be a major}} part of this, and had they contacted you before that encounter with Senator Obama?" [...] Wurzelbacher answered, [...] "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as if I was going to be on the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. I just happened to be here and Barack Obama happened to show up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Runner {{up of the}} {{eleventh}} series, Vana Koutsomitis criticized the living conditions that candidates live in; granted they are accommodated in a lavish house, Vana claimed that the bosses impose living conditions similar to Big Brother - with strict rules and zero contact with outsiders. She said [...] "They just throw you into a house and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have no phone, no internet and you’ll have no {{contact with the outside}} world, You can only talk to your family once a week for 10 minutes and that’s monitored.

[...] She continued; [...] "I think that element of cabin fever and psychological torture is not necessary for a business competition. I don’t believe that you need to isolate people. I think you can gauge people’s business skills without putting them in that environment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{founding}} {{leader of}} the group, David Chemla was born in Tunisia and raised in France. He was a former IDF officer {{who served in the}} Yom Kippur War in the Paratroopers Brigade. He left for France in 1977 after 10 years in Israel. He is chairman of Peace Now in France. He said the group seeks to support Israel's long-term future because [...] "as friends, as Jews, we want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are going down a wrong path. I think our initiative is actually helping Israel's image in Europe. It is a pretty low image over here these days, because of what happened in Gaza, mainly, and it is commonly believed in Europe that Israel is the provocative, negative side of the conflict—the one that is blocking the peace process." [...] He claimed that [...] "We’re not saying that only Israel is responsible for the problem. As Jews tied to Israel, we speak to the Israelis. So this is a call to the Israelis, but of course [...] have a lot of the responsibility for the continuation of the conflict." [...] He affirmed, on behalf of the membership that [...] "our connection to the state of Israel is part of our identity," [...] but in Europe [...] "Israel is seen as responsible for all the problems [...]" [...] Chemla added that the group's was not a movement as such after the first petition but hoped to become one.|$|E
