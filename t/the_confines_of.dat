60|$|But {{the truth}} of this Proposition will farther appear by observing, that in the Superficies interceding two {{transparent}} Mediums, (such as are Air, Water, Oil, common Glass, Crystal, metalline Glasses, Island Glasses, white transparent Arsenick, Diamonds, &c.) the Reflexion is stronger or weaker accordingly, as the Superficies hath a greater or less refracting Power. For in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Air and Sal-gem 'tis stronger than in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Air and Water, and still stronger in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Air and common Glass or Crystal, and stronger in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Air and a Diamond. If any of these, and such like transparent Solids, be immerged in Water, its Reflexion becomes, much weaker than before; and still weaker if they be immerged in the more strongly refracting Liquors of well rectified Oil of Vitriol or Spirit of Turpentine. If Water be distinguish'd into two parts by any imaginary Surface, the Reflexion in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> those two parts is none at all. In <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Water and Ice 'tis very little; in that of Water and Oil 'tis something greater; in that of Water and Sal-gem still greater; and in that of Water and Glass, or Crystal or other denser Substances still greater, accordingly as those Mediums differ more or less in their refracting Powers. Hence in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> common Glass and Crystal, {{there ought to be a}} weak Reflexion, and a stronger Reflexion in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> common and metalline Glass; though I have not yet tried this. But in <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> two Glasses of equal density, there is not any sensible Reflexion; as was shewn in the first Observation. And the same may be understood of the Superficies interceding two Crystals, or two Liquors, or any other Substances in which no Refraction is caused. So then the reason why uniform pellucid Mediums (such as Water, Glass, or Crystal,) have no sensible Reflexion but in their external Superficies, where they are adjacent to other Mediums of a different density, is because all their contiguous parts have one and the same degree of density.|$|R
60|$|Obs. 5. Placing a Prism at the Window to refract the intromitted beam of Light, {{and cast}} the oblong Spectrum of Colours on the Speculum: I covered the Speculum {{with a black}} Paper which had {{in the middle of}} it a hole to let any one of the Colours pass through to the Speculum, whilst the rest were intercepted by the Paper. And now I found Rings of that Colour only which fell upon the Speculum. If the Speculum was {{illuminated}} with red, the Rings were totally red with dark Intervals, if with blue they were totally blue, and so of the other Colours. And when they were illuminated with any one Colour, the Squares of their Diameters measured between their most luminous Parts, were in the arithmetical Progression of the Numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and the Squares of the Diameters of their dark Intervals in the Progression of the intermediate Numbers 1/2, 1-1/2, 2-1/2, 3-1/2. But if the Colour was varied, they varied their Magnitude. In the red they were largest, in the indigo and violet least, and in the intermediate Colours yellow, green, and blue, they were of several intermediate Bignesses answering to the Colour, that is, greater in yellow than in green, and greater in green than in blue. And hence I knew, that when the Speculum was illuminated with white Light, the red and yellow on the outside of the Rings were produced by the least refrangible Rays, and the blue and violet by the most refrangible, and that the Colours of each Ring spread into the Colours of the neighbouring Rings on either side, after the manner explain'd in the first and second Part of this Book, and by mixing diluted one another so that they could not be distinguish'd, unless near the Center where they were least mix'd. For in this Observation I could see the Rings more distinctly, and to a greater Number than before, being able in the yellow Light to number eight or nine of them, besides a faint shadow of a tenth. To satisfy my self how much the Colours of the several Rings spread into one another, I measured the Diameters of the second and third Rings, and found them when made by <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red and orange to be to the same Diameters when made by <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> blue and indigo, as 9 to 8, or thereabouts. For it was hard to determine this Proportion accurately. Also the Circles made successively by the red, yellow, and green, differ'd more from one another than those made successively by the green, blue, and indigo. For the Circle made by the violet was too dark to be seen. To carry on the Computation, let us therefore suppose that the Differences of the Diameters of the Circles made by the outmost red, <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> red and orange, <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> orange and yellow, <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> yellow and green, <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> green and blue, <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> blue and indigo, <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> indigo and violet, and outmost violet, are in proportion as the Differences of the Lengths of a Monochord which sound the Tones in an Eight; sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, that is, as the Numbers 1/9, 1/18, 1/12, 1/12, 2/27, 1/27, 1/18. And if the Diameter of the Circle made by <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> red and orange be 9A, and that of the Circle made by <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> blue and indigo be 8A as above; their difference 9A-8A will be to the difference of the Diameters of the Circles made by the outmost red, and by <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> red and orange, as 1/18 + 1/12 + 1/12 + 2/27 to 1/9, that is as 8/27 to 1/9, or 8 to 3, and to the difference of the Circles made by the outmost violet, and by <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> blue and indigo, as 1/18 + 1/12 + 1/12 + 2/27 to 1/27 + 1/18, that is, as 8/27 to 5/54, or as 16 to 5. And therefore these differences will be 3/8A and 5/16A. Add the first to 9A and subduct the last from 8A, and you will have the Diameters of the Circles made by the least and most refrangible Rays 75/8A and ((61-1/2)/8)A. These diameters are therefore to one another as 75 to 61-1/2 or 50 to 41, and their Squares as 2500 to 1681, that is, as 3 to 2 very nearly. Which proportion differs not much from the proportion of the Diameters of the Circles made by the outmost red and outmost violet, in the 13th Observation of the first part of this Book.|$|R

Here, in the production <b>of</b> these Colours, <b>the</b> <b>Confine</b> <b>of</b> Shadow can have nothing to do.

Neither can these Colours arise from any new Modifications of the Light by Refractions, because they change successively from white to yellow, orange and red, while the Refractions remain the same, and also because the Refractions are made contrary ways by parallel Superficies which destroy one another's Effects.
