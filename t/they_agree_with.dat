25|$|Medicare sets a {{schedule}} of fees, called the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). The standard Medicare rebate is 100% of a general practitioner and 85% of a specialist schedule fee.

25|$|Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 27(f), respondent-appellee Commander S.L. Wright respectfully moves this Court to remand {{this case}} to the {{district}} court with instructions to dismiss it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Respondent-appellee has conferred with counsel for petitioner-appellant, and <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the briefing schedule proposed below. As explained below, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), Pub. L. No. 109-366 (see Attachment1), which took effect on October 17, 2006, removes federal court jurisdiction over pending and future habeas corpus actions and any other actions filed by or on behalf of detained aliens determined by the United States to be enemy combatants, such as petitioner-appellant al- Marri, except as provided in Section1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) of the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA). In plain terms, the MCA removes this Court's jurisdiction (as well as the district court's) over al-Marri's habeas action. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand {{the case to the}} district court with instructions to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Some people reject all {{claims that}} Cornwall is, or ought to be, {{distinct}} from England. While recognising {{that there are}} local peculiarisms, {{they point out that}} Yorkshire, Kent, and Cheshire (for example) also have local customs and identities that do not seem to undermine their essential Englishness. The legal claims concerning the Duchy, they argue, are without merit except as relics of mediaeval feudalism, and they contend that Stannary law applied not to Cornwall as a 'nation', but merely to the guild of tin miners. Rather, they argue that Cornwall has been not only in English possession, but part of England itself, either since Athelstan conquered it in 936, since the administrative centralisation of the Tudor dynasty, or since the creation of Cornwall County Council in 1888. Finally, <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> representatives of the Duchy itself that the Duchy is, in essence, a real estate company that serves to raise income for the Prince of Wales. They compare the situation of the Duchy of Cornwall with that of the Duchy of Lancaster, which has similar rights in Lancashire, which is indisputably part of England. The proponents of such perspectives include not only Unionists, but most branches and agencies of government.|$|E

500|$|Wellek and Warren note {{arguments}} that literature {{is a form}} of philosophy or, alternatively, that it is devoid of such ideas. [...] They reject extreme versions of these arguments. They write that [...] "a knowledge of the history of philosophy and of general ideas" [...] will be valuable for a researcher. However, they note that philosophical ideas may not have been consciously included in a work. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the German scholar Rudolf Unger that [...] "literature expresses a general attitude toward life, that poets usually answer, unsystematically, questions which are also themes of philosophy", in a manner that differs over time. They outline attempts at classifying these ideas, including through Weltanschauung ("world view") and Geistesgeschichte ("time spirit"), before showing shortcomings in these systems. They then write that students of literature, an art which may (but need not) parallel philosophical development, should focus on how ideas enter the work. Wellek and Warren argue that a work does not necessarily become better with more philosophical content.|$|E

The DVD commentary recorded by Parker and Stone for [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty" [...] has been cited as one of the primary reasons the commentaries {{were not included in the}} South Park Season One DVD release. Warner Bros., which released the DVD set, refused to include the commentaries due to [...] "standards" [...] issues with some of the statements unless Parker and Stone allowed the tracks to be edited, which they refused. Media outlets said the commentary that most bothered Warner Bros. executives was the one for [...] "Tom's Rhinoplasty", in which Parker and Stone say <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Garrison's character that the 1997 film Contact (also released by Warner Bros.) was [...] "terrible".

2500|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of polling data {{of support for}} same-sex marriage in Australia and membership demographics of the SDA found that the socially conservative positions of the SDA leadership - particularly de Bruyn - {{are likely to be}} at odds with the rank-and-file of the union. The lobby group Australian Marriage Equality challenged the SDA to survey its membership before contributing further to the same-sex marriage debate in Australia. In response to a 2014 poll with 72 percent support for same-sex marriage, de Bruyn dismissed the figures but refused to poll his members on the issue. He says he [...] "knows <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him absolutely. When we talk to our members about out these things <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> us". Some SDA-aligned Labor MPs do not agree with the SDA's stance on same-sex marriage and in fact support same-sex marriage in defiance of the SDA, some South Australian examples being Kate Ellis, Amanda Rishworth and Nick Champion.|$|E

Case-marked relative pronouns {{in the strict sense}} are almost entirely confined to European languages, where they are widespread except among the Celtic family and Indo-Aryan family.

2500|$|Chaplain {{groups and}} {{religious}} organizations took various positions on DADT. Some {{felt that the}} policy needed to be withdrawn to make the military more inclusive. The Southern Baptist Convention battled the repeal of DADT, warning that their endorsements for chaplains might be withdrawn if the repeal took place. They took the position that allowing gay {{men and women to}} serve in the military without restriction would {{have a negative impact on}} the ability of chaplains who think homosexuality is a sin to speak freely regarding their religious beliefs. The Roman Catholic Church called for the retention of the policy, but had no plans to withdraw its priests from serving as military chaplains. Sixty-five retired chaplains signed a letter opposing repeal, stating that repeal would make it impossible for chaplains whose faith teaches that same-sex behavior is immoral to minister to military service members. Other religious organizations and agencies called the repeal of the policy a [...] "non-event" [...] or [...] "non-issue" [...] for chaplains, claiming that chaplains have always supported military service personnel, whether or not <b>they</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> all their actions or beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|Although Whig grandees such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately {{agreed with}} Burke's Appeal, they {{wished he had}} used more {{moderate}} language. Fitzwilliam saw the Appeal as containing [...] "the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since". Francis Basset, a backbench Whig MP, wrote to Burke: [...] "...though for reasons which I will not now detail I did not then deliver my sentiments, I most perfectly differ from Mr. Fox & from the great Body of opposition on the French Revolution". Burke sent {{a copy of the}} Appeal to the king and the king requested a friend to communicate to Burke that he had read it [...] "with great Satisfaction". Burke wrote of its reception: [...] "Not one word from one of our party. They are secretly galled. <b>They</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox. ... They leave me to myself; they see that I can do myself justice". Charles Burney viewed it as [...] "a most admirable book—the best & most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen" [...] but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly.|$|E

The early part of the twentieth century was {{characterized}} by a series of false starts. In 1911, Arnold Harris Matthew (a former Roman Catholic priest, later consecrated an Old Catholic bishop), entered into union with the Oriental Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch under Metropolitan Gerasimos (Messarah) of Beirut and, in 1912, with the Eastern Orthodox Pope Photios of Alexandria. Bishop Mathew's 1909 [...] who wrote: [...] "...We have thanked God...that you omit the Filioque clause, and that you do not accept money for celebrating Masses.
