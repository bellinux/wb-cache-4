25|$|The {{aircraft}} was en-route to Campbeltown Airport in Argyll, Scotland, {{to pick up}} a <b>ten</b> <b>year-old</b> boy with acute abdominal pain, suspected to be appendicitis. After a flight that included many navigational irregularities, the pilot was flying the normal approach, which took the aircraft out to sea before turning back toward the airport. The pilot informed controllers that he had completed the turn, {{and that was the last}} transmission received from the aircraft. Investigators conclude the aircraft hit the water a few seconds after that transmission. Both occupants of the aircraft, the pilot and a paramedic seated at his station behind the pilot, were killed. The ensuing investigation concluded that the pilot allowed the aircraft to fly too low, and it descended unchecked into the sea. The pilot was also fatigued, overworked, lacked recent flying practise, and he might have suffered from an undetermined influence, such as disorientation, distraction, or subtle incapacitation, as evidenced by several navigational errors, miscommunications, and mismanagement of his instruments. Although the weather might have precluded a safe landing in Campbeltown, the weather was not a cause of the accident. The patient was eventually driven overland to a Glasgow hospital, where he was treated for a ruptured appendix.|$|E

40|$|Speaking {{openly about}} their ideas on race, these nine and <b>ten</b> <b>year-olds</b> show they have internalised the {{prevailing}} western mindset - whatever their own ethnicity.

It was conducted with a sample of Year 5 pupils in two predominantly white and two diverse schools, all of whom were themselves involved in the research process. The book is suffused with their vibrant, profound and original voices and their often surprising ideas. The children's views are accompanied by the researcher's sociologically informed close observation of school life and the views and practice of the teachers, and the book concludes with the important implications she identifies for policy and practice in schools.

40|$|It’s {{approaching}} {{sixty years}} since the term ‘teenager’ was coined in the UK. O 2 Money and LSE have worked in partnership to create a research report into youth spending, with an insightful look into the spending habits of 7 - 15 years olds across the UK. Spending by young people has continued to rise despite drops in parental disposable income. For the first time, the spending power of Britain’s young people has increased during a recession. The average young person will spend over £ 6, 000 {{between the ages of}} seven and fifteen, which equates to spending of £ 10. 27 per week for seven to <b>ten</b> <b>year-olds</b> and an average of £ 15. 25 per week for those aged between 11 and 15. In total, young people are worth £ 4. 89 billion to the British economy each year – twice the value of the UK toy industry. The spending power of young people has continued to increase significantly beyond the rate of inflation, meaning that in real terms, young people are wealthier now than they ever have been. In 1987, the average young person received £ 1. 18 per week and this contrasts with £ 6. 84 in 2009, an increase of 500 per cent. However the spending power young people have on a weekly basis goes significantly beyond pocket money. Whilst their income is £ 6. 84 per week, across the age groups, the same average spending figure is £ 13. 10 – meaning that young people are accessing an additional £ 6. 34 through part-time work, gifts from family or additional household chores to increase their spending power. This increased spending power is in contrast to their parents, who according to recent research from the Post Office (Customer Insight Research, April 2009) have been cutting back monthly spending across many essential items {{as a result of the}} recession, in particular, reducing expenditure on food by an average of £ 56 per month, on clothes by an average of £ 35 per month and on Petrol by £ 34. 20 per month. This would seem to suggest that parents are protecting their children from the direct impact of the recession. In addition to research around young people’s spending patterns, this chapter highlights the importance of improving money management among young people in the UK. Much of the current focus of policy is on activity within the classroom. This report complements this by focusing on activities outside the classroom, by looking into how parents and other agencies might be involved in providing money guidance for the young...|$|R

40|$|Music and {{religion}} are concepts, {{which have been}} continually associated with spirituality {{throughout the history of}} Western religion. Since the dawn of mankind, it has been considered that music has had a clear function about how individuals grasp their inner emotions to reach the transcendent and comprehend "Self". The aim of this thesis is to gain greater understanding as to how a group of young catechists in the Swedish Lutheran Church feel, interpret and construct their identities through popular music. An exploration as to how this specific group perceives concepts such as the Bible, church, spirituality, {{and religion}} was undertaken. The theory forming the basis of this essay is derived from a sociological perspective of postmodernism. <b>Ten</b> fourteen <b>year-old</b> students were subject to semi-structured, qualitative interviews, of which the results were analyzed using both phenomenology and phenomenography. Analysis of the results implies that this specific group of catechists demonstrated lacking the ability to locate and understand spiritual references or messages, regarding the Bible or transcendent, in popular music. It is the proposal of this study that the lack of understanding has four possible causes: a broken chain of tradition, a crisis of linguistic knowledge, music is used to comfort rather than to understand inner spirituality, and the church is used a resource to create social, cultural and traditional meaning to conclusions concerning life issues...|$|R
40|$|As the obesity {{epidemic}} in children increases, {{it is important}} to consider the role of neighborhoods in supporting children’s physical activity and healthy development, especially in low-income communities where obesity levels among children are higher than for their middle-income counterparts.

Girls walk shorter distances to and use different types of community spaces for play and recreation from boys, some of which is explained by the differing environmental-socialization approaches employed by parents and carers. Children’s perceptions of risk align spatially with features of the built environment, but do not correlate with reported crime. Results illustrate the utility of qualitative spatial analysis to understand relationships between children’s perception, the built environment, and social factors that shape children’s active transport, leisure, and recreation in their neighborhood. Children’s local knowledge should be valued and solicited in community-level health and planning interventions to promote physical activity. ...|$|R
40|$|While ‘voice’ is {{frequently}} invoked {{in discussions of}} pupils’ agency and empowerment, less {{attention has been paid}} to the dialogic dynamics of children’s voices and the sociocultural features shaping their emergence. Drawing on linguistic ethnographic research involving recent recordings of <b>ten</b> and eleven <b>year-old</b> children’s spoken language experience across the school day, this article examines how pupils’ voices are configured within institutional interactional contexts which render particular kinds of voice more or less hearable, and convey different kinds of value. Analysis shows how children appropriate and reproduce the authoritative voices of education, popular culture and parents in the course of their induction into social practices. At the same time they also express varying degrees of commitment to these voices and orchestrate their own and other people’s voices within accounts and anecdotes, making voice appropriation an uneven, accumulative process shot through with the dynamics of personal and peer-group experience. The examination of children’s dialogue from different contexts across the school day highlights the situated semiotics of voice and the heteroglossic development of children’s speaking consciousness...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} indicating {{a positive effect}} of acute physical activity on cognitive performance in children. Most of the evidence originates, however, from studies in highly controlled laboratory settings. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether the same effects can be found in more real-world settings. We examined the effects of qualitatively different acute physical activity interventions on the three core dimensions of executive functions (updating, inhibition, shifting). In an experimental between-subject design, 219 <b>ten</b> to twelve <b>year-olds</b> were assigned to one of four conditions which varied systematically in physical activation and cognitive engagement. Executive functions were measured before and immediately after the intervention. Contrary to the hypothesis, no effects of acute physical activity with and without cognitive engagement were found on executive functions in the overall sample. Only children with higher fitness and/or higher academic achievement benefitted from the interventions in terms of their updating performance. Thus, the results indicate that it may be more difficult to attain positive effects through acute physical activity in real-world settings than in laboratory settings and that physiological and cognitive requirements may have to be adjusted to individual capacity to make an intervention effective...|$|R
40|$|Focussing on <b>ten</b> {{and eleven}} <b>year-old</b> children’s ongoing {{informal}} talk in school, this chapter examines {{the emergence of}} their evaluative responses {{to a number of}} texts from popular culture which figure in their everyday lives. It looks in particular at how expressions of emotional reactions, judgements about behaviour and events and appreciation of the aesthetic value of the texts are mediated by the interactive entrainment of evaluation among friends. The data include highly heteroglossic exchanges about an episode of the UK television soap opera EastEnders, which children treat simultaneously as a ‘slice of live’ and as an artful text, revoicing characters and expressing feelings about the producers and the plot. In collaborative performances of musical fragments from films including Titanic and Mama Mia, and a rhythm and blues song by Rihanna: ‘Unfaithful’, children’s appreciation was expressed by entry into and appropriation of rhythmic and melodic forms, often strongly emotionally imbued. The children’s sensitivity to and appreciation of form is conveyed in the interactionally synchronised performance of song which confirms and intensifies social bonding. Judgement here is often implicit in children’s evaluative alliances with the singers whose voices and stances they are reproducing, but they could also distance themselves from these values, for example through playful revoicing. While children’s performances and discussion of the soap-opera and songs enact dominant cultural values and discourse, their revoicings and exchanges with peers also provide evidence of experimentation and play with a range of evaluative positions and with different degrees of commitment...|$|R

The aims of this work are to review and analyze the results of medical treatment of frontal recurrent dislocations on the shoulder with open surgery technique on the Clinic for Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology in Novi Sad in the period from 2002 to 2005. Twenty one patients with anterior recurrent dislocations of the shoulder were operated on, 19 men and 2 women. The average age of those patients was 24. 8 (15 - 40 <b>year-olds).</b> <b>Ten</b> patients had an injury of the left and 11 patients the injury of the right shoulder. There were eight handball players, four fighting skills players; two of them played volleyball and one was a basketball player. Six of them were not sportsmen. The preoperational and post operational mean value of the modified Rowe scale showed a statistically significant difference (P< 0. 001). Observing the patients after the operation in the period of 2 years, according to Neer scale, 3 patients (14. 28 %) had great results (grade over 90), 16 patients (76. 19 %) had a good result, (75 - 89), and only two patients (9. 52 %) had results less than 75. The measuring of the volume of movements after physical treatment in 12 patients (57. 14 %) has shown the decrease of the outside rotation.

40|$|Abstract Background Teaching {{of motor}} skills is {{fundamental}} to physical therapy practice. In order to optimize the benefits of these teaching and training efforts, various forms of patient education material are developed and handed out to patients. One very important fact has been overlooked. While comparative effectiveness of various modes of instruction has been studied in adults, attention has not {{been paid to the}} fact that learning capabilities of children are different from that of adults. The intent of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of video and handout mode of instructions specifically on children. Methods A total of 115 normal elementary-age children aged 10 to 12 years of age were studied. The children were randomized into two groups: A) the video group, and B) the handout group. The video group viewed the video for physical therapy exercises while the handout group was provided with paper handouts especially designed according to the readability of their age group. Results Statistical analysis using the student's't' test showed that subjects of both the video and handout groups exhibited equal overall performance accuracy. There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups both in acquisition and retention accuracy tests. Conclusion The findings of the present study suggest that if the readability and instructional principles applicable to different target age groups are strictly adhered to, then both video as well as handout modes of instructions result in similar feedback and memory recall in <b>ten</b> to twelve <b>year-old</b> children. Principles of readability related to the patient age are of utmost importance when designing the patient education material. These findings suggest that the less expensive handouts can be an effective instructional aid for teaching exercises to children with various neuromuscular, rheumatic, and orthopedics conditions and the most costly videotape techniques are not necessarily better. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study seeks {{to explore and}} illuminate the lived experience {{of a group of}} <b>ten</b> and eleven <b>year-old</b> children, playing in and around the popular multiplayer, sandbox videogame, Minecraft, during a year-long after-school club. Drawing on the work of Deleuze and Guattari (1987) the research employs a playful and emergent methodology, referred to as ‘rhizomic ethnography’, which provides a suite of approaches as a means of exploring the complexity of the social world. This poststructuralist study also builds upon existing research around play, New Literacy Studies, new literacies, space and place, multimodality, multiliteracies and virtual worlds. The accounts that constitute this thesis draw from a pool of rich and varied data, generated using a number of participatory and visual methods, including child-produced video, audio, screencasts, photography, fieldnotes and virtual model-making discussion sessions. In response to this data, this thesis takes a novel approach to representation, drawing on a range of modes. This results in a hybrid text that includes comic strips, illustration and audio, as a means of transcribing and representing the complexity that is the children’s lived experience. Using different selections of data, I investigate the lived experience from three alternative but interconnected perspectives, employing the Deleuzian trope of the plateau. Firstly, I examine how the children’s play worked across the on and off-screen spaces in this complex hybrid site. With a particular focus on the children’s construction of the virtual community that they named ‘Banterbury’, I demonstrate how the game itself shaped the club. Secondly, I show how the children’s interactions regularly drew on aspects of their lives outside of the club, revealing the club as a social site of play, driven by a range of resources from children’s everyday experiences and wider culture. Thirdly, through a focus on the club’s soundscape, I reveal how the children’s play often had a mischievous and exuberant quality. Finally, reading across, between and beyond these three plateaus, I conclude by examining how the lived experience of the club was characterised by an emergent playfulness. Therefore, as well as contributing to the existing literature on virtual world play and demonstrating methodological potential for application in other contexts, this thesis also offers new insights into what constitutes the emergent dimension of play. This has implications for how we consider the kind of opportunities provided for children to interact and drive their own play experiences, with or without technology...|$|R
