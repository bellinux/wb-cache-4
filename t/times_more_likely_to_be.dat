5|$|Another {{study found}} that the risk of {{predation}} for a bird targeted by a Eurasian sparrowhawk or northern goshawk increased 25-fold if the prey was infected with the blood parasite Leucocytozoon, and birds with avian malaria were 16 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are three <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Cone beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) is a three-dimensional radiographic technique used in planning implant therapy to help clinicians determine {{the volume and}} dimension of bone available for implant placement, and CBCT images potentially depict coincident findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred eighteen patients received CBCT scans prior to receiving implants, which were interpreted by blinded board-certified oral and maxillofacial radiologists. All incidental findings were defined as non-tooth-related pathologies or abnormalities. These findings were categorized and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The patients {{ranged in age from}} 16 to 91 years (mean age for men, 64. 73 ± 15. 05 years; for women, 62. 47 ± 15. 83 years). Controlling for age, men were 2. 13 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have sinus pathology than women. Patients over age 65 were 5. 01 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate vascular pathology (eg, carotid artery calcification) than patients ages 41 to 65; the likelihood versus patients ages 16 to 40 was 13. 39. Women were 2. 63 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> display brain pathology (eg, pineal or pituitary calcifications). Controlling for gender, patients ages 41 to 65 were 3. 17 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> exhibit condylar pathology (eg, degenerative changes) than patients ages 16 to 40. Similarly, patients above age 65 were 3. 53 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> show condylar pathology than patients ages 16 to 40, and women were 1. 61 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have condylar pathology than men. Versus patients ages 16 to 40, patients ages 41 to 65 were 17. 69 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> show signs of vertebral pathology (eg, degenerative disc changes) and patients over age 65 were 28. 67 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> display vertebral pathology. CONCLUSION: CBCT scans frequently reveal non-tooth-related pathologies and/or abnormalities {{in the head and neck}} region. Therefore, comprehensive review of the entire CBCT image set is necessary...|$|R

40|$|Neurological {{diseases}} {{are common in}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, but their exact prevalence is unknown. Method We prospectively evaluated the presence of neurological disorders in 121 patients with IBD [51 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 70 with ulcerative colitis (UC) ] and 50 controls (gastritis and dyspepsia) over 3 years. Results Our standard neurological evaluation (that included electrodiagnostic testing) revealed that CD patients were 7. 4 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop large-fiber neuropathy than controls (p = 0. 045), 7. 1 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop any type of neuromuscular condition (p = 0. 001) and 5. 1 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop autonomic complaints (p = 0. 027).

25|$|One {{area where}} hypersegregation {{seems to have}} the {{greatest}} effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent crimes in the U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s. Despite this number, the crime rates in the hypersegregated inner-cities of America are rising. As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shot to death and nine <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> murdered than their European American peers. Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans. Research has proven that the more segregated the surrounding European American suburban ring is, the rate of violent crime in the inner-city will rise, but, likewise, crime in the outer area will drop.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} of the PON1 polymorphisms varies with ethnicity.

In the southern US African-Americans are five <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> RR than Caucasians. In contrast the PON1-55M allele is much less frequent in Oriental and black African populations compared to Caucasians and are extremely rare or absent in some populations e.g. Thais.
