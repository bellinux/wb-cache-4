5|$|Although most methamphetamine users {{lived in}} Asia {{in the early}} 2000s, {{the use of the}} drug {{increased}} dramatically {{in other parts of the}} world in that decade. In areas where use of the drug has become common, meth mouth is often widespread. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> expensive to treat and has strained public health resources, prompting concerns among dental authorities in several countries about the burden of treatment.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{biochemist}} David Dolphin {{proposed a}} link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore. Noting that <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> treated by intravenous haem, he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In children, {{particularly}} those younger {{than six years}} old, the diagnosis can be difficult and <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> often initially mistaken (sometimes {{for up to two}} weeks) for other causes of pains and difficulty walking, such as viral infections, or bone and joint problems.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} by Dr. Alfred H. Freiberg in 1914. He initially thought <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> caused by acute physical trauma, {{which is why}} it was initially called an infraction.|$|R

5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so {{within minutes of}} the injury, due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway and to other injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late deaths that occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> not recognized and treated early, serious complications {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and bronchiectasis may occur as late complications. Years can pass before <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> {{difficult}} to treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, {{as well as}} oral hygiene instruction. It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> {{inherited}} in an {{autosomal recessive}} pattern. In order to inherit it, {{both of the}} parents of an individual must carry an affected gene. Most have no family history of the condition. People with only one abnormal gene are called carriers (heterozygotes) and may have mild, but medically insignificant, abnormalities of copper metabolism.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} stabilization of switching nonlinear systems represented by TS models. To develop <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> we use two different switching Lyapunov functions. For each Lyapunov function {{a set of}} <b>conditions</b> <b>is</b> developed. <b>The</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> formulated as LMIs and relaxed using delays in the controller and the Lyapunov function. The application of <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>is</b> illustrated on numerical examples...|$|R

5|$|White-nose {{syndrome}} (WNS) is {{an emerging}} disease in North American bats which by 2012 {{was associated with}} at least 5-7 million bat deaths. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> named for a distinctive fungal growth around the muzzles and {{on the wings of}} hibernating bats and was first identified from a February 2006 photo taken in a cave in Schoharie County, New York.|$|E
5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{play a role}} in the {{development}} of COPD. It is more common among relatives of those with COPD who smoke than unrelated smokers. Currently, the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT). This risk is particularly high if someone deficient in alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes. It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases and <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people. Other genetic factors are being investigated, of which there are likely to be many.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{named for}} German physician Georg Sack, who described {{a single case}} in 1936, and British surgeon A.P. Barabas, who described two cases in 1967. Barabas recognized that <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of inherited disorders affecting connective tissue. This <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> now called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type EDS type IV.|$|R

5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E
5|$|Images of meth mouth {{are usually}} {{considered}} disturbing {{and have been}} used in anti-drug campaigns, even being placed on hoardings/billboards. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> often mentioned in media coverage of methamphetamine, and it has been included in media portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate the scope of the drug's effects or to provoke disgust in the audience. Opponents argue that the term is used to negatively stereotype methamphetamine users, and that it is falsely portrayed as inevitable or characteristic.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> first {{reported}} by Alibert in 1837, who called it cutis sulcata. A clinical description of <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> provided by Robert in 1843 {{and was named}} by Unna in 1907. It has also been called Robert-Unna syndrome, bulldog scalp, corrugated skin, cutis verticis plicata, and pachydermia verticis gyrata.|$|R

5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain. For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondrosis, or {{surficial}} pits in bone {{at places}} where bones articulate, {{is also known}} in Edmontosaurus. This condition, resulting from cartilage failing {{to be replaced by}} bone during growth, was found to be present in 2.2% of 224edmontosaur toe bones. The underlying cause of <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> unknown. Genetic predisposition, trauma, feeding intensity, alterations in blood supply, excess thyroid hormones, and deficiencies in various growth factors have been suggested. Among dinosaurs, osteochondrosis (like tumors) is most commonly found in hadrosaurids.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> {{developed}} {{at the age of}} 42, and women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. <b>The</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
5|$|The various nicknames {{associated}} with prepatellar bursitis {{arise from the}} fact that it commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling, such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, plumbers, and roofers. The exact incidence of <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> not known; it is difficult to estimate because only severe septic cases require hospital admission, and mild non-septic cases generally go unreported. Prepatellar bursitis is more common among males than females. It affects all age groups, but is more likely to be septic when it occurs in children.|$|E
5|$|The white lion {{is not a}} {{distinct}} subspecies, but a special morph with a genetic condition, leucism, that causes paler colouration akin {{to that of the}} white tiger; <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> similar to melanism, which causes dark skin. They are not albinos, but have normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lion individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in captivity, where breeders deliberately select them. The unusual cream colour of their coats is caused by a recessive allele. Reportedly, they have been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts.|$|E
