5|$|Even {{though some}} of his {{soldiers}} came within 60 meters of the pillbox, after 19 of them (over a third) were killed and the sun began rising in the horizon, Kotzer decided to retreat, unable to receive official permission due to communication problems. He ordered all of his troops to collect the wounded and any weapons they could carry, helping with the task himself. The dead were left in the field, including <b>the</b> <b>medics</b> (not a single medic survived). The injured were brought under fire into the wadi and at about 07:00 the force {{made its way to}} an unoccupied two-storey building on the east bank. After the Egyptians started shelling the building with mortars, Kotzer's company began to move towards Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to <b>the</b> <b>medics</b> and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E

5000|$|Under his {{original}} identity as an unnamed combat medic, he was employed by Big Boss's Militaires Sans Frontieres private forces. <b>The</b> <b>medic's</b> face is never fully shown, partially obscured {{when he is}} on-screen, and his voice is filtered {{to give him a}} lower pitch than Big Boss's. He accompanies Big Boss to Mother Base in a helicopter following the extraction of Ricardo Valenciano Libre and Paz Ortega Andrade from a U.S. Naval prison facility in Cuba in 1975. While <b>the</b> <b>medic</b> successfully removes a time bomb that was implanted inside Paz's abdomen, he fails to notice the second bomb within Paz's womb. When the second bomb goes off, <b>the</b> <b>medic</b> shields Big Boss from the blast, causing the helicopter to crash in the process. The two men, along with Kazuhira Miller, survive the crash, but <b>the</b> <b>medic</b> ends up losing his left arm while fragments of bones and teeth are buried within his body, including a large piece of shrapnel lodged within his cerebral cortex. Both Big Boss and <b>the</b> <b>medic</b> fall into a coma for the next nine years. During his coma, <b>the</b> <b>medic</b> was transferred to a hospital in Cyprus, where he was subjected to a process of subconscious brainwashing and facial reconstruction in order to become Big Boss's mental doppelganger and draw attention away from the real Big Boss.|$|R
5|$|The {{verdict was}} treated with scepticism by much of the {{international}} media and the U.S. government of President Jimmy Carter. On 2 February 1978, {{based on the evidence}} given at the inquest, {{the attorney general of the}} Eastern Cape stated that he would not prosecute the officers. After the inquest, Biko's family brought a civil case against the state; at the advice of their lawyers, they agreed to a settlement of R65,000 (US$78,000) in July 1979. Shortly after the inquest, the South African Medical and Dental Council initiated proceedings against the medical professionals who had been entrusted with Biko's care; eight years later two of <b>the</b> <b>medics</b> were found guilty of improper conduct. The failure of the government-employed doctors to diagnose or treat Biko's injuries has been frequently cited as an example of a repressive state influencing medical practitioners' decisions, and Biko's death as evidence of the need for doctors to serve the needs of patients before those of the state.|$|E

She decides {{on her own}} to try to infiltrate the Capitol and kill Snow. Her team follows her. In the intense urban warfare that ensues, most of Katniss's comrades, including Finnick, are killed. Katniss perseveres alone. As she reaches Snow's mansion, a hoverplane drops parachutes carrying bombs, some of which explode {{among a group of}} children being used as human shields around the mansion. Rebel medics (including Katniss's sister Prim) rush in to help the injured children, but in a calculated move, the rest of the bombs go off, taking a heavy toll on <b>the</b> <b>medics.</b> Prim is killed and Katniss sustains severe burns, but the rebels succeed in taking the Capitol.|$|E
5|$|Early on 15 July, the 1st Parachute Brigade heard {{tank fire}} {{to the south of}} their position. Brigadier Lathbury sent out a patrol to investigate, which located the tanks and {{infantry}} of XIII Corps that had halted just south of them the previous night. The 1st Parachute Brigade and 50th (Northumbrian) Division now moved forward together. The main dressing station, which had continued to operate after being captured, was liberated by the 2nd Parachute Battalion. In an attempt to recapture Primosole Bridge the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, supported by the 44th Royal Tank Regiment, carried out a number of assaults. At one stage they managed to cross the bridge, but three Sherman tanks accompanying them were knocked out by the German 88s, and with no armoured support the infantry were forced to withdraw. However, an error in communication caused the Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion to withdraw to the north bank of the river, and this allowed the Durhams to establish a position {{at the southern end of}} the bridge. At the main dressing station the surgeons had operated on another 14 wounded by the time ambulances arrived from XIII Corps at 17:00 to evacuate the wounded. At 18:00 the Main Dressing Station was closed and the men moved to Johnny I. During the time the main dressing station had been active, the surgeons had completed 31 operations, and <b>the</b> <b>medics</b> had treated 109 wounded.|$|E

25|$|A 1985 prisoner-exchange {{agreement}} between Bulgaria and Libya was the legal instrument {{used for the}} transfer; technically Libya did not free <b>the</b> <b>medics</b> but rather allowed them to serve their sentences in Bulgaria.

25|$|When the {{ambulance}} arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosencrantz {{were the most}} seriously wounded {{of the men and}} took to the hospital immediately. A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because <b>the</b> <b>medics</b> had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of <b>the</b> <b>medics</b> $10,000 in cash to see that he received the best treatment. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic was so worried that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he shoved the money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E

25|$|After a brief {{interruption}} {{where he}} bested Swede Hanson in a WWF card held at New York, Morales returned to CSP joining Carlos Colón, Sr. {{to win the}} CSP World Tag Team Championship over <b>The</b> <b>Medics.</b> On June 25, 1983, he defeated Buddy Landel to add the CSP North American Heavyweight Championship. In a rare CSP card outside of Puerto Rican soil, Morales wrestled Hugo Savinovich in Trinidad. On September 10, 1983, <b>The</b> <b>Medics</b> recovered the titles from him and Colón. One week later, Morales faced Ric Flair in the first Aniversario event, winning the contest by disqualification. On January 6, 1984, he dropped the North American Heavyweight Championship o Sweet Daddy Siki. After wrestling Cyclon Negro in Trinidad and defeating Buddy Rose in a WWF event, Morales won a rematch against Siki, recovering the title. He held the belt until September 15, 1984, dropping it to Randy Savage during {{the final stage of}} his CSP stay. Another notable opponent was James J. Dillon. This run was highlighted by a feud against Bob Sweetan, who injured Morales' neck with a piledriver during one of their encounters.|$|E

Instead following the surrender of the German occupation troops in Norway the division was sent there on 9 May 1945. The 181st left England on the 11 May and landed at Oslo that evening, establishing a hospital at Nordstrand. As well as supervising the German surrender <b>the</b> <b>medics</b> were also responsible for treating the numerous ex Russian prisoners of war.

25|$|He {{challenged}} and defeated Blassie by himself, but {{lost in a}} rematch. Morales wrestled Pat Patterson in two tag matches, losing along Rivera but winning with Gomez. The team with Rivera dissolved afterwards, with another teammate emerging in the figure of Antonio Pugliese. Both of Morales' teams managed to record a successful run against an assortment of teams that included different combinations of opponents such as Stan Stasiak, Tom Andrews, Blassie, Austin, Patterson and Ray Stevens among others. Meanwhile, in one-on-one competition he bested Ron Romano, Baron Mikel Scicluna, Rick Renaldo, The Rebel and won an eight-man battle royale. Morales closed the year by rejoining Gomez as a full-time partner, defeating the team of Blassie and The Great Malenko. To open 1968, he defeated The Peacher, The Rebel and Blassie, briefly rejoining Romero in a draw. Individually, Morales then entered a streak of draws, before rebounding with wins over Rick Renaldo, Rocky Montero, The Alaskan, Lou Anthony, Rocky Montero and The Masked Invader. Antonio Pugliese reappeared on May 4, 1968, only to drop the WWA World Tag Team Championship to <b>The</b> <b>Medics.</b> A week later, Morales and Gomez also lost the AWA World Tag Team Championship to Kinji Shibuya & Masa Saito, but regained them on June 8, 1968. Mil Máscaras became a new member of the team, whom he joined in winning a series against Jim Osborne and losing another to Blassie and Austin. Morales made a one-night appearance in Hawaii during the summer, besting Pat Patterson. Both of Morales teams began having mixed results, which brought in another winning streak as a single wrestler which included names such as Fritz Von Goering, Texas, Osborne, Lou Anthony, Rick Renaldo, Thunderbolt Patterson, Tony Romano, Rocky Montaro and The Masked Invader before being snapped by Blassie via disqualification.
