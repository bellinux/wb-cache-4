5|$|Adult coconut crabs have {{no known}} predators {{apart from other}} coconut crabs and humans. Its large size {{and the quality of}} its meat means that <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab is {{extensively}} hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population. <b>The</b> <b>coconut</b> crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab itself is not innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab may make <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab toxic due to the presence of cardiac cardenolides.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found on the outside of <b>the</b> <b>coconut.</b> Once the pores are visible, <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of <b>the</b> <b>coconut.</b> Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E
5|$|Across Ulithi, 29homes were destroyed, 64were damaged, and the {{remaining}} 33were intact. Of the 79non-residential structures, only 4were left standing. All four schools and medical buildings were destroyed, with nearly all medical supplies being washed away. Agriculture saw extensive losses with nearly the entire taro crop devastated and more than 75% of the food crop was ruined. Roughly 23% of <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> trees were destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crop to return to normal. Banana and breadfruit trees were temporarily useless, though they were in recoverable statuses.|$|E
2500|$|Three of {{the tracks}} {{featured}} backing vocals by <b>the</b> <b>Coconuts,</b> of Kid Creole and <b>the</b> <b>Coconuts.</b> In <b>the</b> words of Steve Lillywhite, [...] "they {{just happened to be}} in Dublin on tour, so we hung out with them and they came in and sang on 'Surrender'. So it was sort of random – this serious Irish rock band having <b>the</b> <b>Coconuts</b> on their album." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Philippine <b>Coconut</b> Authority {{was created}} {{pursuant}} to Presidential Decree 232 on June 30, 1973.

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>Coconuts,</b> {{a trio of}} glamorous {{and often}} skimpily-attired backing vocalists, were led by Darnell's then-wife Adriana [...] "Addy" [...] Kaegi, who also served as the choreographer and costume designer of <b>the</b> <b>Coconuts.</b> On their earliest releases, <b>the</b> <b>Coconuts</b> were Kaegi, Cheryl Poirier, and Lori Eastside; Eastside dropped out early, {{and was replaced by}} Taryn Hagey, who in turn was replaced by Janique Svedberg.|$|R
5|$|Coconut (Cocos nucifera), used {{worldwide}} as a food. The fleshy part of {{the seed}} is edible, and used either desiccated or fresh as an ingredient in many foods. The pressed oil from <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> is used in cooking as well.|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs {{live in the}} Indian Ocean and {{the central}} Pacific Ocean, with a {{distribution}} that closely matches that of <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> palm. The western limit {{of the range of}} B. latro is Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, while the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn mark the northern and southern limits, respectively, with very few population in the subtropics, such as the Ryukyu Islands. There is evidence that <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab once lived on the mainlands of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius, but it no longer occurs in any of these places. As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae.|$|E
5|$|Coconut oil, {{a cooking}} oil, with medical and {{industrial}} applications as well. Extracted from the kernel or meat {{of the fruit}} of <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> palm. Common in the tropics, and unusual in composition, with medium chain fatty acids dominant.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the branchiostegal lung, <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab has an additional rudimentary set of gills. Although these gills are comparable in number to aquatic species from the families Paguridae and the Diogenidae, they are reduced in size and have comparatively less surface area.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coconut</b> crab has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The smells of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coconut</b> crab is {{terrestrial}} {{and uses}} structures called branchiostegal lungs to breathe air. They cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they possess a rudimentary set of gills. They can breathe {{on land and}} hold their breath underwater. The branchiostegal lungs {{are seen as a}} developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.|$|E
5|$|Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean has {{the largest}} and densest {{population}} of coconut crabs in the world, although it is outnumbered there by more than 50 times by the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. Other Indian Ocean populations exist on the Seychelles, including Aldabra and Cosmoledo, but <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab is extinct on the central islands. Coconut crabs occur on several of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. They occur {{on most of the}} islands, and the northern atolls, of the Chagos Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, {{claimed by}} the United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part of the}} Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and {{is considered one of the}} world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.|$|E

50|$|Kid Creole and <b>the</b> <b>Coconuts</b> is an American musical group {{created and}} led by August Darnell. Its music {{incorporates}} {{a variety of styles}} and influences, in particular a mix of disco and Latin American, South American, Caribbean, Trinidadian, and Calloway styles and conceptually inspired by the big band era. <b>The</b> <b>Coconuts</b> are a trio of female backing vocalists/dancers whose lineup has changed throughout the years.|$|R

5|$|In Fakaofo, {{the storm}} surge from Percy damaged a sea wall and caused major beach erosion. One house was {{destroyed}} while others were severely damaged. Percy also damaged much of <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> harvest and 50% of the livestock {{were killed by the}} cyclone. Atafu also suffered similar damage as the storm damaged a UHF tower and several storage sheds. Damage to crops was also significant as the storm damaged much of the banana and pandanus harvests. The schools in Atafu suffered only minimal damage (mostly wind damage).|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, <b>the</b> <b>coconut</b> hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E
