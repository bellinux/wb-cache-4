But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E

[...] "I wasn't getting many runs, {{and one day}} keeper Ray Jordon <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across to Adelaide", he later recalled. [...] "I thought no more of it until Ray, now a newspaper columnist, wrote a story saying I would definitely be going to South Australia". This resulted {{in a series of}} offers from Adelaide clubs which prompted Cosier to move in 1974.|$|E

Les turned around to the girls and showed them the knife. He told them to shut up and not to say anything. Les said {{if they did not}} do what he said, he would stab them. During this Les <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my knife. I got my knife out of the glove box. I have a black handled knife with a jagged edge. I showed the girls I had a knife, too.

6000|$|... "He did," [...] {{answered}} Pitcher. [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> another one.

5000|$|Shortly after Escalante came to Garfield High School, its {{accreditation}} became threatened. Instead of gearing {{classes to}} poorly-performing students, Escalante offered AP Calculus.

[...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> just <b>get</b> them inside," [...] Escalante reported, [...] "but I said, there is no teaching, no learning going on." ...|$|R

6000|$|Speaking of wedgytables, another singler axdent {{happened}} here concarning them.

6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right." [...] I {{gave him}} a ten-dollar note which I had loose in my pocket; it was one that my wife had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> changed at the grocery near the station, and I had walked off to the old temple, or the old cockpit, and {{forgotten}} about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He {{pointed out}} the crooks. The big one was mine, the guy you bluffed.

"The fact is," [...] Mr. Weatherley blundered on, with {{considerable}} awkwardness, for {{he hated the}} whole affair, [...] "my wife--Mrs. Weatherley, you know--is giving a party this evening--having some friends to dinner first, and then some other people coming to bridge.

5000|$|Peter and Vincent {{made some}} {{wonderful}} serious movies but are only known for horror. That was why I went to America.

[...] "She played me her playlist of all the songs she would really dig if she was stranded on a desert island and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> mine together.

Daddy's {{just as good}} as come here himself and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more water for Mummy to cook with.'

On the tenth day of the hearing, Günaydın said that a journalist, Varol Bülent Aral, had told him that the missionary work was {{connected}} to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Günaydın stated, [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that Christianity and the missionary work done in its name had the goal of destroying then the motherland.

He said they would provide us with the state support." [...] The prosecutors then demanded a copy of the Ergenekon indictment concerning an alleged high-level cabal, and the judge agreed to request this from the Heavy Penal Court in Istanbul. Asked about a document that he was alleged to have written, Günaydın denied any connection with retired Major General Levent Ersöz, who was arrested with reference to the Ergenekon case, or the Istanbul president of an ultra-nationalist association, Levent Temiz.|$|R

Father wanted us to go, and we agreed {{to go out for}} five minutes while he talked to mother. We went, and when we came back he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a cab to take mother home. Poor mother stood there looking like a ghost, and he began hunting and hauling her towards the door. I saw red, and instead of a cab I fetched that policeman. Of course father did black his eye.

The boys also got a liberal supply of powder and shot for their guns, some cartridges for the rifle, and some fishing hooks and lines. Everything was stored away in the boathouse on the river, which was locked up tightly, so that nobody might carry off their belongings.|$|E

In the AC/DC memoir AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, former manager Michael Browning states, [...] "I got a call one day from Malcolm and Angus. We were in London, I went to their {{apartment}} and they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> they wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of Mark. Him and Angus didn't see eye to eye.

[...] According to Browning, the Young brothers were seriously considering Colin Pattenden of Manfred Mann fame until Browning, who feared Pattenden was too old and did not fit their image, pushed Englishman Cliff Williams, who had played with Home and Bandit. Williams, who could also sing background vocals, passed the audition and would go on to record on Powerage, although Evans insists that the album also has bass by him, as the Powerage songs started being done during the recording of his last album Let There Be Rock, and producer George Young while Williams was having trouble getting his work visa.
