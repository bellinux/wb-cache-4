Gibbons and colleagues do not describe any examples of impact on specific state reptile species, although they mention a general concern for turtles and crocodillians having their populations become imbalanced—the animals sexes are determined by temperature of the eggs.|$|E

Men are destined {{to live on the}} stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} of macromolecules in cytosol causes an effect called macromolecular crowding, which is when the effective concentration of other macromolecules is increased, since <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> volume to move in. This crowding effect can produce large changes in both the rates and the position of chemical equilibrium of reactions in the cytosol. It is particularly important {{in its ability to}} alter dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome.|$|E

5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there does appear to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E
5|$|The mind of William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) still {{possesses}} Olivia's (Anna Torv) body {{after several}} failed attempts to extract it to recently deceased corpses. Walter (John Noble) and William believe that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> {{than a day}} before Olivia's mind will be lost. They realize that Olivia is unaware {{that she has been}} possessed by William's mind, and instead has likely locked her ego away, making it difficult to contact her by normal means. Walter comes up with a plan: he and Peter (Joshua Jackson) will enter Olivia's mind with the aid of LSD to locate her ego and help it to regain dominance in her mind, while Walter hopes to download William's mind into a computer.|$|E
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E
50|$|Softmodems {{cost less}} to {{manufacture}} than conventional modems because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>less</b> hardware. However, <b>they</b> shared the computer's limited resources with other tasks, which reduced {{the resources available}} to, and sometimes the performance of, the computer's primary tasks.|$|R

5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> time to compensate.|$|E

40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is {{a recognized}} social problem. The IPV {{is common in}} all types of intimate relations, this essays purpose {{was focused on the}} violence performed by women against men. To find the social workers conceptions the study conducted a survey sent to local social service in Sweden. The essay had a statistic approach to visualize the social workers conceptions, and a discursive approach to focus on the language used in text answers. Different aspects of the violence were explored to find the conceptions. How the social workers explain the causes of violence related to gender, and if the social workers claim theirs knowledge about IPV is different depending of the offender’s gender. The result shows that the social workers claimed that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>less</b> knowledge about IPV with a female offender than a male offender. When the social worker described the male victim the answers focused to the feeling of shame, which were not as connected to female victim as male. The study found that the social workers experience that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>less</b> knowledge of IPV against men. Nearby half of the social worker claimed that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>less</b> knowledge about IPV in relation to their job...|$|R

25|$|The {{degree of}} roast {{has an effect}} upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts are {{generally}} bolder because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have a more complex and therefore perceived stronger flavor from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting times. Roasting does not alter the amount of caffeine in the bean, but does give less caffeine when the beans are measured by volume because the beans expand during roasting.|$|E
25|$|Statins are {{effective}} in decreasing mortality in people with pre-existing CVD. They are also advocated for use in patients {{at high risk of}} developing heart disease. On average, statins can lower LDL cholesterol by 1.8mmol/l (70mg/dl), which translates into an estimated 60% {{decrease in the number of}} cardiac events (heart attack, sudden cardiac death) and a 17% reduced risk of stroke after long-term treatment. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> effect than the fibrates or niacin in reducing triglycerides and raising HDL-cholesterol ("good cholesterol").|$|E

25|$|The fastest {{enterprise}} HDDs spin at 10,000 or 15,000rpm, and {{can achieve}} sequential media transfer speeds above 1.6Gbit/s and a sustained transfer rate up to 1Gbit/s. Drives running at 10,000 or 15,000rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased power requirements (as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> air drag) and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives. Enterprise HDDs are commonly connected through Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) or Fibre Channel (FC). Some support multiple ports, {{so they can}} be connected to a redundant host bus adapter.|$|E
25|$|In some city, {{the fare}} {{of the public}} {{transportation}} depends on the travel distance, such as the MRT in Taipei, Taiwan. This increases the transportation expense for those who has been move to the urban area, what's more, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> money to earn by investment because they are using all of money to pay their daily expense already.

25|$|There is {{an overall}} underpricing of formal water and {{sanitation}} services in Sub-Saharan Africa. A first consequence is an insufficient cost recovery, leading to dependency on foreign aid and governmental support, and to insufficient investments. Second, underpricing is socially unfair. Since the poorest social groups are less connected to water networks and sewerage, they need to turn to alternatives, and they pay in some cases a multiple of the formal tariff. Hence, the poorest are hit twice: <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> access to improved water supply and sanitation, {{and they need to}} pay more.|$|E

25|$|A. ocellaris feed on {{plankton}} and algae, {{thus they}} are considered omnivores. Feeding is also affected by the hierarchy in A. ocellaris groups. Since the smaller, less dominant fish face aggression from the more aggressive fish, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> energy to forage for food. Thus, they usually do not eat {{as much as the}} dominant fish do, because of reduced energy, but also because of the increased danger they face when they leave their anemone since they are smaller. In other words, the larger fish will usually travel farther than the smaller fish. Generally, the A. ocellaris feed on algae, copepods, and zooplankton.|$|E
500|$|Early {{embryonal}} lethality, {{also known}} as early embryonic death or a non-viable embryo, may occur when the embryo possesses two dominant white alleles, or have the homozygous genotype. The {{reason for this is}} that many mutations for W are caused by nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations or DNA deletions, which, if homozygous, would make it impossible to produce a functional KIT protein. [...] However, it is possible that homozygous embryos from alleles of missense and splice site mutations might be viable because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>less</b> effect on gene function. A 2013 study also unearthed horses that were compound W5/W20 heterozygotes, almost completely white, essentially with greater depigmentation than could be accounted for by either allele alone.|$|E
