5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to trickle charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>will</b> work. The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E

5|$|The {{system has}} {{two types of}} receivers: radio terminals, which can either be {{hand-held}} or mounted in vehicles, and desktop equipment for control centers. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>will</b> include 40,000 radios throughout the country. Compared to the analog network, the digital radio equipment will be smaller and have options for additional equipment such as hands free, and allow special radios for motorcycles, snowmobiles, boats, undercover activities and smoke diving. Communication can either be performed as one-to-one conversations, group calls for predefined or ad-hoc groups, with radios able {{to be part of}} several groups, or as walkie talkies in areas without network coverage. The digital transmission reduced background noise and allows monitoring terminal identity to prohibit unauthorized use. All radios are equipped with an emergency button that will give priority in the network.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} often {{transform into}} extratropical cyclones {{at the end}} of their tropical existence, usually between 30° and 40° latitude, where there is sufficient forcing from upper-level troughs or shortwaves riding the Westerlies for the process of extratropical transition to begin. During this process, a cyclone in extratropical transition (known across the eastern North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans as the post-tropical stage), will invariably form or connect with nearby fronts and/or troughs consistent with a baroclinic system. Due to this, the size of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>will</b> usually appear to increase, while the core weakens. However, after transition is complete, the storm may re-strengthen due to baroclinic energy, depending on the environmental conditions surrounding the system. The cyclone will also distort in shape, becoming less symmetric with time.|$|E
5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the North Indian Ocean between 100°E and 45°E is {{monitored by the}} India Meteorological Department (IMD, RSMC New Delhi). Within the region a {{tropical cyclone}} is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. The lowest official classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Depression, which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 17–27kn (20–31mph; 31–49km/h). Should the depression intensify further then {{it will become a}} Deep Depression, which has winds between 28–33kn (32–38mph; 50–61km/h). <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>will</b> be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the IMD, if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 34–47kn (39–54mph; 62–88km/h). Severe Cyclonic Storms have storm force wind speeds of between 48–63kn (55–72mph; 89–117km/h), while Very Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 64–89kt (73–102mph; 118–166km/h). Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph). The highest classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Super Cyclonic Storm, which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn (138mph; 222km/h).|$|E

5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>will</b> shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E
