5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}.

If <b>the</b> <b>money</b> income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding <b>the</b> <b>money</b> supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

The activities have been documented in hundreds of surveillance reports, photographs and phone calls, which were recorded by police departments all over the world and are detailed in the indictment.|$|E
