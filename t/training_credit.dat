40|$|The {{potential}} benefit of indigenous chicken (Gallus domesticus) production is still under-exploited in Kenya {{despite the efforts}} by different stakeholders to mainstream this production system as a pathway to rural development. The production system is often characterized by low input-low output productivity and low commercialization of the enterprise. This study which dwells on the current management practices and challenges faced by smallholder indigenous chicken farmers was conducted to gain insights into {{the underlying causes of}} production constraints. In Western Kenya women (76 %) dominate the indigenous chicken production system. The flock composition consists mainly of chicks, hens and pullets (80 %) which reflects their retention for production purposes. Less than half of the farmers access institutional support services such as extension, <b>training,</b> <b>credit</b> and veterinary services. In addition, indigenous chicken is largely reared in a low input-low output free-range system with only few farmers (24. 2 %) adopting management interventions as disseminated by extension service. To improve production and attain increased productivity, policy should focus on repackaging extension messages that considers farmers economic situations and strengthens collective action initiatives. Accessing joint input purchase and collective marketing of chicken products may further assist the farmers to increase profit margins...|$|E
40|$|Open Access JournalThe {{influence}} of socioeconomic and other household characteristics on {{the productivity of}} smallholder farmers supplying cassava to the major commercial starch processors in Nigeria were examined. A multi-stage random sampling technique was used to select 96 farmers working in clusters in selected eight cassava producing states. Data were analyzed {{using a combination of}} descriptive and inferential statistics, and multivariate regression techniques. Results revealed the calculated average yield to be 12. 39 t/ha thereby leaving an average yield-gap of 7. 61 t/ha when compared with an average of 20 t/ha being promoted for farmers under the project. Use of improved varieties (p< 0. 01) and full-time farming (p< 0. 05) had significant positive influence on productivity. Also, <b>training,</b> <b>credit</b> use and marital status of farmers influenced productivity positivity at p< 0. 10 levels. Productivity increased with increase in the variables, but the degree of responsiveness was inelastic in each case. Together the included variables explained 72. 1 % of the variation in the productivity model. The use of improved cuttings should be accompanied by rigorous but appropriate capacity enhancement programmes to update farmers on modern issues on cassava production and farm management. Empowerment of farmers through linkage to sources of soft loan and other microcredit facilities was recommended, but such efforts should be targeted more on the married and full-time farmers for greater impact.

40|$|Small and medium-scale {{enterprises}} (SMMEs) {{form the}} majority of the enterprises in the South African economy. The South African government has identified the SMME sector as one of the potential enablers to achieve its objectives of improving job creation opportunities, reducing poverty and creating a more equitable distribution of wealth. The aim of this article was to provide a perspective on the success government support initiatives has had on the SMME sector. To achieve this, the study sought to analyse the perceived strengths and weaknesses of government's national strategy and its institutions tasked with creating an enabling environment for the sector. The study employed a survey research design methodology in which mixed methods were used. The national business strategy employed by government was critically analysed. Empirical data was collected from 282 respondents in order to answer the research question. The results show that the government's approach has favoured 'supply-side interventions' including, providing access to <b>training,</b> <b>credit,</b> mentoring and information to existing and new business. Furthermore, this study has identified the lack of awareness as the primary reason for the under-delivery of the government support initiatives in SMME development. Respondents indicated that they frequently made use of the services of business consultants and external specialists from which they perceived added more value to their respective businesses.

40|$|Abstract only. The PNBA {{is one of}} {{the largest}} MPAs in Africa. Only {{subsistence}} fishing by resident populations is authorized either on foot or using non-motorized dories, limited in number to 100. A development policy was adopted in 1998 to benefit the resident population by: (i) re-deploying fishing effort targeting a non-sustainable shark fishery and (ii) creating alternative incomes through sustainable and selective sea bream and croaker fisheries. Policy incentives include subsidies to renovate dories and develop cold storage, <b>training,</b> <b>credit</b> and purchasing shark nets. PNBA monitoring since 1999 shows that fishing activities have considerably increased and that shark by-catch remains high. The wealth (rent) generated by the activities tends to be capitalized in the value of the fishing rights, mainly the vessel, the average value of which greatly exceeds the subsidies given by donors for its construction. The economic rationalization of the fishery now poses new challenges for the Mauritanian authorities: changes in vessel ownership and in work and capital remuneration systems, influxes of more productive foreign workers into the Park, and pressure to build new vessels. The PNBA experience highlights both the need to address issues of rent and wealth before implementing policy and the risks involved in developing economic activities based on the exploitation of natural resources in a National Park whose main purpose is their conservation...|$|E
30|$|Passion {{research}} is burgeoning {{as more and}} more studies emerge that investigate the role of this construct in entrepreneurship (Murnieks et al., 2016). Vallerand et al. (2003), introduced the concept of The Dualistic Model of Passion which suggested that individual may experience passion in two (2) ways: The obsessive or the harmonious passion. In their study (Esmail et al., 2016) used harmonious passion to explain entrepreneurial passion which is hypothesized by Vallerand’s “emerge from autonomous internalization” as compared to obsessive passion. Scholars have recently focused on the role affect and emotion play in entrepreneurship (e.g. Baron 2008), and in particular have noted that entrepreneurial passion may be an important construct in need of more careful study (Cardon 2008 a, 2008 b; Cardon et al. 2009). A growing volume of research indicates that entrepreneurial passion, which involves intense positive emotions and a meaningful identity connection is central to the entrepreneurial experience and venture-related outcomes (Huyghe et al. 2016). But, passion alone will not make owner/managers to engage on entrepreneurial activity. In order to discover, evaluate, and exploit opportunities, owner/managers may require resources (both capital and human) to be passionate and engage on entrepreneurship. The owner/managers that developed experience previously, learn from their family occupation, and existence of successful entrepreneurs in the area contributes for passionate owners/managers to engage their firm on entrepreneurship. Similarly, government support in providing <b>training,</b> <b>credit,</b> working space, and technical advice for established firm owner/managers, may help to turn their passion to entrepreneurial engagement, while the unpredictability of environment may block firms that tend to involve in entrepreneurial activity.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author reviews {{some of the}} past and current {{experience}} of micro-enterprise programmes for women: <b>training,</b> <b>credit</b> and producer groups and co-operatives. Although there are some successes, the evidence indicates that the majority of programmes fail to make any significant impact on women's incomes. Most programmes, including co-operatives, have on the whole benefited better-off women. They cannot be assumed to have a beneficial impact on gender inequalities, but may increase workloads without increasing access to incomes within the household. They also cannot be assumed to be of greater benefit than other types of employment programmes to women labourers. The author argues that the diversity of the small-scale sector on the one hand, and the complexity of constraints posed by poverty and inequality on the other, make the likelihood of any easy "blueprint" for successful women's micro-enterprise development extremely slim. Both the market and empowerment approaches to micro-enterprise development contain a number of inherent tensions. These are complicated rather than resolved through the co-option of participation within the market approach, and greater attention to efficiency within the empowerment approach. What is clear from this paper is that micro-enterprise development for women is unlikely to be an "all-win", "bottom-up" solution {{to a wide range of}} development problems, as much of the rhetoric would imply. It cannot be seen as a substitute for welfare programmes or direct efforts to support labour and address gender inequality. Even in terms of narrow aims of increasing beneficiary incomes, micro-enterprise development is unlikely to succeed for the vast majority of poor women (rather than a small number of better-off women) unless it is part of a transformed wider agenda. There are particularly serious implications for any reliance on micro-enterprise programmes as the main focus of a wider strategy for poverty alleviation and change in gender inequality...|$|E
