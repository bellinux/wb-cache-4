5|$|On March 28, Foyt {{seemed to}} have earned a career best start for an IndyCar Series race at Homestead-Miami Speedway for the 2008 GAINSCO Auto Insurance Indy 300 with the third best {{qualifying}} time. His Vision Racing teammate, Ed Carpenter also earned a career best start with the 2nd best qualifying time. However, both cars failed technical inspection, meaning they had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the field. Foyt drove his No. 2 entry from the last position (25th) to a ninth-place finish in the race.|$|E
5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up in cool and dry weather. Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his good performance, setting a time of 1:22.855 despite going into the gravel after braking too deep and also drove the spare Ferrari. Häkkinen was the second-fastest driver; Barrichello was third and Coulthard rounded out the top four. After the session ended, Arrows withdrew their appeal after they accepted the FIA's findings and de la Rosa was required <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the field.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{technical}} developments, Ferrari upgraded their engine for their home race by using {{three of their}} development tokens while Mercedes spent all seven of their remaining engine tokens. As a result of this, Mercedes became the first team in 2015 to use all their tokens, with both Honda and Ferrari having four tokens remaining and Renault having twelve tokens left for later in the season. Because of these changes both Mercedes cars were on their third powerplants, whilst both Ferrari cars were on their fourth power units. Additionally, Toro Rosso, Red Bull and McLaren received grid penalties for exceeding their parts usage, forcing them <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back of the grid. McLaren went back to using their snub nose design, which they had replaced {{earlier in the season}} ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, in order to achieve better aerodynamics and lower drag for the high-speed Monza circuit.|$|E
25|$|Penalty {{only under}} yellow condition, {{enforced}} {{on the second}} lap following a restart, in addition <b>to</b> <b>starting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{tail end of the}} field during for that restart. Under green condition, NASCAR will not allow the car on the track until the car is repaired legally.|$|R

5|$|Some of Mighty Jill Offs {{gameplay}} is {{borrowed from}} the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute. Players control Jill in only three ways: moving, jumping, and slowly descending. In the air, players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the jump button while pointing in the direction that they want her to go. Players can switch direction while they do this. There are three types of obstacles: spikes, fire, and spiders; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close. Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly, forcing her <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> most recent checkpoint—typically located at a change in room. There is only one level in the game, but with several rooms in it. The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower. Each room transition is demonstrated by {{a change in the}} room's background colour. Jill has infinite lives, allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over.|$|E
25|$|Roughly a 30 to 45 {{minutes before}} the race start time, driver {{introductions}} will be held. Failure to attend these will also require the driver <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the field as well.|$|E

25|$|Two {{hours before}} the race, drivers and crew chiefs attend a {{mandatory}} driver's meeting. Failure to attend the meeting will force drivers <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the field. In August 2015, NASCAR announced they would experiment moving the driver's meeting to only one hour before the race since meetings at most races take less than 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Teams {{must use}} a single {{car from the}} start of the first {{practice}} session through the end of the race.

25|$|The canoeing and rowing {{events for}} the 1948 London Olympic Games were contested in early August, {{a month after}} the Royal Regatta. The course was widened to {{accommodate}} three lanes and shortened <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of Temple Island: the distance was approximately 1980 metres – 20 metres short of the standard international distance. Twenty seven nations competed and events for single sculls, double sculls, coxless pairs, coxed pairs, coxless fours, coxed fours and eights were offered.|$|E
25|$|At Sonoma, Vickers {{started in}} 34th {{place in his}} 3rd ride for MWR in the No. 55 Toyota. He led 4 laps and had a very fast racecar, {{even though he had}} <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the field because Jason Bowles had {{qualified}} the car as Vickers was racing at Road America. While his MWR teammates Martin Truex Jr. and Clint Bowyer ended up in the top ten, with Truex winning, Vickers ended up in 13th place.|$|E

At the same time, Urbinaga Station was built {{with the intention of}} connecting lines C1 and C2 of Cercanías and Ansio Station with a bus terminal. However, these connection projects have not been finished as of 2011. Eventually the Urbinaga project was restarted in 2009. That future intermodal station will also take advantage of the future Leioa-Urbinaga Tram. Its construction was expected <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 2009.|$|E

At the penultimate round at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, Yoong qualified fourth and a sprint race that saw wet conditions led to him spinning off and having <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back for the feature race where he climbed to 10th and one point.

Impressed, Rouché asked Sauguet to present the score to him, which he did singing all parts; before he had finished Rouché accepted to produce the work at the Opéra. Rehearsals were scheduled <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very beginning of 1939.|$|E

At Kansas, Busch was forced <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the field when he crashed in practice and had to bring out a backup car. He managed to work {{his way through the}} field to finish second. This brought Busch up to ten top-five and fifteen top-ten finishes over 30 races. Busch would go on to finish tenth in the final standings.|$|E

At the Imperial Conference on November 5, Hirohito approved the plan for a war against the United States, Great Britain and the Netherlands, scheduled <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of December if an acceptable diplomatic settlement were not achieved before then. Over the following weeks, Tōjō's military regime offered a final deal to the United States. They offered to leave only Indochina, but in return for large American economic aid. On November 26, the so-called Hull Memorandum (or Hull Note) rejected the offer and demanded that, in addition to leaving Indochina, the Japanese must leave China (without Manchoukuo) and agree to an Open Door Policy in the Far East.|$|E
25|$|The first {{military}} aircraft {{to land in}} Bodø was a Hansa-Brandenburg aircraft of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service which landed in July 1922. From the mid-1930s, regular seaplane flights were started from Bodø to Southern Norway. Two military Tiger Moth aircraft were sent from Trøndelag to scout the Bodø area for a possible site to land aircraft, and landed at Rønvikjordene. From 1935 additional aircraft missions were carried out to the area. In 1939 a plan for establishing airports in Nordland was made, which included a main air station at Bardufoss and five other smaller airport, including Rønvik. At {{the time of the}} break-out of World War II in Norway in April 1940, construction had yet <b>to</b> <b>start.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time both Germany and the United Kingdom believed that there was an airport in Bodø.|$|E
25|$|The series The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa had a direct-to-video film named Around the World with Timon and Pumbaa, with Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella reprising {{their roles}} as Timon and Pumbaa respectively. The story tells of Pumbaa getting struck by {{lightning}}, losing all his memory, and Timon helps refrain every moment they spent. After Pumbaa gets his memory back, lightning strikes Timon losing his memory this time, making Pumbaa break the fourth wall by telling the viewers to rewind the tape <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning, being {{it was the only}} way to help Timon remember. Several episodes from the series are featured in this film. Aside from this film, two other DVDs, Dining Out... and On Holiday... are an hour compilation of other episodes of the series.
