25|$|The male {{bull shark}} {{is able to}} begin {{reproducing}} around the age of 15 years while the female cannot begin reproducing {{until the age of}} 18 years. The size of a fully matured female bull shark to produce viable eggs for fertilization seems to be 175cm to 235cm. The courting routine between bull sharks has not been observed in detail as of yet. The male likely bites the female on the tail until she can <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> and the male can copulate at that point. At some points, the harassment of the male can become violent. Seeing scratches and other marks on a mature female which may be from the mating ritual is not uncommon.|$|E
500|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey uses KUKA robocoaster technology, {{which allows}} the seats to pivot while being held above the track by a robotic arm. However, the ride is not a roller coaster but a scenic dark ride. The {{experience}} includes a flight around Hogwarts castle, an encounter with the Whomping Willow and a horde of Dementors, and a Quidditch match. The ride drops, spins around, twists and turns, but does not <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> though passengers sometimes lie flat on their backs. Over-the-shoulder bars are used to secure guests in their seats, and a single parabolic metal bar [...] {{is used as a}} hand grip. At the conclusion of the ride, guests exit into Filch's Emporium of Confiscated Goods gift shop.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007–2008 spurred {{renewed interest in}} her works, especially Atlas Shrugged, which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis, and opinion articles compared real-world events with {{the plot of the}} novel. During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests. There was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the political left, with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets, particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan. For example, Mother Jones remarked that [...] "Rand's particular genius has always been her ability to <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed", while equating Randian individual well-being with that of the Volk according to Goebbels. Corey Robin of The Nation alleged similarities between the [...] "moral syntax of Randianism" [...] and fascism.|$|E

This choice came in spite of mixed results during flight testing at Guidonia airport; on 11 June 1938, Maggiore Ugo Borgogno had warned that when turning at 90° and the pilot tried to make a tighter turn, the aircraft became extremely difficult to control, including a tendency to <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> mostly to the right and entering into a violent flat spin.|$|E

60|$|We hold ourselves, we English, {{to be good}} workmen. I do {{not think}} I speak with light {{reference}} to recent calamity, (for I myself lost a young relation, full of hope and good purpose, in the foundered ship London,) when I say that either an Æginetan or Ionian shipwright built ships that could be fought from, though they were under water; and neither {{of them would have}} been proud of having built one that would fill and sink helplessly if the sea washed over her deck, or <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> if a squall struck her topsail.|$|E
60|$|We were {{sorry to}} hear that old Joey gave him a good deal of trouble. This was because his memory is so bad that he often forgets whether it is your head or your feet you should stand on, and he usually begins the day by {{standing}} on the end that happens {{to get out of bed}} first. Thus he requires constant watching, and the worst of it is, you dare not draw attention to his mistake, he is so shrinkingly sensitive about it. No sooner had Joey told us this than the poor old fellow began to <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> and stood on his head; but we pretended not to notice, and talked about the weather until he came to.|$|E
60|$|Well, I {{felt sick}} all over as I {{looked at him}} there, and I {{understood}} why the balloon had taken longer to right itself, and why George had called after me to ride her down. Should I cut loose with the parachute, the bag would at once <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> empty itself, and begin its swift descent. The only hope lay in my riding her down and in the boy holding on. There was no possible {{way for me to}} reach him. No man could climb the slim, closed parachute; and even if a man could, and made the mouth of the balloon, what could he do? Straight out, and fifteen feet away, trailed the boy on his ticklish perch, and those fifteen feet were empty space.|$|E

6000|$|What a queer {{thing the}} {{invisible}} human being would appear if, by some discovery as yet inconceivable, some spiritual X-ray photography, we could flash it into sight! Long ago I {{read a book}} called [...] "Soul Shapes" [...] that was full of ingenious ideas, but I doubt very much if the thing so revealed would have any shape, any abiding solid outline at all. It is something more fluctuating and discursive than that--at any rate, for every one young enough not to have set and hardened. Things come into it and become it, things drift {{out of it and}} cease to be it, things <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> in it and change and colour and dissolve, and grow and eddy about and blend into each other. One might figure it, I suppose, as a preposterous jumble animated by a will; a floundering disconnectedness through which an old hump of impulse rises and thrusts unaccountably; a river beast of purpose wallowing in a back eddy of mud and weeds and floating objects and creatures drowned. Now the sunshine of gladness makes it all vivid, now it is sombre and grimly insistent under the sky of some darkling mood, now an emotional gale sweeps across it and it is one confused agitation....|$|E
60|$|I forget now {{absolutely}} what I {{may have}} expected to happen next. I cannot remember my return to my father's house that day. But I know that what did happen was the most unanticipated and incredible experience of my life. It {{was as if the}} whole world of mankind were suddenly to <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down</b> and people go about calmly in positions of complete inversion. I had a note from Mary on the morning after this discovery that indeed dealt with that but was otherwise not very different from endless notes I had received before our crisis. It was destroyed, so that I do not know its exact text now, but it did not add anything material to the situation, or give me the faintest shadow to intimate what crept close upon us both. She repeated her strangely thwarting refusal to come away and live with me. She seemed indignant that we had been discovered--as though Justin had indulged in an excess of existence by discovering us. I completed and despatched to her a long letter I had already been writing overnight in which I made clear the hopeless impossibility of her attitude, vowed all my life and strength to her, tried to make some picture of the happiness that was possible for us together, sketched as definitely as I could when and where we might meet and whither we might go. It must have made an extraordinary jumble of protest, persuasion and practicality. It never reached her; it was intercepted by Justin.|$|E
60|$|But let us {{leave the}} {{universe}} alone. It {{is too big}} a bauble for me.--Revenons.--At the start of me there is me. There is a mysterious little entity which is my individual self, the god who builds the machine and then makes his gay excursion of seventy years within it. Now we are talking at the moment about the machine. For the moment we are the bicycle, and not the feather-brained cyclist. So that {{all we can do}} is to define the cyclist in terms of ourself. A bicycle could say: Here, upon my leather saddle, rests a strange and animated force, which I call the force of gravity, as being the one great force which controls my universe. And yet, on second thoughts, I must modify myself. This great force of gravity is not always in the saddle. Sometimes it just is not there--and I lean strangely against a wall. I have been even known to <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down,</b> with my wheels in the air; spun by the same mysterious Miss. So that I must introduce a theory of Relativity. However, mostly, when I am awake and alive, she is in the saddle; or it is in the saddle, the mysterious force. And when it is in the saddle, then two subsidiary forces plunge and claw upon my two pedals, plunge and claw with inestimable power. And at the same time, a kind and mysterious force sways my head-stock, sways most incalculably, and governs my whole motion. This force is not a driving force, but a subtle directing force, beneath whose grip my bright steel body is flexible as a dipping highroad. Then let me not forget the sudden clutch of arrest upon my hurrying wheels. Oh, this is pain to me! While I am rushing forward, surpassing myself in an élan vital, suddenly the awful check grips my back wheel, or my front wheel, or both. Suddenly there is a fearful arrest. My soul rushes on before my body, I feel myself strained, torn back. My fibers groan. Then perhaps the tension relaxes.|$|E

6000|$|... "My poor mother!" [...] murmured Davy, as {{the tears}} {{rose to his}} eyes, while he prayed to God in his heart {{that he might be}} spared to see her again. At that moment there came a wave so big and black that Davy thought the sea was going to <b>turn</b> <b>upside</b> <b>down.</b> It came on like a great dark mountain, high above the ship. [...] "Hold on for your lives!" [...] cried some of the men, as the wave fell with a fearful crash and turned the ship over on her side--or on her [...] "beam-ends," [...] as sailors call it. They were in awful danger now, as the sea began to pour down into the cabins, and the masts and sails being in the water the ship could not [...] "right," [...] or become {{straight}} again. [...] "Cut away the masts!" [...] roared the captain. The deck was now standing up like a wall, so that the men could not walk on it, but they managed with great difficulty to reach the mizzenmast, which a few strokes of the axe sent overboard. Still the ship lay on her beam-ends. [...] "Cut away the mainmast!" [...] cried the captain. The order was obeyed, and with a loud report, like a cannon shot, it went overboard too. Immediately {{after the fall of the}} mainmast there came another wave, from which they never expected to rise again. It dashed down on the stern and drove in the cabin windows; but the worst of it was, that it swept away all the boats belonging to the ship. They had been securely fastened to the deck; but this wave carried them all away, so that now, if the ship sank, their only chance of escape was gone. The same wave snapped the foremast across near the deck. This was fortunate, because it enabled the ship to [...] "right" [...] herself, and once more the men were able to stand on the deck. The storm continued to rage still, however, and some of the men were sent to work the pumps, for there was a great deal of water in the ship now; so much, indeed, that she could hardly float. Another party were ordered to fit up a small mast, which they tied to the stump of the foremast. This new one was called a [...] "jury-mast;" [...] and as they could not sail without a mast of some kind or other, they were very glad when they saw it up and a sail hoisted on it. During the night, however, another heavy wave broke this mast away also; so they were again left to toss like a log on the stormy waters.|$|E
