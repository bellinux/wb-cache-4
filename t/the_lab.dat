He hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> He retrieves the anti-virus, but is ambushed and killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. <b>The</b> <b>lab</b> door opens to reveal Kaplan forced the Red Queen to open the door.

5|$|At the secured facility, Fauxlivia is able {{to clear}} Peter, Astrid (Jasika Nicole) and Walter from <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> {{in order to allow}} Ray access to <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> Ray {{continues}} to avoid shifting to a new body. Walter returns to <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> to confirm a theory and is interrupted by Ray. Ray successfully removes the data device, knocks out Walter, and flees to give it to Newton. When Ray requests to be able to return to his family, Newton kills him near his home, but by this time, the Fringe division has identified Ray and have converged on his address. On spotting Newton, they engage in a car chase, eventually damaging Newton's car. Fauxlivia recovers Van Horn's data disc from Newton and hides it before taking Newton into custody.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became the director of <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists to shut down <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, expanded the lab's program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program.|$|E

Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E
