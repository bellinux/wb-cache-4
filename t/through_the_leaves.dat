500|$|The {{inflorescence}} is an unbranched and indeterminate terminal raceme measuring [...] tall, {{with flowers}} that are yellow or white. Each flower has four petals {{set in a}} perpendicular pattern, as well as four sepals, six stamens, and a superior ovary that is two-celled and contains a single stigma and style. Two of the six stamens have shorter filaments. The fruit is a silique that opens at maturity through dehiscence to reveal brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape. Self-pollination is impossible, and plants are cross-pollinated by insects. The initial leaves form a rosette shape comprising 7 to 15 leaves, each measuring [...] by after this, leaves with shorter petioles develop and heads form <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> cupping inward.|$|E
2500|$|Lise, {{also known}} as Lise with a Parasol, is an oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by the French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, created in 1867 during his early Salon period. [...] The full-length painting depicts model Lise Tréhot posing in a forest. She wears a white muslin dress and holds a black lace parasol to shade her from the sunlight, which filters down <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves,</b> contrasting {{her face in the}} shadow and her body in the light, highlighting her dress rather than her face. After having several paintings rejected by the Salon, Renoir's Lise was finally accepted and exhibited in May 1868.|$|E

2500|$|The American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer {{tried to}} show, {{from his own}} imagination, {{the value of the}} eyespots as {{disruptive}} camouflage in a 1907 painting. He used the painting in his 1909 book Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom, denying the possibility of sexual selection and arguing that essentially all forms of animal coloration had evolved as camouflage. He was roundly criticized in a lengthy paper by Theodore Roosevelt, who wrote that Thayer had only managed to paint the peacock's plumage as camouflage by sleight of hand, [...] "with the blue sky showing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> in just sufficient quantity here and there to warrant the author-artists explaining that the wonderful blue hues of the peacock's neck are obliterative because they make it fade into the sky." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Vegetable Staticks, Hales studied {{transpiration}} – {{the loss}} {{of water from the}} leaves of plants. He estimated the surface area of the leaves of the plant and the length and surface area of the roots. This allowed Hales to compare the calculated influx of water into the plant with the amount of water leaving the plant by transpiration <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves.</b> He also measured 'the force of the sap' or root pressure. Hales commented that [...] "plants very probably draw through their leaves some part of their nourishment from the air". In Vegetable Staticks Hales prefigured the cohesion theory of water movement in plants, although his ideas were not understood at the time, so he did not influence the debate on water transport in plants in the 19th century. He also speculated that plants might use light as a source of energy for growth (i.e. photosynthesis), based on Isaac Newton’s suggestion that [...] "gross bodies and light" [...] might be interconvertible.|$|E
