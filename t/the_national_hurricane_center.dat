5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery. By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified, using the Dvorak Technique, by satellite analysts at <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center,</b> in part due to persistent deep convection. Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved westward at 17mph (28km/h), intensifying as it did so, and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm, which was named Dean by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Bermuda, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch on August 5. The hurricane watch was later {{changed to a}} hurricane warning the following day. Dean’s approach to the island canceled numerous inbound and outbound flights. In Atlantic Canada, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a hurricane warning for Nova Scotia and Sable Island, while the Canadian forecasters issued a high wind advisory.|$|E
5|$|Initially, forecasters at <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{predicted}} that Matthew {{would take a}} more eastern track and hit the Florida Panhandle. Because the track shifted westward, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a Tropical Storm Warning from the Florida/Alabama border to Intracoastal City, Louisiana {{on the day before}} landfall.|$|E

5|$|Later on September22, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> began {{noting the}} {{possibility}} of increasing wind shear due to a large upper trough. Despite this, the intensity predictions did not forecast weakening within the next three days. Isaac continued to strengthen and reached hurricane status at 1200UTC on September23. However, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> did not operationally upgrade Isaac until 2100UTC on September23, at which time the storm was a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, Isaac significantly intensified, and on the following day, it reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 120mph (205km/h). <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> then predicted Isaac would become a Category4 hurricane on September25, though this did not materialize.|$|E
5|$|After {{weakening}} to a Category1 hurricane on September30, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{noted that}} very cold cloud tops still existed, though IR imagery {{indicated that the}} convection and circulation associated with the storm was becoming asymmetrical. Isaac remained a Category1 hurricane for almost 24hours, at which time the storm began to accelerate east-northeastward. Early on October1, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> noted that minimal deep convection persisted near the center {{and much of it}} was displaced to the north. Mid-level dry air and low-level cold air began entering the western quadrant of the storm, which caused it to begin its extratropical transition. By 0600UTC on October1, Isaac weakened to a tropical storm. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> noted that further weakening would be slow, due to the large wind field associated with the storm. At 1500UTC on October1, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued its final advisory on the storm; Isaac fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about three hours later, while located about halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores. The extratropical remnants tracked rapidly east-northeastward and affected the British Isles on October3 and October4, eventually merging with another extratropical low while north of Scotland early on October4.|$|E

5|$|Fourteen hours {{prior to}} Edith making {{landfall}} in Central America, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> warned citizens about the extreme {{danger of the}} approaching hurricane, {{and asked them to}} prepare for hurricane conditions. While the storm was located in the Gulf of Mexico, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a Hurricane Warning from Cameron to Morgan City, Louisiana eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall. Edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area.|$|E
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|At 0000UTC on September20, the {{depression}} made landfall near Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and weakening was immediately forecast. Three hours later, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued its final advisory, as {{the lower level}} center became poorly defined because of interaction with the mountains of Central America and deep thunderstorm activity had significantly diminished. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> noted the possibility of regeneration, if the circulation entered into the Pacific Ocean within a few days. Although {{the depression}} never redeveloped, the remnant tropical wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean {{and contributed to the}} development of Hurricane Juliette on September21.|$|E
5|$|August 18–23, 2008– Tropical Storm Fay made {{a record}} four landfalls in Florida. Extreme {{flooding}} {{was reported in}} many counties in central Florida and the Florida panhandle.

5|$|By 1500UTC on September 27, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{declared}} Bonnie extratropical, {{since it}} was losing tropical characteristics. Bonnie re-acquired tropical characteristics, and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> resumed advisories on the storm by 2100UTC on September 28. However, post-analysis indicated that Bonnie remained tropical during that time period. Bonnie re-strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the Azores. Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30, Bonnie passed through the Azores as a moderately weak tropical storm. One location in the Azores reported tropical storm force winds. In addition, one man {{was killed by a}} rock fall on the island of São Miguel. No damage was reported in association with Bonnie.|$|E
5|$|By 4 {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, most {{computer}} models predicted Isabel {{to make landfall}} between North Carolina and New Jersey, and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> consistently forecast a landfall on North Carolina. Initially, forecasters predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted landfall position was much closer to where it ultimately was. From three days in advance, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km). Strong confidence in Isabel's final landfall prompted <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> to issue a hurricane watch for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50hours before Isabel struck land. 38hours before the hurricane made landfall, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the landfall area. The Newport Weather Forecast Office issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall, which indicated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.|$|E
5|$|Information is sparse for {{earlier years}} due to {{limitations}} in tropical cyclone observation, though as coastlines became more populated, more data became available. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> recognizes the uncertainty {{in both the}} death tolls and the dates of the events.|$|E

5|$|On September 9, about 16hours before Florence made landfall, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida. Three hours later, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Pensacola to Cameron, Louisiana, with {{a tropical storm}} warning issued from Pensacola eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. Around the time of Florence moving ashore, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> limited the hurricane warning from Pensacola, Florida to Morgan City, Louisiana. Hours after the hurricane made landfall, the warning {{was replaced by a}} tropical storm warning from Mobile, Alabama to Grand Isle, Louisiana, which was discontinued two hours later.|$|E
5|$|Operationally Erika {{was never}} {{upgraded}} to hurricane status. Based on a persistent eye feature on radar and Doppler weather radar-estimated surface winds of 75mph (120km/h), <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> posthumously upgraded Erika to a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm formed, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a {{tropical}} storm watch from {{the southern end of}} Galveston Island to Morgan City, Louisiana. As a more northward motion occurred, the watch was canceled and replaced with a tropical storm warning from High Island, Texas, to Pascagoula, Mississippi. Shortly before the storm made landfall, the warning was discontinued between High Island and Cameron, Louisiana. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> briefly issued a hurricane watch from Intracoastal City to Morgan City, but it was discontinued when Tropical Storm Bill failed to strengthen. Prior the storm making landfall, local National Weather Service offices issued flash flood watches and a tornado watch for large portions of the Gulf Coast.|$|E

As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> forecast the outer edge of the hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island.
