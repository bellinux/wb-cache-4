40|$|Abstract [...] The foraminiferal bundance and {{percentage}} of coarse ice-rafted etritus (IRD) define glacial, deglacial, and interglacial depositional regimes in AMS radiocarbon-dated box cores from <b>the</b> western <b>Arctic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Sediment deposition rates are generally less than 0. 5 cm/ka for glacial regimes, greater than this for deglacial regimes and greater than 1 - 2 cm/ka for interglacial regimes. These differences in deposition rates might account for the much lower average sedimentation rates for the last 780 ka of 1 - 3 mm/ka in cores from <b>the</b> central <b>Arctic</b> <b>Ocean</b> if glacial regimes dominated this interval. Foraminiferal bundances are less than 500 /g during glacial maxima nd mostly higher than 2000 /g during deglacial and interglacial regimes. Slightly higher coarse IRD percentages occur in deglacial intervals (> 5 - 10 % up to 30 %) compared with interglacial intervals (mostly < 5 %), which characterize the last 10 - 12 ka in <b>the</b> western <b>Arctic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Glacial regimes occurred from about 40 to 11 ka except for a brief interglacial or deglacial interval around 24 - 28 ka in <b>the</b> central <b>Arctic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> <b>The</b> coarsest deglacial events occurred prior to 45 ka. The Late Wisconsin deglaciation sediments (approximately 9 - 16 ka) are difficult to detect in <b>the</b> central <b>Arctic</b> <b>Ocean</b> sediments because they are only slightly coarser than the Holocene and, in some box cores, less coarse than the Holocene. A previously unrecognized coarse IRD event occurred near the core tops (0 - 3 cm) between 1500 and 3500 radiocarbon years ago in <b>the</b> western <b>Arctic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Only sediment older than 40 ka is coarser than this recent IRD event, which might correspond to a Neoglaciation recognized i...|$|R

5|$|Svalbard and Jan Mayen {{constitute}} two {{outlying areas}} of Norway. Svalbard is an archipelago in the Arctic about midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.

The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act established administration by the appointed Governor of Svalbard. Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in <b>the</b> <b>Arctic</b> <b>Ocean</b> {{located at the}} border of the Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea. Since 1994, the island has been administrated by the County Governor of Nordland, with some authority delegated to the station commander.|$|E

Svalbard and Jan Mayen have in common that they are the only integrated parts of Norway not allocated to counties.
