50|$|In 1993, Mercedes-Benz model {{nomenclature}} was rationalized, {{with the}} SE/SEL/SEC cars becoming the S-Class and alphanumerical designations inverted (e.g. the both 500SE and 500SEL became S500 regardless of wheelbase length). In 1995, the W140 received a minor facelift featuring clear <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicator</b> lenses {{on the front}} and rear as well as headlamps fitted with separate low- and high-beam reflectors for the US market. Following the mid-year facelift, the W140 coupé and sedan (Saloon) featured Electronic Stability Control.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, the Fairlane {{line was}} {{supplemented}} {{by the new}} Torino, and the Ranchero followed suit, becoming the largest model since the full-sized 1959. Overall, the new Ranchero was not only bigger, but also more angular than before with its more horizontal grille and horizontal headlamps; Ford and other automakers were making a switch back to horizontal quad headlamps. The interior was all new, as well, sharing the Torino/Fairlane's distinctive four-pod instrument cluster. Though the four round pods gave the illusion of an engine-turned dash, viewed from left to right, they instead featured warning lights for coolant temperature (both cold and hot) and the left <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicator</b> in the left pod with the speedometer in the second pod {{directly in front of}} the driver. Warning lights for the charging system and oil pressure, as well as the right <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicator,</b> were located third from the left. In upscale models, this pod was supplanted by a tachometer. An optional clock filled the fourth pod; a decorative [...] "clock delete" [...] panel otherwise filled the space. A seat belt warning light was a new feature, too, lighting briefly in the far left pod whenever the engine was started. The model line also featured wraparound front side marker lamps which doubled as parking lights and rear side reflectors, newly mandated by US law for the 1968 model year.|$|E

5000|$|In late 1991, after {{worldwide}} launch, {{work begun}} on {{improvements to the}} W140. By the end of 1992, final design changes were approved and later patented(application) on February 27, 1993, exactly 5 years after the original W140 design patent application in 1988. In March 1994, the updated models were unveiled at the Geneva Auto Salon and went on sale in April 1994 in mainland Europe and in other markets {{during the second half}} of the year. The clear <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicator</b> lenses on the front and new taillights were the most obvious change, as was the grille including a new and distinctive one for S 600s. Headlamps were fitted with separate low H7, H1 fog, and high H1 beam reflectors in 1994; pre-1995 models used an H4 bulb and H3 for the fog lamp. In April 1995, [...] "Parktronic" [...] replaced the parking guiders on the rear boot lid.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, Ford Australia {{undertook}} a two-year project of importing and marketing the Mustang in Australia. $4million was allocated for {{the conversion of}} 250 units. The car was not designed for right-hand drive markets and for complying with Australian Design Rules. Tickford Engineering was contracted to engineer the conversion to the right-hand-drive and to meet Australian Design Rules, including the fitment of auxiliary high beam headlamps in the front bumper and side <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> repeaters as well as taillamps with amber <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicators.</b> In total, just 377 Mustangs were sold in Australia between 2001-2003.|$|R

The SL 500 continued with the same powerful engine. A 389 hp (290 kW) 6.0-litre V12 SL 600 topped the range. Introduced in 1993 as the 600 SL, it was re-badged the SL 600 in 1994.|$|R
50|$|For 1966, the Barracuda {{received}} new taillamps, new front sheet metal, and a {{new instrument}} panel. The latter had room for oil pressure and tachometer gauges on models so equipped. The 1966 front sheet metal which, except for the grille, was shared with the Valiant, and gave a more rectilinear contour to the fenders. Deluxe models featured fender-top <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicators</b> with a stylized fin motif. The bumpers were larger, and the grille featured a strong grid theme. A center console was optional for the first time.|$|R
50|$|The Škoda 1201 was {{a family}} car {{produced}} by Czechoslovakian automaker AZNP at their plant in Mladá Boleslav. Saloon and estate versions were offered along with a panel van. The car was released in 1954 as a successor to the Škoda 1200. It inherited its predecessor's steel ponton format body. One difference was the fitting of flashing <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicators,</b> whereas the 1200 had incorporated semaphore style trafficators in its front wings: subsequent retro-fitting of flashing indicators to old 1200s has left this as an imperfect method for distinguishing between the two models, however.|$|R

5000|$|For the Canadian market, the 2017 and 2018 Honda Ridgelines {{are offered}} in five trim levels: LX, Sport, EX-L, Touring, and Black Edition. [...] These trim levels are fairly {{different}} from the ones offered in the US until you reach the top trim levels. However, there are unique amenities {{that can only be}} found in Canadian Ridgelines, such as: heated windshield wipers (all trims) with rain-sensing (Touring trim and up), ventilated front seats (Touring trim and up), power folding side-view mirrors (Touring trim and up) with integrated <b>turning</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicators</b> (Sport trim and up), and heated rear-seats with a rear-passenger climate control interface (EX-L trim and up).|$|R
5000|$|Honda {{offered an}} earlier version of the CB175 for the model year 1968. This bike {{combined}} features of the 1965-1967 CB160 with the 1969 and later CB175. The bike had a 174 cc engine, dual carburetors, five-speed transmission, 12-volt electrics and <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicators,</b> electric and kick starter. It had dual drum brakes and an integrated speedometer/headlight assembly with no tachometer. The engine is used as part of the frame, unlike the 1969 and later CB175, and has a sharper forward slope to the cylinders. This version of the CB175, known as the [...] "K0", was offered in the Asian, European, and Canadian markets as well as the United States.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the first}} Chrysler small car sold in Japan, {{starting}} in 1996-1998, but only the sedan was offered. It was sold at Mitsubishi dealerships as well as Yanase dealerships, and {{very similar to those}} sold in the Australian market. it was equipped with amber <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicators</b> next to the tail lights to comply with Japanese regulations, and a side indicator behind the front wheel installed in the fender. Sales were curtailed due to the lower interest of Japanese consumers. Sales were also affected by the Japanese economic recession due to the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, otherwise known as the [...] "bubble economy".|$|R
5000|$|The LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, {{moving the}} <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicators</b> {{to the front}} bumper instead of the {{headlamp}} assembly. A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. Interestingly, the front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was [...] "1970-something" [...] meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|The M90 {{makes use}} of a {{front-mounted}} 1.6L [...] 4-cylinder Toyota engine, {{as well as a}} Toyota-built 5-speed transmission. The suspension is also from Toyota, using the same setup as is found in the Excel. The instrument cluster is from an Opel Monza and the radiator is from an Austin Allegro. The tail lights are borrowed from the Aston Martin Lagonda and the <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>indicators</b> are from the Ford Fiesta. The body is made of fiberglass and the roof is lowered in two pieces. The top is removed separately and fits in the trunk, to create a 'targa' style roof, and the rear portion folds down like a typical convertible.|$|R
50|$|The turn <b>indicator</b> stalk or <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> lever is {{the control}} lever which {{operates}} the <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> or <b>indicator</b> {{lights on the}} front, sides and rear of the vehicle.
