40|$|The {{capability}} of radar measured rainfall {{to enhance the}} simulation of storm hydrographs was assessed. Six rainfall events which occurred in 1986 and 1987 over an 8. 13 km$ sp 2 $ agricultural watershed in south-western Quebec were used in model simulations. Radar measured rainfall rates were calibrated using measurements from a single <b>tipping-bucket</b> <b>raingauge</b> located at the study site. A deterministic, event-based model, HYMO, was used to simulate streamflow using radar and gauge measured rainfall. The model utilized two rainfall abstraction techniques, i. e. the SCS Curve Number method and the Green-Ampt infiltration equation. Simulated streamflow hydrographs were compared with observed storm flows. For short duration, high intensity, simple rainfall events, there were minor improvements in hydrograph simulations when calibrated radar measured rainfalls were input to the model, compared to <b>tipping-bucket</b> <b>raingauge</b> measurements. Complex, low intensity storms were poorly simulated by the model using either rainfall data source. Neither rainfall abstraction method proved consistently superior...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a class of}} stochastic point process models, based on doubly stochastic Poisson processes, in the modelling of rainfall. We examine the application of this class of models, a neglected alternative to the widely-known Poisson cluster models, {{in the analysis of}} fine time-scale rainfall intensity. These models are mainly used to analyse <b>tipping-bucket</b> <b>raingauge</b> data from a single site but an extension to multiple sites is illustrated which reveals the potential of this class of models to study the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation at fine time-scales...|$|E
40|$|Data are {{provided}} from 2 types of raingauge, drop-counting and tipping-bucket, at 2 sites. The <b>tipping-bucket</b> <b>raingauge</b> {{is a common}} type of gauge, but it has poor resolution of rain rate. Rapid response drop-counting raingauges have been developed at the Chilbolton Observatory to give measurements of every drop rather than every tip of a bucket at high time resolution: 10 seconds. The BADC dataset also includes data from a low-rate drop-counting gauge at Chilbolton {{which is the same}} unit but with a larger collector of 387 cm 2 rather than the standard 150 cm 2 collector. Data from a standard tipping bucket gauge are also provided at each site. The raingauges operate routinely at Chilbolton, England (51. 1445 °N, 1. 4370 °W) and Sparsholt, England (51. 0879 °N, 1. 3914 °W), 8 km to the south-east of Chilbolton Observatory...|$|E
40|$|Raingauges {{and weather}} radar are {{essential}} sources of rainfall information for hydrological modelling and forecasting. However, significant errors in raingauge time-series can drastically affect raingauge-only and combined radar-raingauge rainfall estimates. In turn, these errors {{can have a}} negative impact on hydrological model calibration, performance and failure diagnosis. This study considers the automated quality-control of 15 minute rainfall totals obtained from 981 <b>tipping-bucket</b> <b>raingauges</b> across England & Wales. The Grid-to-Grid distributed hydrological model, now operated by the Flood Forecasting Centre in support of national flood warning, is used with gridded rainfall estimates to assess the utility of the raingauge quality-control procedures. Although a historical dataset is used here for demonstration and assessment purposes, the automated algorithms have been designed for implementation in real-time...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tipping-bucket</b> <b>raingauges</b> {{can produce}} {{misleading}} reports {{as a consequence}} of a number of factors. Very fast tips may result from gauge disturbance, faulty bucket positioning or abrupt snow melt. Very slow tips may result from partial blockage. An absence of tips is an indication of a major problem. This paper suggests easily programmable diagnostic checks that may be used to identify any of these problems, using either the data from a single gauge, or by using additional information from neighbouring gauges. The checks were motivated by the need to process two years of data from Bolton in the north west of England. The checks are then tested on archived data from the HYREX experiment, finding 90 % of confirmed faults...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and availability of}} X-band radar instruments occurred in the last years, provides the scientific community of an important tool for the study, the characterization and the operational usage of detailed precipitation information. The hydrology laboratory of the Department of Civil, Environmental, Aerospace Engineering, and Materials (DICAM) at the University of Palermo, has installed a X-band weather radar in the urban area of Palermo (Italy) along {{with a set of}} advanced auxiliary instruments that help on exploiting the precipitation information. A raingauge network of 18 tipping bucket gauges spread over the observed area is available for the calibration of precipitation maps provided by the radar. Moreover a weight raingauge, an optical disdrometer, and a weather station are installed in a monitoring site. The information provided by these devices can be combined in order to integrate different data and correct errors. The disdrometer is used to estimate the drop size distribution (DSD) that results being directly linked to the parameters used for the transformation of radar reflectivity to precipitation estimates. Moreover, disdrometer observations can be used to classify the precipitation events. The comparison among traditional <b>tipping-bucket</b> gauges, weight-based <b>raingauge,</b> and disdrometer highlights possible issues related to instrumental errors affecting tipping-bucket gauges. Eventually, the weather station provides other different climatic variables that can be useful to interpret and analyze the rainfall events and to better characterize the same events. Radar precipitation estimates with high temporal and spatial resolutions, can be effectively used for supporting flood forecast analyses. Such an implementation is nowadays explored for different urban areas documented in the literature. In this study, observations from the radar and other sensors are embedded in an integrated early warning system able to provide warning related to possible flood in the urban area of Palermo...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of a class of {{stochastic}} point process models, based on doubly stochastic Poisson processes, in the modelling of rainfall. We examine the application of this class of models, a neglected alternative to the widely-known Poisson cluster models, in the analysis of fine time-scale rainfall using <b>tipping-bucket</b> <b>raingauge</b> tip times. These models are used to analyse data from a single and multiple sites to study the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation at fine time-scales. The arrival pattern of raingauge bucket tip times is viewed as a Poisson process whose rate of occurrence varies according to an unobserved finite state irreducible Markov chain. Since the likelihood function can be expressed in a tractable form, the models are fitted with maximum likelihood methods, thus enabling a more straightforward estimation of parameter uncertainty than for Poisson-cluster models. One of the advantages of this modelling approach is that it allows us to fit various sub-models of interest for the data, and also to test hypotheses on model parameters. As the tip-times from raingauges are modelled directly, this approach overcomes the usual need to convert tip-times into rainfall depths. We study precipitation patterns at a network of gauges in the South-West of England (HYREX data) using univariate models and the extension of these models to a multivariate framework is examined. The multivariate version of our proposed model can provide the basis for a proper spatial-temporal model for which the parameters are well identified using maximum likelihood estimation. Results on fitting 3 -state and 4 -state models are presented. A small scale simulation study is carried out to compare some of the rainfall characteristics of accumulated rainfall...|$|E
40|$|Soil loss due {{to water}} erosion {{is a serious}} problem in Mediterranean areas, that causes great concern. The {{resulting}} pattern of vegetation and bare soil is a key factor in runoff generation. According to this, different organic carbon extra-sources (sewage sludge, polymers, mulching, manure, etc) have been proved as an erosion control methods. Some studies indicate a positive influence on plant cover and sediment yield and reducing the high soil losses usually found in degraded areas, bare slopes and cultivate soils from Mediterranean. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the role played by different soil amendments in the runoff generation and soil loss from closed and afforested plots. The experimental area is located in the Natural Park of Sierra Tejeda, Almijara and Alhama, in South of Spain. The study was carried out in seven 24 m 2 (2 x 12 m) closed plots. Every pot had four repetitions. Rainfall was measured with a <b>tipping-bucket</b> <b>raingauge</b> (0. 2 mm accuracy). In order to verify possible differences, we applied the test of Mann-Whitney U in corroboration with the previous homogeneity test of variance. Average total runoff collected from the 24 m 2 plots was negligible for pinus branches mulching (5. 52 l) and straw mulch (6. 36 l), and high for hydroabsorbent polymers (22. 49 l) and sheep manure (23. 67 l). Mean soil losses for each of the land management indicated that hydroabsorbent polymers and sheep manure contributed with the greatest amounts, while straw mulch and pinus branches had negligible or no soil loss. The applications of straw mulch and pinus branches were very effective in reducing soil losses and produced an increase on the available water content respect to the control plots, although was lower than hydroabsorbent polymers.
