2500|$|When Marty {{arrives in}} 1885, the DeLorean's fuel line is pierced by an arrow during an Indian attack. He and Doc patch it {{and attempt to}} use whiskey as a {{replacement}} fuel, since commercial gasoline is not yet available; the test fails, destroying the fuel injection and ignition systems and leaving the car unable to travel under its own power. Its final trip, from 1885 to 1985, is propelled by a steam locomotive that has Doc's version of [...] "Presto Logs" [...] (pressed wood treated with anthracite) added to the boiler to provide the extra power needed to push the car up to 88mph; once this speed is reached, the Mr. Fusion unit provides the power required to activate the flux capacitor and make the jump through time. Doc replaces the 1955-style wheels with cast iron train wheels that fit on the <b>track</b> <b>rails.</b> [...] He uses the old tires and a wooden support to cushion the locomotive's [...] "cow catcher" [...] and the car's rear end. [...] Since {{each of the three}} [...] "Presto Logs" [...] fire at different intervals with increasing power, Doc installs a boiler temperature gauge on the DeLorean's dashboard to indicate when the car will experience a sudden burst of acceleration.|$|E

5000|$|In jointed <b>track,</b> <b>rails</b> {{are usually}} {{connected}} with bolted fishplates (joint bars). The web {{of the rail}} experiences large shear forces and these are enhanced around the bolt hole. Where track maintenance is poor, metallurgical fatigue can result in the propagation of star cracking from the bolthole. In extreme situations {{this can lead to}} a triangular piece of rail at the joint becoming detached.|$|E
50|$|The trams {{were run}} on a direct current power supply from Overhead lines, which {{replaced}} the original conduit {{after a series of}} monsoons. The power supply was obtained by a current collector called a trolley pole, mounted on top of the tram. The <b>track</b> <b>rails</b> served as the return path for the DC current. The DC power was supplied by mercury arc rectifier (converter) stations located in various sections of cities.|$|E

5000|$|Generally {{electric}} locomotives collect power through a third rail or an overhead wire. The full circuit is completed by <b>track</b> <b>rails.</b> For main line railways with their protected lines overhead lines and third rails {{are not a}} problem. Tramways operate in cities. This means that the third rail system is not really practical. It has been used, protection being offered to other road users by placing it in a central groove. Even so the ingress of dirt and water can cause problems.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>track</b> {{undergoes}} complex loading patterns under {{moving traffic}} conditions compared to roads {{due to its}} continued and discontinued multi-layered structure, including rail, sleepers, ballast layer, sub-ballast layer, and subgrade. Particle size distributions (PSDs) of ballast, subballast, and subgrade layers can be critical in cyclic plastic deformation of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> under moving traffic on frequent <b>track</b> degradation of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks,</b> especially at bridge transition zones. Conventional test approaches: static shear and cyclic single-point load tests are however unable to replicate actual loading patterns of moving train. Multi-ring shear apparatus; {{a new type of}} torsional simple shear apparatus, which can reproduce moving traffic conditions, was used in this study to investigate influence of particle size distribution of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> layers on cyclic plastic deformation. Three particle size distributions, using glass beads were examined under different loading patterns: cyclic sin-gle-point load, and cyclic moving wheel load to evaluate cyclic plastic deformation of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> under different loading methods. The results of these tests suggest that particle size distributions of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> structural layers have significant impacts on cyclic plastic deformation under moving train load. Further, the limitations in con-ventional test methods used in laboratories to estimate the plastic deformation of <b>rail</b> <b>track</b> materials lead to underestimate the plastic deformation of <b>rail</b> <b>tracks...</b>|$|R

The trail is 15 miles ending at Haworth Park in Bellevue, Nebraska. The railroad influence is seen along the trail within Keystone.

50|$|Like other {{coasters}} of the Jet Star 3 / Jumbo Jet model line, the Jumbo Jet did not utilize a chain lift or launch {{mechanism to}} reach the top of the lift hill. Instead, small wheel motors drove it up the incline of a tight helix. The track was also different on Jet Star 3 / Jumbo Jet roller coasters than on most later steel roller coasters. The former has much thinner <b>track</b> <b>rails</b> than the tubular steel of the latter. Riders on the Morey's Piers Jumbo Jet cited its high-speed, banking turns as a noteworthy element.|$|E

50|$|The <b>track</b> (<b>rails</b> and sleepers) utilised, {{ranged from}} light, rail frames {{that could be}} carried and laid by two men and were often laid {{directly}} {{on the ground with}} no trackbed, to properly laid, ballasted lines for heavy loads and extended use. Tight curves enabled lines to be more easily routed, largely without structures being required, even in difficult terrain. Provisional track laid along the edges of ditches as they were being extended forward, often on soft ground, led occasionally to derailments. As a result, on many , wooden planks and other lifting gear were carried. Turntables were usually operated by hand.|$|E
