40|$|Acute {{fluroxene}} {{treatment of}} male Wistar rats decreases <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> hepatic microsomal cytochrome P- 450 and haem, increases {{the activities of}} hepatic δ-aminolaevulinate synthase and haem oxygenase, and increases <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> haem precursors (δ-aminolaevulinate and porphobilinogen) in the urine. All of the above effects of fluroxene are enhanced by pretreatment of the experimental animals with 3 -methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital. <b>The</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> porphyrins in <b>the</b> urine and faeces were generally unaffected by acute fluroxene treatment of uninduced or 3 -methylcholanthrene- or phenobarbital-induced Wistar rats. 2, 2, 2 -Trifluoroethyl ethyl ether, the saturated analogue of fluroxene, did not affect <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> hepatic cytochrome P- 450 and haem, <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> haem precursors in the urine or faeces, or the activity of hepatic haem oxygenase in phenobarbital-induced male Wistar rats. <b>The</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> hepatic cytochrome P- 450 and haem and of the haem precursors in urine and faeces, and the activity of δ-aminolaevulinate synthase, were generally not altered by acute fluroxene treatment of uninduced male Long–Evans rats. Chronic treatment of Wistar rats with fluroxene resulted in small increases in <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> δ-aminolaevulinate and porphyrins in urine. <b>The</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> porphobilinogen in urine were elevated up to 2000 %, whereas <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porphyrins in faeces were generally unaffected. After chronic fluroxene treatment, the activity of δ-aminolaevulinate synthase was increased, whereas the activity of uroporphyrinogen synthase was decreased. It is concluded that acute fluroxene treatment may affect haem biosynthesis and degradation by a mechanism similar to allylisopropylacetamide, namely by stimulating an atypical cytochrome P- 450 -dependent pathway for haem degradation. The effects of chronic fluroxene treatment on haem biosynthesis may be a consequence of this mechanism or {{a result of the}} inhibition by fluroxene of uroporphyrinogen synthase. Chronic fluroxene treatment of male rats affects the haem biosynthetic pathway {{in a manner similar to}} that seen in human genetic acute intermittent porphyria...|$|R
