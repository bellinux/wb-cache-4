5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>bill</b> loophole, the Brady law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the private sale loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address what types of sales and transfers of firearms require records and or background checks, such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, {{as long as the}} sale does not cross state lines and does not fall under purview of the National Firearms Act. In addition to federal legislation, firearm laws vary by state.|$|E
5|$|Opening {{statements}} in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States {{was represented by}} a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of <b>the</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill,</b> and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E

2500|$|After losing Tom <b>Brady</b> for <b>the</b> {{first four}} {{games of the season}} due to the {{punishment}} imposed by Commissioner Roger Goodell stemming from Deflategate, the Patriots turned to back-up quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. Garoppolo led the Patriots to a win opening night against the Arizona Cardinals. After a shoulder injury to Garoppolo in the second game of the season against the Miami Dolphins, rookie, third-string back-up quarterback Jacoby Brissett entered the game and led the Patriots to victory. Four days later on Thursday Night Football, Brissett led the Patriots to a 27-0 shutout victory against the Houston Texans. A thumb injury to Brissett's throwing hand derailed the Patriots offense the following week, leading to a shutout home loss to <b>the</b> Buffalo <b>Bills.</b> <b>Brady</b> returned <b>the</b> following week and led the Patriots to four straight victories. A loss mid-season in Week 10 to the Seattle Seahawks proved to be the final defeat of the year, as the Patriots closed the regular season winning seven straight games, along with their eighth consecutive division title and securing the #1 seed overall in the AFC.|$|R

25|$|Warner {{was quite}} moderate, {{especially}} {{in comparison to}} most Republican Senators from the South. He was among the minority of Republicans to support gun control laws.

25|$|With a {{stated goal}} of {{reducing}} crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various gun control measures, {{most notably the}} Gun Control Act of 1968, <b>the</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill</b> of 1993, and Crime Control Act of 1994. However, some Democrats, especially rural, Southern, and Western Democrats, favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue. In the national platform for 2008, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban.|$|E

500|$|Despite being heavily {{associated}} with firearms in his Westerns and police movies, Eastwood has publicly endorsed gun control {{since at least}} 1973. In the April 24, 1973, edition of The Washington Post, the star said, [...] "I'm for gun legislation myself. I don't hunt." [...] Two years later, in 1975, Eastwood told People magazine that he favors [...] "gun control to some degree." [...] About a year later, Eastwood remarked that [...] "All guns should be registered. I don't think legitimate gun owners would mind that kind of legislation. Right now the furor against a gun law is by gun owners who are overreacting. They're worried that all guns {{are going to be}} recalled. It's impossible to take guns out of circulation, and that's why firearms should be registered and mail-order delivery of guns halted." [...] In 1993, he noted that he [...] "...was always a backer" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill,</b> with its federally mandated waiting period. In 1995, Eastwood questioned the purpose of assault weapons. Larry King, the television host and newspaper columnist, wrote in the May 22, 1995, edition of USA Today that [...] "my interview with Eastwood will air on 'Larry King Weekend'... I asked him his thoughts on the NRA and gun control and he said that while people think of him as pro-gun, he has always been in favor of controls. 'Why would anyone need or want an assault weapon?' he said." ...|$|E
