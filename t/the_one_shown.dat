25|$|Note {{that since}} this ratio is {{independent}} of time, one can take arbitrary times and achieve similar triangles. The angle stays the same, meaning that subsequent waves generated between the initial time t=0 and final time t will form similar triangles with coinciding right endpoints to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>shown.</b>|$|E
25|$|Supporters modeled a nonthermal plasma. The {{justification}} is {{the high}} amount of scattering in the device center. Without a magnetic field, electrons scatter in this region. They claimed that this scattering leads to a monoenergetic distribution, like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>shown</b> in Figure 6. This argument is supported by 2 dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Bussard argued that constant electron injection {{would have the same}} effect. Such a distribution would help maintain a negative voltage in the center, improving performance.|$|E
25|$|An {{unstable}} water jet, {{similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>shown</b> {{in the flow}} instability section above, was not disturbed deliberately, but was allowed to rise to a free water surface. On contact with the surface, a slight jet asymmetry caused an unsymmetrical raised surface that fed back to the jet origin and began a process {{that looked like a}} weak version of the flow instability figure. If the jet was not powered, but warmer than the surrounding fluid, it would rise and when encountering the surface would generate a similar feedback system.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to lack of}} suction, {{an infant}} with a cleft may have trouble feeding. An infant with a cleft palate will have greater success feeding in a more upright position. Gravity will help prevent milk from coming through the baby's nose if he/she has cleft palate. Gravity feeding can be {{accomplished}} by using specialized equipment, such as the Haberman Feeder, or by using a combination of nipples and bottle inserts like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>shown,</b> is commonly used with other infants. A large hole, crosscut, or slit in the nipple, a protruding nipple and rhythmically squeezing the bottle insert can result in controllable flow to the infant without the stigma caused by specialized equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{intersection}} of a four (or higher) dimensional regular polytope with a three-dimensional hyperplane {{will be a}} polytope (not necessarily regular). If the hyperplane is moved through the shape, the three-dimensional slices can be combined, animated {{into a kind of}} four dimensional object, where the fourth dimension is taken to be time. In this way, we can see (if not fully grasp) the full four-dimensional structure of the four-dimensional regular polytopes, via such cutaway cross sections. This is analogous to the way a CAT scan reassembles two-dimensional images to form a 3-dimensional representation of the organs being scanned. The ideal would be an animated hologram of some sort, however, even a simple animation such as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>shown</b> can already give some limited insight into the structure of the polytope.|$|E
25|$|Although {{these three}} phylogenetic {{features}} are useful rules of thumb to identify epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes {{that might be}} impacting viral genetic variation, there is growing recognition that the mapping between process and phylogenetic pattern can be many-to-one. For instance, although ladder-like trees such as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>shown</b> in figure 3A could reflect the presence of directional selection, ladder-like trees could also reflect sequential genetic bottlenecks that might occur with rapid spatial spread, {{as in the case}} of rabies virus. Because of this many-to-one mapping between process and phylogenetic pattern, research in the field of viral phylodynamics has sought to develop and apply quantitative methods to effectively infer process from reconstructed viral phylogenies (see Methods). The consideration of other data sources (e.g., incidence patterns) may aid in distinguishing between competing phylodynamic hypotheses. Combining disparate sources of data for phylodynamic analysis remains a major challenge in the field and is an active area of research.|$|E

500|$|A plane graph {{is said to}} be self-dual if it is {{isomorphic}} to its dual graph. The wheel graphs {{provide an}} infinite family of self-dual graphs coming from self-dual polyhedra (the pyramids). However, there also exist self-dual graphs that are not polyhedral, such as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>shown.</b> [...] describe two operations, adhesion and explosion, {{that can be used to}} construct a self-dual graph containing a given planar graph; for instance, the self-dual graph shown can be constructed as the adhesion of a tetrahedron with its dual.|$|E
500|$|Brain {{injuries}} can {{be classified}} into mild, moderate, and severe categories. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), {{the most commonly used}} system for classifying TBI severity, grades a person's level of consciousness on a scale of 3–15 based on verbal, motor, and eye-opening reactions to stimuli. In general, it is agreed that a TBI with a GCS of 13 or above is mild, 9–12 is moderate, and 8 or below is severe. Similar systems exist for young children. However, the GCS grading system has limited ability to predict outcomes. [...] Because of this, other classification systems such as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>shown</b> in the table are also used to help determine severity. [...] A current model developed by the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs uses all three criteria of GCS after resuscitation, duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and loss of consciousness (LOC). It also has been proposed to use changes that are visible on neuroimaging, such as swelling, focal lesions, or diffuse injury as method of classification. Grading scales also exist to classify the severity of mild TBI, commonly called concussion; these use duration of LOC, PTA, and other concussion symptoms.|$|E
500|$|While {{the trailer}} did not confirm that a Tron sequel was in production, {{it showed that}} Disney was serious about a sequel. In an {{interview}} with Sci-Fi Wire, Bridges revealed that the test footage was unlikely {{to appear in the}} finished film. On July 23, 2009, Disney revealed film's title at their panel at Comic-Con. Bridges explained that the title is in reference to the story's theme: [...] "It's basically a story about a son's search for his father." [...] They also showed a trailer similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>shown</b> at Comic-Con 2009, with updated visuals. At the time, the film had just wrapped production and they had a year of post production ahead of them. Because none of the footage from inside the computer world was finished, they premiered concept images from the production. Art included the Recognizer, which has been updated from the original film. Concept photos were also shown of Disc Wars, which has also been revised from the original film into a 16-game tournament. The arena is set up so that the game court organically changes, and all 16 games are going on at the same time. The boards also combine in real time until the last two Disc warriors are connected.|$|E

500|$|Avatars {{of famous}} musicians {{are part of}} the game, {{performing}} for songs by that artist and available as unlockable characters. Notably, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana is a playable avatar; Activision had sought to gain permission to use Cobain's image for the game for three years, including obtaining the necessary agreements with Courtney Love, who controls Cobain's estate, and Dave Grohl and Universal Publishing, who control Nirvana's catalog. Cobain's avatar was designed with input from Love, who provided photos and videos for the design team to use, and emphasized how she would like Cobain to appear, starting from his appearance in [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] and modifying it from there. The avatar includes the T-shirt design based on Daniel Johnston's [...] "Frog" [...] that Cobain had popularized. Johnny Cash is also a playable character, with tribute artist Terry Lee Goffee helping to provide motion capture for his character. Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson (of Garbage), and Matthew Bellamy (of Muse) are also playable avatars, all of whom performed motion capture for their own avatars. There are also unlockable fictional characters like Skeleton, Golden God, Shadow, Frankenrocker, and Gerald Contest Winner. Though Activision approached Jon Bon Jovi to appear in the game, Bon Jovi turned down the offer. [...] While the standard character creator is available for all versions of the game, the Xbox 360 version allows players to import their Xbox Live Avatar into the game, while the Freestyle mode on the Wii version of the game allows use of the players' Miis in the game. Nine of the characters from previous installments return in this game. They all have a costume that they start with and 3 more can be unlocked by completing challenges. Doing this will unlock also new pieces of clothing for the costume to use for user generated rockers. Also, while Gibson no longer sponsors the game, other guitar manufacturers, like Ibanez, ESP, Paul Reed Smith and Schecter, lent the likenesses of their instruments, allowing for new combinations on assembling custom guitars and basses. For the first time, also, sponsored clothing pieces can be used in customization (these being shoes from Vans, Dr. Martens and Converse) There is no money in the game leaving everything available to use, including unlockables. Instruments can also be unlocked to use. Also some clothing now can be changed in style. There are four styles for each; <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>shown,</b> two others that were separate items in previous games (with exceptions), and one new one (with exceptions). Pregenerated characters outfits can only be changed and users can only decide which outfit they wear. However they can still edit their instruments. Virtual avatars of the real life rockers can also not be changed in any way, including instruments.|$|E
