60|$|There {{was nothing}} more to be got from Herr Molk. And with this terrible {{recommendation}} still sounding in her ears, Linda sadly made her {{way back from the}} Egidien Platz to <b>the</b> <b>Schütt</b> island.|$|E
60|$|The nearest and dearest {{friend of}} Linda Tressel was her aunt, the widow Staubach--Madame Charlotte Staubach, {{as she had}} come to be called in the little town of Nuremberg where she lived. In Nuremberg all houses are picturesque, but you shall go through the entire city and find no more picturesque abode than the small red house with the three gables close down by the river-side in <b>the</b> <b>Schütt</b> island--the little island made by the river Pegnitz {{in the middle of the}} town. They who have seen the widow Staubach's house will have remembered it, not only because of its bright colour and its sharp gables, but also because of the garden which runs between the house and the water's edge. And yet the garden was no bigger than may often {{nowadays}} be seen in the balconies of the mansions of Paris and of London. Here Linda Tressel lived with her aunt, and here also Linda had been born.|$|E
60|$|A walk of {{ten minutes}} took Linda from <b>the</b> <b>Schütt</b> island to the Egidien Platz, and placed her {{before the door}} of Herr Molk's house. The Egidien Platz is, perhaps, the most fashionable quarter of Nuremberg, if Nuremberg {{may be said to}} have a fashion in such matters. It is near to the Rathhaus, and to St. Sebald's Church, and is not far distant from the old Burg or Castle in which the Emperors used to dwell when they visited the {{imperial}} city of Nuremberg. This large open Place has a church in its centre, and around it are houses almost all large, built with gables turned towards the street, quaint, picturesque, and eloquent of much burghers' wealth. There could be no such square in a city which was not or had not been very rich. And among all the houses in the Egidien Platz, there was no house to exceed in beauty of ornament, in quaintness of architecture, or in general wealth and comfort, that which was inhabited by Herr Molk.|$|E
5000|$|Richey, who was {{selected}} as <b>the</b> <b>Schutt’s</b> Offensive Player of the Game, was {{the primary source of}} offense for the Hawks as he led the team in receptions (seven) and touchdowns (three). Teems, however, was able to shut down Richey, who did not have a single catch in the 4th quarter.|$|R
50|$|Starting in <b>the</b> 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>Schutts</b> {{began to}} break up the farm. Eventually all but 55 acre was sold to Sheffield Farms, a large {{corporate}} farm that had acquired all or most of some of the surrounding family farms. It would, {{by the middle of the}} century, become one of New York City's largest suppliers of milk.|$|R
50|$|Rummell was {{inserted}} into the lineup after Hines was pulled due to injury in the second quarter. Hines finished the game completing seven of eleven passes with two touchdowns and no interceptions. Rummell, who was awarded <b>the</b> <b>Schutt’s</b> Offensive Player of the Game Award, finished the game completing 12 of 16 passes with 213 yards and five touchdowns, including the game-winner. Dickens had another break-out game hauling in seven receptions for 153 yards with two touchdowns. Savage contributed six receptions with two touchdowns and newcomer Anthony Brown had five receptions for 68 yards.|$|R
60|$|At {{this time}} the widow Staubach was a woman not much over forty years of age; and though it can hardly be said she was comely, yet she was not without a certain prettiness which might have charms in the {{judgment}} of Herr Steinmarc. She was very thin, {{and her face was}} pale, and here and there {{was the beginning of a}} wrinkle telling as much of trouble as of years; but her eyes were bright and clear, and her smooth hair, of which but the edge was allowed to be seen beneath her cap, was of as rich a brown as when she had married Gasper Staubach, now more than twenty years ago; and her teeth were white and perfect, and the oval of her face had not been impaired by time, and her step, though slow, was light and firm, and her voice, though sad, was low and soft. In talking to men--to such a man as was Herr Steinmarc--her voice was always low and soft, though there would be a sharp note in it now and again when she would be speaking to Tetchen or her niece. Whether it was her gentle voice, or her bright eyes, or the edge of soft brown hair beneath her cap, or some less creditable feeling of covetousness in regard to the gabled house in <b>the</b> <b>Schütt</b> island, shall not here be even guessed; but it was the fact that Herr Steinmarc had more than once asked Madame Staubach to be his wife when Tetchen first imparted her suspicion to Linda.|$|E
60|$|Linda Tressel, as she {{returned}} home {{to the house in}} <b>the</b> <b>Schütt</b> island, became aware that it was necessary for her to tell to her aunt all that had passed between herself and Herr Molk. She had been half stunned with grief as she left the magistrate's house, and for a while had tried to think that she could keep back from Madame Staubach at any rate the purport of the advice that had been given to her. And as she {{came to the conclusion that}} this would be impossible to her,--that it must all come out,--various wild plans flitted across her brain. Could she not run away without returning to the red house at all? But whither was she to run, and with whom? The only one who would have helped her in this wild enterprise had been sent to prison by that ill-conditioned old man who had made her so miserable! At this moment, there was no longer any hope in her bosom that she should save herself from being a castaway; nay, there was hardly a wish. There was no disreputable life so terrible to her thoughts, no infamy so infamous in idea to her, as would be respectability in the form of matrimony with Peter Steinmarc. And now, as she walked along painfully, going far out of her way that she might have some little time for reflection, turning all this in her mind, she began almost to fear that if she went back to her aunt, her aunt would prevail, and that in very truth Peter Steinmarc would become her lord and master. Then there was another plan, as impracticable as that scheme of running away. What if she were to become sullen, and decline to speak at all? She was well aware that in such a contest her aunt's tongue would be very terrible to her; and as the idea crossed her mind, she told herself that were she so to act people would treat her as a mad woman. But even that, she thought, would be better than being forced to marry Peter Steinmarc. Before she had reached the island, she knew that the one scheme was as impossible as the other. She entered the house very quietly, and turning to the left went at once into the kitchen.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{location of}} the Christkindlesmarkt was the Nuremberg Hauptmarkt. It was, however, relocated to other places such as the Fleischbrücke or <b>the</b> island <b>Schütt</b> between 1898 and 1933. In 1933, the market returned to its original venue {{in front of the}} Frauenkirche church.|$|R
50|$|More recently, in 2003 Schutt sports {{introduced}} their football helmets {{which contained}} TPU, or thermoplastic urethane. They {{would argue that}} this helps cushion the head {{more than any other}} helmet in <b>the</b> market. <b>Schutt</b> also believes that TPU makes the helmet less prone to mold and easier overall to clean and keep sanitary.|$|R
50|$|Rulloff {{returned}} amid {{rumors that}} he had killed his wife. Confronted by <b>the</b> <b>Schutts,</b> he denied any murder and claimed first {{that his wife had}} abandoned him, then that they had moved to Ohio together. Neither statement was believed because Harriet's clothes and personal items had been found in the house, implying that she had not left on her own accord. Rulloff fled a second time, but he was pursued by his brother-in-law, Ephraim Schutt, who had him apprehended and brought to Ithaca to stand trial for murder. Lake Cayuga was dredged in an attempt to locate the bodies, but they were never found. As the grand jury was unwilling to indict Rulloff for murder without a body, he was instead accused of kidnapping his wife. Rulloff conducted his own defense at his trial, in 1846, focusing on the lack of evidence that any crime had been committed. Nevertheless, he was found guilty and sentenced to ten years with hard labor in Auburn Prison.|$|R
50|$|Twisters players {{picked up}} post-season honors from the af2 coaches and press. Quarterback Kyle Rowley was {{selected}} as <b>the</b> <b>Schutt</b> Offensive Player of the Year. Wide receiver Chris Denney was named Cutters Playmaker of the Year.|$|E
50|$|He {{spent the}} next two seasons playing for the AF2's Arkansas Twisters. After the 2008 season, he was {{selected}} as <b>the</b> <b>Schutt</b> Offensive Player of the Year by a vote of the af2 head coaches and press.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Schutt Sports {{announced}} {{the arrival of}} a next generation helmet, <b>the</b> <b>Schutt</b> ION 4D. This next generation design was in response to the demand for a safer football helmet. The design includes an integrated face guard. This new face guard design features shock absorbing [...] "Energy Wedges" [...] that reduce the force of impacts to the face guard. College teams wearing the helmet include Air Force, Penn State, and Virginia. Schutt has also distinguished between their varsity helmets and youth helmets. The varsity helmets from Schutt are made with polycarbonate, which is a very strong polymer designed to take bigger hits. <b>The</b> <b>Schutt</b> youth helmets however; are made from ABS, which is a lighter material, meant for kids who do not take as powerful of hits.|$|E

60|$|The use {{of light}} tackle by experts for big game fish {{of the sea}} {{has come to be}} an {{established}} practice in American angling. A few years ago, when sport with light tackle was exceptional, it required courage to flaunt its use in the faces of fishermen of experience and established reputation. Long Key, now the most noted fishing resort on the Atlantic coast, was not many years back a place for hand-lines and huge rods and tackle, and boat-loads of fish for one man. It has become a resort for gentlemen anglers, and its sportsmen's club claims such experts and fine exponents of angling as Heilner, Lester, Cassiard, Crowninshield, Conill, <b>the</b> <b>Schutts,</b> and others, who can safely be trusted to advance the standard. Fishermen are like sheep--they follow the boldest leaders. And {{no one wants to be}} despised by the elect. Long Key, with its isolation, yet easy accession, its beauty and charm, its loneliness and quiet, its big game fish, will become the Mecca of high-class light tackle anglers, who will in time answer for the ethics and sportsmanship of the Atlantic seaboard.|$|R

5000|$|Many veteran players still {{preferred}} the old web suspended Riddell TK-2 {{because it was}} generally lighter and more breathable.

5000|$|In 2002 Riddell {{released}} a new more spherical {{design for the}} helmet called the Revolution (or Revo) and it is currently {{the most widely used}} helmet in the National Football League <b>The</b> <b>Schutt</b> counterpart is called the DNA Pro Adult Helmet. A study released by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center shows that the Riddell Revolution, and others like it, reduce the incidences of concussion by 31%. Subsequently, a Senate Commerce Committee meeting on October 19, 2011, heard testimony from Jeffrey Kutcher, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Michigan and chair of the American Academy of Neurology's sports neurology section that [...] "there is no significant data" [...] in the UPMC study for Riddell to make the claim that the helmet reduced concussions by 31%. On or about May 2013, Mary K. Engle, the FTC's associate director for advertising practices wrote that the agency had concluded the UPMC study [...] "did not prove that Revolution varsity football helmets reduce concussions or the risk of concussions by 31%". Riddell has since discontinued use of the 31% claim. [...] Later, Riddell released the Revolution Speed helmet.|$|E

50|$|During the French and Indian War, the Lenape {{initially}} {{sided with}} the French, as they hoped to prevent further British colonial encroachment in their territory.

30|$|The study {{highlights}} the dynamics and morphological characteristics of <b>the</b> Genus Planktoniella <b>Schutt.</b> <b>The</b> two available species P. sol (Wallich) Schutt. and P. blanda (Schmidt) Syvertsen and Hasle are important {{components of the}} phytoplankton assemblage in the estuarine system of Indian Sundarbans and also marine systems elsewhere. The sampling sites {{for the purpose of}} this study include four different spots along a riverine stretch in the estuarine region adjacent to the Tiger Reserve in the Indian Sundarbans flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Integrated phytoplankton samples were preserved for the purpose from composite water samples from each site. The water samples were analysed in field for determining pH, temperature, salinity, conductivity, TDS, turbidity and DO and subsequent to treatment and processing, the samples were microscopically analysed in the laboratory. Significant negative correlation of cell count of both species found with respect to temperature and turbidity. P. sol versus temperature (significant at α =  0.01, p =  0.001) and P. blanda versus temperature (significant at α =  0.05, p =  0.037); P. sol versus turbidity (at α =  0.05, p =  0.019) and P. blanda versus turbidity (at α =  0.05, p =  0.019). Significant positive correlation found with respect to DO and as correlation between the two species themselves. A model has been generated for each of the two species with temperature, turbidity and DO as predictor variables and the two species of Planktoniella as response variables. The influence of other dominant phytoplankton in the samples has also been considered with Pearson correlation computed for each set of species.|$|R
