40|$|Objective: This {{systematic}} review seeks to {{gain insight into}} the effectiveness of return-to-work <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> among sick-listed patients with non-specific musculoskeletal complaints. The focus here lies on the composition of effective <b>treatment</b> <b>programs,</b> itemized for regional non-specific musculoskeletal complaints. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed and methodological quality criteria were applied. Results: Eighteen high quality articles were selected, which reported on a combined total of 22 <b>treatment</b> <b>programs,</b> including a total of 3, 579 participants. Of these 22 <b>treatments</b> <b>programs,</b> seven experimental <b>treatments</b> (32 %) resulted in faster return to work compared to the control treatment. None of the studies reviewed reported negative findings. What appeared to be essential to effective treatment was knowledge conditioning, psychological, physical and work conditioning, possibly supplemented with relaxation exercises. Most of the high quality studies (64 %) reported on a low back pain population. Conclusion: The findings were inconsistent regarding the effectiveness of <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> in enabling sick-listed patients with non-specific musculoskeletal disorders to return to work. Except for low back pain, none of the studies explicitly itemized the effects of <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> on return to work by regional musculoskeletal disorders, such as upper extremity musculoskeletal disorder...|$|R

5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone <b>treatment</b> <b>program</b> for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: <b>Treatment</b> <b>programs</b> for {{overweight}} and obese {{young children are}} of variable effectiveness, and the characteristics of effective programs are unknown. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, the effectiveness of <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> for these children is summarized. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases were searched up to April 2012. Articles reporting the effect of treatment on the body weight of overweight or obese children {{with a mean age}} in the range of 3 – < 8 years are included. Studies reporting the change in BMI z-score with standard error were included in a meta-analysis. For this purpose, a random-effects model was used. Results: The search identified 11, 250 articles, of which 27 were included in this review. Eleven studies, including 20 <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> with 1015 participants, were eligible for the meta-analysis. The pooled intervention effect showed high heterogeneity; therefore, subgroup analysis was performed. Subgroup analysis showed that program intensity and used components partly explained the heterogeneity. The subgroup with two studies using multicomponent <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> (combining dietary and physical activity education and behavioral therapy) of moderate or high intensity showed the largest pooled change in BMI z-score (– 0. 46; I 2, 0 %). Conclusion: Although the subgroup multicomponent <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> of moderate to high intensity contained only two studies, these <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> appeared to be most effective in treating overweight young children...|$|R

5|$|The Scarborough Day School was {{a private}} school in Scarborough-on-Hudson, in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Frank and Narcissa Vanderlip {{established}} the school in 1913 at their estate, Beechwood. The school, a nonsectarian nonprofit college preparatory day school, taught students at pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade levels and had small class sizes, with total enrollment rarely exceeding 150 students. Since 1980, the buildings and property have been owned by The Clear View School, which runs a day <b>treatment</b> <b>program</b> for 83 students.

5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate <b>treatment</b> <b>program</b> for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{has been}} home {{to a number of}} schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 {{students}}, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day <b>treatment</b> <b>program</b> for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there. The Macfadden School ran from 1939 to 1950 at the William Kingsland mansion in the village.|$|E
40|$|A burgeoning of {{research}} on emotion has identified the importance of emotionally competent functioning to children’s psychosocial adaptation.

The rationale for including a greater focus on emotion in youth prevention and <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> is drawn from the affective neuroscience and clinical psychology litera-tures. Preliminary data from prevention and <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> that have a strong emotion focus are promising. Future work needs to examine how emotion-related processes are related to psychopathology in youth, develop developmentally sensitive programs that are influenced by basic research on emotions, evaluate the relative effectiveness of prevention and <b>treatment</b> <b>programs,</b> and assess the potential long-term impact of emotion-focused and emotion-informed programs.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Proposals {{to enroll}} Medicaid {{beneficiaries}} in {{health maintenance organizations}} (HMOs) have raised concerns that community-based mental health <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> would be adversely affected. METHODS. In Hennepin County (Minnesota) 35 % of Medicaid beneficiaries {{were randomly assigned to}} prepaid plans. Random samples of individuals with severe mental illness with selected from the prepaid enrollees and from beneficiaries remaining with traditional Medicaid. The two groups were compared with respect to their use of community <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> and the write-off (the proportion of patient charges for which payment was not received) experienced by those programs for members of the study sample. RESULTS. There was no strong evidence that Medicaid beneficiaries with severe mental illness who were randomly assigned to prepaid plans used community-based mental health <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> differently than did other Medicaid beneficiaries. However, write-offs were consistently higher for enrollees in prepaid plans. CONCLUSIONS. In the short run, the use of community-based mental health <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> need not be affected by enrollment of Medicaid beneficiaries in prepaid plans, providing that Medicaid program administrators take steps to minimize the disruption of ongoing treatment, offer beneficiaries a choice among prepaid plans, and encourage community <b>treatment</b> <b>programs</b> to contract with plans to serve beneficiaries...|$|R
