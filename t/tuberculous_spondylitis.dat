40|$|MR {{images of}} 14 {{patients}} with pyogenic and three patients with <b>tuberculous</b> infectious <b>spondylitis</b> were studied to develop criteria for diagnosis. T 1 -weighted scans, 800 / 20 (TR/TE), were obtained in 17 patients and T 2 -weighted scans,> 2000 / 30, 80, were obtained in 14. In seven patients, T 2 *-weighted scans (gradient-recalled acquisition into steady state, 25 / 15 / 5 - 7 ° [TR/TE/flip angle)) and short-T 1 inversion-recovery scans (STIR), 1400 / 150 / 40 (TR/TI/TE), {{as well as}} fat and water images (using a suppression technique), were obtained. Unenhanced and gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced scans were obtained in four patients. In all but two patients with pyogenic infectious spondylitis, the T 1 -weighted sagittal scan showed characteristic findings: narrowed disk space, low signal intensity in the marrow {{of at least two}} adjacent vertebrae, subliga-mentous or epidural soft-tissue masses, and erosion of cortical bone.

40|$|Background: <b>Tuberculous</b> (TB) <b>spondylitis</b> {{occurs in}} < 1 % of {{patients}} with TB. Atlantoaxial involvement is extremely rare amounting to 0. 3 %– 1 % cases of TB spondylitis. The management of this entity has been fluctuating with time. Various classifications and management protocols have also evolved. We present our experience in managing this entity in 8 patients. Materials and Methods: Retrospective follow-up study of eight patients with atlantoaxial TB over 2 years. They {{ranged in age from}} 14 to 33 years with male preponderance. Four required surgical intervention on initial presentation, 2 were successfully treated conservatively, and 2 had to undergo surgery after a trial of conservative management. All of them were started on antituberculous therapy (ATT) for 18 months. Patients were followed up for 8 – 29 months. Results: Neck pain and restriction of neck movements were standard presenting features. All patients had pulmonary TB confirmed by sputum examination. Radiological investigations formed {{an integral part of the}} evaluation of disease, treatment plan, and prognosis. Improvement in symptoms has been documented in all eight. Conclusion: The involvement of the most mobile spinal segment and the potential cervicomedullary compression makes it a disease of utmost importance. Although ATT remains the mainstay of treatment, surgical intervention is needed for stabilizing the joint and decompressing the cervicomedullary junction. Strict adherence to medical advice and optimum surgical intervention tailored for each patient results in the successful management of the disease...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{analysed}} {{the association between}} the incidence of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> with the Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1 (NRAMP 1, also known as Solute Carrier Family 11 a member 1) polymorphism by studying the genetic segregation of this polymorphism and the incidence of the disease {{among members of the}} West Javanese population undergoing surgery for <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> at our institution. We compared the distribution of NRAMP 1 polymorphism at two specific sites, namely D 543 N, and 3 ’UTR, among subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis and <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis.</b> We found no significant differences in distribution of polymorphism between the two groups, or between pulmonary tuberculosis and <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> compared to healthy subjects. However, a pattern emerged in that polymorphisms at the two sites seemed to be protective against development of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> in our study population.

40|$|Percutaneous {{curettage}} {{and continuous}} irrigation were performed for definitive {{diagnosis and treatment}} of <b>tuberculous</b> (TB) lumbar <b>spondylitis.</b> Under local anaesthesia, affected lumbar discs were curetted using a procedure of percutaneous nucleotomy, and in-tube and the out-tube were placed for continuous irrigation. The period of continuous irrigation was 12 – 16 days. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was demonstrated in case 1 by culture and PCR, whereas histology showed tuberculous lesion with caseous necrosis in both cases. Postoperative MRI showed markedly reduced abscesses after 3 months in both cases. The signal intensity in vertebral bodies was improved. In Case 2, CT observations showed remodeling over time in the vertebral body cavities. This method is advantageous in that although minimally invasive, it achieves identification of pathogenic bacteria and treatment simultaneously.

40|$|Study Design. A {{retrospective}} {{review of}} infective spondylitis patients assessed at a major, tertiary referral centre in Hong Kong. Objective. To assess the prevalence, risk factors, clinical features, and prognostic outcomes associated with <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> {{to that of}} pyogenic spondylitis in Southern Chinese treated at a single institution. Summary of Background Data. Previous studies in Asia suggest that <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> is the predominant infection unless proven otherwise. Current clinical experiences suggest otherwise; however, the current trend and clinical profile of infective spondylitis among Southern Chinese remains speculative with no published studies examining their prevalence. Methods. A retrospective review was performed of all infective spondylitis cases presenting from January 2004 to July 2008 to a tertiary referral center. Cases were included {{on the basis of}} clinical and microbiological criteria. Radiographic imaging was used for further confirmation. Results. Ninety-one patients were identified. Overall, <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> and pyogenic spondylitis entailed 22 (24. 2 %) and 69 (75. 8 %) cases, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated infective agent associated with pyogenic spondylitis. Individuals with pyogenic spondylitis were significantly much older than those with <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> (P = 0. 001). Intravenous drug addiction was the most commonly noted risk factor followed by diabetes, and found to be more prevalent in pyogenic spondylitis cases. At initial presentation, white cell count and c-reactive protein levels were higher in pyogenic spondylitis cases compared with <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> (P < 0. 05). The occurrence of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> cases was predominant in the thoracic region (40. 9 %) (P < 0. 05). Surgical intervention was performed in 54. 5 % of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> and in 24. 6 % of the pyogenic spondylitis cases (P = 0. 009). Conclusion. In Southern Chinese, compared to previous reports over the past 3 decades, a changing prevalence of decreasing <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> was observed. Pyogenic spondylitis was found to be more common among patients hospitalized for infective spondylitis. This has important implications on the method of diagnosis and the need for establishing microbiological diagnosis before commencing treatment.

Methods: MR images of the spines of 41 patients with infectious spondylitis at our institution over 8 -years of period were retrospectively reviewed. Eighteen patients with infective spondylitis were excluded because their results on the marrow biopsy and culture were negative. MR imaging findings in 6 patients with <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> (3 male, 3 female) were compared with those of 17 patients (10 male, 7 female) with pyogenic spondylitis.

Materials and methods. Surgical treatment of 41 patients with infectious spondylitis was retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups. <b>Tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> patients were included into group 1 – 24 (58. 5 %), and those suffering from non-specific spinal osteomyelitis were included into group 2 (17. 0 - 41. 5 %) More than half of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> patients were HIV positive (13 / 54. 3 %) and 16 out of 24 patients (66. 7 %) had generalized form of tuberculosis. The survival forecast for the patients after surgery was estimated by Charlson score, ASA score was used for evaluation of surgical and anesthetic risks, and risk of postoperative complications was assessed by PITSS (Postoperative infection treatment score for the spine) (2012). Results. Early and late infectious complications were detected in 4 (9. 7 %) of patients with ASA at 3 - 4 scores, Charlson score exceeding 5 and high risk as per PITSS (more than 21 scores). <b>Tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> patients had Charlson score exceeding 5 and high risk as per ASA (4 scores) more often compared to those suffering from non-specific spinal osteomyelitis.

Overview of Literature: There have been several reports about clinical, hematological, pathological and radiological findings to differentiate pyogenic & <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis.</b> Methods: We screened 55 patients diagnosed with <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> and pyogenic spondylitis from January 1999 to June 2003. There were seven cases where it was difficult to make an accurate diagnosis. We reviewed the clinical manifestation, laboratory tests, radiological findings and confirmed the diagnoses by the use of biopsies and/or clinical response to treatment. Results: Four cases, which were initially diagnosed as pyogenic spondylitis, had a clinical presentation of fever (37. 4 � 38. 5 ℃) on the day of hospitalization. These cases later turned out to be <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis,</b> as confirmed by an open biopsy and pathologic study. Three cases initially diagnosed as pyogenic spondylitis were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Symptoms were aggravated in these cases, but improved after the use of an anti-tubercular drug. Bony union was observed in all cases in an averageof 4 months (range, 3 � 6 months). Conclusions: In infectious spondylitis, it is important to establish an accurate diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis can be made by laboratory findings and by estimation of the response to treatment during follow-up. If there is no response or aggravation of symptoms despite treatment based on an initial diagnosis, the etiologic organism must be re-evaluated.

40|$|So far, {{there have}} been few {{previous}} reports of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> occurring after percutaneous vertebroplasty. We report an unusual case of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> diagnosed after percutaneous vertebroplasty in a patient who had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis for the first time. A 58 -year-old woman, who had a history of complete recovery from pulmonary tuberculosis six years previously, was hospitalized due to severe back pain after a fall.

Forty five patients with <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital were asked to fill Short Form- 36 and visual analog scale before and after surgery. The data was analyzed and compared before and after surgery in 8 aspects, which is physical function, physical health, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional problems, and mental health. Results. Surgery significantly improved patients 2 ̆ 7 quality of life in all aspects with average physical component summary from 23 to 70 and mental component summary from 35 to 75 (p < 0. 001). There was significant decrease in visual analog scale from seven to one. Significant correlations were seen between American Spinal Injury Association status and physical component summary, between American Spinal Injury Association status and mental component summary after surgery (r = 0. 46 and r = 0. 48). We categorized the patients into three groups based on duration follow up. There was increased physical component summary and mental component summary for each group. Increased quality of life was shown by improvement of Short Form- 36 score. VAS score decreased significantly in post-operative group. Conclusions. Fusion and posterior instrumentation surgery improves patient 2 ̆ 7 s quality of life and decrease the perceived pain scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyse a {{skeleton}} (adult female, 25 - 30 years) that presented evidence of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis.</b> The skeleton, dated from the Roman Period (III-VI centuries), was excavated near the town of Gy&# 337;r, in western Hungary. The skeleton was examined by gross observation supplemented with mycolic acid and proteomic analyses using MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. The biomolecular analyses supported the morphological diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: One of the {{important}} sites for extrapulmonary TB involvement is the skeleton. <b>Tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> (Pott’s disease) comprises 50 - 70 % of the skeletal tuberculosis.  Methods: In this case series study, we prospectively investigated the result of anterior surgery alone (anterior debridement, fusion and instrumentation) in the patients with spinal tuberculosis. The patients with immature skeleton, long segment disease or kyphosis more than 50 ° were excluded. All the cases were followed for at least 2 years (mean 31. 4 +/- 6. 4 months).  Results: This study comprised of 23 (13 male and 10 female) cases {{with a mean age}} of 35. 8 (SD= 7. 8) years old. Segmental kyphosis was corrected from + 11. 9 ° (SD= 13. 8 °) preoperatively to - 3. 8 ° (SD= 8. 9 °) after surgery that was mainly maintained at the last follow up visit. Bony union was achieved in all cases but one.  Conclusions: Our results showed that in selected cases of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis,</b> anterior surgery alone could be encouraging...|$|E
40|$|Backgrounds:Pott's {{disease is}} a rare form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and {{presents}} with several clinical patterns. Delay in diagnosis and management may   cause serious complications. We conducted a retrospective study between 1991 -findings, and therapeutic approaches to spinal tuberculosis. Methods: We reviewed clinical presentation, radiological and laboratory findings of 58 patients with spinal tuberculosis retrospectively. The diagnosis of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> was based on characteristic histology or microbiologic evidence of the disease. The results of study were recorded, and statistically analyzed by SPSS  11. 5. Results: The most frequent symptom was back pain (84 %), with thoracic region   being the most affected site (46 %). Paravertebral abscess noted in 67 % of cases and the average time for diagnosis was 16 months.   Conclusions: The 42 cases of this study underwent surgery and all were treated with drug therapy for 12 months. There was no worsening of the neurologic status in   any patient. All patients with <b>tuberculous</b> <b>spondylitis</b> began to improve 3 months after   chemotherapy and healed within 12 months in nonsurgical and surgical groups. ...|$|E

The patient had undergone percutaneous needle aspiration of an abscess in the cavity of the psoas muscle. Early results from the culture regimen showed isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. After eight weeks, mycobacterium tuberculosis was grown at regimen which was cultured at the same site.
