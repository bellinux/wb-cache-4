These forces remained in the country until mid-2002, fighting to secure remote {{areas of the country}} and participating in operations such as Operation Anaconda, the Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif, and the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi. The division also participated in fighting in the Shahi Khot Valley in 2002. Upon the return of the battalions, they were welcomed home and praised by President Bush.

5|$|Bennington {{was awarded}} to N. F. Palmer & Co. of Chester, Pennsylvania in November 1887, but her hull was {{subcontracted}} to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding & Engine Works which laid down her keel in June 1888. Bennington was launched in June 1890. After her June 1891 commissioning at New York, Bennington joined the Squadron of Evolution for its cruise to South America. The gunboat made two Mediterranean tours between 1892 and 1894, after which she was assigned to duties in the Pacific. She sailed the Pacific coasts of North and Central America and spent time in the Hawaiian Islands protecting American interests there. On her way <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>U.S.</b> Army operations of the Philippine–American War, Bennington claimed Wake Island for the United States. After {{two years in the}} Philippines, she returned to the United States and was taken out of commission for 18 months for repairs and refitting. After her March 1903 re-commissioning, most of the next two years were spent patrolling the Pacific coasts of North and South America.|$|E
5|$|The {{project is}} funded through an equity {{contribution}} of about USD 200m from Diwaco, a USD 300m grant and a USD 100m stand-by facility from the Jordanian government, {{as well as}} USD 475m in foreign loans to Diwaco. The project's total cost {{is expected to be}} $1.1 billion USD. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation has lent USD 250m to Diwaco <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>U.S.</b> foreign investment on the basis that General Electric partially owns GAMA Energy. The state-owned French bank PROPARCO, which is the part of the French Development Agency (AFD) that supports private sector development, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) each lent about USD 100m to Diwaco. The loan package has been put together by the Arab Banking Corporation. Much of the government grant supporting the project comes from sovereign soft loans that the government of Jordan has borrowed from the EIB and AFD and passes on as a grant to the project. AFD provided USD 50m for the state grant and USD 48m for the stand-by facility.|$|E

25|$|The {{bridge at}} Maison Rouge proved unable <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>U.S.</b> tanks (the bridge {{collapsed}} {{under the weight}} of a tank), and so the 30th Infantry had only minimal antitank capability (bazookas and three 57 mm anti-tank guns) when they were counter-attacked late in the afternoon by German infantry and heavy tank destroyers of the 708th Volksgrenadier Division and 280th Assault Gun Battalion. Without cover and unable to dig foxholes because of the frozen terrain, the 30th Infantry was forced to withdraw, taking heavy casualties when the withdrawal assumed the character of a rout. The 30th Infantry reformed on {{the west bank of the}} Ill but was out of action for three days while it reorganized.|$|E

25|$|On October 30, 1873, the Virginius, a munitions and troop {{transportation}} ship {{supporting the}} Cuban Rebellion and flying the U.S. flag, {{was captured by}} Spanish authorities. After a hasty trial in Santiago, Cuba, Spanish authority executed 53 crew members, including American and British citizens. Although Sumner sympathized with the Cuban rebels {{and those who were}} executed by Spanish Republican authority, he refused <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>U.S.</b> military intervention or the annexation of Cuba. On November 17, 1873, when located by a reporter, Sumner stated his views in an interview on the Virginius Affair at a local library in Boston. Sumner believed that although the ship was flying a U.S. flag, the mission of the ship was illegal. Sumner, who opposed the Cuban insurgent neutrality of the Grant Administration, believed that the United States needed to support the First Spanish Republic. On November 28, 1873, Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, who coolly handled the incident amidst national outcries for war, negotiated a peaceful settlement with Spanish President Emilio Castelar, and prevented war with Spain.|$|E

500|$|On December 29, the United Nations General Assembly voted, 75–20 with 40 abstentions, {{to condemn}} the {{invasion}} as a [...] "flagrant violation of international law". The invasion was followed by widespread looting, as the Panamanian police stood by; Kempe reported that the looters caused half a billion U.S. dollars in damages, which the U.S. government later helped repair. Overall, the invasion would cause U.S. $1.5 billion in property damage. According to a CBS poll, 92% of Panamanian adults supported the U.S. incursion, and 76% wished that U.S. forces had invaded in October during the coup. Activist Barbara Trent disputed this finding, saying in a 1992 Academy Award-winning documentary The Panama Deception that the Panamanian surveys were completed in wealthy, English-speaking neighborhoods in Panama City, among Panamanians most likely <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>U.S.</b> actions.|$|E

500|$|MK Dons {{initially}} {{maintained that}} any debate was pointless as their club {{was simply a}} renamed Wimbledon F.C.. Winkelman was unequivocal when answering readers' questions in FourFourTwo magazine in November 2004: [...] "MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon share the same heritage, but we're the real child of Wimbledon", he wrote. One reader asked: [...] "Now that you have renamed the team, and changed the badge and colours, {{do you agree that}} AFC Wimbledon now carry the true spirit of Wimbledon?"; Winkelman replied that AFC Wimbledon's founders had betrayed their club and [...] "left their team before their team left them". In another answer, he poured scorn on suggestions that he might give Wimbledon F.C.'s trophy replicas to AFC Wimbledon, writing that the fans had [...] "abdicated their right to it when they all walked away."

Around 09:00, Patton was wounded while leading six men and a tank in an attack on German machine guns {{near the town of}} Cheppy. His orderly, Private First Class Joe Angelo, saved Patton, for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Patton commanded the battle from a shell hole for another hour before being evacuated. He stopped at a rear command post to submit his report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E. Brett, commander of the U.S. 326th Tank Battalion, took command of the brigade in Patton's absence. Patton {{wrote in a letter to}} his wife: [...] "The bullet went into the front of my left leg and came out just at the crack of my bottom about two inches to the left of my rectum. It was fired at about 50m so made a hole about the size of a [...] dollar where it came out." ...|$|E
500|$|Dowling was {{appointed}} a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1957 New Year Honours, and completed his term as CNS on 23February 1959. On 23March {{he took over}} from Sir Henry Wells as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), a role foreshadowing that of the latter-day Chief of the Defence Force. He was succeeded as CNS by Vice Admiral Henry Burrell. Happily surprised by his appointment as Chairman of COSC, Dowling hoped to transform the position such that it would exercise command authority over the service chiefs, but in this {{he was to be}} disappointed. The position's rank remained the same as the heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and was only responsible for putting their views on military matters to the Minister for Defence. Other setbacks during his tenure included the Defence Department's decision—rescinded after his term—to disband the Fleet Air Arm, and the Federal government's failure to back him when he announced at a SEATO press conference in March 1961 that Australia was prepared to intervene militarily in the second Laotian crisis should it become necessary. In September 1959, during the first Laotian crisis, the Australian government had authorised Dowling to commit [...] "an infantry battalion, a squadron of RAAF fighters, air transport, and two RAN destroyers" [...] <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>US</b> and SEATO forces, but no intervention took place.|$|E

500|$|According to Blair, [...] "Khánh {{could play}} Lodge like a musical instrument" [...] in {{justifying}} his coup. The day after coming to power, Khánh further claimed to Lodge that Don was {{in possession of}} briefing papers from the Americans on plans for the bombing of North Vietnam {{and said that they}} were in danger of being handed over to the communists. Khánh further claimed to be desperately trying to retrieving the documents to prevent the communists from accessing the material. Blair cited Lodge's immediate response—he took Khánh seriously and sent an urgent cable to Washington through the top-secret CIA channel—as an example of gullibility with respect to Khánh's tendency to make grandiose and self-serving claims. Lodge was also greatly reassured by Khánh's assurances <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>US</b> bombing of North Vietnam, increased actions against the Viet Cong and an increase in US advisers down to village level. Lodge also told Khánh that military progress was the bottom line as far as continued US support for his leadership was concerned. According to Blair, [...] "For Lodge, when something was done, it was done, and he cleared his mind of all but the cover-story". She said that Lodge was not interested in getting detailed information on the coup, only that [...] "the best information was that the coup was planned and carried out by General Thieu".|$|E
500|$|Cut-off, about midnight the North Korean 239th Regiment {{attempted}} {{to break out}} to the north, launching a number of attacks against the Americans. During the first attack {{a small group of}} North Koreans succeeded in infiltrating the K Company command post at Yongju. In the close-quarter fighting that ensured Captain Claude K. Josey, the American company commander, tackled a North Korean machine-gunner, and despite being wounded twice he succeeded in disarming him before collapsing from his injuries. Josey was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions. As the fighting continued the K Company executive officer was also wounded, yet the Americans eventually drove off the North Koreans, many of whom were subsequently killed. Nearby, the British and Australians could hear the sounds of heavy fighting between the Americans and North Koreans [...] to the north. Half an hour later a small group of North Koreans attacked A Company, 1 ASHR with grenades, killing two men and wounding two more before being repulsed having suffered one killed and one wounded. A large concentration of around 300 North Koreans were subsequently observed assembling in Yongju by the K Company forward observer, however the American artillery had relocated during the fighting and was unable to engage the target. Two guns from C Battery, US 674th Artillery Battalion were ordered to reposition south Sukchon <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>US</b> 3/187 RCT. Following two more North Korean attacks the Americans near Hill 163 were forced to abandon the roadblock after running out of ammunition. Detecting the withdrawal, the North Koreans attacked again at 04:00. Meanwhile, after forcing their way through heavy North Korean machine-gun and rifle fire the two American howitzers were successfully redeployed, coming into action at 04:15. To the south, the British and Australians could hear the sounds of renewed fighting, and they began to fear that the Americans had been overrun.|$|E
