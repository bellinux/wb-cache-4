5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E

25|$|As some {{of their}} {{potential}} witnesses are attacked and prevented from supporting the Cullens, Carlisle and Edward realize {{they may have to}} fight the Volturi. Their witnesses ultimately agree <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> them in battle, having realized the Volturi increased the Guard by falsely accusing covens of crimes, destroy them and then recruit vampires with gifts. The Volturi arrive prepared for battle, led by Aro, who is eager to obtain the gifted members of the Cullen coven as part of his guard. Aro is allowed to touch Renesmee, and is convinced that she is not an immortal child. Irina is brought forth and takes full responsibility for her mistake, leading to her immediate death. Aro still insists that Renesmee may pose a risk in the future, validating his claim that battle is necessary. Before any violence, Alice shares with Aro her vision of the battle that is to come, during which both sides sustain heavy casualties, including Aro who would also die. Aro believes her, giving Alice and Jasper an opportunity to reveal their witness, Nahuel (a half mortal half vampire just like Renesmee). The witness proves that he is not a threat, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not a threat. The Volturi unhappily walk away, explaining {{that there will be no}} battle today.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} the bridge was built, {{engineers}} had not discovered the aerodynamics of bridge construction. Bridges were not tested in wind tunnels until the 1950s, well {{after the collapse of}} the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, known as Galloping Gertie, in 1940. It is therefore fortunate that the open truss structure supporting the deck is by its nature less subject to aerodynamic problems. Roebling designed a bridge and truss system that was six times as strong as he thought it needed to be. Because of this, the Brooklyn Bridge is still standing when many of the bridges built around the same time have vanished or been replaced. This is also in spite of the substitution of inferior quality wire in the cabling supplied by the contractor J. Lloyd Haigh—by the time it was discovered, it was too late to replace the cabling that had already been constructed. Roebling determined that the poorer wire would leave the bridge four rather than six times as strong as necessary, so it was eventually allowed <b>to</b> <b>stand,</b> <b>with</b> the addition of 250 cables. Diagonal cables were installed from the towers to the deck, intended to stiffen the bridge. They turned out to be unnecessary, but were kept for their distinctive beauty.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{suffered}} a reversal in the 1983 general election, when the SDLP contested the seat. Maginnis won {{and held the}} seat for the UUP for the next eighteen years until he retired. By this point boundary changes had resulted in a broad 50:50 balance between unionists and nationalists and {{it was expected that}} a single unionist candidate would hold the seat in the 2001 general election. James Cooper was nominated by the UUP. On this occasion, however, both the nationalist and unionist votes were to be split. Initially, Maurice Morrow of the DUP was nominated <b>to</b> <b>stand,</b> <b>with</b> the DUP fiercely opposing the UUP's support for the Good Friday Agreement. Morrow then withdrew in favour of Jim Dixon, a survivor of the Enniskillen bombing who stood as an Independent Unionist opposed to the Agreement. Tommy Gallagher of the SDLP ran, but his intervention did not do enough damage to Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin's Michelle Gildernew won by 53 votes over Cooper. Subsequently, the result was challenged amid allegations that a polling station had been kept open by force for longer than the deadline, allowing more people to vote, but the courts—while conceding that this happened—did not uphold the challenge, because it held that the votes cast after the legal closing time would not have affected the outcome.|$|E
25|$|Constance Myers {{indicates}} that three factors {{led to the}} expulsion of the Trotskyists from the Socialist Party in 1937: the divergence between the official Socialists and the Trotskyist faction on the issues, the determination of Altman's wing of the Militants to oust the Trotskyists, and Trotsky's own decision to move towards a break with the party. Recognizing that the Clarity faction had chosen <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> the Altmanites and the Thomas group, Trotsky recommended that the Appeal group focus on disagreements over Spain to provoke a split. At the same time, Thomas, freshly returned from Spain, {{had come to the}} conclusion that the Trotskyists had joined the SP not to make it stronger, but to capture the organization for their own purposes. On June 24–25, 1937, a meeting of the Appeal faction's National Action Committee voted to ratcheted up the rhetoric against American Labor Party and Republican nominee for mayor of New York Fiorello LaGuardia, a favorite son of many in Socialist ranks, and to reestablish their newspaper, The Socialist Appeal. This was met with expulsions from the party beginning August 9 with a rump meeting of the Central Committee of Local New York, which expelled 52 New York Trotskyists by a vote of 48 to 2, with 18 abstentions, and ordering 70 more to be brought up on charges. Wholesale expulsions followed, with a major section of the YPSL leaving the party with the Trotskyists.|$|E

500|$|On March 11, 2003, Republican U.S. Representatives Bob Ney and Walter B. Jones {{directed}} the three House cafeterias {{to change all}} references to French fries and French toast on menus, {{and replace them with}} Freedom fries and Freedom toast, respectively. Jones chose to follow Cubbie's example by circulating a letter to his colleagues advocating their renaming because, he said, [...] "the French were 'sitting on the sidelines. As Ney was Chairman of the United States House Committee on House Administration, the action did not require any vote, as the committee has authority over House cafeterias. According to a statement released by Ney, the renaming was intended to express displeasure with France's [...] "continued refusal <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> their U.S. allies". The statement further read: [...] "This action today is a small but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure many on Capitol Hill have with our so-called ally, France." [...] When asked about his view on the change, Jones said it was a [...] "lighthearted gesture".|$|E
500|$|After the {{surrender}} of General John Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga, Williams was exchanged on January 16, 1778. [...] During his imprisonment, Williams had been [...] promoted to colonel and given command of the 6th Maryland Regiment of the Maryland Line. [...] Shortly after his release, he stated {{in a letter to}} the governor of Maryland that the regiment contained [...] "...not above a hundred effective men... and that those are very indifferently clothed." [...] He further stated: [...] "I heartily desire to join the army as soon as possible but certainly it had better be reinforced by a regiment without a colonel than by a colonel without a regiment." [...] After joining Washington's army shortly before the Battle of Monmouth he learned that the regiment was noted for a looseness of discipline and was unable <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> others in the line during battle. Soon after he took effective command, the 6th Maryland Regiment became known as the equal, if not superior, to any in the whole army.|$|E
500|$|As the war progressed and Germany {{began to}} retreat further, Japanese {{ambassador}} Ōshima never wavered in his confidence that Germany would emerge victorious. However, in March 1945 he reported to Tokyo on the [...] "danger of Berlin becoming a battlefield" [...] and revealing a fear [...] "that {{the abandonment of}} Berlin may take place another month". On 13 April, he met with Ribbentrop — for the last time, it turned out — and vowed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> {{the leaders of the}} Third Reich in their hour of crisis but had to leave Berlin at once by Hitler's direct order. On 7 and 8 May 1945, as the German government surrendered to the Allied powers, Ōshima and his staff were taken into custody and brought to the United States. Now fighting an even more hopeless war, the Japanese government immediately denounced the German surrender as an act of treason and interned the few German individuals as well as confiscated all German property (such as submarines) in Japanese territory at the time. Four months later, on 2 September, Japan had to sign its own surrender documents.|$|E
