5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on the front wall.

They went to <b>the</b> <b>missionaries</b> and asked about Jesus. <b>The</b> <b>missionaries</b> and four Oraon people had many serious discussions about Jesus Christ and <b>the</b> <b>missionaries</b> answered many questions, but the four Oraon people struggled with one question: {{they wanted to see}} Jesus Christ face to face because <b>the</b> <b>missionaries</b> had claimed that Jesus is alive. Both <b>the</b> <b>missionaries</b> and <b>the</b> four seekers were frustrated on this question. When <b>the</b> <b>missionaries</b> could not convince the four seekers on the point that Jesus is alive, the four wanted to quit seeking Him. It was very difficult for the missionaries; after five years of dedicated work, they had four genuine seekers, people who wanted to see Jesus Christ before being baptized. Therefore, they requested that the seekers pray together before they went away. In this prayer with great burden and passion, something happened. The seekers said that they had seen Jesus and now they were ready to take baptism. Apparently, when the prayer ended, the Lord Jesus gave vision to the four seekers and they were convinced. These Oraon people were baptized on 9 June 1850.|$|R
