5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> different directions. Matters {{such as the}} sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E

25|$|In late October 1943, {{there were}} still a few Jews housed in the Citadel who were working for the German army. On October 28, the Nazis and Latvian {{auxiliaries}} rounded up these people and transferred them to the Kaiserwald concentration camp. By this time, some of the Jews had managed to find or buy arms, and there was resistance to this action. Others killed their family members and then themselves to prevent being <b>taken.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> escaped or hid, some {{with the help of}} at least two German soldiers, one named Liederman, the other Bruendl. A very small number (said to be 26 total), were permitted to stay on in the Citadel to work for the German army. On December 4, 1943, the Latvia police arrested these last Jews, leaving only three survivors who were still in hiding in the Citadel.|$|E
25|$|On {{that morning}} Allen sighted three vessels, {{the largest of}} which seemed the most suspicious. Echo gave chase and at 7p.m. the quarry raised French colours and fired a shot.

She was the letter of marque barque Amazon(e), armed with ten 6-pounder guns and {{carrying}} a crew of 60. She was sailing from Jacquemel to Bordeaux with a cargo of coffee. When Echo took her prisoners out of Amazon they proved to be quite unwell. Allen and his officers decided to put the prisoners on a Spanish sloop that Echo had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days earlier and they then directed the sloop to the nearest Spanish port. Echos sails needed a complete overhaul, and with the squadron nowhere in sight, Allen escorted Amazon to Port Royal.|$|E

From the San Francisco Peaks to the Colorado River, vital resources were in short supply.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} year as prime minister, Modi reduced {{the amount of money}} spent by the {{government}} on healthcare. The Modi government launched a [...] "New Health Policy" [...] in January 2015, although this did not increase the government's spending on healthcare, instead emphasizing the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates. The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices received nearly 25% less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the National Health Mission, and received less funds than in previous years. Modi initially appointed Harsh Vardhan, a doctor and an advocate of tobacco control, as minister of health. However, Vardhan was removed in November 2015. The government introduced stricter packaging laws for tobacco which requires 85% of the packet size to be covered by pictorial warnings. In its budget for the second year after it took office, the Modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%. Modi has generally emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health. An article in the medical journal Lancet stated that the country [...] "might have <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> steps back in public health" [...] under Modi.|$|E

Angelina believes she's Barbra Streisand mixed with Celine Dion." [...] The character is described as an alter ego by DeGarmo. DeGarmo revealed that she was having a [...] "blast" [...] picking out costumes for the over-the-top part: [...] "Her hair and make-up are icing on the cake" [...] she stated. Additionally, she noted that [...] "Angelina’s style has <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> notes from the cast of Jersey Shore." [...] Comparing Angelina to herself, she said: [...] "There are some things that I, Diana, would be too terrified to walk out of the house wearing, but Angelina is not afraid." [...] She is also described as a [...] "mafia princess". DeGarmo said: [...] "You never know what she's going to do, which keeps everyone on their toes. One minute she's nice, the next she snaps". According to DeGarmo, Angelina is fully aware that her father is a mob boss and: [...] "she doesn't mind. She likes throwing around her weight at any time. She loves the perks of being a mob boss's daughter. She lives for it." [...] Also, her character was probably based off of Angela Viracco, in the 1985 movie The Last Dragon.|$|E
