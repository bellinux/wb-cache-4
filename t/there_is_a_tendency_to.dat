25|$|A 2003 {{study by}} economists Robert J. Barro and Rachel McCleary {{suggests}} that societies {{with high levels}} of belief in heaven and high levels of church attendance exhibit high rates of economic growth. Barro and McCleary's model has been influential in subsequent scholarship and, to some observers, it supports the belief that Christianity has {{played a major role in}} South Korea's economic success. The study has been criticised by scholars such as Durlauf, Kortellos and Tan (2006). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> build megachurches since 2000, that leads some churches to financial debt.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of over 1000 specimens of Coelophysis at the Whitaker quarry at Ghost Ranch, has suggested gregarious behavior to researchers like Schwartz and Gillette. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> see this massive congregation of animals as evidence for huge packs of Coelophysis bauri roaming the land. No direct evidence for flocking exists; the deposits only indicate that {{large numbers of}} Coelophysis, along with other Triassic animals, were buried together. Some of the evidence from the taphonomy of the site indicates that these animals may have been gathered together to feed or drink from a depleted water hole or to feed on a spawning run of fish, and then became buried in a catastrophic flash flood or a drought.|$|E
25|$|Bitterness is of {{interest}} to those who study evolution, as well as various health researchers since {{a large number of}} natural bitter compounds are known to be toxic. The ability to detect bitter-tasting, toxic compounds at low thresholds is considered to provide an important protective function. Plant leaves often contain toxic compounds, yet even amongst leaf-eating primates, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fiber and poisons than mature leaves. Amongst humans, various food processing techniques are used worldwide to detoxify otherwise inedible foods and make them palatable. Furthermore, the use of fire, changes in diet, and avoidance of toxins has led to neutral evolution in human bitter sensitivity. This has allowed several loss of function mutations that has led to a reduced sensory capacity towards bitterness in humans when compared to other species.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{publication}} of Kenneth Frampton's Modern Architecture: A Critical History (first edition 1980) {{there has been a}} keen consciousness of the role of criticism within architectural theory. Whilst referencing Derrida as a philosophical influence, deconstructivism can also be seen as having as much a basis in critical theory as the other major offshoot of postmodernism, critical regionalism. The two aspects of critical theory, urgency and analysis, are found in deconstructivism. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> re-examine and critique other works or precedents in deconstructivism, and also a tendency to set aesthetic issues in the foreground. An example of this is the Wexner Center. Critical Theory, however, had at its core a critique of capitalism and its excess, and from that respect many of the works of the Deconstructivists would fail in that regard if only they are made for an elite and are, as objects, highly expensive, despite whatever critique they may claim to impart on the conventions of design.|$|E
