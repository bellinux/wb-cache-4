500|$|During the Revolutionary War Eustis became {{close friends}} with Aaron Burr, a {{friendship}} that deepened in the 1790s. [...] Burr and Eustis exchanged letters on <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intimate</b> subjects, recommending potential romantic partners {{to each other}} and sharing a taste for well-educated women. [...] Eustis aided Burr on one occasion by helping him find accommodations for a young woman whose mother had been involved in an adulterous relationship with Alexander Hamilton; she was placed in a Boston-area boarding school. [...] Eustis may have also been the subject of a teenage crush by Burr's daughter Theodosia, who shared intimate details of her life with him (including medical conditions emanating from a difficult pregnancy) well into adulthood.|$|E
500|$|Writing for 'The Philosophy of Computer Games Conference in 2015, Harrer and Pichlmair {{considered}} Resident Evil 5 to be [...] "yet {{another moment}} in the history of commodity racism, which from the late 19th century onwards allowed popular depictions of racial stereotypes to enter <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intimate</b> spaces of European homes." [...] The authors state that Africa is presented from a Western gaze; [...] "what it presented as 'authentic' blackness conforms to the projected fantasy of predominantly white gaming audience". In 2016, Paul Martin from Games and Culture said that the theme of the game could be described as [...] "dark continent", stating that it drew on imagery of European colonialism and depictions of [...] "Blackness" [...] reminiscent of 19th-century European theories on race.|$|E

500|$|Ramprasad's {{literary}} works include [...] Vidyasundar (or Kalikaman-gala) (ca. sixth or seventh {{decade of the}} 18th century), Kali-kirtana, the fragmentary Krishna-kirtana, and Shaktigiti. Kali-kirtana {{is a collection of}} lyric and narrative poetry describing the early life of Uma. Krishna-kirtana is an incomplete book of poems and songs to Krishna—the complete collection is yet to be discovered. Vidyasundara Kavya is written in a narrative style that was already popular in Bengali literature, telling the traditional love story of Vidya and Sundara—children of kings who are aided by Kali in meeting, falling in love, and marrying. Shaktigiti is Ramprasad's well known and respected work, in which he expresses his deepest feelings and love for Kali. In Shaktigiti, he shares <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intimate</b> relationship with Kali—a child who can both love and quarrel with his mother over the inequities of human birth.|$|E
500|$|Christian Ward of NME hailed it as [...] "a joyous, kaleidoscopic {{masterpiece}} of sun-kissed disco-pop", while Andy Kellman of AllMusic called {{it one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intimate</b> and emotional dance records that is not vocal-based. Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle found the album as surprising as [...] "Primal Scream's life-changing Screamadelica was a decade ago. It's downright shocking how fun this is". Pitchforks Matt LeMay credited the Avalanches for developing a [...] "unique context" [...] for the songs without compromising their original [...] "distinct flavor" [...] {{and said that the}} album [...] "sounds like nothing else" [...] because of how the samples are employed rather than their quality or volume. Q magazine's Gareth Grundy remarked that its clever music is delivered as engagingly as [...] "more conventional dance sounds" [...] and that the album [...] "finally fulfils sampling's original promise" [...] of producing new, extraordinary sounds from artfully appropriated pieces of existing songs. Amy Bell of Drowned in Sound praised it as one of the year's best albums.|$|E
500|$|Jason Newman of Rap-Up {{began his}} review, [...] "For a singer long {{accustomed}} to stadiums, Sunday's show was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intimate</b> performance most fans would {{see from the}} ubiquitous superstar." [...] He highlighted how she [...] "split the difference between hushed torch singer and stadium belter", and favored her ability to display both [...] "stamina and vigor, which make for a stadium-perfect show". Newman concluded, [...] "The medley combined the quick blasts of a Las Vegas revue with the emotional candor of a singer-songwriter performing to a near-empty room. It was an odd, yet effective juxtaposition; a global superstar who could effortlessly shuffle between slick, bombastic R and awkwardly honest confessions of a tumultuous career. By {{the end of the}} set though, humility, as one expects from a singer with 16 Grammy awards and more than 75 million records sold worldwide, turned to sly confidence." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times was impressed by the show, complimenting Beyoncé's performances of [...] "underdog tracks" [...] such as [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "Love on Top". He wrote: ...|$|E

500|$|... "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed. Music journalist Sam Richards {{rated the}} song four stars out of five, calling it [...] "a twinkling '90s alt. rock ballad- {{a cousin of}} Radiohead's [...] "High and Dry" [...] and Smashing Pumpkins' [...] "1979"- that just about manages to {{keep a lid on}} its impulse to seek out the nearest clifftop." [...] Hot Press editor Niall Stokes said [...] "the performance is full of languorous beauty, a gentle understated kind of emotion that seems at odds with the disorientation in the lyrics." [...] Billboard contributor Fred Bronson joked that it was an example of how songs named [...] "Stay" [...] reach the Hot 100, following similarly named hits by Big Mountain, The Four Seasons, Shakespears Sister, and Jodeci. Robert Levine of Spin called it one of their best songs, saying [...] "They're still obsessed with transcendence, whether it's the kind you find on a Joshua Tree bluff or a [...] "Miami" [...] dance floor. And [...] framed that search in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intimate</b> of terms, even when they were too jaded to crawl out from under their lemon and look us in the eye." ...|$|E
500|$|... "La Couchette" [...] follows six {{characters}} on a sleeper carriage travelling from Paris to Bourg St. Maurice. Shearsmith {{said that the}} writers aimed to exploit the intimacy of the setting; the unusual situation which is created by trying to sleep in what is potentially {{a room full of}} strangers. This was, for Shearsmith, an [...] "odd frisson" [...] to play with. Discussing the filming, Whitehall said that the set was [...] "definitely <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intimate</b> location I have ever been on ... It's all on springs so it moves around like a train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the first day I threw up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on the intimacy of the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series. Nonetheless, she had [...] "such a fun week" [...] filming the episode, noting that, despite the limited space on-set, it is [...] "amazing how quickly you become institutionalised". Similarly, Pemberton noted that the filming resulted in [...] "a tough week", but that it was [...] "really fun, because it's a very fun episode".|$|E
500|$|A {{writer from}} the website E! Online felt {{that in the}} video, Beyoncé [...] "most {{certainly}} comes into her own". Puja Patel of Spin regarded it as [...] "practically a tribute to her curves". An editor for CTV News noted how the singer was seen hovering over a bed in an exorcist style. Kathy Iandoli from Vice remarked the same particular scenes for showing Beyoncé living in a matrix. Billie Cohen from the magazine Condé Nast Traveler noted that [...] "maybe {{one of the most}} memorable image" [...] from the visual album was when the singer was seen falling on a king-size bed in [...] "Rocket". In what she perceived to be the best dance moves on the album, Lindsey Weber of Vulture listed the same scene. Considering it one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intimate</b> videos on the entire record, Michael Zelenko from The Fader noted, [...] "In a collection full of erotic videos, 'Rocket,' with its heaving chests, bare thighs, bubble baths, and nails clawing at sheets, manages to stand apart as the steamiest of the bunch." [...] Jody Rosen of The New York Times opined that the video featured mostly slow-motion pictures of [...] "billowing silk sheets and water droplets tumbling onto Beyoncé's bare midriff". Neil McCormik from The Daily Telegraph noted the lack of subtlety during the scenes showing a power drill and Beyoncé [...] "shuddering with pleasure". In another review, he labeled the clip as [...] "very naughty".|$|E
5000|$|Koethe's {{work has}} been well {{received}} by critics and academicians. John Freeman, writing in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, praised Sally's Hair by noting: [...] "We're wrapped around Koethe's finger."

500|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 18th century, the once-prosperous Safavid realm was in a state of heavy decline, with insurrections in {{numerous}} parts of its domains. The king, Sultan Husayn, was a weak ruler, and although personally inclined to be more humane, flexible, and relaxed than his chief mullah, he went along with the recommendations of his advisers regarding important state decisions. He reigned as a [...] "stationary monarch", preferring, apart from the occasional hunting party, to be inside or near the capital of Isfahan at all times, invisible to all [...] "but <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intimate</b> of courtiers". Having seen not much more of the world than the harem walls, he had quickly fallen under the spell of the leading ulama, most notably Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi. Majlesi, who had already gained considerable political power during the reign of Sultan Husayn's predecessor SuleimanI ( [...] 1666–1694), instigated the persecutions directed towards Safavid Iran's Sunni and Sufi inhabitants, as well as its non-Muslim religious minorities, namely Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians. Though the Christians, mainly represented by the Armenians, suffered less than other groups, they were also targeted from time to time. As Prof.Roger Savory states, even though Sultan Husayn did not show personal hostility towards Christians, he was persuaded by the clergy (Majlisi in particular), who had great influence over him, to issue [...] "unjust and intolerant decrees". The tense religious atmosphere in the late Safavid era would prove to be a significant factor in the revolts by Sunni adherents from various places within the empire. As Prof.Michael Axworthy notes: [...] "The clearest example was the revolt in Shirvan, where Sunni religious men had been killed, religious books destroyed and Sunni mosques turned into stables".|$|E

"For an individual, the {{problems}} of interpretation are challenging enough", writes Waterman, [...] "but for a quartet grappling with some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> profound, <b>intimate</b> and heartfelt compositions in the music literature, the communal nature of decision-making is often more testing than the decisions themselves." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 2015 {{documentary}} Listen to Me Marlon, Brando {{shared his}} thoughts on playing a death scene, stating, [...] "That's a tough scene to play. You have to make 'em believe that you are dying ... Try to think of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intimate</b> moment you've ever had in your life." [...] Brando's favorite actors were Spencer Tracy, John Barrymore, Fredric March, James Cagney and Paul Muni.|$|E

2500|$|Many reviewers {{have noted}} the {{difficulty}} of writing about Gone Girl, because so little {{in the first half}} of the novel is what it seems to be.
