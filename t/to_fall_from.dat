5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} moved generally eastward from Oklahoma and produced heavy rains from Missouri to Ohio on February 8. By February 9, it had reached Kentucky. A new, secondary {{low pressure}} system formed over Georgia along the warm front {{associated with the}} primary low. As the secondary low matured along the U.S. East Coast, the initial center weakened rapidly, and heavy rainfall developed over the Carolinas in association with the new low. Mixed precipitation soon spread across the Mid-Atlantic States, and heavy snow began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> New Jersey northward by 1200 UTC on February 9.|$|E
40|$|This Briefing {{provides}} an overview of hospitalised injury due <b>to</b> <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders. Injurious <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders requiring admission to hospital occurred at a rate of 18. 5 per 100, 000 population in the year to June 30 2005 (n= 3, 486). Two-thirds of hospitalised injury incidents due <b>to</b> <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders in this year resulted in fractures and more than 40 % of <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders occurred in the home. Rates increased markedly with age and, unlike most other types of <b>fall</b> injuries, <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders were more common for older males than for older females. Both the number and the rate of injurious ladder-related falls have increased for older Australians in recent years...|$|R

5|$|The third villain is Riccardo, who wields a flintlock pistol. For the {{majority}} of the game, Riccardo keeps his face hidden under a hood. Upon revealing himself however, Fiona is shocked to see her dead father's face. Riccardo reveals that he and her father, Ugo, are clones. He murdered Ugo in the car accident as revenge for leaving the castle and marrying Fiona's mother. He plans to use Fiona (by means of her womb and use of her Azoth) to bring about his own rebirth, so that he may live forever. As they fight atop a water tower, Hewie rescues Fiona by attacking Riccardo, causing him <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> the summit.|$|E
5|$|After {{two seasons}} in Kansas City, the {{franchise}} moved to Denver and was renamed the Colorado Rockies it {{played at the}} McNichols Sports Arena. The team won its first game as the Rockies, 4–2, against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Rockies were in position {{to qualify for the}} playoffs 60 games into the 1976–77 season, but a streak of 18 games without a win caused them <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> contention. The Rockies ended the campaign last in the division with a 20–46–14 record and 54 points, and improved to 59 points the next season. Despite having the sixth-worst record in the League, the Rockies beat-out the Vancouver Canucks for second in the Division by two points and gained a playoff berth. The Philadelphia Flyers eliminated the Rockies from the playoffs in the preliminary rounds.|$|E
5|$|Denis Compton hit a {{cautious}} 62, but Middlesex lost wickets regularly <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> 1/78 to 203 all out. Five bowlers shared the wickets, Johnston and Loxton taking three apiece. At one stage, Australia were 53/3, but Morris (109) and Loxton (123) {{put on a}} partnership of 172. No other batsman bettered Hamence's 30, and Jim Sims took 6/65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46. Middlesex scored 135 in their second innings, with only John Dewes (51) and Leslie Compton resisting the tourists, while eight managed only single figures. Five bowlers shared the wickets, and McCool {{was the only one}} to take three. McCool and Ring made the 22 required for victory in four overs.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} that Matt Hardy was not medically cleared to compete (due to an injury suffered on a previous episode of SmackDown), and a match {{was announced}} with Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) defending his WWE United States Championship against the fans' choice between Kane, The Great Khali, and Mark Henry. The second match was for the ECW Championship between CM Punk and The Miz, {{the winner of the}} voting. The match was back and forth {{for the first half of}} the match. The Miz gained the advantage after forcing Punk <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> the second rope. Punk came back after hip tossing The Miz from the top rope. Punk won the match after a GTS.|$|E
5|$|Luton Town's {{most recent}} {{successful}} period began in 1981–82, when the club won the Second Division, and thereby gained promotion to the First. Luton defeated Arsenal 3–2 in the 1988 Football League Cup Final and {{remained in the}} First Division until relegation {{at the end of}} the 1991–92 season. Between 2007 and 2009, financial difficulties caused the club <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> the second tier of English football to the fifth in successive seasons. The last of these relegations came during the 2008–09 season, when 30 points were docked from Luton's record for various financial irregularities. Luton thereafter spent five seasons in non-League football before winning the Conference Premier in 2013–14, securing promotion back into the Football League.|$|E

5|$|Michael Schumacher took {{an early}} pit stop on lap 34 {{and his team}} {{inspected}} his rear of his car {{as well as an}} adjustment to his front wing angle. He rejoined behind Barrichello, but ahead of Häkkinen who overtook Villeneuve on lap 35. Heidfeld pulled {{off to the side of}} the track with an engine failure on the previous lap after he made a pit stop. Alesi in the other Prost stalled at his pit stop and emerged in front of Irvine. Trulli became the first front runner to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 39. Alesi retired when his engine failed on lap 40. Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Zonta, Coulthard, Villeneuve and Fisichella made their pit stops over the next three laps. Salo pulled into retirement after his engine failed on lap 42. All of the drivers changed from dry to wet-weather tyres as rain began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> lap 42 onwards. Häkkinen was the final driver to pit on lap 46.

5|$|The fifth {{match was}} {{the debut of}} the TerrorDome and {{involved}} Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt. Before the match, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the winner would take Kurt Angle's place in the main event, {{in addition to being}} the TNA X Division Championship number one contender. In this match, the ring was surrounded by a giant red steel barred cage with a domed roof. The wrestlers were to compete as they climbed up the side to a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling; the first to escape the cage would win. While Devine was attempting to escape, Kaz intervened and caused Devine <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> the ceiling into a group of wrestlers huddled in the center of the ring. Kaz then climbed out of the hole to win the contest at ten minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E
5|$|Jones and Mutt are {{captured}} by Mac and the Soviets {{and taken to}} their camp in the Amazon jungle, where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood, who reveals that Mutt is Jones' son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great psychic power, and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator. Jones and his four allies escape with the skull, but Marion and Jones get caught into a dry sandpit, to be recaptured by the Soviets after Oxley accidentally brings them as assistance. On their way to Akator, Mac tells Jones he is a CIA double-agent to regain Jones' trust, and Jones' team fights {{its way out of}} the Soviets' clutches, while Dovchenko is devoured by siafu ants. Jones and his allies cause many of the Soviets <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> a cliff, and they survive three waterfalls in an amphibious vehicle. Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent, is still loyal to Spalko and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; {{the souls of the}} Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of the Underworld. When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's {{electricity}} supply was, {{until the early}} 2000s, generated almost entirely from hydroelectric sources; power stations on Lakes Burera and Ruhondo provided 90% of the country's electricity. A combination of below average rainfall and human activity, including the draining of the Rugezi wetlands for cultivation and grazing, caused the two lakes' water levels <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> 1990 onwards; by 2004 levels were reduced by 50%, leading to {{a sharp drop in}} output from the power stations. This, coupled with increased demand as the economy grew, precipitated a shortfall in 2004 and widespread loadshedding. As an emergency measure, the government installed diesel generators north of Kigali; by 2006 these were providing 56% of the country's electricity, but were very costly. The government enacted a number of measures to alleviate this problem, including rehabilitating the Rugezi wetlands, which supply water to Burera and Ruhondo and investing in a scheme to extract methane gas from Lake Kivu, expected in its first phase to increase the country's power generation by 40%. Only 18% of the population had access to electricity in 2012, though this had risen from 10.8% in 2009. The government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013–18 aims to increase access to electricity to 70% of households by 2017.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of ways to {{approach}} the game's situations: players can use a violent approach and shoot their way through environments while using cover to hide from enemy fire. Alternately, Adam can take a stealthy approach, avoiding guards and security devices, again using cover to avoid enemy sight lines. Adam can move between cover elements and around corners while staying hidden. The melee takedown system offers lethal and non-lethal options, in addition to an assortment of lethal and non-lethal weapons. Adam can also move the bodies of enemies into hiding places, preventing them from being seen and raising an alarm. A key part of Adam's abilities are augmentations, which can be acquired and upgraded using Praxis Kits either bought from special vendors, found in the game environments, or are automatically unlocked by leveling up: higher-level augmentations require more Praxis Kits to unlock. Augmentation functions can range from passive enhancements to Adam's vision or damage resistance, to active upgrades such as allowing Adam <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> great heights without being injured or increase his strength. Some augmentations are dependent on Adam's energy level, deactivating after an amount of energy has been drained.|$|E
