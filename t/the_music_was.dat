5|$|After {{writing down}} rules about how <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>was</b> to be used, such as {{specific}} scenes certain songs {{should be used}} in, or ways a certain song should not be used, the game's scripters implemented the music at points they found fitting. During debugging, Nakazawa would request fixes for songs {{that he did not}} think fit the scenes they were used in. For the PlayStation Portable release, Asami Imai performed the opening theme.|$|E
5|$|An edited {{version of}} the musical cue from the Tar Sequence (where the inmates are energetically paving the road) {{has been used for}} years as the theme music for local {{television}} stations' news programs around the world, mostly those owned and operated by ABC in the United States. Although <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>was</b> written for the film, it became more familiar for its association with television news, in part because its staccato melody resembles the sound of a telegraph.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} major Final Fantasy game for mobile devices, Before Crisis was {{designed}} as a gameplay and multiplayer experience unique to the platform.

5|$|Beginning {{development}} in 1987, it was conceived by designer and writer Shouzou Kaga: {{he wanted to}} combine the strategic elements of Famicom Wars with the characters and story of a role-playing video game. Keisuke Terasaki acted as director and Gunpei Yokoi produced, while <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>was</b> composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko. The scale of the game meant that the team needed to find ways around memory storage problems, and make compromises with the graphics and storyline. While initial sales and critical reception were lackluster, it later became popular, launching the Fire Emblem series. The game would later be credited with popularizing the tactical role-playing genre in general.|$|E
