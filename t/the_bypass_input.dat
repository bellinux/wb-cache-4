50|$|Sacramento {{experienced}} several severe floods {{prior to}} construction of <b>the</b> <b>bypass.</b> During wet years, <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> can {{be full of}} water.

5|$|By 1997, {{the start}} of {{construction}} of <b>the</b> Hampstead <b>Bypass</b> was proposed {{for three to four}} years in the future; at that time, most of the engineering phase was complete but most of the highway right-of-way had yet to be purchased. The three-year timeframe was again put forth in 2001. Finally, in 2004, officials announced that <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> would begin construction in autumn 2005. Construction finally got underway in summer 2006. Houcksville Road's bridge over <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> and <b>the</b> highway's bridges over Shiloh Road and Indian Run were completed in 2007. The roundabouts at MD 482 and {{at the southern end of}} <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> opened, without connections to <b>the</b> under-construction <b>bypass,</b> in April and May 2009, respectively.

5|$|Since {{as early}} as 1967, local {{officials}} have discussed building a Manchester bypass, either as a separate project {{or as part of}} a road bypassing both Hampstead and Manchester. However, by the mid-1970s, the town of Manchester decided it did not want <b>the</b> <b>bypass.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> was planned to pass to the west of Manchester, but the town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> route. <b>The</b> planned <b>bypass</b> route was eventually changed to be east of town. After two decades of disagreement by the town and county over the path of <b>the</b> <b>bypass,</b> in 1993 <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> was placed in the town's master plan. However, state support for <b>the</b> Manchester <b>bypass</b> was scrapped in 1998 by Smart Growth proponent and governor Parris Glendening, who said <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> would promote suburban sprawl. <b>The</b> Manchester <b>Bypass</b> is neither in the Maryland Department of Transportation's Consolidated Transportation Program for 2012 to 2017 nor in MDSHA's 2011 Highway Needs Inventory for the next 20 years.|$|R
50|$|Burgh Bypass is a <b>bypass</b> of <b>the</b> town of Burgh Le Marsh near Skegness.

50|$|The normal {{definition}} for <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> ratio (BPR) of a turbofan engine is the ratio between the {{mass flow rate}} of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> stream to <b>the</b> mass flow rate entering the core. A 10:1 bypass ratio, for example, means that 10 kg of air passes through <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> duct for every 1 kg of air passing through the core. Note that in an aft fan engine, like the General Electric CJ805-23, all of the fan air enters <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> stream, whereas on most turbofans only the air entering the outer section of the fan passes to <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> duct. Another special case is the General Electric TF39 {{where most of the}} fan air plus some of the low pressure compressor air enter <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> duct.|$|R
40|$|Atrioventricular bypass tract {{deflections}} {{were recorded}} in five patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome using standard, closely spaced (5 mm) electrode catheters. Three right paraseptal and two left-sided Kent bundles were recorded {{at the level of}} the tricuspid valve on the His bundle catheter and in the coronary sinus, respectively. Characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tracts were studied during atrial pacing, programmed premature atrial stimulation, induction of supraventricular tachycardias and programmed ventricular stimulation. During atrial pacing, as pre-excitation increased, <b>the</b> stimulus to <b>bypass</b> tract deflection time remained unchanged. In five patients normalization of the QRS complex coincided with loss of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract deflection during incremental atrial pacing. Two patients demonstrated fragmentation of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract deflection before block. In one patient fragmentation of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> deflection coincided with normalization of the QRS complex. The effective refractory periods of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tracts coincided with loss of bypass tract deflections in three of the five patients. In one patient, the effective refractory period of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract at its ventricular insertion preceded that at its atrial insertion, whereas in the remaining patient, the effective refractory period of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract was not attained because of atrial refractoriness. During orthodromic supraventricular tachycardia, <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract deflections disappeared in the anterograde limb in all patients. In one patient, <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract deflection was recorded during atrial fibrillation with pre-excitation. In conclusion: 1) Bypass tract deflections can be recorded with a closely spaced electrode catheter. 2) Right paraseptal bypass tracts are located close to the His bundle. 3) The anterograde effective refractory period of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract usually reflects its atrial insertion, but concealment through <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract can occur with block at the ventricular insertion. 4) Decremental conduction within <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract can occur before block, suggesting concealed and overt Wenckebach block within <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract. 5) Recordings of bypass tract deflections increase the potential of closed chest ablation of right paraseptal and left-sided bypass tracts...|$|R

50|$|A {{bypass duct}} is an annular passage that allows some of a {{turbofan}}'s airflow to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> engine core, or gas generator.

40|$|Verapamil, a {{calcium channel}} {{blocking}} agent, {{has been demonstrated}} to have depressive effects on the atrioventricular (AV) node but not anomalous AV bypass tracts. Of 39 patients with AV reciprocating tachycardia utilizing left-sided bypass tracts for retrograde conduction, intravenous infusion of verapamil (0. 15 mg/kg) terminated the tachycardia in 31 patients. Verapamil interrupted the tachycardia circuit by inducing retrograde conduction block in <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract rather than the AV node in 5 of these 31 patients. Electrophysiologic studies in these five patients revealed that verapamil-induced conduction block in <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract could {{be accounted for by}} two distinctly different mechanisms. In three patients, verapamil induced alternating slow and fast AV nodal conduction resulting in alternating long and short cycle lengths during the tachycardia; consequently, development of the Ashman phenomenon in <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> tract terminated <b>the</b> tachycardia.
