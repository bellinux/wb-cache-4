5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1895, the University of Montana {{has had a}} major impact on the {{development}} of Missoula's economy. In addition to the economic advantage from accommodating the student body, it gave the city an educated workforce not available in most of the state. The university has a close relationship with the city as Missoula's largest employer and with <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> the school brings into the city through visitors of school-sponsored sporting and cultural events.

5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, not {{to mention}} <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Phil England {{writes in}} The Ecologist that the {{strength}} of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Ross Gelbspan’s The Heat is On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E

5|$|On October 23, 1928, RCA {{announced}} it was merging Film Booking Offices and Keith-Albee-Orpheum to form the new motion picture business Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), with Sarnoff as chairman. Kennedy, who retained Pathé, was paid $150,000 for arranging the merger on top of <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in profit he made from selling off his stock. Joseph I. Schnitzer, ranking FBO vice-president, was elevated to {{president of the new}} company's production arm, replacing Kennedy. William LeBaron, the last FBO production chief, retained his position after the merger, but the new studio, dedicated to full sound production, cut ties with most of FBO's roster of silent-screen performers. Movies that Film Booking Offices had either produced or arranged to distribute were released under the FBO banner through the end of 1929. The last official FBO production to reach American theaters was Pals of the Prairie, directed by Louis King and starring Buzz Barton and Frank Rice, released July 1, 1929.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the questions raised by {{the large amount of}} funding he took from the health care industry, Baucus declared a moratorium as of July 1, 2009 on taking more special interest money from health care political action committees. Baucus, however, refused to return as part of his moratorium any of <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> he has received from health care industry interests before July 1, 2009, or to rule out a resumption of taking the same or greater health care industry contributions in the future. His policy on not taking health care industry money reportedly still allowed him to accept money from lobbyists or corporate executives, who, according to The Washington Post, continued to make donations after July 1, 2009. A watchdog group found that in July 2009 Baucus accepted additional money from the health care industry in violation of his own self-defined moratorium terms, reportedly leading Baucus to return those monies.|$|E
25|$|Only 25 of {{the players}} on a Major League Baseball team's 40-man major league reserve list may be active for the major league club, with two {{exception}}s. One minor exception is that when a team is scheduled to play a day-night doubleheader, it is allowed to carry 26 players on the active roster for that day only. The more significant exception is that from September 1 {{to the end of}} the regular season, teams are allowed to expand their game-day rosters to 40 players. The remaining 15 players are generally either on the disabled list or play at some level of the minor leagues (usually at the Triple-A or Double-A level). Players on the 40-man reserve list are eligible for membership in the Major League Baseball Players Association. The minor league players work at the lower end of major league pay scales and are covered by all rules and player agreements {{of the players}} association. Minor league players not on the 40-man reserve list are under contract to their respective parent Major League Baseball clubs but have no union. They generally work for far less pay as they develop their skills and work their way up the ladder toward the major leagues. Many players have signing bonuses and other additional compensation that can run into <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars,</b> although that is generally reserved for early round draft picks.|$|E
