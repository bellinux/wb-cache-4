500|$|Another {{symbolic}} {{sound is}} <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> a mosquito. Although his producer insists that these parasites don't live in Los Angeles (since [...] "mosquitos breed in swamps; {{this is a}} desert"), its distinctive sound is heard clearly as Barton watches a bug circle overhead in his hotel room. Later, he arrives at meetings with mosquito bites on his face. The insect also figures prominently into the revelation of Audrey's death; Barton slaps a mosquito feeding on her corpse and suddenly realizes she's been murdered. The high pitch of the mosquito's hum is echoed in the high strings used for the movie's score. During filming, the Coens were contacted by an animal rights group who expressed concern about how mosquitoes would be treated.|$|E
500|$|Steve Lowe {{called the}} song [...] "penetrating surgery on pseudo-meaningful corporations' lifestyles" [...] with [...] "a repugnance for {{prevailing}} yuppified social values". Among the loosely connected {{imagery of the}} lyrics, Footman identified the song's subject as [...] "the materially comfortable, morally empty embodiment of modern, Western humanity, half-salaryman, half-Stepford Wife, destined for the metaphorical farrowing crate, propped up on Prozac, Viagra and anything else his insurance plan can cover." [...] Sam Steele called the lyrics [...] "a stream of received imagery: scraps of media information, interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence. It is <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> a world buzzing with words, one of the messages seeming to be {{that we live in}} such a synthetic universe we have grown unable to detect reality from artifice." ...|$|E

500|$|Walton's {{works of}} the 1920s, while {{he was living in}} the Sitwells' attic, include the {{overture}} Portsmouth Point, dedicated to Sassoon and inspired by the well-known painting of the same name by Thomas Rowlandson. It was first heard as an entr'acte at a performance in Diaghilev's 1926 ballet season, where The Times complained, [...] "It is a little difficult to make much of new music when it is heard through <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> conversation." [...] Sir Henry Wood programmed the work at the Proms the following year, where it made more of an impression. The composer conducted this performance; he did not enjoy conducting, but he had firm views on how his works should be interpreted, and orchestral players appreciated his [...] "easy nonchalance" [...] and [...] "complete absence of fuss." [...] Walton's other {{works of the}} 1920s included a short orchestral piece, Siesta (1926) and a Sinfonia Concertante for piano and orchestra (1928), which was well received at its premiere at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert, but has not entered the regular repertory.|$|E
500|$|The {{experiment}} {{consisted of}} making audio recordings of a Toyota Prius and combustion engine Honda Accord approaching from two directions at [...] {{to assure that}} the hybrid car operated only with its electric motor. Then test subjects in a laboratory listened to the recordings and indicated when they could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could locate <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> the internal combustion engine car at [...] away, but could not identify the hybrid running in electric mode until it came within , leaving just less than two seconds to react before the vehicle reached their position. In a second trial, the background sounds of two quietly idling combustion engine cars were added to the recordings to simulate the noise of a parking lot. Under this condition, the hybrid needed to be 74 percent closer than the conventional car before the subjects could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could correctly judge the approach of the combustion car when it was about [...] feet away. This result means that under closer to normal environmental noise, a pedestrian {{would not be able to}} correctly determine the hybrid's approach until it was one second away.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps no city...in Illinois, {{outside of}} [...] the great city of Chicago, {{presents}} {{an instance of}} such rapid and substantial growth as the city of Streator. From a single small grocery house... the locality has grown to be a city of 6,000 prosperous and intelligent people. Churches, school-houses, large, substantial business houses and handsome residences, with elegant grounds and surroundings, now beautify the waste of ten years ago, while <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> machinery and thronged streets are unmistakable evidences of business importance and prosperity.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Viviendo", {{the poet}} {{is in the}} city, walking in the {{twilight}} surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> traffic. [...] The poet feels part of a machine that is slowly ticking away time. [...] He reaches {{the realization that the}} individual can die without the machine either slowing or stopping, regardless of whether the individual has completed his part of the work of that machine. [...] As time goes by, the sight of tables on a café terrace remind him that there is after all a human component to this machine. [...] The conclusion that emerges is again resignation to the inevitability of death but there is no sense of consolation, merely an unconvincing stoicism of a man journeying from nothingness to nothingness. [...] It is a very different feel to [...] "A vista de hombre".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the chaos}} of {{production}} and post-production, the team made decisions about character voicing and sound effects. Sound designer Ben Burtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an [...] "organic soundtrack". Blaster sounds were a modified recording of a steel cable, under tension, being struck. The lightsaber sound effect was developed by Burtt as a combination of <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> idling interlock motors in aged movie projectors and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless microphone. Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as {{he was looking for}} a buzzing, sparking sound to add to the projector-motor hum. For Chewbacca's growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers, and walruses to create phrases and sentences. Lucas and Burtt created the robotic voice of R2-D2 by filtering their voices through an electronic synthesizer. Darth Vader's breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a scuba regulator implanted with a microphone.|$|E
60|$|The {{report of}} a musket from the {{southern}} side of the stockade, and <b>the</b> <b>humming</b> <b>of</b> a bullet close beside Susan's head, gave emphasis to the lad's words, causing the sentinel to obey without further parley.|$|R

60|$|Mitchell tottered. He grasped my arm for support. Everything {{was very}} still. Nothing broke the stillness but <b>the</b> <b>humming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bees, {{the murmur of}} the distant wavelets, {{and the sound of}} Mitchell's caddie going on with his apple.|$|R
2500|$|A {{noise gate}} sets a {{threshold}} where {{if it is}} quieter it will not let the signal pass {{and if it is}} louder it opens the gate. [...] A noise gate's function is in a sense the opposite to that of a compressor. [...] Noise gates are useful for microphones which will pick up noise which is not relevant to the program, such as <b>the</b> <b>hum</b> <b>of</b> a miked electric guitar amplifier or the rustling of papers on a minister's lectern. Noise gates are also used to process the microphones placed near the drums of a drum kit in many hard rock and metal bands. [...] Without a noise gate, the microphone for a specific instrument such as the floor tom will also pick up signal from nearby drums or cymbals. [...] With a noise gate, the threshold of sensitivity for each microphone on the drum kit can be set so that only the direct strike and subsequent decay of the drum will be heard, not the nearby sounds.|$|E
