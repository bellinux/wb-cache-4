5|$|The matches {{were played}} {{according}} to the standard rules of a One Day International (ODI). Each side batted for a maximum of 50 overs, and fielding restrictions applied for the bowling side. For the first 15 overs only two fielders were allowed outside <b>the</b> <b>infield,</b> {{and for the rest}} of the innings four fielders (including a bowler and the wicket-keeper) had to be deployed in <b>the</b> <b>infield.</b> No player was allowed to bowl more than 10 overs in an innings.|$|E
5|$|Musberger's call, {{dramatic}} as it was, incorrectly implied that Bernie Williams fielded the double in left. Bernie was playing center {{field at the}} time. Gerald Williams was in left field playing the ball and making the late throw back to <b>the</b> <b>infield.</b>|$|E

50|$|Baseball {{historian}} Bill James {{rated the}} 1914 edition of <b>the</b> $100,000 <b>infield</b> as <b>the</b> greatest <b>infield</b> of all time, and also ranked the 1912 and 1913 editions {{in the top}} five of all time.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>infield</b> {{staging area}} was 2.5 metres high, {{and had to}} {{accommodate}} the elements revealed during the ceremony, such as the chimneys and beam engines from 'Pandemonium', and the cauldron. To ensure that it remained secret, the cauldron was code-named 'Betty', and installed and tested at night.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Adams {{created the}} concept of the shortstop position, {{according}} to Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into <b>the</b> <b>infield,</b> because of the balls' light weight. Adams' shortstop position, at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved toward <b>the</b> <b>infield,</b> since the distance the balls could travel increased. Prior to the invention of the shortstop, large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields; defensive players tended to stand by bases, leaving empty space in between them for batters. The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is {{referred}} to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond <b>the</b> <b>infield</b> is the outfield. In the middle of <b>the</b> <b>infield</b> is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields). The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{attendance of}} the event was 134,476, of which 70,000 were estimated to be in <b>the</b> <b>infield</b> of Churchill Downs. This surpassed the previous Derby record of 130,564; however the record lasted only a year as the 1974 edition attracted 163,628 spectators. Dwight Chapin of Los Angeles Times and author Timothy Capps credited the increased attendance due to Secretariat's loss at the Wood.|$|E
5|$|The time of {{the race}} was disputed. <b>The</b> <b>infield</b> teletimer {{displayed}} a time of 1:55 but it had malfunctioned because of damage caused by people crossing the track to reach <b>the</b> <b>infield.</b> The Pimlico Race Course clocker E.T. McLean Jr. announced a hand time of 1:54, but two Daily Racing Form clockers claimed the time was 1:53, which would have broken the track record of 1:54 set by Cañonero II. Tapes of Secretariat and Cañonero II were played side by side by CBS, and Secretariat got {{to the finish line}} first on tape, though this was not a reliable method of timing a horse race at the time. The Maryland Jockey Club, which managed the Pimlico racetrack and is responsible for maintaining Preakness records, discarded both the electronic and Daily Racing Form times and recognized the clocker's 1:54 as the official time; however, the Daily Racing Form, {{for the first time in}} history, printed its own clocking of 1:53 underneath the official time in the chart of the race.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999 Marlboro 500 CART race, Canadian driver Greg Moore {{died in a}} crash {{along the}} backstretch of the track. It was {{determined}} that after sliding along <b>the</b> <b>infield</b> grass, Moore's car hit the edge of oncoming pavement, which caused the car to flip into a concrete retaining wall. The incident prompted the track owners, ISC, to pave the backstretch of both Auto Club Speedway and its sister track Michigan International Speedway {{in an attempt to}} prevent a similar accident. Shortly after the crash, CART mandated the use of a head-and-neck restraint system on all ovals. The rule eventually became mandatory on all tracks.|$|E

5|$|Green Lantern {{is located}} in the Boardwalk section of the park. Green Lantern is the third roller coaster to occupy this plot of land, {{following}} the Sarajevo Bobsled (which ran at Great Adventure from 1984 to 1988 before moving to Six Flags Great America and Great Escape) and the Great American Scream Machine (an Arrow Dynamics looping coaster which had occupied this area from 1989 to 2010). Like the Great American Scream Machine, <b>the</b> <b>infield</b> of Green Lantern is covered with gravel. The coaster also reuses the Scream Machine's queue area building.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{his first}} full season in the majors, Youkilis became a regular first baseman (with 127 games at first). Until that time, he was {{primarily}} a third baseman, though he did play nine games at first base with the Red Sox in 2005, and 56 games at first base in his minor league career. Also in 2006 {{he played in the}} outfield {{for the first time in}} his professional career, 18 games in left field. Despite his inexperience in the outfield, Youkilis did not commit an error while in the outfield; he did, however, commit eight errors while playing <b>the</b> <b>infield.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kelley {{moved back}} to <b>the</b> <b>infield,</b> {{becoming}} the regular first baseman in 1901. After the 1901 season, Kelley denied reports that he would jump from the Superbas to the Detroit Tigers of the American League (AL), the former Western League which had decided {{to compete with the}} NL by creating franchises in east coast cities that housed NL franchises. However, the opportunity to return to Baltimore proved irresistible to Kelley, and after the AL's successful 1901 season, he jumped from the Superbas to the Baltimore Orioles AL. Kelley's father-in-law, John Mahon, was president and principal share holder of the AL's Orioles.|$|E

50|$|World Cup Play is the game's single-player mode. The player takes {{control of}} Team USA, as they compete against eight rival teams in a dodgeball tournament with {{irregular}} rules. To win each match, the player must defeat <b>the</b> three <b>infield</b> members of <b>the</b> rival team. However, if <b>the</b> three <b>infield</b> members of <b>the</b> player's team are defeated, the player {{will lose the}} match.|$|R
5|$|MFP Baseball, which {{purchased}} the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating. <b>The</b> <b>infield</b> was re-sodded and leveled, protective railing was installed {{along the edge}} of the field, and the backstop netting was replaced. The entire concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage and a family fun zone were constructed by the concourse entrance.|$|E
5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in <b>the</b> <b>infield</b> for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into <b>the</b> <b>infield,</b> allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of}} the batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E
5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through <b>the</b> <b>infield,</b> it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E

5|$|Dreyfuss {{announced}} that unlike established wooden ballparks {{such as the}} Polo Grounds, he would build a three-tiered stadium out of steel and concrete to increase longevity—the {{first of its kind}} in the nation. Charles Wellford Leavitt, Jr. was contracted to design the stadium's grandstand. A civil engineer, Leavitt had founded an engineering and landscape architecture firm in 1897. He had gained experience in steel and concrete constructs while designing the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks. Based on Dreyfuss' architectural requirements, Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field—the only ballpark he would design. Pirates' manager Fred Clarke also had input into the stadium's design, giving groundskeepers advice on the field, in addition to designing and patenting a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over <b>the</b> <b>infield</b> in case of rain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, poor {{transport}} forced self-sufficiency on small settlements. Lacking the urban centres created under the Romans {{in the rest}} of Britain, the economy of Scotland in the early Middle Ages was overwhelmingly agricultural. With a lack of significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain, farming was done on single homesteads or amongst a small cluster of three or four homes. Each of these probably contained a nuclear family, with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance. A system was adopted that distinguished between <b>the</b> <b>infield,</b> around the settlement, where crops were grown every year, and the outfield, further away, where crops were grown and then left fallow in different years. This would be the predominant system until the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Over $200,000 {{was spent}} on renovations {{in the fall and}} winter before the 1995 season. The home clubhouse and weight room were remodeled, aisles behind the dugouts were resurfaced to reduce {{slippery}} areas, and the entire playing field was re-sodded. This was the first replacement and upgrading of the field since the original sod was laid in 1978. First, all of the old grass was stripped from the field. Then, the grounds crew installed a new drainage system. Four trenches were dug and laid with 2,500feet (760m) of drainage pipe to carry water away from the field and beyond the center field wall. A layer of gravel was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10to15cm) layer of sand was placed above the gravel. After raising the level of <b>the</b> <b>infield</b> dirt and brick warning track to the same height of the new field, 100,000square feet (9,300m²) of Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass was installed on the field and edged into a baseball diamond configuration.|$|E

5000|$|Before Neale Stadium, {{football}} was played at MacLean Field, the large athletic field between the Mem Gym and the Shattuck Arboretum, behind (west of) the Administration Building. It {{was named for}} James Alexander MacLean, the university president from 1900 to 1913. <b>The</b> baseball <b>infield</b> was originally in the southwest corner, with the football field set north-south, in the outfield. When Neale Stadium opened, <b>the</b> baseball <b>infield</b> {{was moved to the}} northeast corner of MacLean, {{on the site of the}} current College of Education building. The primary spectator area was on the slope along the east sideline (later the third base line). (1921 photo - Idaho 6-0 over 9th Army Corps on 03-Dec) - (campus photo - circa 1940) <b>The</b> former <b>infield</b> area became <b>the</b> site of the utilitarian Field House (1948-75).|$|R
