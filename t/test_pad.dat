5000|$|The {{signaling}} on high-speed serial buses like PCI Express, Fibre Channel 10-Gbit/s Ethernet, InfiniBand or Intel®’s QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) is {{very sensitive}} to capacitive coupling effects. As a result, placing a <b>test</b> <b>pad</b> {{on one of these}} buses to provide access to the test probes that external instruments such as oscilloscopes and in-circuit test systems rely on will disrupt the integrity of signals on the underlying bus. As a result, today’s best practices for designing circuit boards call for the elimination of test pads, which restricts the use of test probes. The alternative is embedded instruments which are able to test from the inside out.|$|E
50|$|Bead probe {{can be used}} in {{circuits}} {{where the}} pin-pitch is too fine to allow standard test pads. This is becoming more common as pin pitches continue to reduce, particularly in embedded devices. Typically bead probe widths are the width of the PCB traces with a length of about three times this. This allows a high degree of flexibility in their positioning, and can in some cases be applied retrospectively to existing layouts.Because of their small size, bead probes do not affect the signal quality of the signals transferring within the PCB trace. This is especially useful in high speed input/output (HSIO) interconnects, where a standard <b>test</b> <b>pad</b> would interfere with the signal.|$|E
50|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred on}} March 19, 1981 {{that led to}} the deaths of three people. During a countdown test for STS-1, a pure nitrogen atmosphere was introduced in the aft engine compartment of Columbia to reduce the danger of an explosion from the many other potentially dangerous gases on board the orbiter. At the conclusion of the <b>test,</b> <b>pad</b> workers were given clearance to return to work on the orbiter, even though the nitrogen had not yet been purged due to a recent procedure change. Three technicians, John Bjornstand, Forrest Cole, and Nick Mullon, entered the compartment without air packs, unaware of the danger since nitrogen gas is odorless and colorless, and lost consciousnesses due to lack of oxygen. Several minutes later, another worker saw them and tried to help, but passed out himself. The fourth did not alert anyone, but was himself seen by two other people. Of those two, one alerted a security guard and another went to help the unconscious group. The security guard entered the compartment with an air pack and removed the five men from the compartment.|$|E

5000|$|While {{a ground}} laser could track and engage a moving target, an {{airborne}} laser had the added difficulties of vibrations, beam propagation, and pointing a laser from an aerial platform. Development of the Airborne Laser Laboratory (ALL) became {{the centerpiece of}} AFWL’s laser program in the 1970s. The ALL term was coined in 1972, and the ALL program began with Cycle I testing in 1973 and ended with the completion of Cycle III in September 1983. The ALL was a modified NKC-135, and the 4900th Flight Test Group was formed for aircraft operations. Laboratory testing occurred in the 400 area of Kirtland AFB and initial ground tests in hangar 1001, while the hangar at the Advanced Radiation Test Facility (ARTF) at {{the southeast corner of}} the runway was being constructed. ARTF was used for later ground tests that aimed the APT from the ARTF <b>test</b> <b>pad</b> to a target in the atmosphere in order to calibrate aircraft instruments in preparation for flight tests. Along with the five NKC-135, the 4900th FTG operated a fleet of five F-4Ds, one RF-4C, three NC-135As, five C-130s, and several A-37s, F-100s, and helicopters.|$|E
50|$|In February 2010, SpaceX's {{first flight}} stack was set {{vertical}} at Space Launch Complex 40, Cape Canaveral, and on March 9, SpaceX performed a static fire test, {{where the first}} stage was to be fired without taking off. The test aborted at T-2 seconds due to a failure in the system designed to pump high-pressure helium from the launch pad into the first stage turbopumps, which would get them spinning in preparation for launch. Subsequent review showed that the failure occurred when a valve did not receive a command to open. As the problem was with the pad and not with the rocket itself, it didn't occur at the McGregor test site, which {{did not have the}} same valve setup. Some fire and smoke were seen {{at the base of the}} rocket, leading to speculation of an engine fire. However, the fire and smoke were the result of normal burnoff from the liquid oxygen and fuel mix present in the system prior to launch, and no damage was sustained by the vehicle or the <b>test</b> <b>pad.</b> All vehicle systems leading up to the abort performed as expected, and no additional issues were noted that needed addressing. A subsequent test on March 13 was successful in firing the nine first-stage engines for 3.5 seconds.|$|E
40|$|Envirocare of Utah, Inc. (Envirocare) has {{developed}} and constructed a <b>test</b> <b>pad</b> to evaluate potential infiltration through the designed cover system over the low-level {{radioactive waste disposal}} embankments incorporated at the facility. The general design of the <b>test</b> <b>pad</b> follows the recommendations {{set forth in the}} Alternative Cover Assessment Program (ACAP) that is currently funded by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assess potential alternatives to conventional landfill cover designs. The bulk of the <b>test</b> <b>pad</b> is below grade with dimensions approximately 16 feet wide by 28 feet long. The base of the <b>test</b> <b>pad</b> is a lysimeter built to the same dimensions as compliance lysimeters within the disposal embankments at Envirocare. The lysimeter collects all liquids to a single low point and directs the liquids through monitoring instruments within a manhole outside the <b>test</b> <b>pad.</b> The lysimeter is constructed to simulate the ''top of waste'' condition in Envirocare's embankments; consequently, the top of the lysimeter is sloped at an angle of approximately 2. 8 percent, the design top slope of the embankment. A replica of the embankment cover is constructed directly above the lysimeter. This cover is constructed exactly the same as final cover is constructed upon the waste disposal embankments, utilizing the same QA/QC measures. Permanent monitoring equipment has been placed during construction at specific intervals throughout the <b>test</b> <b>pad.</b> Monitoring equipment consists of water content reflectometers (WCRs), matric water potential sensors (heat dissipation units; HDUs), and temperature probes. The monitoring equipment provides cross-sectional data of the moisture content and temperatures throughout the constructed cover. Additionally, surface water runoff is collected through a drainage trough and measured in order to perform a water balance over the entire <b>test</b> <b>pad.</b> To aid in the assessment, data collected from the site meteorological stat ion will be used, including: wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, solar radiation, pan evaporation, and precipitation. The data collected through this <b>test</b> <b>pad</b> will be used to assess the applicability of the performance modeling that was accomplished as part of the original design of the embankments. Analysis of the data generated through this <b>test</b> <b>pad</b> will be the subject of future technical papers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Most {{older adults}} with urinary {{incontinence}} use absorbent pads. Because of exposure to moisture and chemical irritating substances in urine, the perineal skin region is always at risk for development of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the efficacy of an improved absorbent pad against IAD. Methods A cluster randomized controlled design was used to compare the efficacy of two absorbent pads. Female inpatients aged ≥ 65 [*]years who had IAD and used an absorbent pad or diaper all day were enrolled. Healing rate of IAD and variables of skin barrier function such as skin pH and skin moisture were compared between the usual absorbent pad group (n[*]=[*] 30) and the <b>test</b> absorbent <b>pad</b> group (n[*]=[*] 30). Results Thirteen patients (43. 3 %) from the <b>test</b> absorbent <b>pad</b> group and 4 patients (13. 3 %) from the usual absorbent pad group recovered completely from IAD. Moreover, the <b>test</b> absorbent <b>pad</b> group healed significantly faster than the usual absorbent pad group (p[*]=[*] 0. 009). On the other hand, there were no significant differences between the two groups in skin barrier function. Conclusion The <b>test</b> absorbent <b>pad</b> for {{older adults with}} urinary incontinence might be more efficacious against IAD than usual absorbent pad.

40|$|Based on {{elemental}} and ABA analysis, {{a significant}} portion of a waste rock with low levels of sulphide-S and neutralization potential (NP) was predicted to potentially generate acid rock drainage (ARD). Mineralogical work included optical and scanning electron microscopy, electron-probe microanalysis, and quantitative X-ray powder diffraction. Post-blast grab samples were sieved into various size fractions and each fraction was analyzed to determine the relative contribution of acid potential (AP) and NP. Kinetic testing included field <b>test</b> <b>pads,</b> laboratory cells comparing drip-leach and flood leach, and re-circulating columns. Interpreting the results of the kinetic tests was aided with pre and post-test shake flask data. Results of the study indicated that much of the sulphides are encapsulated within quartz, insoluble sulphate was a minor but potentially significant constituent of the measured AP, and sulphides preferentially report to the fine fraction of the post-blast material. Molar ratios of calcium and magnesium to sulphate for leachate from the field <b>test</b> <b>pads</b> were used in combination with laboratory sulphate production rates to assess the ARD potential. Selenium, the primary element of concern, returned concentrations from the field tests an order of magnitude greater than returned from the laboratory re-circulating columns and waste dump seeps of the same material...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) {{is associated}} with comorbid atherosclerosis of the coronary and carotid arteries and is a significant risk factor for stroke. However, cognitive function in PAD patients before clinically evident stroke remains poorly characterized. Here we hypothesized that, on neuropsychological <b>testing,</b> <b>PAD</b> patients would perform more poorly than healthy control subjects, and persons with mild cardiovascular disease (essential hypertension), but better than stroke patients, thus reflecting a continuum of cognitive impairment associated with increased severity of vascular disease. Method: The cognitive performance of 38 PAD patients (mean ankle-brachial index 0. 67, Fontaine Class II) was contrasted with that of 23 healthy normotensive controls, 20 essential hypertensives, and 26 anterior ischemic stroke patients on twelve neuropsychological <b>tests.</b> Results: <b>PAD</b> patients performed significantly more poorly than hypertensives and normotensives, but better than stroke patients, on seven tests of nonverbal memory, concentration, executive function, perceptuo-motor speed, and manual dexterity. Hyperten-sives displayed poorer performance than normotensives on tests of nonverbal memory and manual dexterity. These findings were independent of age, education, and depression scores. Higher diastolic blood pressure and plasma glucose levels predicted poorer performance of select cognitive <b>tests</b> by <b>PAD</b> patients. Eight to 67 % of PAD patients displayed impaired performance (5 th percentile of normotensive controls) on the seven aforementioned cognitive <b>tests.</b> Conclusions: <b>PAD</b> patients exhibit diminished performance {{across a variety of}} domains of cognitive function. Findings also suggest a continuum of cognitive impairment associated with increasingly severe manifestations of cardiovascular disease, thus emphasizing the need for enhanced preventative measures to avert functional declines.

The Bentonite Mat Demonstration Project (BMDP) is a field demonstration study to determine the construction/installation requirements, permeability, and subsidence performance characteristics of a composite barrier. The composite barrier will consist of on-site sandy-clay blanketed by a bentonite mat and a flexible High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) liner (also called flexible membrane liner).

Based upon engineering experience and technical references, a set of nominal soil parameters have been selected. Currently, detailed soil test data and cavity configuration data are not available to validate the mathematical model. Since the configuration of the cavities created in the testing process is irregular and unpredictable, two extreme configurations are considered in this mathematical model, viz., the circular cavity and the infinitely long trench in the sand underneath the cap.

40|$|The methods {{utilized}} {{to determine the}} hydraulic conductivity of compacted clay liners (CCLs) are of importance for safe guarding the environment from landfill leachate. Therefore, the methods utilized {{in the analysis of}} the Two Stage Borehole (TSB) test, as described in the ASTM D 6391 - 11 (Method A, B, and C) standard, were evaluated. Data from hydraulic conductivity tests, as performed on three test pads, were {{utilized to}} review the ASTM D 6391 - 11 equations. Additionally, two test pads were instrumented with volumetric water content and soil water matric potential sensors to facilitate the determination of field-obtained soil water characteristic curves (SWCCs) and hydraulic conductivity functions (k-functions) for unsaturated soils. For the determination of the SWCCs and k-functions, each <b>test</b> <b>pad</b> was subjected to an infiltration cycle, using either a sealed double ring infiltrometer or a two-stage borehole infiltrometer, followed by a drying cycle. To compare the results that were obtained from the field-obtained SWCCs and k-functions, laboratory tests were performed on Shelby tube samples acquired from the corresponding <b>test</b> <b>pad.</b> The obtained data were fitted using the van Genuchten model and the RETC (RETention Curve) program. The results that were obtained from TSB testing led to the conclusion that Method B and C, as written in the ASTMs D 6391 - 11 standard contained errors that impacted the results that were obtained from hydraulic conductivity testing. Specifically, utilizing Method C provided results that were four times greater than the hydraulic conductivity and utilizing Method B provided results that were as much as two orders of magnitude greater than the hydraulic conductivity. Several recommendations are proposed herein to ensure accurate hydraulic conductivity analysis is performed in the future.
