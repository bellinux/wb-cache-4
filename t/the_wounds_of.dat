5|$|In Catholicism, {{there has}} been a long {{tradition}} of veneration of the heart, stemming from worship of <b>the</b> <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ which gained prominence from the mid sixteenth century. This tradition influenced the development of the medieval Christian devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the parallel worship of Immaculate Heart of Mary, made popular by John Eudes.|$|E
5|$|Three Taliban {{fighters were}} in the courtyard, which had a chicken coop within it. The Taliban fired on Petry and Robinson; Petry was wounded by one round that went through both his legs, and Robinson was wounded, being hit on the armor plate {{protecting}} his side. Petry led Robinson to {{the cover of the}} chicken coop, and reported the contact and their wounded condition. Petry threw a thermobaric grenade from cover. At the chicken coop, the two men were joined by Sergeant Daniel Higgins, who assessed <b>the</b> <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> the two soldiers.|$|E
5|$|A few British leaders, {{particularly}} Lord Mountbatten, {{the last}} British viceroy of India, were also uncomfortable with breaking links between independent India and the princely states. The development of trade, commerce and communications during the 19th and 20th centuries had bound the princely {{states to the}} British India through a complex network of interests. Agreements relating to railways, customs, irrigation, use of ports, and other similar agreements would get terminated, posing {{a serious threat to}} the economic life of the subcontinent. Mountbatten was also persuaded by the argument of Indian officials such as V. P. Menon that the integration of the princely states into independent India would, to some extent, assuage <b>the</b> <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> partition. The result was that Mountbatten personally favoured and worked towards the accession of princely states to India following the transfer of power, as proposed by the Congress.|$|E

Aquinas writes [...] "Therefore in so far as the reason is deprived of its order to the true, there is <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> ignorance; in so far as the will is deprived of its order of good, there is <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> malice; in so far as the irascible is deprived of its order to the arduous, there is <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> weakness; and in so far as the concupiscible is deprived of its order to the delectable, moderated by reason, there is <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> <b>of</b> concupiscence." ...|$|R

5|$|Daedaleopsis confragosa is a lignicolous fungus that {{produces}} a decay of sapwood. It causes white rot, a type of wood decay in which lignin is degraded and cellulose remains as a light-colored residue. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups, sometimes in tiers, in <b>the</b> <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> living trees. Its preferred host is willow, {{but it has also}} been found on birch and other hardwoods. Fruiting usually occurs from June to December, but the hard shelves can persist year-round. In North America, the species is most common in eastern locales, but rare in western regions. It is common in Europe, {{and is one of the}} 100 most common fungi in the United Kingdom. Its European range extends east to the Urals. In Asia it is widely distributed, having been recorded from China, western Maharashtra (India), Iran, and Japan.|$|E

25|$|The 1954 to 1959 {{phase of}} the Vietnam War was {{the era of the}} two nations. Coming after the First Indochina War, this period {{resulted}} in the military defeat of the French, a 1954 Geneva meeting that partitioned Vietnam into North and South, and the French withdrawal from Vietnam, leaving the Republic of Vietnam regime fighting a communist insurgency with USA aid. During this period, North Vietnam recovered from <b>the</b> <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> war, rebuilt nationally, and accrued to prepare for the anticipated war. In South Vietnam, Ngô Đình Diệm consolidated power and encouraged anti-communism. This period was marked by U.S. support to South Vietnam before Gulf of Tonkin, as well as communist infrastructure-building.|$|E
25|$|In {{honor of}} Asclepius, a {{particular}} type of non-venomous snake was often used in healing rituals, and these snakes– the Aesculapian snakes– crawled around freely on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. These snakes were introduced at the founding of each new temple of Asclepius throughout the classical world. From about 300 BCE onwards, the cult of Asclepius grew very popular and pilgrims flocked to his healing temples (Asclepieia) to be cured of their ills. Ritual purification would be followed by offerings or sacrifices to the god (according to means), and the supplicant would then spend the night in the holiest part of the sanctuary– the abaton (or adyton). Any dreams or visions would be reported to a priest who would prescribe the appropriate therapy by a process of interpretation. Some healing temples also used sacred dogs to lick <b>the</b> <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> sick petitioners.|$|E

25|$|A {{good example}} of a case where {{forensic}} entomology was successful in determining a postmortem interval is one involving a young prostitute and a thirty-year-old member of the Army. A family member had informed the police of her disappearance four days before her body was found. She had last {{been seen in the}} presence of this military man on May 31. A large number of adult flies and maggots were noticed and gathered inside and near <b>the</b> <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> the young girl. A number of these maggots were kept and grown to be adult flies (reared), and others were taken in their present state. Pictures were taken and enlarged showing the flies around the body when it was found. Using this evidence along with correlating weather conditions known to be present around that time, an entomologist was able to give a postmortem interval. The evidence showed that the flies had arrived on May 31, which indicated a time period of four days since she had died. This information showed the army man to be the last person to be with the girl. When presented with the evidence authorities were able to get a confession out of the man. The use of forensic entomology was definitely a key factor in this case.|$|E
25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into <b>the</b> <b>wounds</b> <b>of</b> an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown {{down the stairs}} head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|E
