60|$|He laughed sardonically, hastily <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> as hastily {{threw it}} from him.|$|E
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> kissed it. He {{was like}} himself again, and I felt still more encouraged.|$|E
60|$|She <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{pressed it}} to her cold lips. The tears gushed into my eyes, as I tried to speak to her.|$|E
50|$|They sang three soundtracks and {{featured}} in another soundtrack for Miss Korea, which are New World, Street Of Angels, <b>Take</b> <b>My</b> <b>Hands</b> <b>and</b> Heartbreaker respectively.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou wast not bold!--thou wast not true!" [...] {{answered}} the child. [...] "Thou wouldst not promise to <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> mother's <b>hand,</b> to-morrow noon-tide!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, child, it's one of {{the keepers}} asleep, or some {{stroller}} who has no business here. <b>Take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> we'll see who it is." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{he found}} that Van Koop had gone away without saying good-bye, Lord Ragnall made no remark. Only he <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> shook it.|$|E
60|$|Then before I could answer, Kari <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{touched it}} with his lips. Another moment and I had lost sight {{of him in the}} shadows.|$|E
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> pressed it. Characteristically, he did {{not answer}} this, and I remembered he was always careful not to say {{anything}} which might smack of insincerity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I couldn't stop {{if it were}} {{to prolong}} my life a score of years,' rejoined Nicholas. 'Here, <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> with it <b>my</b> hearty thanks.--Oh! that I should have been fooling here!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Winnie," [...] he said, [...] "there {{has been}} dire devastation here. Perhaps inside things may look better. Come, <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> don't be afraid. The floor is level and your eyes will soon get {{accustomed}} to the dim light." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is reality, Miss Hannay. <b>Take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{you will}} see that it is solid. The voices you heard were similar to those I heard at Deennugghur; they were {{messages}} I sent you by means of Rujub and his daughter." ...|$|R
60|$|He had {{hitherto}} concealed his feelings, but I {{saw them}} now {{begin to get}} the better of him. His eyes softened, and he <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> squeezed it hard.|$|E
60|$|She <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{led me to}} the sofa. We sat down, side by side. Her {{face was}} {{composed}} to a sad tranquillity. She was quiet; she was herself again.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} being stopped by Grierson as I {{was going out}} of the side entrance. He <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> squeezed it, and there was on his face an odd, surprised look.|$|E
6000|$|... "Up to {{a certain}} point. Beyond that, I warn you, I should have no pity. If you were a wise man, I think even now that you would thank me for <b>my</b> luncheon <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> bid me farewell." ...|$|R
60|$|I withdrew <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> sharply. I <b>took</b> up <b>my</b> hat {{from the}} chair on which I had cast it. She might have spared me that, I thought. She need not have professed joy. At least she might have <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> parted in kindness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! how I wish I {{could take}} you and {{her home to}} Uncle Joe, and give you both good bread <b>and</b> milk! <b>Take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> shut your eyes, and we will wish and wish very hard, and, perhaps, you will come there with me. Paris is not very far off." ...|$|R
60|$|Then he <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> kissed it and {{we entered}} the reeds, I, who was a hunter, feeling more happy than I had done since we {{set foot in the}} East.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let them bury {{me after}} the fashion of my people, Macumazahn, and set my eyes towards Zululand;' and he <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> shook it, {{and then turned to}} face the {{advancing}} foe.|$|E
60|$|He looked puzzled, as well he might. Then he smiled, <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> led me {{away from}} the door--to the knob of which I was still holding with all my might--to the sofa.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Troy is not {{satisfied}} yet," [...] she said bitterly. [...] "My love, <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{look me in}} the face as your equal; I know no difference of rank at such a time as this. Before God, who hears you, are you innocent of the theft of the bank-note?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she rejoined with tender mockery; [...] "you either took a {{great deal}} for granted or there was one {{important}} thing you were willing to leave in doubt. Now <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> hold them fast. You know I have suffered something--fears and anxieties because of you--I want to feel safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come," [...] I say to him, encouragingly, [...] "pull {{yourself}} together, {{and be a}} man. Don't {{think about}} it. Put it behind you, and determine that you won't be conquered. Come, we shall be round the corner in another minute, where you won't {{be able to see}} it. <b>Take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> let's run!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Henceforth {{we have no}} lord but you, O Shabaka," [...] they said, and {{one after}} another <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> pressed it to their foreheads, vowing {{to be true to}} me in all things while we lived.|$|E
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> we {{ran down}} the slope and went {{skimming}} over the ice. It was glorious. The house came in sight as we reached the other side. It was big and dark and silent.|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose he}} had {{exhausted}} his ill-temper on {{my aunt and}} Oscar. He said those words--more than kindly--almost tenderly. His fierce eyes seemed to soften behind his spectacles; he <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> patted it to encourage me.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{comes back}} the {{youngest}} <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> the oldest holds by my jacket, and we goes up into High Street, and {{across to the}} other cliff. We goes along till we comes to a pretty little cottage looking over the sea. There was a garden in front, new planted with flowers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then farewell! And to thee farewell, also, Eric Brighteyes! Now <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> hold {{it while}} I die. Behold! I give thee a new name, {{and by that}} name thou shalt be called in story. I name thee Eric the Unlucky. Of all tales that are told, thine shall be the greatest. A mighty stroke that was of thine--a mighty stroke! Farewell!" ...|$|R
60|$|Again he <b>took</b> both <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> {{put them}} to his lips, while my blood ran cold within me.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me a little curiously. From the first her own {{demeanor}} had been singularly unmoved. During the last few seconds, however, she had grown paler. She suddenly <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> gave it a little squeeze.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go now," [...] she {{presently}} {{added in}} a petulant tone; [...] "I am tired, and wish to rest"; and Yoletta, who had been standing silently by me all the time, <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> led me from the room.|$|E
6000|$|When he went I {{followed}} him {{to the top of the}} stairs. I was speechless with gratitude and also with fears for him. But he <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> said, with that same quaint, somewhat inane laugh which was so characteristic of him: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't he {{tell you}} that I offered to leave Dimchurch for ever? I meant it. I saw the misery in the poor fellow's face, when Grosse and I were leading Lucilla out of the room. With my whole heart, I meant it. If he had <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> had said Good-bye, I should have gone. He wouldn't <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b> He insisted on {{thinking}} it over by himself. He came back, resolved to make the sacrifice, on his side----" ...|$|R
