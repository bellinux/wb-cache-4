Short appealed to Masterson, who contacted Earp. On May 31, 1883, Earp and Josephine went with Bat Masterson, Johnny Millsap, Shotgun John Collins, Texas Jack Vermillion, and Johnny Green to Dodge City to help Short.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the evolution of the tetrapod limb from fins in lobe-finned fishes is related to expression of the HOXD13 gene or the loss of the proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2, which are involved in fish fin development. Robot simulations suggest that the necessary nervous circuitry for walking evolved from the nerves governing swimming, utilizing the sideways oscillation of the body with the limbs primarily functioning as anchoring points and providing limited thrust. This type of movement, as well as changes to the pectoral girdle are similar to those seen in the fossil record can be induced in bichirs by raising <b>then</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> water.|$|E

Hopestar {{returned}} to the United Kingdom via Port Said, Suez, Aden, Mauritius, Durban and Freetown. She arrived at Southend-on-Sea on 20 April 1942. She sailed a week later on a voyage that would take her to New York, Key West, Trinidad, Cape Town, Durban and Bombay, India, where she arrived on 28 October 1942.|$|E

25|$|In close/narrow-angle, the iridocorneal {{angle is}} {{completely}} closed because of forward {{displacement of the}} final roll and root of the iris against the cornea, resulting in {{the inability of the}} aqueous fluid to flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the trabecular network.

The {{main part of}} his cricketing career commenced the next year, {{when he began to}} play for Worcestershire. His County Championship debut, versus Kent in early May 1927, brought him a first-innings haul of 4-139, though Worcestershire lost the game by an innings. A fortnight later he recorded a career-best return of 6-59 against Northamptonshire, hitting 31 from number eleven for good measure, though again his county were defeated.|$|E
25|$|Bob Jones, Jr. was a {{connoisseur}} of European art and began collecting after World War II on about $30,000 a year {{authorized by the}} University Board of Directors. Jones first concentrated on the Italian Baroque, a style <b>then</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor and relatively inexpensive {{in the years immediately}} following the war. Fifty years after the opening of the gallery, the BJU collection included more than 400 European paintings from the 14th to through the 19th centuries (mostly pre-19th century), period furniture, and a notable collection of Russian icons. The museum also includes a variety of Holy Land antiquities collected in the early 20th century by missionaries Frank and Barbara Bowen.|$|E
25|$|The 2003 Cricket World Cup {{came and}} Waugh's desire {{to return for}} a fifth World Cup was denied. A chance for a last minute reprieve came when all rounder Shane Watson was injured before the tournament. Waugh had been using his {{newspaper}} column to promote his bowling abilities and had been increasingly using himself as a bowler {{in an attempt to}} strengthen his case for a recall. However, his successor Ricky Ponting publicly called for the inclusion of <b>then</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> form Andrew Symonds. Ponting got his wish, and although the selection was regarded as being highly controversial at the time, Symonds established himself at international level with a series of match winnings innings.|$|E

In 1938 Paynter had another outstanding series against Australia, averaging 101.75 and hitting 216 not out at Nottingham, {{at the time a}} record for Ashes Tests in England. He also filled in very competently as wicket-keeper for Les Ames when the latter was injured at Lord's. Paynter was again very successful the following winter against South Africa, scoring three centuries and two fifties in eight innings, including 243 at Durban, to average 81.62.|$|E
25|$|Pulis was <b>then</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{work for}} two years, before the {{resignation}} of Stoke City's manager Steve Cotterill early into the 2002–03 season led to Pulis being given the job that November. Pulis immediately {{found himself in a}} relegation battle and it looked likely that the club would be relegated back to the Second Division only a year after being promoted. Pulis, however, completed the signings of striker Ade Akinbiyi and goalkeeper Mark Crossley, on loan from Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough respectively, who helped turn around the club's bad run. Stoke avoided relegation {{on the final day of}} the 2002–03 season with a 1–0 win over Reading at the Britannia Stadium, with Akinbiyi scoring the only goal of the match. Pulis rates Stoke's survival in 2002–03 as one of his best achievements in management.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hundred million}} years ago, plants (probably {{resembling}} algae) and fungi started growing {{at the edges of}} the water, and <b>then</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. The oldest fossils of land fungi and plants date to 480–460Ma, though molecular evidence suggests the fungi may have colonized the land as early as 1000Ma and the plants 700Ma. Initially remaining close to the water's edge, mutations and variations resulted in further colonization of this new environment. The timing of the first animals to leave the oceans is not precisely known: the oldest clear evidence is of arthropods on land around 450Ma, perhaps thriving and becoming better adapted due to the vast food source provided by the terrestrial plants. There is also unconfirmed evidence that arthropods may have appeared on land as early as 530 Ma.|$|E

25|$|It was rumoured that Robertson was {{angling for}} Haig’s job in July, {{although}} there is no clear evidence that this was so. This was the month with the highest British casualties of the entire war, {{at a time when the}} German Verdun Offensive was already being scaled back. Haig was reluctant to send Robertson full weekly reports and Robertson complained that Haig’s daily telegrams to him contained little more information than the daily press releases. “Not exactly the letter of a CIGS! … He ought to take responsibility also!” was Haig’s comment on one such letter (29 July). F.E. Smith (1 August) circulated a paper by his friend Winston Churchill (<b>then</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> office), criticising the high losses and negligible gains of the Somme. Churchill argued that this would leave Germany freer to win victories elsewhere. Robertson issued a strong rebuttal the same day, arguing that Britain’s losses were small compared to what France had suffered in previous years, that Germany had had to quadruple the number of her divisions on the Somme sector and that this had taken pressure off Verdun and contributed to the success of Russian and Italian offensives. After the Churchill memorandum, both Robertson and Esher wrote to Haig reminding him of how Robertson was covering Haig’s back in London, Robertson reminding Haig of the need to give him “the necessary data with which to reply to the swines” (7 and 8 August).|$|E
