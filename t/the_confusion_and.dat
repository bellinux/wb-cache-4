5|$|The Swedish {{fled the}} island {{as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> fear amongst the conscripts; Jens Kofoed {{installed}} an intermediate rule and sent a message to King Frederick III of Denmark that Bornholm had liberated itself, and wished to return to Danish rule. This was confirmed in the 1660 peace settlement between Denmark and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised. A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed {{as they crossed}} the gangway, {{but the rest of}} the party made it onto Chesapeake. Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{group who}} {{had watched the}} {{departure}} of the trains {{from the top of the}} chimney near the Liverpool tunnel, meanwhile, had been forgotten in <b>the</b> <b>confusion,</b> <b>and</b> were unable to get down from their vantage point. Eventually at around 8.00pm John Harrison, a teacher of gymnastics and swordsmanship, lowered himself down the rope hand-over-hand, and coaxed the others to follow him down in the same manner. The angry group then set out in search of the worker who had been supposed to bring them down.|$|E

5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie {{got back into the}} motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Army of Africa {{crossed the}} Gibraltar Strait, using Junkers Ju 52 {{transport}} planes provided by Nazi Germany, without any loyalist Air Force interference owing to <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> lack of {{decision of the}} Spanish Republican side. The massive airlift of troops from Spanish Morocco was the world's first long-range combat airlift and it allowed Franco's troops to join General Queipo de Llano's forces in Seville. Their quick movement allowed them to meet General Mola's Northern Army and secure most of northern and northwestern Spain, as well as central and western Andalusia. The Republican Government ended up with controlling {{almost all of the}} Eastern Spanish coast and central area around Madrid, as well as Asturias, Cantabria and part of the Basque Country in the north. Mola was keen {{to create a sense of}} fear within Nationalist-controlled areas. There was a massive purge of freemasons, and a wide part of the left, including some moderate socialists.|$|E
5|$|Observing the French fleet's {{departure}} from the harbour at dusk, Pellew immediately dispatched Phoebe to Colpoys and Amazon to the main fleet at Portsmouth with warnings, before approaching the entrance to Brest in Indefatigable {{with the intention of}} disrupting French movements. Believing that the frigates in the bay must be the forerunners of a larger British force, de Galles attempted to pass his fleet through the Raz de Sein. This channel was a narrow, rocky and dangerous passage, and de Galles used corvettes as temporary light ships that shone blue lights and fired fireworks to direct his main fleet through the passage. Pellew observed this, and sailed Indefatigable right through the French fleet, launching rockets and shining lights seemingly at random. This succeeded in confusing the French officers, causing the Séduisant to strike the Grand Stevenent rock and sink with the loss of over 680 men from a complement of 1,300. Séduisants distress flares added to <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> delayed the fleet's passage until dawn. His task of observing the enemy completed, Pellew took his remaining squadron to Falmouth, sent a report to the Admiralty by semaphore telegraph, and refitted his ships.|$|E

5000|$|Having thus {{entered the}} {{pamphlet}} [...] "war", Ascham {{then began to}} expand his arguments. He was certainly {{the author of a}} longer pamphlet, The Bounds and Bonds of Publique Obedience, which appeared in August 1649; and by November he had added nine chapters to his 1648 Discourse, which now appeared under the title Of <b>the</b> <b>Confusions</b> <b>and</b> Revolutions of [...] (sic). This work attracted the attention of Robert Sanderson who criticised it in a short and pungent pamphlet. Ascham's Reply to a paper of Dr Sandersons, containing a censure of Mr A. A. his book of <b>the</b> <b>Confusions</b> <b>and</b> revolution of Government (sic), which was published on 9 January 1650, was directed as much as against Edward Gee's Exercitation concerning usurped powers as against Sanderson's work. In these works Ascham's essential argument was that in a situation in which people had to look after their own safety, they were justified in giving their allegiance to any power that was capable of protecting them, whatever the legality of its title to power.|$|R
25|$|The Vandals, led by King Gaiseric, took {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> weakness of the Western Empire {{in the wake of}} Valentinian's turbulent succession, moving into Italy and sacking Rome.

On the other hand, the chronicler Evagrius Scholasticus writes that Olybrius had fled Rome on the approach of Gaiseric's army.|$|E
25|$|According to Robert M.

25|$|The {{cause of}} this failure is to be {{attributed}} not to the want of sufficient cavalry, for indeed there was an ample number for the purpose, but to <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> disorder consequent upon the surprise which the French attack had occasioned, and which was augmented by the darkness that had set in upon the field.

25|$|Ammonia {{also plays}} a role in both normal and {{abnormal}} animal physiology. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The liver converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the urea cycle. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in cirrhosis, may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as ornithine transcarbamylase, lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to <b>the</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>and</b> coma of hepatic encephalopathy, as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and organic acidurias.|$|E

A fight with his older brother, Buzz, results in Kevin getting sent to {{the third floor of the}} house for punishment, where he wishes that his family would disappear.
