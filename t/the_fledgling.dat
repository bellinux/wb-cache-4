5|$|Believing that Gary, the Nosferatu chief, {{has stolen}} the sarcophagus, <b>the</b> <b>fledgling</b> {{is sent to}} Hollywood to find him; after {{locating}} a captured Nosferatu for Gary, he reveals that the sarcophagus was stolen by the Giovanni vampire clan. <b>The</b> <b>fledgling</b> infiltrates the Giovanni mansion and finds the sarcophagus guarded by the Kuei-Jin, who claim their leader, Ming-Xiao, has formed an alliance with LaCroix. The locked sarcophagus is returned to LaCroix's tower and Beckett, a vampire historian, tells <b>the</b> <b>fledgling</b> that {{the only person who}} can open it has been abducted by Grunfeld to lure LaCroix. <b>The</b> <b>fledgling</b> kills Grunfeld and learns that the sarcophagus' key has been stolen.|$|E
5|$|They {{return to}} LaCroix, {{learning}} that the Sabbat tried {{to steal the}} sarcophagus to destroy it and prevent Gehenna, and kill the Sabbat leader to disperse his followers. <b>The</b> <b>fledgling</b> is met by Ming-Xiao, who offers to form an alliance. Ming-Xiao reveals that she has the key, and LaCroix killed Grout to prevent his powerful insight from unveiling LaCroix's plans; Ming-Xiao changed into Nines at the mansion to frame him. Denying Ming-Xiao's claims, LaCroix rescinds the blood hunt on Nines and entrusts <b>the</b> <b>fledgling</b> with recruiting the Anarchs to punish the Kuei-Jin for murdering Grout. <b>The</b> <b>fledgling</b> finds Nines hiding in the forest, and they are then attacked by a werewolf and Nines is badly injured. <b>The</b> <b>fledgling</b> escapes with Jack, who reveals that LaCroix has issued an execution order on <b>the</b> <b>fledgling</b> for framing Nines on orders from Ming-Xiao.|$|E
5|$|Increased Sabbat {{activity}} {{coincides with}} {{the disappearance of the}} Malkavian chief, Alistair Grout. At Grout's mansion, <b>the</b> <b>fledgling</b> sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout's remains in the mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach, who denies involvement in Grout's death. Learning about Nines' presence at the mansion, LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines' execution. <b>The</b> <b>fledgling</b> is sent to the Museum of Natural History to recover the sarcophagus, but finds that it has been stolen. Jack later suggests to <b>the</b> <b>fledgling</b> that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the blood of the ancient within, gaining its power.|$|E
40|$|From 1986 to 1989 two adoptions in Spanish Emperial Eagle were {{recorded}} involving 5. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>fledglings.</b> <b>The</b> results of blood analyses show that values of <b>the</b> adopted <b>fledglings</b> were not <b>the</b> highest for variables indicative of chronic malnutrition.

40|$|A nest of Red-headed Falcon Falco chicquera was {{observed}} in 2009, beginning {{with the onset of}} breeding and continuing on to the next breeding of the pair.   The nest was found on 02 March 2009 in an electricity pylon in a sub-urban area at Keraniganj, Dhaka, Bangladesh.   The incubation period was estimated at a minimum of four weeks and the nestling period was 37 days.   <b>Fledglings</b> remained in <b>the</b> nesting area up to four months after fledging.   The female almost exclusively fed <b>the</b> nestlings and <b>fledglings.</b>   <b>The</b> diet of adults, nestlings and fledglings consisted of 72 % small birds (sparrow sized) and 28 % Pipistrellus bats (n = 112).   <b>The</b> diet of <b>fledglings</b> consisted of 61 % birds and 39 % bats (n= 72; before independence mainly birds and after independence mainly bats).   Parents delivered prey to fledglings up to 39 days after fledging (i. e., post-fledging dependence period was 39 days).   <b>The</b> <b>fledgling’s</b> flight pattern was distinguishable from the adults nearly two months after fledging.   <b>The</b> <b>fledgling’s</b> call reminiscent of a begging call was recorded up to 75 days after fledging.

40|$|We {{studied the}} post-fledging {{dependence}} period of individually marked lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni) in southwestern Spain. Chicks fledged at {{a mean age}} of 37 d and remained at the breeding colony, depending on their parents for food, on average 5 d more. Parents declined food provisioning to offspring during the post-fledging dependence period. We did not observe play wish objects, social play, training or learning of hunting skills among <b>the</b> <b>fledglings.</b> Family groups dissolved once <b>the</b> <b>fledglings</b> dispersed from <b>the</b> colony. The adults tend to remain at the breeding colony while juveniles have been observed up to 164 km NE-NW from their nasal colony before starting fall migration. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|LaCroix sends <b>the</b> <b>fledgling</b> to Santa Monica to {{help his}} ghoul, Mercurio, destroy a Sabbat warehouse.

LaCroix tasks the player with investigating a docked ship, the Elizabeth Dane, for information about an Ankaran sarcophagus rumored to contain the body of an Antediluvian, {{one of the oldest}} and most powerful vampires, whose arrival would herald the vampire apocalypse, Gehenna. <b>The</b> <b>fledgling</b> discovers that the sarcophagus seems to have been opened from within.|$|E

50|$|The Cape weaver is {{subjected}} to brood parasitism by the diederik cuckoo. The nests are sometimes heavily infested with parasites such as mites, and <b>the</b> <b>fledglings</b> can be parasitised by ticks. Disused nests may be reused by Cape sparrows and African dusky flycatchers.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{season is}} chiefly from August to February each year. Both {{partners}} build the rather small nest. <b>The</b> <b>fledglings</b> leave <b>the</b> nest after {{about three weeks}} of hatching. They look like the adults, except the black facial mask is reduced to an eye stripe.|$|R
