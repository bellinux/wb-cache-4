5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E
25|$|Ms Frizzle's {{class is}} going {{with her on}} the most boring field trip, to the waterworks. At least that is what they think until they {{discover}} how interesting things always happen on Ms Frizzle's trips. After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in scuba diving outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises {{up in the air and}} into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually it takes them back to Walkerville Elementary, where <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the faucet in the girls' bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and wonder how it returned from the cloud.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the music}} video began on September 20, 2012, with shots of Jepsen on set of the music video {{surfacing}} online the same day. She was pictured {{wearing a pair of}} leather pants along with a red-black corset and a silver chain hanging from her waist. The singer said she is aiming to show a more mature side with the music video. On October 8, 2012, a 24-second teaser was uploaded to YouTube featuring Jepsen performing the track at a party, falling for a guy in a grey beanie and then jumping into a swimming pool with him for a kiss. Two weeks later, the singer tweeted, [...] "the music video for This Kiss is coming soooo soon! Until then here is a little preview. Hope you enjoy it! Mwah x," [...] followed by the link of the teaser. A lyric video, which [...] "channels the familiar opening credits of the classic show Saved By The Bell" [...] as noted by Carl Williot of Idolator, was released on October 18, 2012. The music video premiered on October 26, 2012, at the Fun Size film premiere, and was released online on October 28, 2012. Directed by Justin Francis, the video starts with Jepsen and her fellow friends driving a Fiat 500. After <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car, they follow to a '80s inspired warehouse, where Jepsen starts flirting with a guy (actor Kurt Collins). The guy is immediately attracted to her, and, as the video comes to a close, they dive in a pool and kiss.|$|E

At the start of Season 5, Leonard and Priya are trying to maintain a long-distance relationship via Skype (including a failed attempt at cybersex) with Priya continuing to treat Leonard like a submissive partner. Despite being the most eager to have sex, Leonard proves he is quite awkward in these situations. Leonard later goes to a wedding with Amy, {{and they seem to}} take a liking to each other, though Sheldon disapproves, karate-chopping Leonard and saying, [...] "She's not for you...not for you!". Later, despite feeling that he and Priya were in love and might get married, Leonard finds himself attracted to a comic book artist named Alice. The attraction is mutual, and they even share a kiss. Right when they are about to have sex, however, he tells Alice that he has a girlfriend, thus ending the relationship. Leonard then decides to confess his behavior to Priya via Skype, but he is shocked to learn that Priya has also betrayed him, sleeping with her former boyfriend; Priya defends that they both slipped up a little, but Leonard corrects her saying that he slipped a little, while she slipped a lot, bringing the conversation to a strained end. In the next episode, Leonard tells Sheldon that he is single, implying that he and Priya have broken up; his actions since then have confirmed their split occurred.|$|E
