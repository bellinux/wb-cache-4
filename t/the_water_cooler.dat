5|$|After {{a company}} night {{out to the}} Springfield drag races, Smithers fails to protect Mr. Burns from being harassed by a drunken Lenny. Though he tries to make amends the next day, Smithers again bungles his duties and {{attempts}} to drown himself in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>cooler</b> out of guilt, so Burns suggests he take a vacation. Seeking a replacement who will not outshine him, Smithers purposely selects Homer for the job. Burns soon proves to be ridiculously demanding {{for someone who has}} not devoted his life to him like Smithers. After putting up with Mr. Burns' constant abuse for several days, Homer finally snaps and punches Burns. Fearing he has killed the old man, Homer runs away in panic, and hides at home.|$|E

500|$|USA Todays Scott Bowles {{awarded the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, {{labeling}} it a [...] "surprising comedy that rivals Bridesmaids as the funniest film of the summer, if not the year." [...] Bowles added that [...] "the characters are so likable", giving particular credit to Sudeikis though also adding praise for the performances of Bateman and Day. The dialogue was also lauded by Bowles, which commented that [...] "Seth Gordon has a deft touch with water-cooler talk—even when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>cooler</b> might be spiked with poison." [...] Leonard Maltin of indieWire considered Day to have had the [...] "breakout role" [...] and offered praise to the performances of the cast, but lamented the lack of screen time for Farrell's character. Maltin concluded [...] "the movie has just enough raunchiness to identify it as a 2011 comedy, just enough cleverness to admire, and just the right camaraderie among its three male stars, which {{turns out to be the}} movie’s greatest strength." [...] Rolling Stones Peter Travers gave kudos to the [...] "killer cast", with specific credit given to Bateman and Day, but was critical of the movie, stating [...] "it wussies out on a sharp premise" [...] and that it is a [...] "hit-and-miss farce that leaves you wishing it was funnier than it is" [...] The Guardians Philip French called Horrible Bosses [...] "alumbering, misogynistic affair", but admitted [...] "Ilaughed frequently, probably to the detriment of my self-respect." [...] Nicholas Barber of The Independent gave a positive review, complimenting Gordon for not allowing the actors' improvisation to be detrimental to the pacing, but felt the movie was not as [...] "dark" [...] as its premise required, saying [...] "what edginess the film does have comes instead from the inordinate quantity of swearing, plus a smattering of homophobia and misogyny." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, {{a disgruntled}} {{employee}} at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station in Canada obtained a sample (estimated as about a [...] "half cup") of heavy {{water from the}} primary heat transport loop of the nuclear reactor, and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving bioassay urine samples with elevated tritium levels. The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water. This was not an incident of heavy water poisoning, but rather radiation poisoning from other isotopes in the heavy water. Some news services were not careful to distinguish these points, {{and some of the}} public were left with the impression that heavy water is normally radioactive and more severely toxic than it is. Even if pure heavy water had been used in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>cooler</b> indefinitely, it is not likely the incident would have been detected or caused harm, since no employee would be expected to get much more than 25% of their daily drinking water from such a source.|$|E
40|$|The barrel is {{a special}} {{thick-walled}} cylinder. It is significance to study the temperature distribution of thick-walled cylinder under liquid-cooled state to weapon launch safety and effectiveness. Taking a naval gun barrel as research objective, a unified thermal-fluid-solid coupling model is put forward including barrel solid wall, <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> jacket solid wall. The unsteady coupled temperature field of the barrel is calculated {{at the time of}} single and continuous firing and some influencing factors such as <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flow velocity, barrel wall thickness and so on, are analyzed to the barrel temperature field. The results show that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> effect of <b>the</b> barrel outer is closely related to the wall thickness and <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flow velocity. When the barrel wall thickness is small, increasing the flow velocity increase heat dissipation and reduce barrel wall temperature obviously.

Goldberg was arrested later that night for aggravated stalking and taken into custody by police. However, later that night, Elizabeth admitted that she was lying. As it turned out, Elizabeth was a pawn for the nWo so that Goldberg {{would be unable to}} have his scheduled title match with Kevin Nash later that night. Due to Goldberg's apparent absence, the returning Hulk Hogan took Goldberg's title shot in the match. Soon after, Elizabeth accompanied Lex Luger, and sometimes Kevin Nash, to ringside. Lex Luger, who was accompanied by Elizabeth at this time to ringside for single matches, was supposed {{to get ready for the}} tag team match against Konnan and Rey Mysterio Jr. with Miss Elizabeth's hair on the line and Rey Mysterio Jr.'s mask on the line at Superbrawl IX with Kevin Nash as his tag team partner. However, on the February 18, 1999 edition of WCW Thunder, at the E-Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, a limo pulled up and was driving along with Rey Mysterio Jr. with Luger and Elizabeth inside. As Elizabeth and Luger were getting out of the limo, Rey Mysterio Jr. grabbed the door and slammed it into Luger's biceps, injuring him in the process. Elizabeth was screaming at Rey who yelled [...] "thug life!". As Elizabeth closed the door, the limo left the arena with Luger and Elizabeth inside. Luger was immediately replaced by Scott Hall as Kevin Nash's tag team partner for the tag team match at Superbrawl IX. After Spring Stampede (1999) she took time off on the road with Luger to recover from his bicep injury and go through a divorce with her husband Cary Lubetsky.|$|E
