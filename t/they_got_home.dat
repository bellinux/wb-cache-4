5|$|Barbara and Adam Maitland {{decide to}} spend their {{vacation}} decorating their idyllic Connecticut country home. As the two are driving home {{from a trip to}} town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river. After they return home, Adam decides to retrace their steps as they can't recall how <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b> Upon stepping outside he's taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before being pulled back in by Barbara. Even though he had been gone for less than a minute Barbara claims he had been gone for over an hour. She and Adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and realize they did not survive the crash.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment {{surrendered}} {{with the}} Department of the Trans-Mississippi, General E. Kirby Smith commanding, May 26, 1865. When the Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered, {{all of the}} Arkansas infantry regiments were encamped in and around Marshall, Texas (war-ravaged Arkansas {{no longer able to}} subsist the army). The regiments were ordered to report to Shreveport, Louisiana, to be paroled. None of them did so. Some soldiers went to Shreveport on their own to be paroled, but the regiments simply disbanded without formally surrendering. A company or two managed to keep together until <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

[...] "Everyone who was there would say that <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> because of Reg." [...] Another said: [...] "We were lucky to have Reg Newton and that is {{evidenced}} by the fact that the casualties in D Force were one of the lowest and it was definitely because of him." [...] His men realized his unorthodox measures gave them the best chance of survival.|$|E
60|$|As {{young people}} do not care for such discussions, we will not {{describe}} them, but as the impression they made upon one of the mammas affected our hero and heroine, we must mention the changes {{which took place in}} their life when <b>they</b> all <b>got</b> <b>home</b> again.|$|R
60|$|While he {{was doing}} this the Eagle flew off to the man's home with him, and with the hare, and when <b>they</b> had <b>got</b> <b>home</b> the man went to the churchyard, and had some Christian earth laid upon the hare, and then it turned into his son Jack.|$|R
50|$|Despite their relief, Matthew, Jimmy and Carl {{were far}} from ecstatic, with Matthew still wanting to know who killed his father. When <b>they</b> <b>got</b> to <b>Home</b> Farm, Matthew was still {{convinced}} Jimmy was guilty and demanded he admit it, once and for all. However, Jimmy continued to deny that it was him.|$|R
2500|$|On October 16, 2014, {{as part of}} a {{stand-up}} comedy routine in Philadelphia, Hannibal Buress addressed Cosby's legacy of [...] "talk down" [...] to young black men about their mode of dress and lifestyle. Buress criticized the actor's public moralizing by saying, [...] "Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of brings you down a couple notches." [...] The audience appeared to respond to Buress's accusation as an incredulous joke before he encouraged everyone to [...] "Google 'Bill Cosby rape' [...] " [...] when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b> Buress had been using the same Cosby routine for the previous six months with little response, but the October performance went viral after being posted on Philadelphia magazine's website. A media firestorm ensued, with numerous publications tackling the question of how Cosby had managed to maintain, as Buress called it in his routine, a [...] "teflon image" [...] despite {{more than a decade of}} public sex abuse accusations.|$|E
2500|$|The 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment was {{formerly}} surrendered with the Department of the Trans-Mississippi by Major General E. Kirby Smith on May 26, 1865. When the Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered, {{all of the}} Arkansas infantry regiments were encamped in and around Marshall, Texas (since war-ravaged Arkansas was {{no longer able to}} sustain the army).

Some soldiers went to Shreveport on their own to be paroled, but the regiments simply disbanded without formally surrendering. A company or two managed to keep together until <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b> For example, Company G, 35th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, traveled back to Van Buren, Arkansas, where they surrendered to the U.S. post commander in a formal ceremony, drawn {{up in front of the}} court-house, laying down their weapons, etc. But for the most part, the men simply went home. Many of the Arkansas Cavalry [...] units, which had largely been furloughed for the winter of 1864-1865 following Price's disastrous Missouri Expedition did formally surrendered at Jacksonport, Wittsburg, and a few other locations.|$|E
60|$|It {{was rather}} a {{favourite}} habit of hers {{to make much}} of Cytherea when they were out, and snub her for it afterwards when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Europe, EMI booked {{the band}} months {{ahead of time}} {{so that there was}} {{adequate}} promo.

50|$|As {{students}} and scholars pore over {{the wealth of}} information on the 506th website, more information about the Vietnam experience of GIs has led to opportunities for recognition and appreciation of veterans. In some cases this has been helping to heal the pain from the reception <b>they</b> <b>got</b> coming <b>home</b> and the misunderstandings about Vietnam that have persisted for decades.|$|R
5000|$|Porkeri Church is a {{black and}} white wooden church with grass roof.

5|$|As {{the crowd}} began {{making their way}} home from Ninian Park, the news began to filter slowly out. Some Scottish fans had elected to remain in Cardiff and were celebrating the {{achievement}} of guaranteeing the play-off spot when they saw and heard what had happened. Others had boarded trains or were in cars heading home – many fans didn't hear the news until <b>they</b> eventually <b>got</b> <b>home</b> the following day.|$|R
50|$|They then {{defeated}} East Carolina by a 37-17 margin at <b>home.</b> <b>They</b> <b>got</b> demolished at <b>home</b> by ACC powerhouse Maryland 17-48. They then {{traveled to}} Rutgers, where they won handily 40-0. The next game was a 34-17 home win over Syracuse.|$|R
60|$|Mortimer Lightwood {{was not an}} {{extraordinarily}} impressible man, but this face impressed him. He spoke of it more than once on {{the remainder of the}} way home, and more than once when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
60|$|When <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{they found}} that Captain Colby had already arrived. He and the Dartaway were in the field back of the barn, and {{surrounding}} the aviator were {{all the members of}} the Rover household.|$|E

Wasn't that like a man?" ...|$|R
2500|$|This was {{the first}} time in its history the Telemark Battalion had participated in actual combat. The Commander of the QRF, Lt. Col.

[...] The participating soldiers also commented that the training <b>they</b> <b>got</b> at <b>home</b> was important for their success in the operation.|$|R

60|$|<b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{that night}} {{just as the}} sun was setting redly behind the great maples on the western hill. As they drove into the yard, Clemantiny's face appeared, gazing at them over the high board fence of the cow-yard. Chester waved his hand at her gleefully.|$|E
60|$|They had a merry little supper after <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> and Polly {{gave them}} a burlesque opera that convulsed her hearers, for her spirits rose again and she was {{determined}} to get the last drop of fun before she went back to her humdrum life again.|$|E
50|$|Porkeri Church is {{a church}} in the {{settlement}} of Porkeri in the Faroe Islands. Porkeri is situated in the island Suðuroy, which is the southernmost of the islands.

60|$|Shivering, dripping, and crying, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> Amy <b>home,</b> {{and after}} an {{exciting}} time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.|$|R
60|$|Away went {{these two}} through the snow, {{until they came}} to where the deer had been left. It was hard work to get it lashed on the sled, and much harder work to drag it over the snow, but by dint of {{perseverance}} and resolution <b>they</b> <b>got</b> it <b>home.</b> <b>They</b> were so fatigued, however, {{that it was impossible}} to think of doing the same with the bear. This was a perplexing state of things, for Roy had observed a wolf-track when out, and feared that nothing but the bones would be left in the morning.|$|R
6000|$|And then, when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> {{very hungry}} after their toil, Mr. Townsend made another apology for the poorness of his table.

60|$|When <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> Aunt Plenty {{received}} her new guest with her accustomed hospitality and, on learning the story, was as warmly interested as even enthusiastic Rose could desire, bustling {{about to make}} the child comfortable with an energy pleasant to see, for the grandmotherly instincts were strong in the old lady and of late had been beautifully developed.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{they walked}} along {{down the steep}} path, until they began to enter the bushes. Rollo's father had made this {{arrangement}} {{so that he might}} have an opportunity to talk with him about the difficulty with the boys, for he thought, on the whole, {{it would be better to}} talk with him now than to wait till <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
50|$|When <b>they</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home,</b> Jack {{was still}} nervous about one day hurting Jennifer. He was {{getting used to}} the idea of them as a couple when he ended up killing Harper accidentally when he tried to stop Harper from {{shooting}} Steve on Steve's wedding to Kayla (Jack had been best man when Steve tried to marry Kayla after the Marina incident nullified Steve's marriage to Kayla, but the wedding was interrupted when Kayla was wrongly arrested for Marina's murder. The real killer was Isabella who had killed her sister accidentally and then blocked it from her mind).|$|R
60|$|They rambled about {{among the}} rocks {{for a short}} time longer, and then they descended by a steep and crooked path, in a {{different}} place from where they had ascended.

They gained a large fan base quickly and sold out their shows. They went on tour and spread their popularity all over Japan. Once <b>they</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home</b> to release their first video and live CD in spring 1997, they had developed such a fan base that the first press of the video sold out instantly, to all parts of Japan from Okinawa to Hokkaidō.|$|R
