5|$|The 1928 Okeechobee {{hurricane}} caused {{at least}} 2,500deaths, {{most of which}} were migrant, black farmer workers around Lake Okeechobee. Due to racial segregation at the time, the coffins provided were used for the white victims, most of whom received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in West Palm Beach. The bodies of <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> who were killed, and some of those whose race could not be identified, were disposed of by other means. Some were burned in funeral pyres, while many were placed into mass graves, including about 1,600 in Port Mayaca, 674 at the pauper's cemetery in West Palm Beach, at least 22 in Miami Locks (now known as Lake Harbor), 28 in Ortona, and 22 in Sebring. There were also unconfirmed reports of bodies buried in Loxahatchee. After the burials were complete, then-Mayor of West Palm Beach Vincent Oaksmith proclaimed an hour of mourning on October1 for those who died during the storm. A funeral service was hosted by several local clergymen. Roughly 3,000 people attended, including educator and civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune. A memorial was placed at Woodlawn Cemetery in memory of the victims of the storm, but no such marker was placed at the pauper's cemetery.|$|E

The captain, with three head injuries and a broken arm, and the three survivors who supported him, were locked in the chamber to defend themselves with firearms that were stored there, but the rioters threw buckets of water on the weapons and wet the gunpowder.

500|$|In 1954 the NP {{government}} {{passed the}} Bantu Resettlement Act, which, {{along with the}} 1950 Group Areas Act, forcibly moved millions of South Africans into townships in racially segregated zones. This {{was part of a}} plan to divide the country into a number of smaller regions, including tiny, impoverished bantustans where <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> were to live. In 1955, the settlement of Sophiatown was destroyed, and its 60,000 inhabitants moved, many to a settlement known as Meadowlands. Sophiatown had been a center of African jazz music prior to the relocation. The move was the inspiration for the writing of the song [...] "Meadowlands", by Strike Vilakezi. As with many other songs of the time, it was popularised both within and outside the country by Miriam Makeba. Makeba's song [...] "Sophiatown is Gone" [...] also referred to the relocation from Sophiatown, as did [...] "Bye Bye Sophiatown" [...] by the Sun Valley Sisters. Music not directly related to the movement was also often harnessed during this period: the South African Communist Party would use such music for its fundraising dances, and the song [...] "Udumo Lwamaphoyisa" [...] (A Strong Police Force) was sung by lookouts to provide warnings of police presence and liquor raids.|$|E
500|$|Makeba {{has also}} been {{associated}} with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: [...] "Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. <b>The</b> <b>Black</b> <b>people</b> are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that [...] "black is beautiful". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to racial and gender disparities, and highlighting [...] "that the liberation they desired could not separate race from sex". Makeba's critique of second-wave feminism as being the product of luxury led to observers being unwilling to call her a feminist. Scholar Ruth Feldstein stated that Makeba and others influenced both black feminism and second-wave feminism through their advocacy, and the historian Jacqueline Castledine referred to her as one of the [...] "most steadfast voices for social justice".|$|E

The author of the novel aims to show that <b>black</b> <b>people</b> may not forget their origin as well as their indigenous nature, in which they should know and follow their traditions as <b>black</b> <b>people.</b> Jadine neglects her own tribe by forgetting her indigenous nature, so that she has a conflict with Son concerning <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>people's</b> roles. This conflict triggers the writer to question and to analyze the causes and the ending of the story. Their conflicts are caused by their different characters and personalities, shaped by their different backgrounds during their teenage years. Their ideas concerning <b>black</b> <b>people's</b> roles are never able to meet. Literary theories such as: characterization, conflict and setting will be applied in analyzing Jadine's refusal to be black that leads to her conflict with Son. Moreover, in helping <b>the</b> analysis, <b>black</b> identity theory and social background of America in 1980 s will also be used, for this theory can help to find out the answer. Eventually, by using all these tools, this study concludes that Son and Jadine fail to keep their relationship because they have very contrasting ideas of <b>black</b> <b>people's</b> roles.
