5|$|The local {{special vote}} {{phase of the}} {{election}} took place on 5–6 May 2014, accommodating who are physically infirm, disabled or pregnant or were unable to vote at their voting station on the polling day. Former President <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki</b> cast a special vote as he was attending a World Economic Forum meeting in Nigeria on polling day.|$|E
5|$|At the 20th century's end, Gaddafi—frustrated by {{the failure}} of his Pan-Arab ideals—increasingly {{rejected}} Arab nationalism in favour of Pan-Africanism, emphasising Libya's African identity. From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became {{one of the founders of}} the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{democratic}} process was {{threatened by the}} Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist groups like Inkatha and far-right Afrikaner parties; in June 1993, one of the latter—the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB)—attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre. Following the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani, Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who {{had died of a}} stroke. In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal. Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki,</b> Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Mandela served 27 {{years in}} prison, {{initially}} on Robben Island, {{and later in}} Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, Mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki.</b> Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki,</b> {{president}} of South Africa and mediator for the African Union {{for the civil}} war in Côte d'Ivoire assembled on 4 and 5 April in Pretoria the different protagonists of the conflict: president Laurent Gbagbo, Prime Minister Seydou Diarra, Guillaume Soro (Forces Nouvelles), Alassane Ouattara (Rassemblement des républicains), Henri Konan Bédié (Parti démocratique de Côte d'Ivoire). An agreement to end the hostilities was reached which envisages the disarmament of the rebel forces and the different pro government militia. The question about eligibility for the presidency of the Republic could not be resolved. <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki</b> has given himself one week to make proposals, after having consulted Olusegun Obasanjo, {{president of}} Nigeria and of the African Union, and Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the UNO. The presidential election remains scheduled for October 2005. Laurent Gbagbo was pleased with this agreement, as was the African Union, whose commission president Alpha Oumar Konaré congratulated the mediation by <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki.</b> Guillaume Soro announced the imminent return to the government of the Forces nouvelles ministers.|$|E

50|$|Mathanzima died in Queenstown on his 88th birthday. He {{received}} an official funeral, {{but not a}} state one as former allies and supporters had hoped. The continued mixed feelings toward him in South Africa were reflected in then President <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki's</b> eulogy for him, and Mandela's speaking warmly of Mathanzima's role as a Thembu elder.|$|R

50|$|AIDS-denialist {{policies}} have impeded {{the creation of}} effective programs for distribution of antiretroviral drugs. Denialist policies by former South African President <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki's</b> administration led to several hundred thousand unnecessary deaths. UNAIDS estimates that in 2005 there were 5.5 million people in South Africa infected with HIV — 12.4% of the population. This was an increase of 200,000 people since 2003.|$|R
50|$|On the {{retirement}} of Nelson Mandela, he served in <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki's</b> first government as the Minister of Safety and Security from 1999 {{until his death in}} April 2002. He was tasked with restoring the morale of an undermanned, underpaid police force beset with a political history of maintaining apartheid, riddled with corruption and a huge escalation of violent crime in the country.|$|R
2500|$|In 2008, University of Cape Town {{researcher}} Nicoli Nattrass, {{and later}} that year a group of Harvard scientists led by Zimbabwean physician Pride Chigwedere each independently estimated that <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki's</b> denialist policies led to the early deaths of more than 330,000 South Africans. Barbara Hogan, the health minister appointed by Mbeki's successor, voiced shame over the studies' findings and stated: [...] "The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa." ...|$|R

25|$|On 20 September 2008, <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki</b> {{announced}} his resignation after being recalled by the African National Congress's National Executive Committee.

25|$|Govan Mbeki {{had come}} to the rural Eastern Cape as a {{political}} activist after earning two university degrees; he urged his family to make the ANC their family, and of his children, <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki</b> is the one who most clearly followed that instruction, joining the party at the age of fourteen and devoting his life to it thereafter.|$|E
25|$|In November 2008, The New York Times {{reported}} {{that due to}} <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki's</b> rejection of scientific consensus on AIDS and his embrace of AIDS denialism, an estimated 365,000 people had perished in South Africa. A study in African Affairs in 2008 found that Mbeki's government could have prevented the deaths of 343,000 South Africans during his tenure, had it followed the more sensible public health policies then applied in the Western Cape province.|$|R
50|$|AIDS-denialist {{claims have}} failed to attract support in the {{scientific}} community, where the evidence for the causative role of HIV in AIDS is considered conclusive. However, the movement has {{had a significant impact}} in the political sphere, culminating with former South African President <b>Thabo</b> <b>Mbeki's</b> embrace of AIDS-denialist claims. The resulting governmental refusal to provide effective anti-HIV treatment in South Africa has been blamed {{for hundreds of thousands of}} premature AIDS-related deaths in South Africa.|$|R
