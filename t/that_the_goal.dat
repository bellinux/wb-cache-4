5|$|Fictional {{accounts}} sometimes {{portray the}} rebelling slaves as ancient Roman freedom fighters, struggling {{to change a}} corrupt Roman society and to end the Roman institution of slavery. Although this is not contradicted by classical historians, no historical account mentions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> of the rebel slaves was to end slavery in the Republic, nor {{do any of the}} actions of rebel leaders, who themselves committed numerous atrocities, seem specifically aimed at ending slavery.|$|E

5000|$|On June 11, 2013, Hardy {{spoke to}} reporters during a summer minicamp {{claiming}} his goal for sacks in the 2013 season to be 50. Regarding such a lofty number, {{more than twice}} the current record, Hardy stated, [...] "Why shoot low, right? If I'm going to shoot at it, I'm going to shoot at it with a 50 caliber. I'm going to shoot at a little bird with a 50-caliber bullet. <b>That's</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> for this year, 50 sacks, that's where I'm at. <b>That's</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal,</b> 50.

5|$|On 4 January 2017, Walker, who {{was still}} {{recovering}} from the injury sustained while playing in India, signed a 18 month long deal with Scottish League Two club Edinburgh City. He scored his first goal for the club in a league match against Montrose in February. The goal was his fifteenth goal of his career. He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> {{was one of the}} better goals of his career. Walker was appointed as the club captain in May. He also simultaneously signed a contract keeping him in the club till May 2020.|$|E
5|$|Spain's first {{match of}} UEFA Euro 2012 {{qualifying}} was against Liechtenstein on 3 September 2010, Villa scored the second {{goal of the}} match which eventually ended 4–0. It was believed that this goal meant that he had equalled Raúl's record 44-goal tally, however after many debates about whether he or Dariusz Dudka scored the first goal in Spain's 6–0 win over Poland, FIFA eventually decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> was indeed an own goal by Dudka, meaning Villa's goal tally would remain at 43. On 12 October 2010, he finally equalled Raúl's record, scoring a penalty against Scotland and helping Spain see off the Scots in a 3–2 victory at Hampden Park.|$|E

Numerous landmarks in and around Newark and Elizabeth, New Jersey, are then shown passing by the camera as Tony drives down the highway.

Chase has said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> of the title sequence was to show that this particular mafia show was about New Jersey, as opposed to New York, where most similar dramas have been set.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{during the}} 1960s, the Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked the {{communist}} leader of Albania Enver Hoxha about giving autonomy to the minority, but this initiative was without any result. The autonomy question {{remains one of}} the main issues on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania (1991). Moreover, a certain degree of autonomy, based on the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, is the main objective of the organization Omonoia, as well as the Unity for Human Rights Party, which represents the Greek minority in the Albanian government. Such proposals were rejected in 1991 by the Albanian government, thus spurring Omonoia's radical wing to call for Union with Greece. In another incident, in 1993, Omonoia’s chairman was immediately arrested by the Albanian police, after explaining in public <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> of the Greek minority was autonomy inside the Albanian borders, based on the terms of the Protocol.|$|E
5|$|The Goodison Park {{structure}} {{was built in}} stages. In the summer of 1895 a new Bullens Road stand was built and a roof placed on the original Goodison Road stand but only after five directors, including Chairman, George Mahon had resigned over what was described in the club minutes as 'acute administrative difficulties'. In 1906, the doubled-decker Goodison Avenue Stand was built behind the goal {{at the south end}} of the ground. The stand was designed by Liverpool architect Henry Hartley who went on to chair the Liverpool Architectural Society a year later. The club minutes from the time show that Hartley was unhappy with certain aspects of the stand and the poor sightlines meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> line had to be moved seven metres north, towards Gwladys Street. In January 1908, he complained that his fees had not been paid and the bill for the stand was near £13,000. There were 2,657 seats on its upper tier with a terrace below.|$|E

5|$|The {{commuter}} rail system was introduced from 1 January 1992, after {{an agreement between}} NSB, Rogaland County Municipality and the six municipalities along the line. NSB introduced new Class 69 multiple units, while the county municipality introduced a fare coordination with the corresponding bus services. The increase in service involved 15 departures per direction per day, and the travel time from Stavanger to Egersund was reduced from 80 to 55 minutes. In addition, NSB started with a half-hour headway between Stavanger and Sandnes. A new station, Sandnes Sentrum, was opened in the city center of Sandnes {{at the time the}} new service started. NSB stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> was to increase the daily ridership from 2,900 to 5,000 passengers by 1994. The stations were also upgraded, including new sheds. The Scanet train radio system was installed between 1993 and 1996.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> {{theory of}} {{achievement}} argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> stressed by schools have dramatic consequences for whether children {{develop a sense}} of self-efficacy, or whether they avoid challenging tasks, giving up when faced with failure. It is commonly believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> stressed by Western-oriented schools are inappropriate to indigenous minority group students and predisposes them to school failure. This paper reports on a continuing study with a range of cultural groups in which the aim is to demonstrate the cultural relevance and applicability of goal theory to explaining and interpreting motivation in school settings. In particular, the paper describes the use of the LISREL computer program to develop motivational scales representing achievement goals that have validity and reliability in cross-cultural settings and the use of these scales for describing and explaining academic attitudes an...|$|R

25|$|Thus, a person’s {{attitude}} toward {{these two factors}} will influence his or her motivation level and subsequent group behavior.

On the other hand, motivation was lowest when the goal seemed impossible {{and not at all}} valuable.|$|E
