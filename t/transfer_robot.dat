We apply abstraction {{to the task of}} forming an asymmetric triangle with a homogeneous swarm of MAVs. The results show that the evolved behavior is effective both in simulation and reality, suggesting that abstraction can be a useful tool in making evolved behavior robust to the reality gap. Furthermore, we study the evolved solution, showing that it exploits the environment (in this case the identical behavior of the other robots) and creates behavioral attractors resulting {{in the creation of the}} required formation. Hence, the analysis suggests that by using abstraction, sensory-motor coordination is not necessarily lost but rather shifted to a higher level of abstraction. Control & Simulatio...|$|E

Moreover, this approach match very well the omnidirectional drive robot for two reasons: the poorly reliable odometry of this drive system and the brisk jerks these robots experience when they cross an uneven floor. Experiments performed on a relatively long path in an indoor environment with repetitive patterns and sparse local features show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed technique in reliably extracting and matching features and in the generation of a correct visual odometry.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} of evolutionary robotics is to <b>transfer</b> <b>robot</b> controllers evolved in simulation to robots in the real world. In this article, we investigate abstraction of the sensory inputs and motor actions {{as a tool to}} tackle this problem. Abstraction in robots is simply the use of preprocessed sensory inputs and low-level closed-loop control systems that execute higher-level motor commands. To demonstrate the impact abstraction could have, we evolved two controllers with different levels of abstraction to solve a task of forming an asymmetric triangle with a homogeneous swarm of micro air vehicles. The results show that although both controllers can effectively complete the task in simulation, the controller with the lower level of abstraction is not effective on the real vehicle, due to the reality gap. The controller with the higher level of abstraction is, however, effective both in simulation and in reality, suggesting that abstraction can be a useful tool in making evolved behavior robust to the reality gap. Additionally, abstraction aided in reducing the computational complexity of the simulation environment, speeding up the optimization process. Preeminently, we show that the optimized behavior exploits the environment (in this case the identical behavior of the other robots) and performs input shaping to allow the vehicles to fly into and maintain the required formation, demonstrating clear sensory-motor coordination. This shows that the power of the genetic optimization to find complex correlations is not necessarily lost through abstraction as some have suggested. Control & Simulatio...|$|E
