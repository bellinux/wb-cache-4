5|$|The bill {{then passed}} {{to a third}} reading in the House of Lords, where {{it took a few}} minor amendments, but escaped any {{significant}} opposition barring a brief dispute over the status of Cadet units; it was eventually agreed that they could be supported by the associations provided that no funding was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> from money voted by Parliament.

5|$|A new organ was {{supplied}} to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals, and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South crossing arches, with the console {{standing on the}} floor next to the north-west pier of the crossing. New cases were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> to designs by Brian Oliver of Bath, but were never executed. Norman & Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal.|$|E
5|$|Although kings, {{rulers and}} {{powerful}} {{people have always}} been able to pay for entertainment <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.|$|E
5|$|As intended, the Comanche {{was to be}} {{equipped}} with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have to enabled operations during nighttime and within challenging weather conditions. Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system. Each of the two crew members were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> {{with a pair of}} LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E

5|$|Following Irma, many {{survivors}} in Benagaspasan demanded {{for an emergency}} airlift of food, medicine, and clothing. These were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> by air force authorities. Provençal governments asked the president to declare Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur provinces disaster areas. Marcos also toured over the devastated area, noting that damage was less than initially feared. On December1, President Marcos {{declared a state of}} emergency in 17Philippines provinces. Following a meeting, Marcos ordered the release of $278,750 to help subsidize rice to farmers. Moreover, $250,000 was ordered to be released for other relief operations.|$|E
5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad mount. The 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the WPNSA was {{selected}} to host sailing events at the 2012 Olympic Games—mainly because the Academy had recently been built, so no new venue would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided.</b> However, {{as part of the}} South West of England Regional Development Agency's plans to redevelop Osprey Quay, a new 600-berth marina and an extension with more on-site facilities were built. Construction was scheduled between October 2007 and the end of 2008, and with its completion and formal opening on 11 June 2009, the venue became the first of the 2012 Olympic Games to be completed.|$|E

5|$|In November 1899, the BS {{announced}} {{a bill for}} the 1900 session. Again, an extension was proposed from Marylebone to Paddington, this time terminating {{to the east of}} the mainline station at the junction of Bishop's Road (now Bishop's Bridge Road) and Gloucester Terrace. A station was planned under Bishop's Road, linked to the mainline station by a subway under Eastbourne Terrace. From Waterloo, an extension was planned to run under Westminster Bridge Road and St George's Road to terminate at Elephant and Castle. The BS would connect there with the C's station as the NC planned two years earlier. A spur was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> to a depot and power station that were to be constructed {{on the site of the}} School for the Indigent Blind south of St George's Circus.|$|E
5|$|In {{its natural}} habitat, N. rajah grows in open areas, {{where it is}} exposed to direct {{sunlight}} – it therefore needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> with {{a significant amount of}} light in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many growers have used metal halide lamps in the 500–1000watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, growers can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination. However, this is only recommended for those living in equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A photoperiod of 12hours is comparable to that experienced in nature, since Borneo lies on the equator.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1940 the Australian Government {{placed an}} order for 243 Brewster Bermuda dive bombers for the RAAF. This type was still under development, and the program to produce it {{suffered}} from repeated delays. On 28 September 1941 the British Government offered to provide Vultee Vengeances from its allocation of the type if the RAAF considered them suitable. The Australian War Cabinet authorised the purchase of 297 Vultee Vengeances on 22 October 1941 and cancelled the order of Bermudas. By March 1942 the order had been slightly increased to 300 aircraft, of which 57 were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> by the United States Government under Lend-Lease and the other 243 {{paid for by the}} Australian Government. Australia eventually ordered 400 Vengeances. The price for each of the aircraft purchased by Australia was A£90,000.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education. Education {{was viewed as a}} religious duty, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> for at home, where its quality was dependent upon the spare time and level of education of parents. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E
5|$|Several relief {{agencies}} were already positioned {{in the region}} {{in response to a}} magnitude 6.9 earthquake in January of that year that killed over 20,000 people. Additional disaster relief teams were deployed to the region to further prepare residents for the cyclone. Food, water and other necessities were stored and ready <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> to victims of the storm. Large swells produced by the storm affected {{a large portion of the}} western Indian coastline, especially in the city of Bombay. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. Offshore, between 1,500 and 2,000 fishing vessels had lost contact with the mainland. Later reports indicated that between 120 and 900 fishermen had gone missing as a result of the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|The Borders Railway {{bill was}} debated in September 2005 and a motion {{supporting}} {{it was passed}} with 102 in favour, none against and one abstention. On 9 May 2006, the bill committee published its final report supporting the project with two recommendations: a station had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> at Stow and the line had to be completed to its full extent, i.e. as far as Tweedbank. These recommendations were accepted by the Scottish Parliament in the final debate on the bill on 14 June 2006. The bill was carried by 114 votes to one.|$|E

5|$|The GDR emblem {{was removed}} from over the main {{entrance}} in 1990, the year of reunification, leaving a dark patch. Following reunification, the Berlin offices of the German Chancellery and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs moved into the building. In January 1993, after a legal decision, the Federal Government returned the building to the Federal State of Berlin, which wished {{to use it for}} its original purpose of city administration. However, it first urgently required refurbishment; under the GDR, upkeep had been neglected and the plumbing facilities, for example, dated in part to the 1920s.

5|$|The Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol is in {{the process}} of being electrified. However because of cost overruns and delays, on 8 November 2016 the {{government}} announced that several elements of the programme would be deferred including electrification south west of Thingley Junction near Chippenham and Bristol Parkway. This will leave Temple Meads un-electrified but the new Hitachi Super Express trains are bi-mode so can operate as diesels around Bristol and can use electricity where the electrification work is complete. The electrification plans do not extend west of Bristol so local services will continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> using diesel trains, with Class 165/166s cascaded from Thames Valley services scheduled to replace the 150/153/158s on local services.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier FA2 {{featured}} the Blue Vixen radar, which {{was described as}} one of the most advanced pulse doppler radar systems in the world; the Blue Fox radar was seen by some critics as having comparatively low performance for what was available at the time of procurement.

The Sea Harrier FA2 also carried the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, the first UK aircraft <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> with this capability. An upgraded model of the Pegasus engine, the Pegasus Mk 106, was used in the Sea Harrier FA2; in response to the threat of radar-based anti aircraft weapons electronic countermeasures were added. Other improvements included an increase to the air-to-air weapons load, look-down radar, increased range, and improved cockpit displays.|$|E
