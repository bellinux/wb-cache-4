500|$|... "King Kjarvalr", Sigurd's {{supposed}} grandfather, {{appears as}} Kjarvalr Írakonungr in the Landnámabók {{and has been}} identified as Cerball mac Dúnlainge, King of Osraige who died in 888. There is clearly a chronological problem with Sigurd's mother being the daughter of a king who died more than 70 years before the death of his own grandfather, Earl Thorfinn. Furthermore, Thorstein [...] "the Red" [...] Olafsson (fl. late 9th century and Hlodvir's great-grandfather) was apparently married to a granddaughter of Kjarvalr. Woolf (2007) concludes that the saga writers may have confused <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>about</b> the provenance of Sigurd Hlodvirsson with one about Thorstein, a close ally of Sigurd Eysteinsson.|$|E

500|$|... “I {{am writing}} <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>about</b> a detective who {{turns into a}} tree” was what writer Troy Kennedy Martin told his colleagues when asked what {{he was working on}} during the early 1980s. Kennedy Martin had become {{frustrated}} that “at the BBC there was no political dimension to their drama whatsoever” but had chosen to write a political story anyway, not really believing it would ever get made. The election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan as President of the United States had brought about a major shift in the global political landscape and Kennedy Martin was motivated to write out of concern arising from such issues as the Greenham Common protests, the Falklands War, unrest among the miners and, arising out of the escalation of the Cold War, the fear that “born-again Christians and Cold War warriors appeared to be running the United States”.|$|E
500|$|Director Mamoru Oshii stated, [...] "My intuition {{told me that}} <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>about</b> {{a futuristic}} world carried an {{immediate}} message for our present world. I am also interested in computers through my own personal experience with them. I had the same feeling about Patlabor and I {{thought it would be}} interesting to make a film that took place in the near future. There are only a few movies, even out of Hollywood, which clearly portray the influence and power of computers. I thought this theme would be more effectively conveyed through animation." [...] Oshii expanded on these thoughts in a later interview, noting that technology changes people and had become a part of the culture of Japan. He commented that his use of philosophy caused producers to become frustrated because of sparing use of action scenes. Oshii also acknowledged that a movie with more action would sell better, but he continued to make these movies anyway. When Oshii went back to make changes to the original Ghost in the Shell to re-release it as Ghost in the Shell 2.0, one of the reasons he gave was that the film did not resemble the sequel. He wanted to update the film to reflect changes in perspective.|$|E
