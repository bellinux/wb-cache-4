5|$|In 1964, a New Year's Eve benefit {{event was}} held for the Council on Religion and the Homosexual.

40|$|Taking some typical {{international}} practice situations, we can {{highlight the}} basic professional competence questions posed: (1) ABC Company, located in California, wants {{to establish a}} manufacturing facility in Mexico, (2) ABC asks a lawyer to draft a sales agency agreement that it will use in dealing with a French distributor. <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> has previously prepared such an agreement for this client for use with respect to distributorships in the United States. These hypothetical situations raise the following professional competence questions: (1) What are <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s professional responsibilities if <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> undertakes sole representation of this client in <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s home jurisdiction, for example California, and this representation involves advising on foreign law? In this example, {{sometimes referred to as}} the “self-help” option, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> independently, and without foreign expert assistance, counsels the client. (2) What are <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s professional responsibilities if <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> undertakes representation of the client in the foreign country? For example, given the facts above, is <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> somehow professionally restricted from going abroad to France or Mexico and doing legal work for a client in those countries? Which country 2 ̆ 7 s professional standards would apply to <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s activities? (3) If <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> decides {{that he or she is}} not competent to advise on foreign law, what are that lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s responsibilities with respect to selecting competent local counsel and to selecting competent counsel who resides and practices in a foreign country? (4) Once <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> selects counsel competent to advise on foreign law matters, what are <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s professional obligations as to the counsel 2 ̆ 7 s activities? What problems is <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> likely to encounter, and how can they best be handled? The following sections will address these concerns and hopefully offer guidance to <b>the</b> U.

S. lawyer-foreign lawyer communications, and liability for foreign lawyer legal opinions, both of which are relevant to the use and selection of foreign counsel...|$|R
