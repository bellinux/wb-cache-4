It reported that Valdocs on the computer [...] "is slow. Sometimes it merely dawdles slightly, but other times, it crawls. Entering text becomes a disconcerting pastime when the screen display lags as many as 60 characters behind your typing, and you lose characters". The magazine added that [...] "VALDOCS crashed (failed) numerous times while we were using it <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> <b>review.</b> We lost data each time, came close to losing a whole disk, and ended up retyping it into our trusty IBM PC to meet deadline". It advised users to backup their files, but stated that since the process was so slow the computer encouraged them to avoid doing so {{until it was too}} late. While praising the QX-10 itself ("Physically this is an excellent machine") and Valdocs' ease of use, Jerry Pournelle wrote in BYTE in August 1983 that [...] "the first problem is obvious {{from the other side of}} the room. The Valdocs system is slow. It seems to take forever to do disk operations ... Getting from the beginning to the end of a six-page document takes 15 seconds. Deleting the first three pages of the same document takes 20 seconds". He believed that the software [...] "has pushed the Zilog Z80 chip past its limits ... I don't think Valdocs will ever run properly until something like the 8086 or 68000 is used".|$|E

40|$|The {{splicing}} of precursors to mRNAs {{occurs in}} two steps, both involving single transesterification reactions (Fig. 1). The first step generates a 2 - 5 bond at the branch site upstream of the 3 splice site {{and a free}} 3 hy-droxyl group on the 5 exon. The resulting lariat RNA intermediate, with its slow migration in gels, {{is the most common}} assay for splicing in vitro. In the second step, attack of the 3 hydroxyl on the phosphodiester bond at the 3 splice site displaces the lariat intron with a 3 hydroxyl group and results in joining of the two exons. The bimolecular nature of the in-termediate in splicing indicated that the reaction must occur within a sta-ble splicing body or spliceosome. Surprisingly, assembly and function-ing of the spliceosome requires approximately 100 polypeptides and five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), not considering gene-specific RNA-binding factors. There are two distinct types of spliceosomes in most cells. The major class or U 2 -type spliceosome is universal in eukaryotes, whereas the minor class or U 12 -type spliceosome may not be present in some organisms. The evolutionary relationship of these two spliceosomes is uncertain. The sequence specificity for the splicing of introns must be encoded within the gene. In vertebrate genes, particularly for U 2 -type introns, the sequence specificity for splicing is not determined solely by the consen-sus sequences at the intron boundaries but is more broadly distributed within the gene. In contrast, the consensus sequences of the introns in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are generally adequate to specify their excision. The consensus sequences of U 12 -type introns are more highly conserved than those of vertebrate U 2 -type introns. <b>This</b> <b>review</b> focuses on certain aspects of pre-mRNA splicing, in-cluding recent results in spliceosome formation, the U 12 -type spliceo-*Both authors contributed equally <b>to</b> the <b>writing</b> of <b>this</b> <b>review...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} {{determinations}} of the pseudoscalar glueball and eventual radial excitation of the η masses and decay constants from QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR). The glueball mass is (2. 05 ± 0. 19) {{which one can}} compare with the eventual experimental candidate X(1835), while the η(1400) is likely a radial excitation of the η ′-meson. Their effects on the estimates of U(1) A topological susceptibility and its slope {{as well as the}} impact of the latter in the estimate of the spin of the proton is discussed. We predict the singlet polarized parton distributions to be a 0 (Q 2 = 4 GeV 2) = 0. 32 ± 0. 02, which is about a factor two smaller than the OZI value, but comparable with the COMPASS measurement of 0. 24 ± 0. 02. Prologue It is a great honour and pleasure for me <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> <b>review</b> for Professor Adriano Di Giacomo for celebrating his 70 th birthday. My scientific connection with Adriano started when I studied at CERN in 82, the SVZ-expansion of QSSR 1, 2, and where the Pisa group 3 has presented the first quenched lattice results values of the gluon condensates 〈αsG 2 〉 and g 3 fabc〈G a G b G c 〉 at the 1 st Montpellier Conference on Non-pertubative methods in 85. About the same time, my previous interest 4 on the topological susceptibility χ(0) of the U(1) A anomaly 5 and its slope χ ′ (0) continued after several discussions with Gabriele Veneziano during my stay at CERN. A program on the estimate of these quantities using QSSR has started 7. In parallel, the Pisa group has runned their lattice simulations, and, for his 2 nd participation at the Montpellier conference (QCD 90), Adriano has presented the lattice Pisa group 8 results for χ(0) and χ ′ (0) which confirmed our previous results in 7. Since then, there was a common interest between the Pisa group and Montpellier on these non-perturbative aspects of QCD. More recently, these common interests concern the proton spin problem 9, 10, 11, the estimate of the gluon condensate using QSSR 12 and lattice 13, and the estimate of the quark-gluon mixed condensates using QSSR 14 and field correlators 15...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Growing {{awareness}} of the environmental performance of construction products and buildings brings about the need for a suitable method to assess their environmental performance. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become a widely recognised and accepted method to assess the burdens and impacts throughout the life cycle. This LCA-based information may be in the form of environmental product declarations (EPD) or product environmental footprints (PEF), based on reliable and verifiable information. All of these use LCA to quantify and report several environmental impact categorie and may also provide additional information. To better understand on the one hand existing EPD programmes (EN 15804) for each country and on the other the recent developments in terms of EU reference document (e. g. PEF), the authors decided <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>this</b> <b>review</b> paper based on the outcomes of the EPD workshop that was held prior to SB 13 Graz conference. Methods This paper presents {{the state of the art}} in LCA and an overview of the EPD programmes in five European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland) based on the workshop in the first part and a comprehensive description and comparison of the PEF method and EN 15804 in the second part. In the last part, a general conclusion will wrap up the findings and results will provide a further outlook on future activities. Results and discussion The high number of EPD programmes underlines the fact that there is obviously a demand for assessments of the environmental performance of construction materials. In the comparison between and experiences of the different countries, it can be seen that more similarities than differences exist. A comparison between PEF and EPD shows differences, e. g. LCIA impact categories and recycling methodology. Conclusions Independent of raising {{awareness of}} the construction material environmental performance, the existence of so many environmental claims calls for clarification and harmonisation. Additionally, construction materials being assessed in the voluntary approaches have to follow the harmonised approach following the principles of the European Construction Products Regulation (regulated) not to foster barriers of trade. The authors therefore highly appreciate the most recent activities of the sustainability of construction works (CEN/TC 350 committee [URL] espacenormalisation/CENTC 350 /index. html) currently working on these issues at the EU level. Finally, the LCA community is further encouraged to increase the background life cycle inventory data and life cycle inventory modelling as well as the meaningfulness of certain environmental impact categories, such as toxicity, land use, biodiversity and resource usage...|$|E
