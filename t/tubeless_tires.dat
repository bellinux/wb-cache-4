25|$|In 1955, the California Highway Patrol {{placed a}} large fleet order for Century 2-door sedans, a body style {{unavailable}} {{to the general}} public. It combined the Special 2-door sedan body shell with Century powertrain and trim. Broderick Crawford was shown driving a 2-door Century sedan during the first season of his popular syndicated TV series Highway Patrol. (In later seasons he'd drive a four-door Century, like his real life counterparts in the California Highway Patrol.) Power brakes were optional. <b>Tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> were new.|$|E
2500|$|Balloon tires became {{available}} in 1925. They were [...] all around. Balloon tires were closer in design to today's tires, with steel wires reinforcing the tire bead, making lower pressure possible – typically [...] – giving a softer ride. The old nomenclature for tire size changed from measuring the outer diameter to measuring the rim diameter so [...] (rim diameter) × [...] (tire width) wheels has {{about the same}} outer diameter as 30 in (76cm) clincher tires. All tires in this time period used an inner tube to hold the pressurized air; <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> were not generally in use until much later.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> or tyres (in some Commonwealth Nations) are {{pneumatic}} tires that do {{not require}} a separate inner tube.|$|E
50|$|In 1947, BFGoodrich {{developed}} the first <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> in the United States. The <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> {{eliminate the need}} for an inner tube, which improves performance and safety, as well as enhanced confort for the car's occupants.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> are {{primarily}} used on mountain bikes {{due to their}} ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats. <b>Tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> work similarly to clinchers in that the bead of the tire is specifically designed to interlock into a corresponding tubeless rim, but without an inner tube. Air is inflated directly into the tire, and once [...] "locked" [...] into the rim, the system is airtight. Liquid sealants are often injected into <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> to prevent punctures. Pinch flats are impossible in a tubeless setup because there is no tube to pinch; however, air can escape if the bead lock is compromised from too much lateral force on the tire or deformation of the rim/tire due to hard impact with an object. Tubeless technology has progressed significantly over the last few years, and road-specific tubeless technologies for narrow tires are now gaining popularity.|$|E
50|$|Increasingly common are <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> {{conforming}} to the UST (Universal System Tubeless) standard pioneered by French wheel manufacturer Mavic {{in conjunction with}} tire manufacturers Hutchinson and Michelin.|$|E
5000|$|... 1978 Frank Herzegh - Goodrich {{inventor}} of the first successful <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> and owner of patents for over 100 inventions {{in the field of}} tire technology ...|$|R
5000|$|Traditional {{designs of}} {{pneumatic}} tires required a separate inner tube which could fail {{for a number}} of reasons, such as incorrect tire fit, friction between the tire wall and inner tube generating excess heat, or a puncture. <b>Tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> technology does away with the need for an inner tube thereby increasing safety. In a <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire,</b> the tire and the rim of the wheel form an airtight seal, with the valve being directly mounted on the rim. If a <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> gets a small puncture, air escapes only through the hole, leading to a gentle deflation. Conversely, an inner tube could potentially burst like a balloon, leading to deflation of the tire which could result in sudden loss of control of the vehicle. However, the [...] "bursting like a balloon" [...] scenario is highly unlikely due to fact that the inner tube is inside of the tire and will deflate at a rate proportional to the puncture hole size.|$|R
5000|$|Herzegh {{was born}} in Cleveland, Ohio, {{receiving}} his bachelor's degree in Physics from Case School of Applied Science. He then joined the B. F. Goodrich Co. in Akron as a research and development engineer. In addition to the <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire,</b> he also obtained over 100 other patents. After a 42-year career with Goodrich, he retired in 1972.|$|R
50|$|The {{globally}} certified {{safety features}} of this vehicle include crash protecting crumple zones, child lock, collapsible steering and side intrusion beams. Also, the <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires,</b> voice assist system and remote locking / unlocking of the vehicle are the additional safety features.|$|E
50|$|A {{tire iron}} (also tire lever or tire spoon) is a {{specialized}} metal tool used {{in working with}} tires. Tire irons have not been in common use for automobile tires since the shift {{to the use of}} <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> in the late 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The {{drawbacks}} to <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> {{are that}} they are notorious for being harder to mount on the rim than clincher tires, and that the cyclist must still carry a spare tube to insert {{in case of a}} flat tire due to a puncture.|$|E

50|$|Tucker envisioned {{several other}} {{innovations}} that were later abandoned. Magnesium wheels, disc brakes, fuel injection, self-sealing <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires,</b> and a direct-drive torque converter transmission were all evaluated or tested, but were {{dropped on the}} final prototype due to cost, engineering complexity, and lack of time to develop.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{pneumatic}} tires {{which use}} a separate inner tube, <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> have continuous ribs molded integrally into the bead of the tire {{so that they}} are forced by the pressure of the air inside the tire to seal with the flanges of the metal rim of the wheel.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{halogenated}} {{butyl rubber}} (halobutyl) was developed, in its chlorinated (chlorobutyl) and brominated (bromobutyl) variants, providing significantly higher curing rates and allowing covulcanization with other rubbers such as natural rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber. Halobutyl is today {{the most important}} material for the inner linings of <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, several dozen {{individuals}} and small businesses located mostly in southern Ontario experimented with snowblower innovation. One of these, Samuel McLaughlin of Oshawa, eventually {{became the basis for}} General Motors of Canada. S. L. C. Coleman of Fredericton, New Brunswick invented the sway bar, a device to improve the suspension of automobiles, in 1919. The dump truck was invented in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1920 by Robert T. Mawhinney. In Montreal Alexis Nihon invented the <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cross-section}} of a rim {{can have a}} wide range of geometry, each optimized for particular performance goals. Aerodynamics, mass and inertia, stiffness, durability, <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> compatibility, brake compatibility, and cost are all considerations. If the part of the {{cross-section of}} the rim is hollow where the spokes attached, as in the Sprint rim pictured, it is described as box-section or double-wall to distinguish it from single-wall rims such as the Westwood rim pictured. The double wall can make the rim stiffer. Triple-wall rims have additional reinforcement inside the box-section.|$|R
50|$|French tire {{manufacturer}} Hutchinson {{has introduced}} a tubeless wheel system, Road Tubeless, that shares many similarities to the UST (Universal System Tubeless) that was developed in conjunction with Mavic and Michelin. Road Tubeless rims, like UST rims, have no spoke holes protruding to the air chamber of the rim. The flange of the Road Tubeless rim {{is similar to the}} hook bead of a standard clincher rim but is contoured to very close tolerances to interlock with a Road <b>Tubeless</b> <b>tire,</b> creating an airtight seal between tire and rim. This system eliminates the need for a rim strip and inner tube.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of the cast wheels versus spoked are several, and {{include the use of}} <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> for higher speed and better retention of inflation; better runout tolerance and the elimination of spoke maintenance; better rigidity and thus better handling; weight reduction due to smaller hub size; and better handling of side loads for motorcycles with sidecar rigs.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{passenger}} vehicles and <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> typically use one-piece rims with a [...] "safety" [...] rim profile. The safety feature {{helps keep the}} tire bead held to the rim under adverse conditions by having a pair of safety humps extending inwardly of the rim toward the other tire bead seat from an outer contoured surface of the rim.|$|E
5000|$|Many patents {{had been}} filed {{covering}} <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires.</b> Killen Tire {{applied for a}} patent in 1928 and was granted [...] in the UK in 1930. The Wingfoot Corporation, a subsidiary of Goodyear Tire were granted a patent in South Africa in 1944. Due to technical problems, most of these designs only saw limited production or were abandoned.|$|E
50|$|The {{tire bead}} {{is the part}} of the tire that {{contacts}} the rim on the wheel. The bead is typically reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility rubber. The bead seats tightly against the two rims on the wheel to ensure that a <b>tubeless</b> <b>tire</b> holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure the tire does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to the tire is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports the tire's profile.|$|R
25|$|In 1901 Frank Seiberling {{provided}} Henry Ford with racing tires. In 1903, Paul Weeks Litchfield {{was granted}} a patent for the first <b>tubeless</b> automobile <b>tire.</b> By 1908 Ford was outfitting his Model T with Goodyear tires. In 1909 Goodyear manufactured its first aircraft tire.|$|R
50|$|Litchfield High School was {{a public}} high school in Gadsden, Alabama, serving grades nine through twelve. LHS was founded in 1958 as Litchfield Junior High School and was {{converted}} into a high school in 1975. The school bears the name of the former president of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and inventor of the first <b>tubeless</b> automobile <b>tire,</b> Paul Weeks Litchfield.|$|R
50|$|Second Series Volgas were {{introduced}} in 1959, with a new grille painted the body color or in chrome. Halfway through the 1959 production run (model year 1959½), a vinyl cover {{was added to the}} dash. Added were windscreen washers and <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires.</b> just Before the series concluded, telescopic shocks replaced the lever type. The 1961 Volgas were priced at 5,100 rubles.|$|E
50|$|Some {{off-road}} {{tires are}} designed to be used with low inflation pressure on difficult terrain, reducing their rigidity and allowing the tread to better conform to the terrain. Such a design may allow for use on a wider range of surfaces, but <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires</b> running under rated pressure run the risk of breaking their bead. A beadlock can be used to prevent this.|$|E
50|$|The ComStar wheels {{combine the}} {{flexibility}} of spoked wheels with the strength and tubeless characteristics of one-piece wheels. Honda introduced the Com-Star wheels {{a year or so}} earlier on the CB250T/400T Dream {{as well as on the}} CB750F2 and GL1000 Gold Wing, although these featured standard rims that demanded inner tubes to be used. The CX500 was the first production motorcycle to use <b>tubeless</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|E
