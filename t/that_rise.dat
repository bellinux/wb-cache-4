5|$|During Microsoft's E3 2014 presentation, Rise of the Tomb Raider was {{announced}} as a sequel. At Gamescom 2014, Microsoft announced during its press briefing <b>that</b> <b>Rise</b> of the Tomb Raider would be exclusive to Xbox consoles at launch. The exclusivity is timed, with Square Enix, the game's developer, allowed {{to release the}} title to other platforms after an unspecified period of time. In December 2014, Microsoft announced {{that they would be}} publishing the title for its release on Xbox consoles. Rise of the Tomb Raider was released on 10 November 2015 for Xbox One and Xbox 360, and 28 January 2016 for Microsoft Windows. The PlayStation 4 version was released on 11 October 2016, titled the 20 Year Celebration, as it was released 20 years after the original Tomb Raider game. This version includes all of the previously released DLC.|$|E
5|$|Oviraptorid eggs {{appear to}} have been 17cm (6in) long on average, and the most {{complete}} eggs found with MPC-D107/15 are thought to have been 5to 6cm (2to 2.3in) wide and 14 to 16cm (5to 6in) long when intact. The eggs are nearly identical to some that have previously been found in Mongolia, and have therefore been assigned to the oofamily (egg-taxon family) Elongatoolithidae. The eggshells are relatively thin, between 1and 1.2mm (0.03and 0.04in), and their outer surface is covered by ridges and nodes <b>that</b> <b>rise</b> about 0.3mm (0.01in) above the shell. The micro-structure of the eggshells could not be properly studied, as the calcite has been heavily altered and re-crystallized.|$|E

The Black Hills are the location of Black Elk Peak (7,242ft or 2,207m above sea level), the highest point in South Dakota and also the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Two billion-year-old Precambrian formations, the oldest rocks in the state, form the central core of the Black Hills. Formations from the Paleozoic Era form the outer ring of the Black Hills; these were created between roughly 540 and 250million years ago. This area features rocks such as limestone, which were deposited here when the area formed the shoreline of an ancient inland sea.|$|E

5|$|The Black Hills are in {{the southwestern}} part of South Dakota and extend into Wyoming. This range of low {{mountains}} covers 6,000sq. miles (15,500km2.) with mountains <b>that</b> <b>rise</b> from 2,000 to 4,000feet (600 to 1,200m) above their bases. The highest point in South Dakota, Black Elk Peak (formerly named Harney Peak) is 7,242ft or 2,207m above sea level {{and is in the}} Black Hills. This is the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Other Black Hills mountains that are over 7,000ft (2,133m) in elevation include Bear Mountain, Crooks Tower, Terry Peak, and Crows Nest Peak. The Black Hills are rich in minerals such as gold, silver, copper, and lead. The Homestake Mine, the largest and deepest gold mine in North America, was located in the Black Hills and produced over $1billion in gold since it started operation in 1876. The mine is now a scientific laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The two tallest {{buildings}} of the Dayton skyline are the Kettering Tower at 408ft (124m) and the KeyBank Tower at 385ft (117m). Kettering Tower was originally Winters Tower, the headquarters of Winters Bank, and the building was renamed when Winters merged with BankOne. KeyBank Tower was {{formerly known as the}} MeadWestvaco Tower before KeyBank gained naming rights to the building in 2008. Dayton is the site of five skyscrapers <b>that</b> <b>rise</b> at least 328ft (100m) in height. The most recently completed high-rise in the city is the Miami Valley Hospital Southeast Tower, which was constructed in 2010 and rises 246feet (75m).|$|E
5|$|Thoratic scutes on struthiosaurines are oval to {{teardrop}} shaped, and possess sharp ridges <b>that</b> <b>rise</b> distally. Some scutes {{were long}} and had small domes on them. The first primary osteoderms on the pelvis are large, compressed from the sides, and have a sharp, short point. S. sp. was preserved with five fragmentary scutes from the pelvis. One fragment includes two small scutes with a ridge down the middle, joining the two together, and a compressed osteoderm with a small spike. It is thought that the fragment was {{from the edge of}} the pelvic region. Another fragment includes two oval osteoderms with small ossicles fused between them. Pelvic shields were probably formed on struthiosaurines by these scutes.|$|E

5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers <b>that</b> <b>rise</b> to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one way or another.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce {{magnetic field}}s, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, {{and the amount of}} magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines <b>that</b> <b>rise</b> from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks <b>that</b> <b>rise</b> and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E

5|$|The {{demersal}} zone supports {{many animals}} that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators. The seabed provides {{a range of}} habitats on or {{under the surface of}} the substrate which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. The tidal zone with its periodic exposure to dehydrating air is home to barnacles, molluscs, and crustaceans. The neritic zone has many organisms that need light to flourish. Here, sponges, echinoderms, polychaete worms, sea anemones, and other invertebrates live among algal-encrusted rocks. Corals often contain photosynthetic symbionts and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. The extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the seabed. These provide a diverse habitat for reef dwelling organisms. There is less sea life on the floor of deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around seamounts <b>that</b> <b>rise</b> from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. Close to the seabed live demersal fish that largely feed on pelagic organisms or benthic invertebrates. Exploration of the deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on the seabed that scientists had not previously expected. Some like the detritivores rely on organic material falling to the ocean floor. Others cluster round deep-sea hydrothermal vents where mineral-rich flows of water emerge, supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria and whose consumers include specialized bivalves, sea anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms, and fish. A dead whale sinking {{to the bottom of the}} ocean provides food for an assembly of organisms which similarly rely largely on the actions of sulphur-reducing bacteria. Such places support unique biomes where many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered.|$|E

40|$|China’s {{household}} saving {{rate has}} increased markedly since the mid- 1990 s and the age-savings profile has become U-shaped during the 2000 s.

Using a panel of Chinese households covering the period 1989 - 2006, we document that strong average income growth {{has been accompanied by}} a substantial increase in income uncertainty. Interestingly, the permanent variance of household income remains stable while it is the transitory variance <b>that</b> <b>rises</b> sharply. A calibration of a buffer-stock savings model indicates <b>that</b> <b>rising</b> savings rates among younger households are consistent with rising income uncertainty and higher saving rates among older households are consistent with a decline in the pension replacement ratio for those retiring after 1997. We conclude <b>that</b> <b>rising</b> income uncertainty and pension reforms can account for over half of the increase in the urban household savings rate in China since the mid- 1990 s as well as the U-shaped age-saving profile. ...|$|R
