2500|$|Despite the [...] "loud guffaws" [...] {{among the}} Philadelphia press, Yankees manager Casey Stengel {{endorsed}} {{the hiring of}} Smith, saying:"Mayo will make good. [...] He {{is one of the}} coming young managers in baseball. I watched him closely in my advance camps, and he was the one manager in the Yankee chain who asked questions, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> liked things done this way and not that way. He never intimated that he knew all the answers. [...] He kept notes, and he learned." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Coyote named First Angry {{appeared}} again. [...] He said, [...] "I {{know you}} have been planning great things. [...] I demand <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> {{was not included in}} the planning." [...] First Man and First Woman said nothing. [...] Coyote said, [...] "You believe that I spoiled your living in the lower worlds, but it is not true. Now I will spoil your plans. The path of the sun and the path of the moon will not return to their beginning after 12 months. [...] The twelve months of the sun will be 13 months of the moon. Sometimes frost will come early, and sometimes it will remain late. [...] Sometimes the rains will not come, and you will have to summon the baby of the Big Water Creature to bring water." [...] And he left them.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, you're {{young and}} callow yet. You'll live <b>to</b> <b>know</b> better. <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> shall hear you saying {{a good word}} soon even for such unclean spawn as this," [...] prodding the {{prostrate}} friar with the handle of his paddle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word of honour. On {{the head}} of my child," [...] protested Almayer. [...] "I had to deceive you till now because of Captain Lingard. But I couldn't bear it. Think only what a risk I run in telling you--if ever Lingard was <b>to</b> <b>know!</b> <b>Why</b> should <b>I</b> do it? Pure friendship. Dear Peter was my {{colleague}} in Macassar for years, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My mind is much occupied," [...] he said. [...] "And {{you want}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why!</b> Well, sir, <b>I</b> {{can assure you}} that not only do <b>I</b> not <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> do these things, but I did not even know I did them.

6000|$|... "And now," [...] he continued, [...] "I {{suppose you}} want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> came out here." [...] He easily {{supplied}} {{the lack of}} cordial solicitation on my part.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Anne, [...] "nor next week, nor next, nor next. I {{assure you}} that {{nothing of the sort}} you are {{thinking}} of will be settled any week. I am not going to marry Mr Elliot. <b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> you imagine <b>I</b> am?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{pleasant}} irony in the words, which his guest, preoccupied and keeping to the point, didn't take up.

60|$|But what I {{particularly}} {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> and <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have resolved {{to tell you}} so much while I am afraid it may make you a little uncomfortable without occasion, is this. She is so true and so devoted, and knows so completely that all her love and duty are his for ever, {{that you may be}} certain she will love him, admire him, praise him, and conceal all his faults, until she dies. I believe she conceals them, and always will conceal them, even from herself.|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{memory of}} Scheherazade," [...] said Appleplex, [...] "is {{to me that}} of Bird's custard and prunes in a Bloomsbury {{boarding}} house. It is not my intention to represent Edith as merely disreputable. Neither is she a tragic figure. <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> she misses. <b>I</b> cannot altogether analyse her 'into a combination of known elements' but I fail to touch anything definitely unanalysable.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 October 2008, Leadbitter {{scored a}} memorable goal against Arsenal after just {{coming off the}} bench. The 25-yard goal was celebrated in {{emotional}} style, as he ran over to his manager and had {{his head on the}} floor, nearly in tears. This emotional celebration was because his father, Brian Leadbitter, had died just weeks beforehand and his ashes had been buried right on that spot under the grass on Stadium of Light. [...] "People close <b>to</b> me <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> went down on the floor like I did, I just want to leave it at that. The people who <b>know</b> me <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> kissed that area of the ground. My dad's ashes were buried there. I don't want to go on about it. It just {{means a lot to me}} and my family. It's exactly that spot and it was always my intention to do something like that when I scored my first goal here." [...] Leadbitter said to the press after the match.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Grant, [...] "as I've {{tried to}} tell you, it works out very much like this. It was known that this land was {{specially}} adapted to mixed farming quite a few years ago, but the men who ran their cattle over it never drove a plough. You want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why?</b> Well, <b>I</b> guess it was for much {{the same reason that}} an association of our big manufacturers bought up the patents of an improved process, and for a long while never made an ounce of material under them, or let any one else try. We had to pay more than it was worth for an inferior article that hampered {{some of the most important}} industries in the country, and they piled up the dollars in the old-time way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I suppose I {{shall be}} able to endure life without her. At any rate, we will talk of {{something}} else. Tell me, are you not curious <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> insisted upon bringing you here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|You want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> am {{so fond of}} {{that little}} bit of limestone, no bigger than my hand, which lies upon the shelf; why I ponder over it so often, and show it to all {{sensible}} {{people who come to}} see me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will sit}} down," [...] he said, [...] "I am not well! The sea disagrees with me horribly. Well, well, you want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> came here! I {{can answer that}} {{question}} by another. What are you doing here? Why {{are you going to}} Africa?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{this morning}} I was {{watching}} that tortoise-shell of yours on the houseboat. She was creeping along the roof, behind the flower-boxes, stalking a young thrush that had perched upon a coil of rope. Murder gleamed from her eye, assassination lurked in every twitching muscle of her body. As she crouched to spring, Fate, for once favouring the weak, directed {{her attention to}} myself, and she became, for the first time, aware of my presence. It acted upon her as a heavenly vision upon a Biblical criminal. In an instant she was a changed being. The wicked beast, going about seeking whom it might devour, had vanished. In its place sat a long-tailed, furry angel, gazing {{up into the sky}} with an expression that was one-third innocence and two-thirds admiration of the beauties of nature. What was she doing there, did <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>know?</b> <b>Why,</b> could <b>I</b> not see, playing with a bit of earth. Surely I was not so evil- minded as to imagine she wanted to kill that dear little bird--God bless it.|$|R
5000|$|The rock'n'roll {{spirit is}} not survival. Of course {{the people who}} play rock'n'roll should survive. But {{the essence of the}} rock'n'roll spirit to me, is that it's better to burn out really bright than to sort of decay off into infinity. Even though {{if you look at it}} in a mature way, you'll think, [...] "well, yes ... you should decay off into infinity, and keep going along". Rock'n'roll doesn't look that far ahead. Rock'n'roll is right now. What's {{happening}} right this second. Is it bright? Or is it dim because it's waiting for tomorrow—that's what people want <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> And that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> say that.|$|R
60|$|When I went there, {{early next}} morning, it was Cheplahgan himself who showed me where his nest was. I was hunting along {{the foot of}} the cliff when, glancing back towards the lake, I saw him coming far away, and hid in the underbrush. He passed very near, and following, I saw him {{standing}} on a ledge {{near the top of the}} cliff. Just below him, in the top of a stunted tree growing out of the face of the rock was a huge mass of sticks that formed the nest, with a great mother-eagle standing by, feeding the little ones. Both birds started away silently when I appeared, but came back soon and swept back and forth over me, as I sat watching the nest and the face of the cliff through my glass. No need now of caution. Both birds seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> instinctively <b>why</b> <b>I</b> had come, and that the fate of the eaglets lay in my hands if I could but scale the cliff.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello! I {{wonder what}} Mr. Dickley wants of me," [...] Dave mused, {{as he turned}} the letter over.

60|$|He {{urged me}} to accept more, but I {{did not wish to}} outdo Providence. Then I went to the General's room and asked for the dog back. He was very angry, and wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> had sold him a dog that did not belong to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are mistaken," [...] {{returned}} the other quietly. [...] "I am not {{and never have}} been unkind. All the unkindness and the enmity, open and secret, has been on your side.

And I think it calls for a celebration and a title like Living Legend will embody that whole situation." ...|$|R
50|$|Everyone learns in {{different}} ways and according to Dr. Gong, he learns best by writing books. Dr. Gong does not write because he is knowledgeable about the field, but he writes to become knowledgeable about the field.

50|$|In my own labrang, I have {{recently}} witnessed {{a kind of}} factionalism, and I have discovered that one person in particular was planning an evil conspiracy. This plan was to murder my assistant, Tharchin, and to implicate His Holiness’s government-in-exile with this odious crime. The conspirator aimed to become changzoe manager of my estate. Tharchin has been very kind to me, more so than my own parents, and has taken care of me since I was three years old, as well as managing the affairs of my labrang. With my own ears I heard this person discussing on the telephone a plan to assassinate Tharchin. It is really a matter of great sadness and surprise, especially since the person involved in this ploy has been very close to me as well. If he had succeeded in his plan, {{it would have been}} a cause of great trouble for the labrang, as well as a cause of disgrace to the Tibetan government and His Holiness the Dalai Lama.
