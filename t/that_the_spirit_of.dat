5|$|Extracts of {{the speech}} {{appeared}} in The New Yorker on June 10. Several weeks later, The New York Times printed the whole text, quickly followed by Life magazine and Reader's Digest. Hand's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a folk hero. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect {{of the speech}} was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> liberty must entertain doubt.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} century the neglect continued until some basic external renovation work was undertaken between 1965 and 1971, making the structure {{wind and water}} tight, although it remained unoccupied. The castle was again abandoned and left unmaintained. The condition of the building further declined, becoming derelict. It was in a ruinous state when marketed for sale in April 2013 {{after the death of}} Count Robin Mirrlees, who had owned it for about fifty years. At the end of that year it was purchased by the former model Olga Roh, who said she intended to restore it. Modern day reports suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the 3rd Lord Banff and that of a white dog haunt the castle, which is classified as a category A listed building.|$|E
5|$|Lotus Temple, is a Bahá'í House of Worship {{completed}} in 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, {{it serves as}} the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent {{and has become a}} prominent attraction in the city. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and been featured in hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. Like all other Bahá'í Houses of Worship, is open to all regardless of religion, or any other distinction, as emphasised in Bahá'í texts. The Bahá'í laws emphasise <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the House of Worship be that it is a gathering place where people of all religions may worship God without denominational restrictions. The Bahá'í laws also stipulate that only the holy scriptures of the Bahá'í Faith and other religions can be read or chanted inside in any language; while readings and prayers can be set to music by choirs, no musical instruments can be played inside. Furthermore, no sermons can be delivered, and there can be no ritualistic ceremonies practised.|$|E

5|$|While in Mexico, Cameron began {{performing}} blood rituals in {{the hope}} of communicating with Parsons' spirit; during these, she cut her own wrists. As part of these rituals, she claimed to have received a new magical identity, Hilarion. When she learned that an unidentified flying object had been seen over Washington D.C.'s Capitol Building she considered it a response to Parsons' death. After two months, she returned to California and attempted suicide. Increasingly interested in occultism, she read through her husband's papers. Embracing his Thelemic beliefs, she came to understand his purpose in carrying out the Babalon Working and also came to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> Babalon had been incarnated into herself. She came to believe that Parsons had been murdered by the police or anti-zionists, and continued her attempts at astral projection to commune with his spirit.|$|E

After the cremation, the funeral buildings will be torn down, as they are sombre reminders of a royal death.

Along with Étienne-Louis Boullée and his project for the Cenotaph of Newton, he is considered a precursor to the utopians who would follow.

25|$|The {{victory of}} Nagysalló, brought with itself serious results. It {{opened the way}} towards Komárom, {{bringing}} its relieving to {{just a couple of}} days distance. In the same time it brought the imperials in the situation of being incapable to stretch their troops on a very large front which this Hungarian victory created, so instead of uniting their troops around Pest and Buda, as they planned, Feldzeugmeister Welden had to order the retreat from Pest being in danger to fall in the pincers of the Hungarian troops. When he learned about the defeat in the morning of 20 April, he wrote to Lieutenant General Balthasar Simunich, the commander of the besieging forces of Komárom, and to Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, the Minister-President of the Austrian Empire, that in order to secure Vienna and Pozsony, from a Hungarian attack, he is forced to retreat the imperial troops from Pest, and even from Komárom. He also wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the imperial troops is very low, and because of this they cannot fight another battle for a while, without suffering another defeat. So the next day he ordered the evacuation of Pest, leaving an important garrison in the fortress of Buda, to defend it against the Hungarian attacks. He ordered to Jelačić to remain for a while in Pest, and than to retreat towards Eszék in Bácska where the Serbian insurgents, allied with the Austrians were in a grave situation after the victories of the Hungarian armies led by Mór Perczel and Józef Bem.|$|E

500|$|Another way to {{interpret}} the clause is {{through the lens of}} textualism, that is, giving primary consideration to what the law says rather than to its purpose. Most legal scholars who take this view argue that the Saxbe fix does not address the constitutional problem. Because to textualism believers the language of the rule is an absolute prohibition, law professor and textualist Michael Paulsen has said, a [...] "'fix' can rescind the salary, ... but it cannot repeal historical events. The emoluments of the office had been increased. The rule specified in the text still controls." [...] Most textualists agree <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Ineligibility Clause would be addressed by a Saxbe fix, but they dispute that a clause's [...] "spirit" [...] overrides its text.|$|E
