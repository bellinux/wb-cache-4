Waistcoats are now worn less, so the pocket watch may more likely be stored in a trouser pocket.|$|E

In <b>this</b> <b>use,</b> <b>a</b> saint is therefore not merely a believer, but one who has been transformed by virtue. In Catholicism, a saint is a special sign of God's activity.

50|$|If the {{coefficients}} are real and the polynomial has odd degree, {{then it must}} {{have at least one}} real root. To find <b>this,</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> real value of p0 as the initial guess and make q0 and r0, etc, complex conjugate pairs. Then the iteration will preserve these properties; that is, pn will always be real, and qn and rn, etc, will always be conjugate. In this way, the pn will converge to a real root P. Alternatively, make all of the initial guesses real; they will remain so.|$|E
5000|$|Horse halters are {{sometimes}} confused with a bridle.The primary {{difference between a}} halter and a bridle is that a halter is used by a handler {{on the ground to}} lead or tie up an animal, but a bridle is generally used by a person who is riding or driving an animal that has been trained in <b>this</b> <b>use.</b> <b>A</b> halter is safer than a bridle for tying, as the bit of a bridle may injure the horse's mouth if the horse sets back while tied with a bridle, and in addition, many bridles are made of lighter materials and will break. On the other hand, a bridle offers more precise control.|$|E

5000|$|Celluloid {{was useful}} for {{creating}} cheaper jewellery, jewellery boxes, hair accessories and many items that would earlier have been manufactured from ivory, horn or other expensive animal products. It was {{often referred to}} as [...] "Ivorine" [...] or [...] "French Ivory". For <b>this</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> form of Celluloid was developed in France that had lines that resembled those of Ivory. [...] It was also used for dressing table sets, dolls, picture frames, charms, hat pins, buttons, buckles, stringed instrument parts, accordions, fountain pens, cutlery handles and kitchen items. The main disadvantage the material had was that it was flammable. Items made in celluloid are collectible today and increasingly rare in good condition. It was soon overtaken by Bakelite and Catalin. Table tennis balls are still made from celluloid. [...] "Parker Brothers...made some versions [...] out of hollow Celluloid--which, because of its 'frictionless' properties, spun even faster than steel." ...|$|E
50|$|The Vickers {{was used}} for {{indirect}} fire against enemy positions at ranges up to 4500 yd. This plunging fire was used to great effect against road junctions, trench systems, forming up points, and other locations that might be observed by a forward observer, or zeroed in at one time for future attacks, or guessed at by men using maps and experience. Sometimes a location might be zeroed in during the day, and then attacked at night, much to the surprise and confusion of the enemy. New Zealand units were especially fond of <b>this</b> <b>use.</b> <b>A</b> white disc would be set up on a pole near the MMG, and the gunner would aim at a mark on it, knowing that this corresponded to aiming at the distant target. There was a special back-sight with a tall extension on it for this purpose. The only similar weapon of the time to use indirect fire was the German MG 08, which had a separate attachment sight with range calculator.|$|E

Vitreous OH-doped silica suits well to <b>this</b> <b>use.</b> <b>A</b> parallel plate capacitor is not very suitable when applied in vacuum, since thermalization against a flat substrate introduces stray-capacitance perturbations. Using vapour deposition of gold, we have prepared an inter-digital pattern of electrodes leaving one face of the slab free. Very small surface area of the electrodes minimizes eddycurrent heating. Relaxation effects could be reduced by careful annealing which removed water molecules from the sample surfaces. Some SiO x layers with controlled OH-content were also prepared by plasma deposition (PACVD) ...|$|E

A test bench for chipping wood under reasonably realistic conditions of industrial production is improved by adding an indirect force measurement system with high bandwidth of 3 KHz. The dynamic experimentations give the data needed to compute the curve presenting the vertical component of the cutting force, which is composed of three sections; the first one presents {{the values of the}} impact force; the second one is relatively straight and it refers to shear stress in wood; the third section corresponds to the period between two crosscuts...|$|E
40|$|Interaction {{in written}} {{discourse}} {{can be carried}} out {{in a number of ways}} which are essentially the same as in spoken discourse but which have a different effect because of the medium. This paper gives an overview of the main grammatical systems which can be exploited in interaction, and then examines their use in written texts, focusing particularly on enacted and projected roles. Written advertisements are used to exemplify features of <b>this</b> <b>use.</b> <b>A</b> distinction is drawn between writer and reader on the one hand and writer-in-the-text and reader-in-the-text. It is argued that one function of the interaction is to project a reader-in-the-text with whom the reader is invited to identify, or converge. This is especially evident in advertisements, and has a clearly manipulative purpose there; but other written genres can be viewed as exploiting similar linguistic options for their own purposes, and can be defined partly by their use of these options...|$|E
40|$|Water for {{irrigation}} is a scarce resource in central Arizona. Additional water imported into the Salt River Valley {{would be of}} value to agriculture in that it would replace more expensive water that is now being pumped. It would also {{extend the life of}} irrigated agriculture in the Valley by slowing the rate of decline in the groundwater table. The major field crop organization of central Arizona was determined, and based on these findings, budgets for field crops were developed. These budgets were organized into typical farm operating units of relevant sizes. Water use within these operating units was then developed and from <b>this</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> value for additional irrigation water was determined. The findings indicate that additional surface water is of value to agriculture in two ways. First, it will have an immediate value due to its lower cost, thereby providing for more total net revenue. Secondly, it will be of value in that it will decrease the use of groundwater, thereby slowing the rate of decline in the groundwater table and extending the time when groundwater will be uneconomic to use in agriculture...|$|E
