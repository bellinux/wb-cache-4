40|$|Abstract—The Smith Tube, a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>cylindrical</b> {{extension}} of the Smith Chart, provides a mechanism to simultaneously optimize power amplifier circuit and waveform parameters for radar transmitters. A direct, vector-based search algorithm is presented to find the optimum combination of bandwidth and load impedance for a power amplifier to maximize the waveform bandwidth while meeting requirements on the power-added efficiency and the adjacent-channel power ratio. For this optimization, waveform bandwidth is represented on the vertical axis of the Smith Tube, with the complex load reflection coefficient represented in the horizontal plane. Excellent correspondence is obtained in measurement testing of the algorithm from multiple starting combinations of load reflection coefficient and bandwidth.

Additionally, the phase spaces of the orbits are explored and a numerical analysis is developed to find periodic orbits.

We then consider a system of two fluids rotating at different rates and derive its dispersion relation, which is rather more complicated than that for a single rotating fluid. While a general analytic solution is unattainable, by investigating some special cases we show that the fundamental mode is always stable, and that Kelvin-Helmholtz instability also exists for the system.
