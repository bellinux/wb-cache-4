50|$|This {{process can}} be applied to a {{standard}} racing <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> optimize its power output as well as <b>to</b> a production <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> it into a racing <b>engine,</b> <b>to</b> enhance its power output for daily use or to alter its power output characteristics to suit a particular application.|$|R
50|$|In May 2016, South Korea alleged Nissan used a {{so-called}} defeat device in those Qashqai with diesel <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> off its exhaust reduction system under regular driving temperatures. It fined Nissan {{and ordered a}} recall of models with Euro 6 engines. Nissan denied any wrongdoing.|$|R
50|$|With {{the ships}} being twin screw, the engines were {{fitted with a}} shaft {{coupling}} to the crank shaft at the forward end, allowing the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> end to end to suit either port or starboard side fitting.|$|R
25|$|Bicycles {{can also}} use hybrid systems {{including}} both internal combustion and electric power sources, either in parallel, or in series. The first practical series-hybrid electric/petroleum system used the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> a generator that charged the batteries directly, maintaining or increasing battery charge levels while riding the bicycle.|$|R
5000|$|In the Calling All Engines DVDs Character Gallery, Lady is {{described}} as [...] "a magical engine. When she works along the rails, she spreads gold dust along the rails. Lady {{has been known to}} help Thomas and his friends when there was no other <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> to..." ...|$|R
50|$|The smaller {{sustainer}} {{engines are}} usually not equipped with a throttle, but instead have a cable to open decompression valves in each cylinder <b>to</b> allow the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> freely for starting. Sustainer engines are typically two-stroke two-cylinder air-cooled engines {{in the range of}} 18-30 hp (14-22 kW). They are lighter in weight, and simpler to operate than self-launching powerplants.|$|R
5000|$|Reverting to her {{original}} name, Newport lay idle in the Pacific Reserve Fleet until recommissioned on 27 July 1950 for {{service in the}} Korean War. Lieutenant Commander P.A. Lilly became her recommissioning Commanding Officer. She patrolled off Inchon, Korea, from 15 to 26 September 1950, screening United Nations ships during the Inchon landings. Lilly recalled, [...] "The extreme tides made for extreme currents and rip tides. When I went alongside an anchored tanker, I had <b>to</b> keep <b>engines</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> stay alongside until fully moored. After the troops were safely ashore, we (escort ships) made {{our way back to}} Japan with the newly empty troop ships." ...|$|R
5000|$|During the Movement Phase, {{the player}} can move his ships across the tabletop. Different ships move at {{different}} speeds, and turn at different rates. Smaller escorts (frigates and destroyers) are typically the fastest ships in a fleet. Ships can also {{choose to go}} into [...] "Special Orders" [...] {{at the start of}} the Movement Phase. Special Orders allow ships to move/turn faster, reload their ordnance, or increase the efficiency of their firing, at the cost of being less able to perform other functions later in the turn (or in other turns); for example, if a ship uses a Special Order to increase power <b>to</b> the <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn,</b> the ship's firepower is halved that turn.|$|R
5000|$|A {{propeller}} speed reduction unit is a gearbox or a {{belt and pulley}} device used to reduce the output revolutions per minute (rpm) from the higher input rpm of the powerplant. [...] This allows the use of small displacement internal combustion automotive <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> aircraft propellers within an efficient speed range.|$|R
50|$|In a diesel-hydraulic {{multiple}} unit, {{a hydraulic}} torque converter, {{a type of}} fluid coupling, acts as the transmission medium for the motive power of the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the wheels. Some units feature a hybrid mix of hydraulic and mechanical transmissions, usually reverting to the latter at higher operating speeds as this decreases engine RPM and noise.|$|R
50|$|Bosch {{announced}} in 2007 {{that it is}} supplying hybrid diesel-electric technology to Peugeot for the 308. A prototype 308 equipped with this technology was displayed in the Frankfurt car show '07 and a further 'Prologue' concept car was shown at the 2008 Paris Motor Show featuring a 1.6-litre HDi <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the front wheels and an electric motor to turn the rears.|$|R
5000|$|During its slow {{progress}} across the semi-desert country, where grades were easy and the right-of-way uncluttered, {{it had been}} in the habit of stringing a [...] "Y" [...] out on the prairie <b>to</b> enable its <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> around. Manyberries was no exception, and for years to come marked the end of the line. Indeed, as events were to prove, the line past Etzikom was already over-extended. Trains ran twice a week.|$|R
25|$|LED lamps {{are used}} for {{flashing}} beacon lights on vehicles such as maintenance trucks. Previously, traditional light sources required the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> continue running {{to ensure that the}} battery would not become depleted if the lights were to be used {{for more than a few}} hours. The energy-efficient nature of the LED source allows the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> remain <b>turned</b> off but the light to continue to flash.|$|R
5000|$|Human {{habitation}} of {{the region}} began at least 3,500 years ago, but increased rapidly {{with the arrival of}} Europeans about 300 years ago. The great American naturalist, William Bartram, explored the north shore during a trip west in 1777. In 1852 a railroad was constructed to link New Orleans <b>to</b> the north. <b>Engines</b> <b>turned</b> at Pass Manchac. However, the pilings were burned to the water line in the Civil War. [...] The great cypress swamps of the area were heavily logged in the early 20th century; many have not regrown.|$|R
5000|$|Air conditioning. The power {{required}} for the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the compressor decreases the fuel-efficiency, though only when in use. This may be offset by the reduced drag of the vehicle compared with driving with the windows down. The efficiency of AC systems gradually deteriorates due to dirty filters etc.; regular maintenance prevents this. The extra mass of the air conditioning system will cause {{a slight increase in}} fuel consumption.|$|R
5000|$|Smaller {{and older}} {{propeller}} planes {{make use of}} reciprocating engines (or piston <b>engines)</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> a propeller to create thrust. The amount of thrust a propeller creates is determined by its disk area - {{the area in which}} the blades rotate. If the area is too small, efficiency is poor, and if the area is large, the propeller must rotate at a very low speed to avoid going supersonic and creating a lot of noise, and not much thrust. Because of this limitation, propellers are favored for planes which travel at below mach [...]5, while jets are a better choice above that speed. Propeller engines may be quieter than jet engines (though not always) and may cost less to purchase or maintain and so remain common on light general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna 172. Larger modern propeller planes such as the Dash 8 use a jet <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the propeller, primarily because an equivalent piston engine in power output would be much larger and more complex.|$|R
5000|$|As aero engines grew bigger in {{capacity}} (during the interwar period), single-person propeller swinging became physically difficult, {{ground crew}} personnel would join hands and pull {{together as a}} team or use a canvas sock fitted over one propeller blade, the sock having a length of rope attached to the propeller tip end. Note that this is different from the manual [...] "turning over" [...] of radial piston engine, which is done to release oil that has become trapped in the lower cylinders prior to starting, <b>to</b> avoid <b>engine</b> damage. The two appear similar, but while hand starting involves a sharp, strong [...] "yank" [...] on the prop <b>to</b> start the <b>engine,</b> <b>turning</b> over is simply done by turning the prop through a certain set amount.|$|R
5000|$|Distributed {{cogeneration}} sources use steam turbines, natural gas-fired fuel cells, microturbines or reciprocating <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> generators. The hot exhaust is {{then used}} for space or water heating, or to drive an absorptive chiller [...] for cooling such as air-conditioning. In addition to natural gas-based schemes, distributed energy projects can also include other renewable or low carbon fuels including biofuels, biogas, landfill gas, sewage gas, coal bed methane, syngas and associated petroleum gas.|$|R
50|$|A {{belt-driven}} design offers approximately 88% efficiency, which, while {{lower than}} that of a manual transmission, can be offset by lower production cost and by enabling the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> run at its most efficient speed for a range of output speeds. When power is more important than economy, the ratio of the CVT can be changed <b>to</b> allow the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> at the RPM at which it produces greatest power. This is typically higher than the RPM that achieves peak efficiency. In low-mass low-torque applications (such as motor scooters) a belt-driven CVT also offers ease of use and mechanical simplicity.|$|R
50|$|Mild hybrids are {{generally}} internal combustion engines {{equipped with an}} electric machine (one motor/generator in a parallel configuration) allowing the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> off whenever the car is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly. Mild hybrids may employ regenerative brake and some level of power assist to {{the internal combustion engine}} (ICE), but mild hybrids do not have an exclusive electric-only mode of propulsion.|$|R
50|$|As {{the others}} destroy Maki's Yōma {{servants}} with Hyper Cannonball {{to get back}} Shishi-no-Shin & Tsuki-no-Wa's Engine Casts, Go-on Red is overwhelmed by Maki until the Honōshū arrive. However, with Engine-Oh and the other Engines fighting Maki in her monstrous form before being broken down. But Sōsuke manages to grab on to one of Maki's heads, fighting his way <b>to</b> Retsu-Taka's <b>Engine</b> Cast. Once getting the Engine Cast, Maki assumes her true form as the Honōshū risk themselves <b>to</b> form <b>Engine</b> Daishougun with Sōsuke piloting them to destroy Maki and burn her castle to the ground. With the battle over, as Samurai World's denizens return <b>to</b> normal, <b>Engine</b> Daishogun <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> stone much to Sōsuke's dismay. The Go-on teams soon return to their world.|$|R
50|$|The Shoranur Junction-Kochi metre gauge railway line, {{that was}} about 62 mi long, ended at the Ernakulam Terminus Station (Ernakulam Old Railway Station; Station Code: ERG), {{situated}} behind Kerala High Court. Initially, {{there was only one}} track. A circular track was put up nearby <b>to</b> enable the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b> Buses and rickshaws used to come up to the station to pick up the passengers. There was an exclusive saloon for the Maharaja that used to be attached to the train only when the Maharaja travelled. Admission to the royal waiting room was restricted to {{members of the royal family}} and VIPs.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2012, {{service was}} {{extended}} from Pie del Llano northeastwards to Mercado Periférico, adding 2.7 km and six stations. The latter was a temporary terminus, pending {{the opening of}} the next extension, and was not equipped with overhead wires; the trolleybuses switched <b>to</b> their diesel <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> around at Mercado Periférico terminus. This brought the line's length to 13.1 km. [...] Construction continued on the extension from there to a new terminus at {{the upper end of the}} also-under-construction aerial cableway (Line 3), which was to be named Los Conquistadores (but was later renamed Domingo Peña).|$|R
5000|$|Combustion: {{also known}} as power or {{ignition}} This {{is the start of}} the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at T.D.C. (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|Mild hybrids {{like the}} General Motors 2004-07 Parallel Hybrid Truck (PHT) and the Honda Eco-Assist hybrids are {{equipped}} with a three-phase electric motor mounted within the bell-housing between the engine and transmission, allowing the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> off whenever the truck is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly to provide power. Accessories can continue to run on electrical power while the engine is off, and as in other hybrid designs, regenerative braking recaptures energy. The large electric motor spins up the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> operating speeds before injecting fuel.|$|R
50|$|Close-ratio {{transmissions}} {{require a}} compromise, however. To maximize the dynamic {{performance of a}} vehicle, the automotive engineer would choose gear ratios that allow the vehicle to reach its theoretical maximum speed. For the BMW 323i above, that speed might be 130 mph given its 150-horsepower output at 6,000 rpm and aerodynamic and frictional drag at that speed. Thus, the engineer would select the appropriate rear axle ratio that, with the 1.00:1 5th gear ratio of the close-ratio transmission, causes the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> at 6,000 rpm and generate the 150 HP needed at 130 mph.|$|R
5000|$|Commuter trains ran to {{and from}} Kirkwood until 1961. A train turn-table was located near the present Farmers Market for the <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> for the return trip to St. Louis and for the helper engines, which were used to help freight trains manage the [...] "Kirkwood Hill," [...] prior {{to the arrival of}} diesel engines. Though {{originally}} deemed ineligible for such status, the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 5, 1985.|$|R
5000|$|... 1913 There are {{now three}} round trips {{scheduled}} between Whitings and Beach Haven as passenger traffic slowly increases. PRR {{cooperated with the}} TRR and installed a block signal system between Whitings and Beach Haven for the summer months. In winter months the equipment was removed and stored for the next season. The track in Whitings is reconfigured and the wye is eliminated. A turntable is installed to be able <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>engines.</b> Speed limits {{on the line from}} Whitings to Manahawkin are set at 60 MPH to match the PRR's line from Camden.|$|R
50|$|Either an {{electrical}} starter or an air-start system is used <b>to</b> start the <b>engine</b> <b>turning.</b> On large <b>engines,</b> pre-lubrication and slow <b>turning</b> of an <b>engine,</b> {{as well as}} heating, are required to minimise the amount of engine damage during initial start-up and running. Some smaller military diesels can be started with an explosive cartridge, called a Coffman starter, which provides the extra power required to get the machine turning. In the past, Caterpillar and John Deere used a small petrol pony engine in their tractors to start the primary diesel engine. The pony engine heated the diesel to aid in ignition and used a small clutch and transmission to spin up the diesel engine. Even more unusual was an International Harvester design in which the diesel engine had its own carburetor and ignition system, and started on petrol. Once warmed, the operator moved two levers <b>to</b> switch the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> diesel operation, and work could begin. These engines had very complex cylinder heads, with their own petrol combustion chambers, and were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken (especially in letting the <b>engine</b> cool before <b>turning</b> it off).|$|R
5000|$|Most {{commercial}} aircraft and large military transport airplanes usually use {{what is called}} an auxiliary power unit (APU). It is normally a small gas turbine. Thus, {{one could say that}} using such an APU is using a small gas turbine to start a larger one. Low pressure (...) , high volume air from the compressor section of the APU is bled off through a system of pipes <b>to</b> the <b>engines</b> where it is directed into the starting system. This bleed air is directed into a mechanism <b>to</b> start the <b>engine</b> <b>turning</b> and begin pulling in air. The starter is usually an air turbine type, similar to the cartridge starter, but uses the APU's bleed air instead of the burning gases of the propellant cartridge. Most cart starters can also use APU air to turn them. When the rotating speed of the <b>engine</b> is sufficient <b>to</b> pull in enough air to support combustion, fuel is introduced and ignited. Once the engine ignites and reaches idle speed, the bleed air and ignition systems are shut off.|$|R
50|$|Grand Hotel Station, MP 41.4 of the Ulster and Delaware Railroad, {{was located}} in the small {{mountain}} hamlet of Highmount, New York, at the summit between Big Indian and Arkville. A turntable was located here, allowing pusher <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> before descending to Arkville or Big Indian. It served as a stop for the Grand Hotel and the Highmount post office. It was extremely busy {{until the end of}} passenger service on the line, on March 31, 1954. It was left to fall apart, become an eyesore, and was soon demolished.|$|R
50|$|The Hobrecht-Plan was {{detailed}} for street area giving {{only the}} boundary lines for the housing construction. The housing construction business was rather unregulated {{in comparison with}} modern construction rules - there were some basic constraints to allow fire brigades {{to do their work}} by having the maximum height limited to 20 meter and each house must be reachable from the streets via a backyard of at least 5.34 × 5.34 m in size to allow the fire <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b> In effect speculative builders took over with architecture designs that showed densest packed construction to allow the maximum of rooms - the foundation of the Mietskaserne tenement housing estates rings.|$|R
40|$|Game based {{learning}} {{can be seen}} as an interesting approach to learning, but the complexity of today’s videogames demands from developers a robust foundation in a variety of technologies. On the other hand, the educational part of game based learning requires the active participation of field experts. The collaboration between those experts and game developers is always difficult. The project addresses this problem by offering an authoring environment for educational adventure games that does not demand a deep formation in Information and Communication Technologies. The author (an expert in a specific field) only needs to write documents that describe the contents of the videogame following the XML syntax and feed them <b>to</b> the <b>engine.</b> In <b>turn,</b> the <b>engine</b> produces a fully functional game from those documents...|$|R
50|$|The {{color of}} the lamps varies by jurisdiction; typical colors are blue and/or red for police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles; amber for hazards (slow-moving vehicles, wide loads, tow trucks, {{security}} personnel, construction vehicles, etc.); green for volunteer firefighters or for medical personnel, and violet for funerary vehicles. Beacons may be constructed with halogen bulbs {{similar to those used}} in vehicle headlamps, xenon flashtubes, or LEDs. Incandescent and xenon light sources require the vehicle’s <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> continue running to ensure that the battery is not depleted when the lights are used for a prolonged period. The low power consumption of LEDs allows the vehicle's <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> remain <b>turned</b> off while the lights operate nodes.|$|R
50|$|In September 1882 in New York, the Pearl Street Station was {{established}} by Edison to provide electric lighting in the lower Manhattan Island area. The station ran until destroyed by fire in 1890. The station used reciprocating steam <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> direct-current generators. Because of the DC distribution, the service area was small, limited by voltage drop in the feeders. The War of Currents eventually resolved in favor of AC distribution and utilization, although some DC systems persisted {{to the end of}} the 20th century. DC systems with a service radius of a mile (kilometer) or so were necessarily smaller, less efficient of fuel consumption, and more labor-intensive to operate than much larger central AC generating stations.|$|R
