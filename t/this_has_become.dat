Additionally, mineral extraction through mining and {{oil and natural gas}} exploration and recovery are also conducted, though in Sawtooth National Forest <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> less common due to a consensus to protect the natural surroundings. Leases offered to ranchers to allow them to graze cattle and sheep on the forest are common.
