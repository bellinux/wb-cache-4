5|$|In {{his second}} term, Nixon ordered an airlift to {{resupply}} Israeli {{losses in the}} Yom Kippur War, resulting in the restart of <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> and an oil crisis at home. The Nixon administration supported a coup in Chile that ousted the government of Salvador Allende and propelled Augusto Pinochet to power. By late 1973, the Watergate scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support. On August 9, 1974, he resigned {{in the face of}} almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he was issued a pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. In 20 years of retirement, Nixon wrote nine books and undertook many foreign trips, helping to rehabilitate his image into that of elder statesman. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994 and died four days later at the age of 81.|$|E

25|$|By some analysts, {{the process}} has been {{declared}} ineffective. The stalling of <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>Process</b> is having an impact on the Barcelona Process and is hindering progress especially in the first basket. The economic basket can be considered a success, and there have been more projects for the exchange on a cultural level and between the peoples in the riparian states.

Normally it is the EU that is assessing the state of affairs, which leads to the impression that the North is dictating the South what to do.

The Oslo Accords of 1993 between the later assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat had provided that agreement should be reached on all outstanding issues between the Palestinians and Israeli sides – the so-called final status settlement – within five years of the implementation of Palestinian autonomy. However, the interim process put in place under Oslo had fulfilled neither Israeli nor Palestinian expectations.|$|E

25|$|Sharaf was {{appointed}} to the People's Republic of China in 1982, becoming the seventh Egyptian diplomat to assume the post since the establishment of diplomatic relation between the two countries in 1956. He assumed his new position in September 1982, and presented his credentials in Beijing to the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on 22 September 1982. He established a working relationship with Chinese Communist Party leaders, including paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, and Premier and General Secretary of the Communist Party Zhao Ziyang, which successfully resulted in several important bilateral visits including that by Zhao Ziyang to Cairo in December 1982. During this visit many international, regional and bilateral issues were discussed amongst them was <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>Process.</b> His rapport and contacts in both Cairo and Beijing enabled him to arrange for the first visit ever by an Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to the People's Republic of China, in April 1983.|$|E
25|$|After the 1967 war Gunnar Jarring was {{appointed}} by the UN as a special envoy for <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process,</b> leading the Jarring Mission. The talks between Arab countries and Israel resulted in a deadlock. The stalemate led to renewed fears of another war between Arab countries and Israel. Worried that Jordan would be dragged into another war unprepared, Hussein sent Zaid Al-Rifai to Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in December 1972 to inquire. Sadat informed Al-Rifai {{that he had been}} planning a limited incursion in the Sinai that would allow some political manoeuvring. Sadat then invited Al-Rifai and Hussein to a summit on 10September 1973 with him and Hafez Al-Assad, who had become president of Syria. The summit ended with a restoration of ties between Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. Sadat disclosed to Assad and Hussein his intention to initiate military action. Hussein refused Sadat's request to allow the fedayeen's return to Jordan but agreed that in case of a military operation, Jordanian troops would play a limited defensive role in assisting the Syrians in the Golan Heights.|$|E
25|$|Sharaf {{received}} an important visit by the Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense and Military Production Field Marshal Mohamed Abd al-Halim Abu Ghazala in September 1983. As {{a result of}} this visit, and in his capacity as ambassador to China, Sharaf was requested the following year to name and hoist the Egyptian flag on the 1586 Ton Chinese built Jianghu-1 class Type 053 frigate Najim al Zafir (951). This was an unusual request and a rare honor for an Egyptian Diplomat, let alone a civilian. The flag hoisting ceremony took place on 20 July 1984, at the Hudong Shipyard in Shanghai China, and after completing her shakedown cruise in Chinese waters, Al Zafir set sail for Egypt where she was commissioned and entered service with the Egyptian Navy in late October 1984. Sharaf also received in Beijing in 1984, his friend and mentor Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali, later Secretary General of the United Nations, in the latter's capacity as Egypt's then Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. Sharaf would arrange for Ghali to discuss several issues of importance with his Chinese hosts including <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process,</b> Egypt's activities in the Non Aligned Movement, the ongoing Iran–Iraq War, {{as well as a number}} of bilateral issues.|$|E

Ferguson recalls: [...] "Richard was playing the guitar—something from Cat Stevens—one day and I walked up to him and we did 'Wild Thing'. I sang a few lyrics and jumped about like a mad thing. Lo and behold we made a stack of money in ten minutes." [...] The two began performing together and joined with another friend, Robert Piper, to form the Doug Anthony All Stars. They derived their name from Doug Anthony, a former Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. According to Fidler, during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street performers, Ferguson was [...] "a bit of an explosive hippie" [...] while Fidler and Piper were more reserved. Robert Piper left the group in 1985 due to other commitments.
