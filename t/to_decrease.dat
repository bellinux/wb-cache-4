As a conjoint program with Africare, the sorority sought <b>to</b> <b>decrease</b> poverty in African villages. In collaboration with the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH), the sorority built ten schools in South Africa after apartheid ended, and it donated computer technology to the region.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of other methods to reduce {{mosquito}} bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts <b>to</b> <b>decrease</b> mosquito larva by decreasing the availability of open water in which they develop or by adding substances <b>to</b> <b>decrease</b> their development is effective in some locations. Electronic mosquito repellent devices which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, do not have supporting evidence.|$|E

50|$|Orotic acid is an {{intermediate}} product in pyrimidine synthesis pathway, a subsequent product of which {{plays a role}} in conversion between dihydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate. Orotic aciduria is associated with megaloblastic anemia due <b>to</b> <b>decreased</b> pyrimidine synthesis, which leads <b>to</b> <b>decreased</b> nucleotide-lipid cofactors needed for erythrocyte membrane synthesis in the bone marrow.|$|R

50|$|Primary {{hypogonadism}} (indicating {{an intrinsic}} {{problem with the}} testes in males) leads <b>to</b> <b>decreased</b> testosterone synthesis and increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol potentially leading to a gynecomastic appearance. Klinefelter syndrome is a notable example of a disorder that causes hypogonadism, gynecomastia, and has {{a higher risk of}} breast cancer in males (20-50 times higher than males without the disorder). Central hypogonadism (indicating a problem with the brain) leads <b>to</b> <b>decreased</b> production and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) (a stimulatory signal for endogenous steroid hormone synthesis) which leads <b>to</b> <b>decreased</b> production of testosterone and estradiol in the testes.|$|R

5|$|Historically the {{population}} of Manchester began to increase rapidly during the Victorian era, peaking at 766,311 in 1931.

50|$|Inhibition of ACE with ACE inhibitors leads <b>to</b> <b>decreased</b> {{conversion}} of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a vasoconstrictor) {{but also to}} an increase in bradykinin due <b>to</b> <b>decreased</b> degradation.

5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed <b>to</b> <b>decrease</b> each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting <b>to</b> <b>decrease</b> the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E
