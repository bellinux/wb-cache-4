The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US27 was renumbered to Bus. US127 as {{with all of the}} other similar business routes in the state. However, unlike the other new Bus. US127s, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> no connection to US127, its new parent highway. MDOT has retained the business route as an unsigned trunkline designation ever since.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic and Murray met for {{the first}} time since the {{aforementioned}} French Open final in the championship match of the season-concluding ATP World Tour Finals in London in November. Of the five meetings (all in championship matches) that took place between the pair in 2016, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> added significance, as for the first time in tournament history, the two finalists had the chance to become year-end number 1 by winning the title. The stakes were high in Djokovic's case, as a win would have seen him win his fifth consecutive year-end title, and sixth overall (matching the record held by Roger Federer); Murray, on the other hand, was shooting for his first year-end title, having qualified for the championship match for the first time. Ultimately, Murray won in straight sets, ensuring he ended the year ranked world number one, and also becoming the first man other than Djokovic, Federer or Rafael Nadal to finish the year at the top of the rankings since Andy Roddick in 2003.|$|E

Very few 24 BAs were produced, although enthusiasts have suggested that they nevertheless compromised the upmarket image of the more expensive versions.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most viral {{marketing}} campaigns, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> virtually {{nothing to do}} with the film's plot or characters. Instead it focused mainly on the fictional drink Slusho! and the fictional company Tagruato. Puzzle websites containing Lovecraftian elements, such as Ethan Haas Was Right, were originally reported to be connected to the film. On July 9, 2007, producer J. J. Abrams stated that, while a number of websites were being developed to market the film, the only official site that had been found was 1-18-08.com. At the site, which now redirects to the Paramount Pictures home page, a collection of time-coded photos were available to piece together a series of events and interpret their meanings. The pictures could also be flipped over by repeatedly and rapidly moving the mouse side to side. Also, if the page was left open for six minutes, the monster's roar could be heard. Eventually, Cloverfield Movie.com was created. The site provided both a trailer and a number, 33287, which, when texted from a mobile phone, provided a ringtone of the monster's roar and a wallpaper of a decimated Manhattan. This eventually turns out to be a Paramount number (people later received material on Iron Man, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Kung Fu Panda, and The Love Guru).|$|E
500|$|A lot of {{the special}} was more [...] "edgy" [...] and dark than {{what had been done}} {{previously}} on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. A major reason behind this was the peril, danger, and conflict that constructed the plot so heavily. McCracken explains, [...] "When we start a show {{one of the first things}} we think about is tone, is this a goofy one, is it a serious one, whatever it may be we stay true to that tone. <b>This</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way.

500|$|Infinitys {{first week}} {{was a major}} success and was the band's biggest selling week, selling 260,000 copies to debut at No.1 on the US Billboard 200 and inside the top five worldwide. This {{charting}} was first started with lead single [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love", with minor success on the Billboard charts. This success was bolstered by the further-successful second single [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race", which reached No.2 in both the US and UK {{as well as the}} top five in many other countries. On the band's decision to pick the song as a single, Wentz commented [...] "There may be other songs on the record that would be bigger radio hits, but <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> the right message." [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs", the third single, peaked just outside the top 10 at No.11 on the strength of sales and popular radio play, and went on to sell over two million copies in the US. It found its greatest success in Australia where it charted at No.3. In 2007, Fall Out Boy placed at No.9 in the Top Selling Digital Artists chart with 4,423,000 digital tracks sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album itself has sold over two million copies worldwide and subsequently was certified Platinum in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Four {{songs were}} {{released}} as singles from the album's fourteen tracks, of which three charted on the US Billboard Hot 100 and all reaching international charts. Infinity on High was {{spurred on by}} the lead single [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race", which became the highest charting song for band and their first to chart worldwide. Wentz commented on the band's decision to pick [...] "This Ain't a Scene..." [...] as the first single, saying [...] "There may be other songs on the record that would be bigger radio hits, but <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> the right message." [...] It was sent to radio weeks before its digital release in January 2007; upon digital release the track debuted and peaked at number two on the Hot 100 where it stayed at that position for two consecutive weeks, spending nine weeks in the top ten. The single sold 162,000 digital downloads in its opening week, breaking various music industry records and becoming the highest debut of 2007. With this total {{it was the largest}} opening-week tally for a group since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking digital sales in 2003 and set a new record for the highest bow for a band since radio only titles joined the chart in 1998. It also reached number one on the defunct-Pop 100, number one on Billboard Digital Songs and came at number eight on Alternative Songs. Internationally, [...] "This Ain't a Scene..." [...] debuted and peaked inside the top ten of many charts. It reached number one in New Zealand, number two in the UK, number four and Platinum status in Australia, number four on the Canadian Hot 100 and in Ireland, and placed at number nine on the European Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|McEntire's seventy-sixth chart single, [...] "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain", {{released}} in mid-2003, ended her two-year break from recording. In November 2003, her twenty-third studio album, Room to Breathe, marked her first release of new material in four years. Writing for The Boston Globe, Steve Morse found the album's material {{to have a}} variety of musical stylings, saying the track [...] "Love Revival" [...] sounded like Tanya Tucker and calling [...] "If I Had Any Sense at All" [...] "a mournful country ballad". Dan MacIntosh of Country Standard Time gave Room to Breathe a less-received review, reporting that [...] "it ultimately falls short of leaving the listener breathless". He highlighted [...] "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain" [...] for sounding like a Bluegrass-inspired song such as music by Ricky Skaggs or Patty Loveless. The album itself reached a peak of No. 4 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and No.25 on the Billboard 200, staying at the position for only one week. The second single, [...] "Somebody", also recorded by Mark Wills on his [...] "Loving Every Minute" [...] release, became her twenty-second number-one single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and first since [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her" [...] six years previous. This became her thirty-third number-one single overall. It took longer than expected to become a hit, according to McEntire, who said, [...] "Yeah, that had us concerned. The album came out in November and it took 30 weeks for [...] "Somebody" [...] to work its way up the charts. Usually, it's 15 weeks. But <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> a resurgence of life, especially after the video came out. MCA is really kicking butt with it." [...] Its third single, [...] "He Gets That from Me" [...] reached No. 7, followed by the Amy Dalley co-written track [...] "My Sister", which reached No. 16.|$|E
