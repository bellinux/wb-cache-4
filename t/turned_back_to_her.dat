5|$|On 27 July, as the {{squadron}} neared Rochefort, it was spotted by HMS Mars, a Royal Navy ship {{of the line}} stationed off the port to intercept French ships entering or leaving. Signalling {{to the rest of}} the British squadron, Captain Robert Dudley Oliver took Mars in pursuit, chasing the French squadron all through the night and into the next morning, by which time the frigate Rhin had fallen far behind the others. Recognising that Rhin was in danger of being captured, Lamellerie <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> defence with his main squadron but then changed his mind, turning once more and retreating to Rochefort as Oliver took possession of the heavily outgunned Rhin.|$|E
60|$|Jacob {{rose to his}} feet. The girl's look of {{disappointment}} was so ingenuous that he <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Whereupon she <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> arranging, fixing, stitching, {{his nerves}} jumped with anger as the sewing-machine started and stuttered and buzzed.|$|E
6000|$|KATHERINE <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> glass, puts <b>back</b> her hair, and [...] smooths {{her lips}} and eyes. The door from the {{corridor}} is [...] opened, and HELEN's voice says: [...] "Kit! You're not in bed?" ...|$|R
60|$|She was on {{the point}} of <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> boudoir, drawing Lady Ffoulkes by the hand, when {{suddenly}} she caught sight of Sir Andrew, who stood at a little distance from her, {{at the top of the}} stairs.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Flack {{looked at}} her for a moment very hard, in the whites of the eyes; then he replied, <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sister: [...] "Anything YOU like, Miss Francie. With you one subject's as good as another. Can't we sit down? Can't we be comfortable?" [...] he added.|$|R
60|$|When Miss Hacket <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{with the}} {{acceptance}} of the invitation, she thought she might wait just to help Miss Hacket to put in the corn and the sop. Meantime Miss Constance talked to Dolores.|$|E
60|$|Jane Porter {{had risen}} to her feet; as Clayton <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> she {{staggered}} in weakness. He put out his arms to save her from falling, and then drew her close to him--pressing her head against his shoulder, he stooped to kiss her in thanksgiving.|$|E
60|$|As {{she moved}} forward, she was {{suddenly}} conscious {{of the man who}} had been talking to Madame Selarne. He had drawn a little on one side and he was watching the young soldier with a curious intentness. She <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> nephew and touched him on the arm.|$|E
60|$|He said nothing, but got to {{his feet}} and walked slowly to the door, where he stood looking out again. I felt for him, I would have gone to him then {{had it not been for}} the sense in me that Helene did not wish it. As for Helene, she sat waiting for him <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and at length he did.|$|R
50|$|The plot of The Monster is {{an exact}} {{inversion}} {{of one of}} Méliès's major earlier films, The Vanishing Lady. In the earlier film, a living woman becomes a skeleton before <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> living form; in the later film, a skeleton temporarily becomes a living woman. Both films are examples of the memento mori theme in art. The Monster is also reminiscent of horror films, but was made before horror was established as a film genre.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what is worse," [...] said he, <b>turning</b> his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> suddenly, and writhing in his chair, [...] "you {{have made}} a rogue of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... said old Mrs. Possum, {{grinning}} in {{the most}} aggravating way as she <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> babies. She had found out {{what she wanted to}} know--Sammy Jay had seen nothing of Unc' Billy Possum. Old Mrs. Possum sat down with her head in her hands. She was more worried than ever.|$|E
60|$|She came in very quietly, {{and stood}} still, {{as if she}} did not want to {{interrupt}} Graham's eloquence.... But his doubts and questionings fled before her presence. He remembered the things that he had meant to say. He faced the cameras again and the light about him grew brighter. He <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Her face {{must have}} shown that she was {{conscious}} {{that he was still}} holding her hand, for he suddenly released it. With a heightened color and a half girlish naivete, that was the more charming for its contrast with her tall figure and air of thoroughbred repose, she <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chair, and lightly motioned him to take the one before her. [...] "I am here on BUSINESS; otherwise I should not have dared to look in upon you at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could forget}} what I have been!" [...] muttered David, <b>turning</b> his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and kicking a log that had {{rolled out of}} place.|$|R
50|$|Hanna: Born in 1910, she is {{a sickly}} girl {{who seems to be}} resented by her own mother. As a result, she tragically dies in the {{accident}} that held on the Little Baroness. She is the antagonist in the game wherein she is physically transformed as a creature with only a head and tentacles. After she is defeated, she <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> original form and is saved by Eric before she departs along with the Little Baroness in the good ending.|$|R
60|$|I had <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> bear <b>her</b> company, and we {{were now}} come near {{the head of the}} brae above Dean village. At this word I stepped in front of her like one {{suddenly}} distracted.|$|R
60|$|Tranquillity {{she found}} when she stayed {{late in the}} deserted office. Here no Schwirtz could reach her. Here her toil counted for {{something}} in the world's work--in the making of suburban homes {{for men and women}} and children. She sighed, and her breast felt barren, as she thought of the children. But tranquillity there was, and a brilliant beauty of the city as across dark spaces of evening were strung the jewels of light, as in small, French restaurants sounded desirous violins. On warm evenings of autumn Una would lean out of the window and be absorbed in the afterglow above the North River: smoke-clouds from Jersey factories drifting across the long, carmine stain, air sweet and cool, and the yellow-lighted windows of other skyscrapers giving distant companionship. She fancied sometimes that she was watching the afterglow over a far northern lake, among the pines; and with a sigh more of content than of restlessness she <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> work.... Time ceased to exist when she worked alone. Of time and of the office she was manager. What if she didn't go out to dinner till eight? She could dine whenever she wanted to. If a clumsy man called Eddie Schwirtz got hungry he could get his own dinner. What if she did work slowly? There were no telephone messages, no Mr. Truax to annoy her. She could be leisurely and do the work as it should be done.... She was no longer afraid of the rustling silence about her, as Una Golden had been at Troy Wilkins's. She was a woman now, and trained to fill the blank spaces of the deserted office with her own colored thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was just}} of her brute {{of a mother}} that {{the manner of the}} {{question}} in a remarkable degree reminded her: it had the free flight of one of Ida's fine bridgings of space. With the sense of this was kindled for Maisie at the same time an inspiration. [...] "Oh yes, I know everything!" [...] and she became so radiant that her father, seeing it in the mirror, <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and presently, on the sofa, had her at his knee again and was again particularly affecting. Maisie's inspiration instructed her, pressingly, that the more she should be able to say about mamma the less she would be called upon to speak of her step-parents. She kept hoping the Countess would come in before her power to protect them was exhausted; and it was now, in closer quarters with her companion, that the idea {{at the back of her}} head shifted its place to her lips. She told him she had met her mother in the Park with a gentleman who, while Sir Claude had strolled with her ladyship, had been kind and had sat and talked to her; narrating the scene with a remembrance of her pledge of secrecy to the Captain quite brushed away by the joy of seeing Beale listen without profane interruption. It was almost an amazement, but it was indeed all a joy, thus to be able to guess that papa was at last quite tired of his anger--of his anger at any rate about mamma. He was only bored with her now. That made it, however, the more imperative that his spent displeasure shouldn't be blown out again. It charmed the child to see how much she could interest him; and the charm remained even when, after asking her a dozen questions, he observed musingly and a little obscurely: [...] "Yes, damned if she won't!" [...] For in this too there was a detachment, a wise weariness that made her feel safe. She had had to mention Sir Claude, though she mentioned him as little as possible and Beale only appeared to look quite over his head. It pieced itself together for her that this was the mildness of general indifference, a source of profit so great for herself personally that if the Countess was the author of it she was prepared literally to hug the Countess. She betrayed that eagerness by a restless question about her, to which her father replied: [...] "Oh she has a head on her shoulders. I'll back her to get out of anything!" [...] He looked at Maisie quite as if he could trace the connexion between her enquiry and the impatience of her gratitude. [...] "Do you mean to say you'd really come with me?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} took his {{reluctant}} departure. Jane crossed the hall, entered her own little sanctum, drew the lamp {{to the edge}} of the table and sank into her easy-chair with a little sigh of relief. All the rest of her correspondence she threw to one side. The orange-coloured wrappers she tore off, one by one. As she read, her face softened and her eyes grew very bright. The first cutting was a report of Tallente's last speech in the House, a clever and forceful attack upon the Government's policy of compromise in the matter of recent strikes. The next was a speech at the Holborn Town Hall, on workmen's dwellings, another a thoughtful appreciation of him from the pages of a great review. There was also a eulogy from an American journal and a gloomy attack upon him in the chief Whig organ. When she had finished the pile, she sat for some time gazing at the burning logs. The little epitome of his daily life--there were records there even of many of his social engagements-seemed to carry her into another atmosphere, an atmosphere far removed from this lonely spot upon the moors. She seemed to catch from those printed lines some faint, reflective thrill of the more vital world of strife in which he was living. For a moment the roar of London was in her ears. She saw the lighted thoroughfares, the crowded pavements, the faces of the men and women, all a little strained and eager, so different from the placid immobility of the world in which she lived. She rose to her feet and moved restlessly about the room. Presently she lifted the curtain and looked out. There was a pause in the storm and a great mass of black clouds had just been driven past the face of the watery moon. Even the wind seemed to be holding its breath, but so far as she could see, moors and hillsides were wrapped in one unending mantle of snow. There was no visible sign of any human habitation, no sound from any of the birds or animals who were cowering in their shelters, not even a sheep hell or the barking of a dog to break the profound silence. She dropped the curtain and <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chair. Her feet were leaden and her heart was heavy. The struggle of the day was at an end. Memory was asserting itself. She felt the flush in her cheek, the quickening heat of her heart, the thrill of her pulses as she lived again through those few wild minutes. There was no longer any escape from the wild, confusing truth. The thing which she had dreaded had come.|$|E
60|$|When she limped {{out into}} the kitchen, Judith looked up with a hard face. A flame of sullen anger glowed in her dark eyes, and {{she went into the}} sitting-room and shut the door, as if by that act she were {{shutting}} her sister for evermore out of her heart and life. Salome, strung up to the last pitch of nervous tension, felt intuitively the significance of that closed door. For a moment she wavered--oh, she could not go against Judith! She was all but <b>turning</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> room when Lionel Hezekiah came running in, and paused <b>to</b> look at <b>her</b> admiringly.|$|R
60|$|And she glided stealthily {{as a cat}} {{toward the}} hammock, while her cowardly {{companion}} stood shivering {{at the other end}} of the cabin, and <b>turned</b> his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> that he might not see the deed.|$|R
60|$|Margaret <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{inspection}} of the pond and its inmates, grasping the iron railing {{in front of her}} and gazing down into the waters, so that he could not see her face.|$|R
50|$|She had {{two other}} marriages, to Lee Stricker and Timothy Stricker {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s. When her husband Timothy went to prison in 1995 she <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> art and {{made a name for}} herself in Charleston, Illinois.|$|E
50|$|Talbot {{came from}} a family active in the British Labour Party where {{politics}} was actively discussed and engaged in. At 16 she finished her secondary schooling and attended the Royal College of Music in London, specialising in the cello. She spent the next 15 years working as a musician, however she said her life always <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> interest in politics.|$|E

50|$|The red-breasted nuthatch, {{like all}} nuthatches, is monogamous. The male courts the female with a {{peculiar}} display, lifting {{his head and}} tail while <b>turning</b> his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> drooping his wings, and swaying from side to side.|$|R
50|$|On May 10, 2017, DeVos gave a {{commencement}} {{speech at}} Bethune-Cookman University, a historically black college, and during her speech {{a majority of}} the students booed DeVos, with about half of them standing up and <b>turning</b> their <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Laws, how odd!" [...] said Augusta. [...] "Always carried {{about by}} four men! I'm sure I shouldn't like it. Am I right behind, Mamma? I {{feel as if}} I was open;" [...] and she <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> anxious parent.|$|R
50|$|According to the tradition, Wilhelmina of Prussia, wife of {{stadholder}} William V {{was captured}} here on 28 June 1787 by the Patriots from Gouda. In reality, her entourage were arrested at Bonrepas {{on the river}} Vlist, {{on the way to}} Schoonhoven near Haastrecht. Wilhelmina was at a farm overhanging the Goejanverwellesluis, where Cornelis Johan de Lange, commander of the free corps of Gouda, had been billeted. Informed of her plans by the gentleman Martinus van Toulon, former bailiff of Gouda, the Commission of Defense stopped her from driving on to Gouda that night. The princess left the very same evening after 10pm in the direction of Schoonhoven and <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> spouse stadholder William V at Nijmegen. This event formed the main reason for the Prussians' raid into Holland, with Frederick William II of Prussia coming to his sister Wilhelmina's aid and so making possible William's return to the Hague. This raid led to an exodus of the Patriots from the United Republic of the Seven Netherlands in 1787.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{beautiful}} legends of Ngardmau includes [...] "Ngerchokl" [...] water wells. This place called [...] "Ngerchokl" [...] {{was known to be}} the water of youth. If a person jumped in the water well and came up, he or she would look years younger. However, the water well [...] "Ngerchokl" [...] lost its power in later years. A woman who was traveling with her child came upon the water well to drink water but because it was too hot, she decided to jump in not knowing the natural magic of the water. When she came up, she was younger than her age so her child cried heavily because the mother looked so different. The mother tried to console the child but didn't work. The woman eventually jumped again in the water well and she <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> old self again. The curse of this water well began and it has never been the same then. Today, the villagers share this story in many occasions with laughter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between Eva and Angelos {{is described by}} Takis Dimopoulos, a very close friend of Angelos and person that understood his work, in his article titled [...] "The poet and Eva" [...] Dimopoulos, initially deals with their relationship as secretly prepared for long and almost predetermined by fate. Angelos (who, {{at the time he}} met Palmer was in his prime both spiritually and mentally, “a young bull”, a young Dionysus and fabulous Adonis” from the [...] "warm bosom of Mother Earth") and Eva, both urged to mate by the poet’s sister Penelope, are considered as two symbols: [...] "... we have ... the man, whose bowels are burning with desire for the Eternal female ... and the woman who, like a crystal interacts with the [...] "Male Speech" [...] in many levels. .... "Sikelianos, after their acquaintance, travels to Egypt (where he writes his work “Alafroiskiotos" [...] (The Light-Shadowed) and, when he returned to Lefkada, he gets into a relationship with her, which would soon lead to marriage. Eva as the new [...] "Homeric Penelope", due to the waiting for his return, changes her spiritual targeting and recognizes the priority that a loyal attitude and focus on the vision of the great poet has: she becomes the [...] "thirsty receiver" [...] of unrestrained [...] "bacchic" [...] erotic and mystic intoxication, sets aside every obstacle that gets in his way (material or otherwise), guides him and supports him in difficult times (death of Penelope), in a word, she is trying to assure that he will remain undisturbed from anything will could stand in his course. He, in turn, tries to understand the Greek tradition, he knows the [...] "great Mystics" [...] of all cultures and times and is increasingly developing his [...] "innate secretive mood" [...] and the [...] "first image of Mother Nature" [...] in him. This spiritual quest ends with the birth of the Delphic Idea, the new concept for Delphi by Sikelianos. This idea will rush through him in a Dionysian and lyrical way. He wants to change the Present (a political act - in the broader meaning of the term) with “the Love for the Other person” as the means. Eva plays a very important role in this quest and essentially manages to become a “true Greek Bacchant”, she deals with all the organizational, practical and material aspects of the Festivals, allowing Angelos to be devoted to his vision. Her offer, however, is very important (she composes music for the chorus of the tragedies and sews the dresses for the dancers according to ancient Greek standards). Even with such fatigue and responsibility, things are going well and the Festivals (both) are successful. However, the money needed for the conduct of the Delphic Festivals were many and there is need for new resources, so Eva is obliged to return home. Her efforts to find financial resources and partners were long and fruitless and eventually failed. Angelos, influenced by her absence (which resulted in the cancellation of their wedding in 1934 and their separation), turned to another 'first image’" [...] of the [...] "Mother", trying to divert somewhere else his torrential Dionysian vision which is [...] "affected" [...] by the existential questions that have begun to torture him. This period of [...] "existential" [...] -almost- loneliness ends in 1938, when he met Anna Karamani, his future wife. Eva had become successively Daughter (the [...] "intellectual exercise"), Wife ("fulfilling the Dionysian visions") and Sister, and now had reached the highest stage of this unique development: she became the Mother, who from afar tries to relieve her son of the final course to fulfill the [...] "great longing", while she is alone and mourning. This is Eva’s role now in relation to Angelos, who asks her consent to his marriage with Anna (she [...] "gives her blessings"). Ultimately, she <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> [...] "spiritual home", Greece, only when her Dionysus had returned to his Mother, so that she would stay forever in Delphi.|$|E
60|$|She {{walked to}} the door and stood uneasily {{listening}} in the passage until she heard the clatter of hoofs in the paved patio, and knew that he had ordered his horse. Then she <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> relieved <b>to</b> <b>her</b> room.|$|R
60|$|He <b>turned</b> his <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> then, {{and began}} {{clipping}} away as before. Beth sprang up and {{laid a hand}} upon his arm, arresting him. Again he turned <b>to</b> stare at <b>her,</b> and in his eyes was a look almost of fear.|$|R
