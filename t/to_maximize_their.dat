The tax farmers' profits consisted of additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing or turning a blind eye. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> profits, produced a system of arbitrary exactions regarded quite rightly as barbarously cruel to taxpayers, unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.|$|E
5|$|The Ekaterina II {{class were}} {{a class of}} four battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. They were the first battleships built for the Black Sea Fleet. Their design was highly unusual in having the main guns on three barbettes grouped in a {{triangle}} around a central armored redoubt, two side-by-side forward {{and one on the}} centerline aft. This was intended <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> firepower forward, both when operating in the narrow waters of the Bosphorus and when ramming. Construction was slow because they were the largest warships built until then in the Black Sea and the shipyards had to be upgraded to handle them.|$|E
5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E

Hull plates {{had to be}} removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had to be separated from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the crane barge Wotan. Saturation diving was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on Monitor and proved to be very successful, allowing divers <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> time on the bottom.

Eidos Interactive, whose release of Tomb Raider had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a triangular shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts. The PC version would end up providing the source code for subsequent ports.|$|E

25|$|In microeconomics, {{the utility}} {{maximization}} problem and its dual problem, the expenditure minimization problem, are economic optimization problems.

Also, agents are often modeled as being risk-averse, thereby preferring to avoid risk.

Males generally prefer <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> number of offspring, and therefore their number of mates; females, on the other hand, tend to care more for their offspring and have fewer mates. Because of this, there are generally more males available to mate at a given time, making females a limited resource. This leads males to evolve aggressive mating behaviors which can help them acquire mates.|$|E

25|$|Grafting to {{involves}} the strong adsorption or chemical bonding of a polymer molecule to a surface from solution. This process is typically achieved through a coupling agent that links {{a handle on}} the surface to a reactive group on either of the chain termini. Although simple, this approach suffers from the disadvantage of a relatively low grafting density as a result of steric hindrance from the already-attached polymer coils. After coupling, as in all cases, polymers attempt <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> entropy typically by assuming a brush or mushroom conformation.

25|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> <b>their</b> {{individual}} fitness, {{workers will}} try to reduce the reproduction of other wasps. This is known as worker policing. As previously mentioned, workers will attempt to suppress other workers. Worker policing also plays {{a large role in}} modulating the number of queens per colony. As cyclical oligogyny progresses, new queens will attempt to assert their dominance after the death of the old queens. Any worker could be morphologically able to function as a new queen, but the number of new queens is restricted by workers as they aggressively interact with potential new queens. This suppresses the development of the female’s ovaries, preventing her from becoming queen.|$|E
40|$|Sepsis {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} a systemic inflammatory response to infection potentially leading to acute organ failure and rapid decline to death. Polyclonal intravenous immune globulin, a blood product derived from human donor blood, in addition to antiinfective activities, also exerts a broad antiinflammatory and immunomodulating effect. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been proposed as adjuvant therapy for sepsis even though the clinical studies demonstrating their efficacy and safety are relatively small. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in sepsis have been performed. As a result of heterogeneity across studies and inconsistencies in results, the majority have concluded that more evidence, coming from large, well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs), is required. Moreover the appropriate timing of administration and the identification of specific clinical settings represent a key factor <b>to</b> <b>maximizing</b> <b>their</b> beneficial effect. The authors, in this revision, review the basic mechanisms of action of IVIg, the rationale for their use, and their clinical applications. (C) 2014 European Federation of Internal Medicine.
