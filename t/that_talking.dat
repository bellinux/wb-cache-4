I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism.

For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that fathers generally tend to avoid sexual conversations with their children. Many fathers have uncertainties on how to start to the conversation. Other times they simply put the initiative on their daughters to come to them with questions or issues. Even when the conversation is launched fathers tend to be judgmental or only talk about abstinence. Fathers {{are more likely to}} forbid daughters from having sex when they are talking. Wilson et al. (2010) found that some fathers felt <b>that</b> <b>talking</b> about the potential consequences of sex was easier than talking about sex itself. Fathers overall tend to apply more orders when talking to their daughters than giving them unbiased information or simply listening and trying to give them their best advice.|$|E
25|$|There {{originally}} {{was a brief}} shot in the scene where Bambi's mother dies of her jumping over a log and getting shot by man. Larry Morey, however, felt the scene was too dramatic, {{and that it was}} emotional enough to justify having her death occurring off screen. Walt Disney was also eager to show man burned to death by his fire that he inadvertently started, but this was discarded when it was decided not to show man at all. There was also a scene involving two autumn leaves conversing like an old married couple before parting ways and falling to the ground, but Disney found <b>that</b> <b>talking</b> flora did not work {{in the context of the}} film, and instead a visual metaphor of two realistic leaves falling to the ground was used instead. Disney and his story team also developed the characters consisting of a squirrel and a chipmunk that were to be a comic duo reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy. However, after years of experimentation, Walt felt that the story should focus on the three principal characters: Bambi, Thumper and Flower. The squirrel and chipmunk make only brief appearances in the final film.|$|E

500|$|The fact is, I used to {{get very}} involved, {{six or seven years}} ago, and before that, in {{questions}} of taxonomy of genre, and in the idea—which is ultimately a political idea—that a given writer, perhaps me, could in some objective way alter or reorganize the boundaries between genres.... Nowadays, I've come to feel <b>that</b> <b>talking</b> about categories, about [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", about genre and their boundaries and the blurring of those boundaries, all consists only of an elaborate way to avoid actually discussing what moves and interests me about books—my own, and others'. What I like are books in their homely actuality—the insides of the books, the mysterious movements of characters and situations and the emotions that accompany those movements. The play of sentences, their infinite variety.|$|E
500|$|The Division Bell {{deals with}} themes of {{communication}} and the idea <b>that</b> <b>talking</b> can solve many problems. In the Studio radio host Redbeard suggested that the album offered [...] "the very real possibility of transcending it all, through shivering moments of grace". Songs such as [...] "Poles Apart" [...] and [...] "Lost for Words" [...] have been interpreted as references to the estrangement between Pink Floyd and former band member Roger Waters, who left in 1985; however, Gilmour denied this, and said: [...] "People can invent and relate to a song in their personal ways, but it's a little late at this point {{for us to be}} conjuring Roger up." [...] The title refers to the division bell rung in the British parliament to announce a vote. Drummer Nick Mason said: [...] "It does have some meaning. It's about people making choices, yeas or nays." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1926, Jack L. Warner, head of Warner Bros., {{was quoted}} {{to the effect}} <b>that</b> <b>talking</b> {{pictures}} would never be viable: [...] "They fail {{to take into account}} the international language of the silent pictures, and the unconscious share of each onlooker in creating the play, the action, the plot, and the imagined dialogue for himself." [...] Much to his company's benefit, he would be proven very wrong—between the 1927–28 and 1928–29 fiscal years, Warners' profits surged from $2 million to $14 million. Sound film, in fact, was a clear boon to all the major players in the industry. During that same twelve-month span, Paramount's profits rose by $7 million, Fox's by $3.5 million, and Loew's/MGM's by $3 million. RKO, which hadn't even existed in September 1928 and whose parent production company, FBO, was in the Hollywood minor leagues, by the end of 1929 was established as one of America's leading entertainment businesses. Fueling the boom was the emergence of an important new cinematic genre made possible by sound: the musical. Over sixty Hollywood musicals were released in 1929, and more than eighty the following year.|$|E

500|$|On Good Friday in March 2005, Veitch, Albee and {{six other}} women went to a strip club in Riverside and paid for lap dances. Instead of {{accepting}} the dances, they talked with the strippers, telling {{them that they were}} loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there. One of the lap dancers cried and told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because she had thought that she would be rejected. The woman accepted a prayer from Albee and hugged her. Albee would later say <b>that</b> <b>talking</b> with women at the strip club that first day changed her life. Because the volunteers received more positive responses than they had expected, they decided to continue to evangelize at strip clubs. To organize these activities, Veitch and Albee founded JC's Girls, with [...] "JC" [...] standing for Jesus Christ.

Talking Heads' art pop innovations have had a long-lasting impact. Along with other groups such as Devo, the Ramones and Blondie, they helped define the new wave genre in the United States. Meanwhile, the more worldly popularities like 1980's Remain in Light helped bring African rock to the western world.|$|E
