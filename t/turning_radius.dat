5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual <b>turning</b> <b>radius.</b> Values less than one, where the front wheel side slip {{is greater than the}} rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The vessels handled well and had a tight <b>turning</b> <b>radius,</b> but they suffered from weather helm and tended to drift while underway. The ships' crew numbered ten officers and 191enlisted men, and later increased to eleven officers and 197enlisted men. The ships carried several smaller boats, including two picket boats, one launch, two yawls, and one dinghy. These were handled with a large derrick that was fitted to the main mast.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl was an {{excellent}} sea boat; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate <b>turning</b> <b>radius.</b> She was somewhat unbalanced, however, and a 6degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men. Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.|$|E
50|$|Recreational {{skiing is}} usually done at speeds in range between 5 m/s and 15 m/s with average <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> {{of less than}} 15 m. Accordingly, sidecuts of modern {{recreational}} skis are calculated for <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> of approximately 7 to 15 m.|$|R
50|$|One-circle flow {{will result}} in another merge, unless an angular {{advantage}} can be obtained. During one-circle flow, the fighter with the smaller <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> will have the advantage. Pilots will often pitch-up out-of-plane while increasing thrust, to help minimize <b>turn</b> <b>radius.</b> Because it does not really matter where the two fighters meet in the circle, turn rate is of little importance during one circle flow. Therefore, it is often called a radius fight. An out-of-plane maneuver, such as a displacement roll, is a viable option for reducing <b>turn</b> <b>radius.</b>|$|R

5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The ships were described as good sea-boats, but were prone to heavy pitching. The ships were responsive and had a tight <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> at low speed, but at hard rudder of 12degrees, the ships lost up to 70percent speed. The ships had a crew of 35officers and 708men normally, and when serving as a squadron flagship, they had an additional 13officers and 66men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats aboard, including two picket boats, two launches, a pinnace (later removed), two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> when taxiing. The engine intakes are larger {{than those of the}} first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The {{class had}} greatly {{improved}} handling characteristics over the preceding Nassau class. The Helgolands were much better sea boats {{and did not}} suffer from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did. The ships were responsive to the helm, and had a tight <b>turning</b> <b>radius,</b> and lost only minimal speed during swells. The ships lost up to 54% of their speed at hard rudder, and would heel up to 7°. For comparison, the earlier Nassaus lost up to 70% speed and held a 12° heel with the rudder hard over.|$|E

5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small <b>turning</b> <b>radius.</b> They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E
5|$|Brummer and Bremse were {{fitted with}} masts {{similar to the}} British Arethusa-class cruisers, and {{similarly}} to the British ships, the masts could be lowered and stored on the superstructure deck. Their bow was also modeled on the Arethusa-class ships to further disguise the vessels. The ships had a complement of 16officers and 293enlisted men. They carried several smaller vessels, including one picket boat, one barge, and two dinghies. The German Navy regarded the ships as excellent sea boats, having gentle motion. The ships were highly maneuverable and had a tight <b>turning</b> <b>radius,</b> and only lost slight speed in a head sea. In hard turns, they lost up to sixty percent speed. They were very , however.|$|E
5|$|The German navy {{regarded}} the ships as poor sea boats, with severe rolling, and {{a tendency to}} take on water. The ships had a very small <b>turning</b> <b>radius,</b> however, and were quick to answer commands from the helm. Their standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 enlisted men, and while serving as a division flagship, this could be augmented by an additional seven officers and thirty-four sailors. After their reconstruction in the 1890s, the ships' crews were significantly increased, to 33 officers and 344 enlisted men, and later to 35 officers and 401 enlisted men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one launch, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy.|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{empirical}} {{knowledge about the}} effect of ski geometry, particularly in the context of injury prevention in alpine ski racing. We investigated the effect of sidecut radius on biomechanical variables related to the mechanics of turning. Methods: During a field experiment, six European Cup level athletes skied on three different pairs of giant slalom (GS) skis varying in sidecut radii (30  m, 35  m and 40  m). Using a video-based three-dimensional (3 D) kinematic system, a 22 -point body segment model of the athletes was reconstructed in 3 D, and the variables ground reaction force, centre of mass (COM) speed, COM <b>turn</b> <b>radius,</b> ski <b>turn</b> <b>radius,</b> edge angle, fore/aft position and skid angle were calculated. Results: While steering out of the fall line after gate passage, ground reaction force significantly differed between the 30  m and 40  m skis and between the 35  m and 40  m skis. These differences were mainly explainable by larger COM <b>turn</b> <b>radii</b> when skiing on the 40  m ski. During the same turn phase, significant differences in ski <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> also were found, but there were no differences in edge angle, fore/aft position and skid angle. Summary: The sidecut-induced reduction in ground reaction force and the sidecut-induced increase in centre of mass and ski <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> observed in this study provides indirect evidence of reduced self-steering of the ski.

5|$|Wipeout is {{a racing}} game that {{is set in}} 2052, where players compete in the F3600 anti-gravity racing league. The game allows the player to pilot one of a {{selection}} of craft in races on several different tracks. There are four racing teams to choose from, and two ships for each team. Each ship has its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, mass, and <b>turning</b> <b>radius.</b> By piloting their craft over power-up pads found on the tracks, the player can pick up various weapons and power-ups such as shields, turbo boosts, mines, shock waves, rockets, or missiles. The power-ups allow the player to either protect their craft or disrupt the competitors' craft.|$|E
5|$|The SL79 make up 40 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the newer}} SL95. Following the {{delivery}} of the SL95 low-floor trams in 1999 and 2000, Oslo Sporveier has a pure articulated fleet. The newer series has a greater <b>turning</b> <b>radius,</b> heavier axle load and is two-directional. The radius and axle load of the SL95 {{makes it impossible for}} it to operate around Majorstuen, requiring lines 11, 12 and 19 to use SL79-units. With the 1999-extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line to Rikshospitalet, the tramway received its first terminus without a balloon loop, making it necessary for lines 17 and 18 to be served only by SL95 units. These also serve line 13, since it is a continuation of the service along the Sinsen Line from Majorstuen. The SL79 operate on the Briskeby, Ekeberg, Frogner, Gamleby, Grünerløkka–Torshov, Kjelsås and Vika Lines. Each service has a ten-minute headway, giving a five-minute interval on section that are served by two lines.|$|E
25|$|Its hydro {{mechanical}} transmission helps {{to increase its}} maneuverability by providing different speeds to {{each side of the}} vehicle. This allows the BTR-90 to have a low <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> of 6 m. When turning with only the front four wheels, it has a <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> of 14 m.

Articulated vehicles are an exception – their movement along a circle is possible only at large <b>turning</b> <b>radiuses.</b> It {{can be explained by}} the fact that semitrailers have large wheelbases...|$|R
25|$|Since {{the speed}} {{difference}} {{of the two}} tracks is independent of the gearbox selection, this makes the steering effect less pronounced at higher speeds; this means the tank has a longer <b>turning</b> <b>radius</b> at higher speeds, which is generally what is wanted.

25|$|A {{standard}} indoor {{track is}} designed similarly to an outdoor track, but is only 200 metres {{in length and}} has between four and eight lanes, each with width between 0.90m and 1.10m.

Because of space limitations, meetings held at indoor facilities do not hold many of athletics events typically contested outdoors.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} to this design {{is that the}} brake is not being applied to slow the vehicle, it is simply clutching {{the second set of}} gears in or out. This means it does not dissipate energy, except in the brief period it is being applied or released. Smoother steering can be accomplished by partial application of the brake, but then it begins to dissipate energy like the braked differential. The main disadvantage is {{that there is only one}} <b>turning</b> <b>radius.</b> Like the standard differential solution, these systems are also subject to self-turning when travelling over terrain.|$|E
5000|$|Elan is a Slovenian company, {{located in}} Begunje, notable in ski {{manufacturing}} for inventing shaped skis, also called parabolic skis that made carve turns possible at low speeds and with short <b>turn</b> <b>radius.</b>|$|R
50|$|Different {{types of}} skis have {{different}} sidecuts. Skis with drastic sidecuts {{tend to make}} quicker sharper turns and have a smaller <b>turn</b> <b>radius.</b> For example a world cup slalom ski would have an extremely large tip (probably around 120 mm) a narrow waist (in around 60mm) and a large tail (slightly narrower than the tip). The drastic shape of this ski would allow it to make extremely quick <b>turns</b> (<b>radius</b> between 11m and 14m) without skidding. The disadvantage to a pronounced sidecut is that the ski will be less stable at high speeds, preferring short, quick turns. Also, skis with a drastic sidecut will perform poorly in moguls. Most skis have a moderate amount of sidecut. This allows reasonably fast <b>turns</b> (<b>radius</b> around 17m on most skis) while still maintaining some stability at higher speeds. Another possibility is a very slight sidecut. This is commonly found on giant slalom skis and competition level mogul skis. The straighter sidecut allows skis to make long, fast, highly stable <b>turns</b> (<b>radius</b> around 30m for giant slalom, even more for most mogul skis). In mogul skis, the narrow width, straighter sidecut, and light weight allow the ski to be maneuvered through the tight troughs in the bumps. Jumping skis are very wide and have virtually parallel sides, as the ski jumper is more concerned about maintaining a fast and straight trajectory, and not turning at all.|$|R
5000|$|By {{moving the}} fighter {{more into the}} {{vertical}} plane, the pilot can use gravity to assist the aircraft in turn performance. In vertical or oblique geometric planes, the turn will be much slower over the top, and the <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> will be much smaller. Conversely, the <b>turn</b> <b>radius</b> will be much larger through {{the bottom of the}} turn, but the turn rate will be faster. Displacement rolls make full use of this assistance provided by gravity. By moving the fighter into more of the vertical plane, the pilot can then control the roll rate and yaw to provide a sharp reduction in <b>turn</b> <b>radius,</b> helping the attacker to prevent an overshoot and remain inside of the defender's turn. Such a displacement roll, also called a [...] "rollaway," [...] uses the geometry of three dimensions by performing a half barrel-roll into the inverted position, then performing the second half of a loop with very little roll, keeping the lift vector aligned with the defender as the aircraft reverses direction.|$|R
