40|$|ABSTRACT. Lake Michigan, {{particularly}} the southern basin, {{is subject to}} recurrent episodes of mas-sive sediment resuspension by storm-induced waves and currents. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investi-gate the climatology of these events for Lake Michigan, including an analysis of associated meteorologi-cal conditions. This paper begins by examining turbidity records from two water treatment plants (Chicago, IL and St. Joseph, MI) for which long-term records are available. The turbidity records from the two plants show significant differences indicating that turbidity measurements from a single location would probably not be representative of a basin-wide climatology. A one-dimensional sediment resuspen-sion and deposition model for fine-grained sediments is then developed and calibrated with data from the water treatment plants. The one-dimensional model is applied at 15 points around the southern basin for a 45 -year period for which Lake Michigan wave climatology is available and the results are averaged to obtain a basin-wide <b>turbidity</b> <b>index</b> (Southern Lake Michigan <b>Turbidity</b> <b>Index,</b> SLMTI). A frequency dis-tribution of the <b>turbidity</b> <b>index</b> is presented and meteorological conditions associated with the largest events are examined. Our analysis indicates that significant resuspension events in southern Lake Michi-gan are usually caused by a strong cyclone passing to the east of the lake. The most likely time of the year for this to occur is October to April. There is an average of 1 event per year with SLMTI above 25 mg/L and each event typically lasts about 3 days. Our analysis indicates that events have occurred more frequently since the late 1980 s as the number of winter storms has increased and ice cover has decreased...|$|E

We also monitored changes in the plankton and nekton communities through the eruptive and post-eruptive phases. Decrease of oxygen, acidification, rising temperature and deposition of chemicals in shallow waters resulted in a reduction of epipelagic stocks and a disruption of diel vertical migration (nocturnal ascent) of mesopelagic organisms. Furthermore, decreased light levels at depth caused by extinction in the volcanic plume resulted in a significant shallowing of the deep acoustic scattering layer.

40|$|Abstract [...] Statistical Process Control (SPC) is an {{important}} tool for {{improving the quality of}} a process. It is achieved using statistical methods, and the main tools that SPC uses are the control charts. Traditional SPC control charts are effective tools for improving process quality. A basic assumption in standard applications of control charts is that observations from the process at different times are independent and identically distributed (i. i. d) variables that follow a normal distribution. However, the assumption of independence is often violated for processes in many industries, such as chemical industries. Under this scenario, observations are frequently autocorrelated, and this autocorrelation has a serious impact on the control charts. A typical effect of autocorrelation is the decrease of the in-control average run length (ARL) leading to a higher false alarm rate than that of an independent process. In this study, we deal with autocorrelated data that came from a chemical process (the quality characteristics of water for human consumption).

In situ measurements were carried out in eight measuring stations in two Swedish lakes within 2 days of MERIS overpass. The results suggest that the MERIS CDOM product was not suitable for estimating CDOM in lakes Mälaren and Tämnaren and was not a good proxy for mapping lake DOC and TOC from space. However, a simple green to red band ratio and some other MERIS products like the total absorption coefficient, <b>turbidity</b> <b>index,</b> suspended matter and chlorophyll-a were correlated with different carbon fractions and could potentially be used as proxies to map these lake carbon fractions (CDOM, DOC, TOC, DIC, TIC and pCO 2) from space...|$|E

Among the different <b>turbidity</b> <b>indices,</b> the &# 197;ngstr&# 246;m turbidity coefficient &beta; is frequently used. In this work, we analyse the performance of three methods based on broad-band solar irradiance measurements in the estimation of &beta;. The evaluation of the performance of the models was undertaken by graphical and statistical (root mean square errors and mean bias errors) means. The data sets used in this study comprise measurements of broad-band solar irradiance obtained at eight radiometric stations and aerosol optical thickness measurements obtained at one co-located radiometric station. Since all three methods require estimates of precipitable water content, three common methods for calculating atmospheric precipitable water content from surface air temperature and relative humidity are evaluated. Results show that these methods exhibit significant differences for low values of precipitable water. The effect of these differences in precipitable water estimates on turbidity algorithms is discussed. Differences in hourly turbidity estimates are later examined. The effects of random errors in pyranometer measurements and cloud interferences on the performance of the models are also presented.

As a result of the heat treatment, the size of micelles in skim milk increased due to complex of casein/whey protein formed via covalent bonds, whereas it decreased in distilled water attributed to the change of hydrophobicity in micelles. The size distribution of particles broadened with increasing heating temperature, resulting in the increase in <b>turbidity</b> and polydispersity <b>index</b> of casein micelles both in skim milk and distilled water.

In this respect small reservoirs {{play a critical role}} in sustaining rural livelihoods. However, the management of small reservoirs in Zimbabwe is negatively affected by missing or poorly coordinated information relating to such key attributes as location, capacity, and environmental condition. A study was undertaken to identify and characterise small reservoirs in the Limpopo river basin in Zimbabwe. The objective of the study was to identify small reservoirs and characterise them in terms of capacity, and chlorophyll-a and <b>turbidity</b> <b>indices,</b> as proxies for measuring environmental degradation of catchments in which these are located. The study was carried out in Gwanda district that is located in South West Zimbabwe. Identification was done by processing Landsat TM 4 - 5 images of February-March and April-May 2009, using Geographical Information Systems. Time and cost considerations were the main factors in the selection of the technology and the images that were used. Field inspections were used to validate selected parameters from February to April 2011. A total of 256 small reservoirs, with an estimated total capacity of 17 million m 3, were identified. The capacities of reservoirs were found to vary widely from around 4, 000 m 3 to over 650, 000 m 3. About half (46 %) of the small reservoirs were found to be dry by May, just two months after the end of the wet season. Seven reservoirs, which represented 2 % of the total number and 3 % of the total capacity of reservoirs, were characterised as highly turbid. Twenty-three reservoirs, representing 9 % of the total number and 3 % of the total capacity of reservoirs, showed signs of environmental degradation in the catchments. The smallest reservoirs were found to be most vulnerable to environmental degradation. The study concluded that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can successfully be used to identify and characterise small reservoirs in the data-poor Limpopo basin in Zimbabwe, and can be used by decentralised water institutions and River Basin Organisations (RBOs) to better manage available water resources for the benefit of rural communities found therein. </p...|$|R

As a result, ESA initiated and funded the DUE GlobColour project ([URL] to develop a satellite based ocean colour data set to support global carbon-cycle research. It aims to satisfy the scientific requirement for a long (10 + year) time-series of consistently calibrated global ocean colour information with the best possible spatial coverage. This has been achieved by merging data from the three most capable sensors: SeaWiFS on GeoEye's Orbview- 2 mission, MODIS on NASA's Aqua mission and MERIS on ESA's ENVISAT mission. In setting up the GlobColour project, three user organisations were invited to help. Their roles are to specify the detailed user requirements, act as a channel to the broader end user community and to provide feedback and assessment of the results. The International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project (IOCCP) based at UNESCO in Paris provides direct access to the carbon cycle modelling community's requirements and to the modellers themselves who will use the final products. The UK Met Office's National Centre for Ocean Forecasting (NCOF) in Exeter, UK, provides an understanding of the requirements of oceanography users, and the IOCCG bring their understanding of the global user needs and valuable advice on best practice within the ocean colour science community. The three year project kicked-off in November 2005 under the leadership of ACRI-ST (France). The first year was a feasibility demonstration phase that was successfully concluded at a user consultation workshop organised by the Laboratoire d'Océanographie de Villefranche, France, in December 2006. Error statistics and inter-sensor biases were quantified by comparison with insitu measurements from moored optical buoys and ship based campaigns, and used as an input to the merging. The second year was dedicated to the production of the time series. In total, more than 25 Tb of input (level 2) data have been ingested and 14 Tb of intermediate and output products created, with 4 Tb of data distributed to the user community. Quality control (QC) is provided through the Diagnostic Data Sets (DDS), which are extracted sub-areas covering locations of in-situ data collection or interesting oceanographic phenomena. This Full Product Set (FPS) covers global daily merged ocean colour products in the time period 1997 - 2006 and is also freely available for use by the worldwide science community at [URL] The GlobColour service distributes global daily, 8 -day and monthly data sets at 4. 6 km resolution for, chlorophyll-a concentration, normalised water-leaving radiances (412, 443, 490, 510, 531, 555 and 620 nm, 670, 681 and 709 nm), diffuse attenuation coefficient, coloured dissolved and detrital organic materials, total suspended matter or particulate backscattering coefficient, <b>turbidity</b> <b>index,</b> cloud fraction and quality indicators. Error statistics from the initial sensor characterisation are used as an input to the merging methods and propagate through the merging process to provide error estimates for the output merged products. These error estimates are a key component of GlobColour as they are invaluable to the users; particularly the modellers who need them in order to assimilate the ocean colour data into ocean simulations. An intensive phase of validation has been undertaken to assess the quality of the data set. In addition, inter-comparisons between the different merged datasets will help in further refining the techniques used.

Von Bertalanffy growth models indicated faster growth and a greater maximum total length for yellow bass in Little Grassy Lake. However, growth of fish in Little Grassy Lake nearly ceased after age 4. The Weisberg model indicated differences in individual growth rate between the two lakes that were consistent across years (age effects were significant but growth year effects and the age-growth year interaction were not). Inter-lake differences in fish growth were present up to age 3. Recruitment was relatively stable in Crab Orchard, with year classes up to age 7 observed. Recruitment was more erratic in Little Grassy, with age 5 being the dominant year class and fish up to age 11 present. Differences in growth and recruitment patterns for yellow bass in these two lakes may be attributed to substantial inter-lake differences in <b>turbidity,</b> morphoedaphic <b>index,</b> or yellow bass density. Maximum age of yellow bass (age 11) was higher than previously reported for this species, likely due to the use of otoliths to age fish rather than scales.

We focused on accelerated soil erosion processes in an Italian central Apennine intermountain watershed using modeling techniques implemented in a GIS environment. Our thorough literature review revealed a gap in research on soil erosion processes in such forested, intermountain watersheds. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the soil erosion processes in such landscapes, we proposed an integrated modeling approach applying a RUSLE model and a <b>Turbidity</b> Unit <b>Index.</b> The model outcomes were validated through measurements of lake sediment deposition. Our findings indicate a potential high soil erosion risk. With 1. 33 M t− 1 yr− 1 of annual sediment yield, corresponding to an area-specific sediment yield of 32. 35 t ha− 1 yr− 1, the Turano drainage basin belongs to the Italian basins with the highest sediment discharge. The outcomes of the RUSLE model showed that, despite the diverse forms of forests that cover about 62 % of the drainage basin area, sizable plots of the investigated area are prone to soil erosion. The validation of the model outcomes revealed that the TU Index model performed significantly better than the RUSLE model with regard to sediment yield prediction. Accordingly, we found that even though rill and interrill processes reach very alarming values (RUSLE), they are not the dominant sediment source within the Turano watershed. Other geomorphological processes contributing to the watershed sediment yield – for instance, megarill, gully, bank and channel erosion and re-entrainment of landslide sediments – were very active in the study area. If both models are used in a combined approach, the amount of river load (TU Index) as well as the relative spatial distribution of rill and interrill erosion processes (RUSLE) can be described with sufficient precision.

Results have shown that temperature significantly (P < 0. 05) affects the pH, acidity, non-protein nitrogen (NPN), protein total soluble solids, fat and lactose contents. Significantly (p < 0. 05) higher foaming capacity (FC), foam stability (FS), whey protein nitrogen index (WPNI), and a lower <b>turbidity</b> and solubility <b>index</b> (SI) were observed in whey powder processed at 160 °C compared to whey powder processed at 180 °C. During storage of 180 days, slow but progressive changes were noticed on the physicochemical and functional properties of whey powder. Reverse phase-HPLC analysis revealed a significant (P < 0. 05) effect of temperature on whey protein contents.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{encapsulate}} the steviol glycosides (SGs), derived from Stevia rebaudiana (Bert) Bertoni leaves, by applying a spray-drying method. The purpose was to minimize the bitter aftertaste of the SGs as well as to ameliorate/improve their properties. The encapsulation agents used were maltodextrin (19 DE) and inulin in a ratio of 80 : 20, while three levels of SGs in total solids (1. 5, 2. 5 and 3. 5 %) were studied. The encapsulated SGs products were evaluated for their hygroscopicity, solubility, moisture content and microencapsulation efficiency (MEE %). Also, syrups prepared with encapsulated SGs, at 1 % w/v, were tested for their viscosity, refractive <b>index,</b> <b>turbidity</b> and sensory properties. Significant differences (P < 0. 05)   in MEE %, moisture content, hygroscopicity and solubility values of the encapsulated SGs products were observed depending on the level of SGs in total solids. In particular, the MEE %, the hygroscopicity and the solubility values ranged from 62. 36, 82. 46 to 94. 67 %, 21. 51, 26. 67 and 24. 25 % and 99. 93, 97. 50 to 96. 03 % for encapsulated SGs products produced with 1. 5, 2. 5 and 3. 5 % SGs in total solids, respectively. The encapsulated product produced with 2. 5 % steviol glycosides in total solids presented the most appealing sensory and quality characteristics. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Water {{filtration}} {{units have}} been faced problems in water turbidity removal {{related to their}} media, which is determined by qualitative indices. Moreover, Current qualitative <b>indices</b> such as <b>turbidity</b> and escaping particle number could not precisely determine {{the efficiency of the}} media in water filtration, so defining new indices is essential. In this study, the efficiency of Anthracite-Silica and LECA-Silica media in turbidity removal were compared in different operating condition by using modified qualitative indices. Methods: The pilot consisted of a filter column (one meter depth) which consisted of a layer of LECA (450 mm depth) and a layer of Silica sand (350 mm depth. Turbidities of 10, 20, and 30 NTU, coagulant concentrations of 4, 8, and 12 ppm and filtration rates of 10, 15, and 20 m/h were considered as variables. Results: The LECA-Silica media is suitable media for water filtration. Averages of turbidity removal efficiencies in different condition for the LECA-Silica media were 85. 8 ± 5. 37 percent in stable phase and 69. 75 ± 3. 37 percent in whole operation phase, while the efficiency of total system were 98. 31 ± 0. 63 and 94. 49 ± 2. 97 percent, respectively. Conclusion: The LECA layer efficiency in turbidity removal was independent from filtration rates and due to its low head loss; LECA {{can be used as a}} proper medium for treatment plants. Results also showed that the particle index (PI) was a suitable index as a substitute for <b>turbidity</b> and EPN <b>indices...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} starches with specific characteristics makes {{it important to}} study unconventional starches and their modifications {{in order to meet}} consumer demands. The aim of this work was to study physicochemical characteristics of native starch and phosphate starch of S. lycocarpum. Native starch was phosphated with sodium tripolyphosphate (5 - 11 %) added with stirring. Chemical composition, morphology, density, binding ability to cold water, swelling power and solubility <b>index,</b> <b>turbidity</b> and syneresis, rheological and calorimetric properties were determined. Phosphorus was not detected in the native sample, but the phosphating process produced modified starches with phosphorus contents of 0. 015, 0. 092 and 0. 397 %, with the capacity of absorbing more water, either cold or hot. Rheological data showed the strong influence of phosphorus content on viscosity of phosphate starch, with lower pasting temperature and peak viscosity higher than those of native starch. Enthalpy was negatively correlated with the phosphorus content, requiring 9. 7; 8. 5; 8. 1 and 6. 4 kJ g- 1 of energy for the transition from the amorphous to the crystalline state for the starch granules with phosphorus contents of 0; 0. 015; 0. 092 and 0. 397 %, respectively. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis showed that starches with 0. 015 and 0. 092 % phosphorus have similar characteristics and are different from the others. Our results show that the characteristics of phosphate modified S. lycocarpum starch have optimal conditions {{to meet the demands of}} raw materials, which require greater consistency in stickiness, combined with low rates of retrogradation and syneresis...|$|R
40|$|Land-based sewage {{pollution}} {{is a major}} threat to the health of near-shore coral reefs. Macroalgal delta N- 15 -values are useful indicators for tracking nitrogen sources and sewage input; however, the direct link between delta N- 15 -values of macroalgae and the coral condition, including live coral cover, species richness, and juvenile coral density, is unclear. Macroalgal delta N- 15 -values of two species, Lobophora variegata and Tricleocarpa oblongata, were measured in Wenchang (northeast Hainan Island, South China Sea) in both the dry and wet seasons, to assess the influence of nitrogen sources and nutrient stress resulting from sewage input or upwelling on the condition of corals. Macroalgal delta N- 15 -values showed that shallow stations between the reef and the coast were severely affected by sewage input (e. g., river discharges and aquaculture ponds), whereas deep stations {{on the outside of the}} reef were influenced by upwelling-based nutrients. Correlation and redundancy analysis demonstrated that delta N- 15 -values of L. variegata had a stronger relation with coral condition than any other environmental parameter (e. g., water quality <b>index,</b> <b>turbidity,</b> and dissolved nutrients), with significant negative correlations in both the dry and wet seasons. Thus, macroalgal delta N- 15 -values can be used to determine where nutrient stress is negatively affecting corals, highlighting the links of human activities and coastal upwelling with marine ecosystems.
