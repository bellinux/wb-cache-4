5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> <b>and</b> general population.

Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed in <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> <b>and</b> public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.|$|E

5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new Soviet leader {{proved to}} be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>and</b> the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E
