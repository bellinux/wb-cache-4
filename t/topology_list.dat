40|$|Transmembrane protein coding {{genes are}} {{commonly}} associated with human diseases. We characterized disease causing mutations and natural polymorphisms in transmembrane proteins by mapping missense genetic variations from the UniProt database on the transmembrane protein <b>topology</b> <b>listed</b> in the Human Transmembrane Proteome database. We found characteristic differences in the spectrum of amino acid changes within transmembrane regions: {{in the case of}} disease associated mutations the non-polar to non-polar and non-polar to charged amino acid changes are equally frequent. In contrast, in the case of natural polymorphisms non-polar to charged amino acid changes are rare while non-polar to non-polar changes are common. The majority of disease associated mutations result in glycine to arginine and leucine to proline substitutions. Mutations to positively charged amino acids are more common {{in the center of the}} lipid bilayer, where they cause more severe structural and functional anomalies. Our analysis contributes to the better understanding of the effect of disease associated mutations in transmembrane proteins, which can help prioritize genetic variations in personal genomic investigations...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} for intersection a {{line and}} a convex hull of points cloud is presented. The algorithm doesn't require the convex hull construction. The points cloud can be arbitrary and not sorted, no <b>topology,</b> face <b>list</b> or edge list is known. The algorithm uses only vertices coordinates. Standard transformation of coordinates is performed and the points cloud is bisected by two perpendicular planes. Yielded 1 D points set lies at the line. Bounds of the set are intersection points of the points cloud and the line. The algorithm was compared against the obvious algorithm which uses intersection {{of the line and}} all possible faces (sets of three points). Presented algorithm is much faster than the obvious one. © 2013 R. P. Koptelov and A. M. Konashkova...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{reducing}} the complexity in verification by exploiting modularity at various levels: in specification, in verification, and structurally. For specifications, we use the modular language CSP-OZ-DC, which allows us to decouple verification tasks concerning data from those concerning durations. At the verification level, we exploit modularity in theorem proving for rich data structures and use this for invariant checking. At the structural level, we analyze possibilities for modular verification of systems consisting of various components which interact. We illustrate these ideas by automatically verifying safety properties of a case study from the European Train Control System standard, which extends previous examples by comprising a complex track <b>topology</b> with <b>lists</b> of track segments and trains with different routes.

AL-SAFE is able to filter traffic at two distinct points in the virtual infrastructure and adapt the enforced rulesets based on changes in the virtual infrastructure <b>topology</b> and the <b>list</b> of services running inside the virtual machines.

40|$|We {{consider}} off-line {{versions of}} path provisioning and path protection problems for general circuit switched networks. Both problems {{deal with a}} given network <b>topology</b> and a <b>list</b> of integral demand flows. The objective is to route the flows and to allocate the bandwidth {{in a way that}} minimizes the total amount of bandwidth used for working and protection paths. We consider path-based protection where, in case of a single link failure, all the flows utilizing the failed link can be rerouted to a precomputed set of paths. We demonstrate that flow splitting can bring significant advantages for both provisioning and protection problems. Since the problem is NP-complete, we propose and analyze two simple heuristics. We show that one of these heuristics performs almost as well as the optimal solution...|$|R

The radial distance of each scanning point from the axis of the cylindrical coordinates is measured by laser triangulation. A face array <b>listing</b> (<b>topology),</b> which defines the sampling point connectivity and {{the shape of the}} mesh, is assigned to meet the desired meshing. Topologically stable meshing, and hence, an accurate approximation, free from the shape ambiguity unavoidable in the so-called ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm, is then accomplished.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{computing}} reliable Gaussian and mean curvature sign-map descriptors from the polynomial approximation of surfaces was demonstrated. Such descriptors which are invariant under perspective variation {{are suitable for}} hypothesis generation. A means for determining the pose of constructed geometric forms whose algebraic surface descriptors are nonlinear {{in terms of their}} orienting parameters was developed. This was done by means of linear functions which are capable of approximating nonlinear forms and determining their parameters. It was shown that biquadratic surfaces are suitable companion linear forms for cylindrical approximation and parameter estimation. The estimates provided the initial parametric approximations necessary for a nonlinear regression stage to fine tune the estimates by fitting the actual nonlinear form to the data. A hypothesis-based split-merge algorithm for extraction and pose determination of cylinders and planes which merge smoothly into other surfaces was developed. It was shown that all split-merge algorithms are hypothesis-based. A finite-state algorithm for the extraction of the boundaries of run-length regions was developed. The computation takes advantage of the run <b>list</b> <b>topology</b> and boundary direction constraints implicit in the run-length encoding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Distributed systems, due {{to their}} {{inherent}} complexity and nondeterministic nature, are programmed using high-level abstractions, such as processes, actors, ambients, agents, or services. There {{is a need to}} provide tools which allow developers to better understand, test, and debug distributed systems. OverView is a software toolkit which allows online and offline visualization of distributed systems through the concepts of entities and containers, which preserve the abstractions used at the programming level and display important dynamic properties, such as temporal (that is, when entities are created and deleted), spatial (that is, entity location and migration events) and relational (that is, entity containment or communication patterns). In this paper, we introduce two general layout mechanisms to visualize distributed systems: a hierarchical concentric layout that places containers and entities in a ring of rings, and an organic layout that uses the dynamic properties of the system to co-locate entities. We define visualization quality metrics such as intuitiveness, scalability, and genericity, and use them to evaluate the visualization layouts for several application communication <b>topologies</b> including linked <b>lists,</b> trees, hypercubes, and topologies arising from structured overlay networks such as Chord rings.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Computer Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The {{objective}} in designing a communications network {{is to find}} the most cost efficient network design that specifies hardware devices to be installed, the type of transmission links to be installed, and the routing strategy to be followed. The volume of traffic that will be supported by the network is dependent on the capacity of the hardware devices and the transmission links. Different hardware devices and transmission media will have different capacities and costing structures depending on the choice of vendor. The outputs expected from solving the network design problem are, therefore, the proposed <b>topology</b> with a <b>list</b> of hardware devices and transmission technologies that should be installed at the node and link locations respectively, as well as the proposed routing strategy in order to satisfy all routing restrictions and traffic requirements. In addition to finding the most cost efficient network design, ensuring quality of service, is considered to be another primary {{objective in}} planning communication networks. Two issues pertinent to quality of service are robustness and survivability. The contributions of this thesis are, therefore, towards solving the survivable network design problem by taking into account uncertainty in the traffic requirements for general IP networks. The model under consideration makes provision for a detailed representation of hardware devices typically found in SDH transmission networks, and both dynamic and static routing models are presented, with details on appropriate metric inequalities needed for characterising feasible capacities. Details are provided on separation strategies as well as an iterative approach for obtaining solutions that significantly reduces computing times. In order to maintain tractability a problem reduction approach is suggested based on the theory of domination. Computational results are provided based on data collected from an operational network. From the results it is observed that the suggested approach for solving the survivable network design problem with uncertain traffic requirements successfully reduces computing times.
