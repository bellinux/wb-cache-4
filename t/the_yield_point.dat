25|$|A yield {{strength}} or yield stress is the material property {{defined as the}} stress at which a material begins to deform plastically whereas yield point is the point where nonlinear (elastic + plastic) deformation begins. Prior to <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> the material will deform elastically and will return to its original shape when the applied stress is removed. Once <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> is passed, some fraction of the deformation will be permanent and non-reversible.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> {{determines the}} limits of {{performance}} for mechanical components, since it represents the upper limit to forces {{that can be applied}} without permanent deformation. In structural engineering, this is a soft failure mode which does not normally cause catastrophic failure or ultimate failure unless it accelerates buckling.|$|E
25|$|Maximum Distortion Energy Theory (von Mises yield criterion) – This theory {{proposes that}} the total strain energy can be {{separated}} into two components: the volumetric (hydrostatic) strain energy and the shape (distortion or shear) strain energy.

25|$|Some metals, such as mild steel, {{reach an}} upper <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> before {{dropping}} rapidly {{to a lower}} <b>yield</b> <b>point.</b> <b>The</b> material response is linear up until <b>the</b> upper <b>yield</b> <b>point,</b> but <b>the</b> lower <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> is used in structural engineering as a conservative value.

40|$|Thermoplastic {{vulcanizates}} (TPVs) {{based on}} PP and EPDM (the ratio is 5 : 5) with different crosslinking degrees were prepared using different contents of phenolic resins, and then blended with polyamide 6 (PA 6). The {{results indicated that}} {{with an increase in}} crosslinking degree, the double yielding phenomenon in PA 6 /TPV blends became more distinct, <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> stress of <b>the</b> first <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> and <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> stress difference of <b>the</b> two <b>yield</b> <b>points</b> decreased; however, <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> strain of <b>the</b> first <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> did not change with the increasing crosslinking degree of the TPV, but <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> strain of <b>the</b> second <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> increased, resulting in a more broadened <b>yield</b> region. <b>The</b> SEM results showed that with an increase in the crosslinking degree of TPV, the diameter of TPV increased in the core layer, and the orientation degree of TPV in the skin and subskin layer deceased, accompanying with a decrease of the ratio of length to diameter (L/D) of the droplets. The morphology evolution of the PA 6 /TPV blend during the tensile test was also studied, and the results agreed well with the model we propose...|$|R
25|$|In {{both the}} tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in the bolt and {{resulting}} compression preload in the clamped components {{is essential to the}} joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured torque to the bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand the bolt then turning the nut down, torquing the bolt to <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point,</b> testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components.

25|$|The {{buckling}} {{strength of a}} member {{is less than the}} elastic {{buckling strength}} of a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond the elastic material range and into the non-linear (plastic) material behavior range. When the compression load is near the buckling load, the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point,</b> hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.|$|E

40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{comprehensive}} experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} causes of thermal hardening in FCC Al and BCC Fe at high strain rates, with the aim to shed light on important mechanisms governing deformation and failures in materials subjected to shocks and impacts at very high strain rates. Experimental evidence regarding the temperature dependence of <b>the</b> dynamic <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> of FCC Al and BCC Fe shock loaded at 107 s− 1 is provided. <b>The</b> dynamic <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> of Al increases with temperature in the range 125 K– 795 K; for the same loading and temperate range, <b>the</b> dynamic <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> of BCC Fe remains largely insensitive. A Multiscale Discrete Dislocation Plasticity (MDDP) model of both Fe and Al is developed, leading to good agreement with experiments. The importance of the Peierls barrier in Fe is highlighted, showing it is largely responsible for the temperature insensitivity in BCC metals. The relevance of the mobility of edge components in determining the plastic response of both FCC Al and BCC Fe at different temperatures is discussed, which leads to developing a mechanistic explanation of the underlying mechanisms leading to the experimental behaviour using Dynamic Discrete Dislocation Plasticity (D 3 P). It is shown that the main contributing factor to temperature evolution of <b>the</b> dynamic <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> is not <b>the</b> mobility of dislocations, but the temperature variation of the shear modulus, the decrease of which is correlated to the experimental behaviour observed for both FCC Al and BCC Fe...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a general {{procedure}} to create yield surfaces (both isotropic and anisotropic) for elastic plastic metals with particular reference to sheet metal forming operations. Due to the fact that the forming limit of sheet metals requires a very accurate prediction of <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> limits and their normals, it is desirable to create yield functions that offer independent control of <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> <b>points</b> and <b>the</b> normal to <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> surface at a particular stress state without affecting its global convexity properties and <b>the</b> <b>yield</b> <b>points</b> at other states of stress. We achieve this by creating a class of yield surfaces that are obtained by the intersection of a number of elementary convex surfaces (such as planes and cylinders); the edges and corners that are a result of the intersection are smoothened by a Lp-norm smoothing technique to give rounded corners. <b>The</b> <b>yield</b> surfaces generated by this procedure are centrosymmetric in nature and are thus limited in their applicability. We show that many of <b>the</b> standard <b>yield</b> surfaces can be recast into this form.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{kinetics}} of <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> return {{have been}} studied in two NiAl-based alloys {{as a function of}} aging time at temperatures between 300 and 700 K.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of strain aging {{has been investigated}} in polycrystalline and single crystal NiAl alloys at temperatures between 300 and 1200 K.

Between 700 and 800 K, yield stress plateaus, yield stress transients upon a ten-fold increase in strain rate, work hardening peaks, and dips in the strain rate sensitivity (SRS) have been observed in conventional-purity and carbon-doped polycrystals. In single crystals, similar behavior was observed; in conventional-purity single crystals, however, the strain rate sensitivity became negative resulting in serrated yielding, whereas, the strain rate sensitivity stayed positive in high purity and in molybdenum-doped NiAl. These observations are indicative of dynamic strain aging (DSA) and are discussed in terms of conventional strain aging theories. The impact of these phenomena on the composition-structure-property relations are discerned.
