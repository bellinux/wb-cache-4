Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind <b>them.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E

25|$|Captain Peter Hamilton and First Officer Donald Rowland {{had flown}} on various flights {{together}} before, {{and had an}} ongoing discussion on when to arm the ground spoilers. They both agreed they did not like arming them {{at the beginning of}} the final approach, as specified in the checklist, fearing it could lead to an inadvertent spoiler deployment. The captain preferred arming <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> while the copilot preferred arming them during the landing flare.|$|E

25|$|The battle lasted {{less than}} 45 minutes, but its {{intensity}} led to heavy casualties on both sides. As dawn broke, Harvey ordered the outnumbered British {{to fall back}} into the woods in order to hide their small numbers.

They later watched from a distance as the Americans returned to their camp after daybreak, burned their provisions and tents and retreated toward Forty Mile Creek (present day Grimsby, Ontario). By afternoon on 6 June, the British occupied the former site of the American camp.|$|E
25|$|Allied pilots {{soon found}} that the only {{reliable}} way to destroy the jets, as with the even faster Me 163 Komet rocket fighters, was to attack <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> or during takeoff or landing. Luftwaffe airfields identified as jet bases were frequently bombed by medium bombers, and Allied fighters patrolled over the fields to attack jets trying to land. The Luftwaffe countered by installing extensive flak alleys of anti-aircraft guns along the approach lines to protect the Me 262s from the ground—and by providing top cover during the jets' takeoff and landing with the most advanced Luftwaffe single-engined fighters, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190D and (just becoming available in 1945) Focke-Wulf Ta 152H. Nevertheless, in March–April 1945, Allied fighter patrol patterns over Me 262 airfields resulted in numerous jet losses.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, Saddam {{participated in}} a bloodless coup led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr that overthrew Abdul Rahman Arif. Saddam and Salah Omar al-Ali {{contacted}} Ba'athists {{in the military and}} helped lead <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Arif was given refuge in London and then Istanbul. Al-Bakr was named president and Saddam was named his deputy, and deputy chairman of the Ba'athist Revolutionary Command Council. According to biographers, Saddam never forgot the tensions within the first Ba'athist government, which formed the basis for his measures to promote Ba'ath party unity as well as his resolve to maintain power and programs to ensure social stability. Although Saddam was al-Bakr's deputy, he was a strong behind-the-scenes party politician. Al-Bakr was the older and more prestigious of the two, but by 1969 Saddam clearly had become the moving force behind the party.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September 1955, an Israeli Meteor {{shot down}} an Egyptian de Havilland Vampire, the first jet {{aircraft}} {{to be shot}} down in the theatre. The Meteor {{played a key role}} during the Suez Crisis; on 28 October 1956, an Israeli NF.13 took part in Operation Tarnegol, in which it successfully located and shot down an Egyptian Ilyushin Il-14 that had been carrying several high-ranking Egyptian Military officers {{on the eve of the}} crisis. The operation had intended to shoot down the Il-14 that was supposed to be carrying the supreme commander of the Egyptian armed forces, Abdel Hakim Amer, however a different aircraft had been inadvertently attacked and destroyed instead. After deploying paratroopers east of the Suez Canal, the Israeli Air Force continued to support <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> predominantly using its jet aircraft, fearing its propeller-driven aircraft would be vulnerable against Egypt's own jet fighters.|$|E
25|$|On 3 February the Japanese {{opened a}} series of air attacks on ABDA bases on Java, and the 19th BG was again caught on the ground, losing five of its B-17s in a raid on Singosari, four of <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> On 20 February, just back from a mission to bomb the {{invasion}} force at Bali, seven B-17s of the 19th BG were caught {{on the ground at}} Pasirian Field in southeastern Java by Zero strafers while re-arming and five more were destroyed. Although 38 of the more capable B-17E Flying Fortresses and a dozen LB-30 Liberators incrementally reinforced both heavy bombardment groups of the FEAF, losses were severe and the slow rate of reinforcement was unable to keep pace. Despite dispersal and elaborate camouflage, a lack of antiaircraft artillery and poor warning/communication systems resulted in the loss of 65 FEAF aircraft on the ground alone.|$|E

25|$|Accidents put {{all three}} P-40s based on Mindanao out of {{commission}} by 9 February, leaving just two P-35s that had escaped from Bataan. Transfer of a propeller put a P-40 back in commission two days later, and shipment to Cebu by submarine of parts taken from wrecks on Bataan put another back in operation by mid-March, when a fire destroyed one of <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Three new P-40Es, still in crates, were shipped from Brisbane, Australia, by blockade runner on 22 February but ran aground on 9 March on a reef between Bohol and Leyte. Carefully hidden and moved by barge at night, the crates reached Mindanao on 26 March, where a makeshift air depot had been established in a coconut grove at Buenavista Airfield using mechanics of the 19th Bomb Group and the 440th Ordnance Company. By 2 April, all three P-40s were assembled and flight-tested, making the Mindanao P-40 force {{twice as large as}} that on Bataan.|$|E

He [...] "threw <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and spurned them with his foot". In 1649, Temple became the guardian of the daughter of one Mrs Eyre. He apparently [...] "inveigled" [...] her to marry his son, Alexander. As a result, Temple acquired the deeds to property in Ireland which he subsequently refused to return.

500|$|Following the season, on 31 May 2008, Milan {{vice-president}} Adriano Galliani {{revealed that}} the club would loan Gourcuff to French club Bordeaux for the entire 2008–09 season to allow him more playing time. In 2010, {{in an interview with}} French newspaper L'Equipe, former Milan captain Paolo Maldini stated that Gourcuff lacked discipline while at the club and often distanced himself from the team citing the player's refusal to learn the Italian language. Maldini also stated that Gourcuff did not give his all during his stint at Milan and that the player himself knew it. Gourcuff did not respond to the comments, but his father Christian did, stating to France Football that {{there was some sort of}} conspiracy out there looking to tarnish his son's image. The elder Gourcuff responded to Maldini's charges stating his son [...] "took two hours (of Italian language courses) per day and spoke Italian after two months" [...] and that [...] "he is passionate about tactics" [...] in response to Maldini saying Gourcuff refused to learn Italian and he was limited tactically. Gourcuff was also defended by his club president Jean-Louis Triaud at his former club Bordeaux who stated in response to Maldini's comments [...] "Yoann is not like that. A number ten who does not play with the group is a little weird. This does not correspond at all to what we saw with Yoann at Bordeaux.

Prior to SummerSlam 1994, DiBiase claimed to have added Luger to the group. Luger denied having joined, despite Tatanka claiming that he had evidence that Luger had [...] "sold out" [...] to DiBiase. Luger and Tatanka faced each other at SummerSlam, where {{it was revealed that}} the storyline was a swerve, as Tatanka turned on Luger to join the Million Dollar Corporation. Bigelow and Adam Bomb had also been feuding since the September 10, 1994 episode of Superstars of Wrestling. Bigelow attacked his opponent, a jobber, before the match. DiBiase then claimed that the company was not providing suitable competition, and he challenged any wrestler to face Bigelow. Bomb responded, and the two brawled briefly. Leading up to Survivor Series, Bomb and Bigelow faced each other at several house shows. The Heavenly Bodies were not members of DiBiase's stable, but they competed on behalf of the group. At the time, they were involved in a feud with The Smokin' Gunns {{as a result of a}} match on the September 3 episode of Superstars of Wrestling.
