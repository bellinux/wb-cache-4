40|$|BACKGROUND: Until now, {{it remains}} elusive which {{strategy}} - antithyroid drug withdrawal or increased radioiodine target doses - should be preferred {{to avoid the}} detrimental effect of antithyroid drugs in high- and low-dose radioiodine therapy, respectively. METHODS: We explored the effects of carbimazole on the 1 -year post-radioiodine success and hypothyroidism rates by continuous dose-effect models, whereas success was defined as elimination of hyperthyroidism. Euthyroidism rates with and without carbimazole were calculated by numerical integration of the area between success and hypothyroidism curves. Target dose amplification factors for equal chance of success with and without carbimazole were calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-eight patients were included in this study. Radioiodine target doses between 33 and 839 Gy were applied. Overall, the euthyroidism rates were 16. 5 % and 64. 8 %, while the hypothyroidism rates were 37. 6 % and 14. 8 % in Graves' disease and <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre,</b> respectively. The success rate with simultaneous carbimazole (median dose 15 mg day(- 1); range 2. 5 - 60 mg day(- 1)) was reduced over the entire target dose range in Graves' disease and <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre.</b> The areas between curves for euthyroidism without and with simultaneous carbimazole were 127 and 43 Gy in Graves' disease and 178 and 128 Gy in <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre.</b> The estimated radioiodine target dose amplification factor was 5. 5 for Graves' disease and 3. 0 for <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous carbimazole reduces the euthyroidism rate, the aim of low-dose radioiodine therapy, over the entire target dose range in both Graves' disease and <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre.</b> Therefore, antithyroid drug discontinuation should be preferred in low-dose radioiodine therapy. Conversely, escalation of the target dose should be preferred in high-dose radioiodine therap...|$|E

40|$|A {{patient with}} <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> is {{described}} in whom radioiodine (131 I) therapy paradoxically induced typical Graves' disease. This patient had a goitre with two autonomously functioning nodules suppressing uptake by {{the remainder of the}} gland. Circulating thyroid peroxidase antibody indicated the coexistence of focal lymphocytic thyroiditis. Radioiodine therapy was followed by the development of severe and persistent Graves' hyperthyroidism associated with diffuse 131 I uptake by the gland. A second administration of 131 I produced a further worsening of hyperthyroidism, and the appearance of ophthalmopathy. TSH-receptor antibody and thyroid stimulating antibody were undetectable before 131 I, appeared after the first administration of radioiodine, and showed a further increase after the second dose of 131 I. We suggest that, in a patient genetically susceptible to thyroid autoimmunity, the release of TSH-receptor antigenic components from follicular cells damaged by radioiodine therapy triggered an autoimmune response to the TSH-receptor, thus turning a <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> into Graves' disease...|$|E
40|$|The ageing thyroid is {{associated}} with a number of morphological and functional changes, such as decreased serum T 3 and mean thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, that are to some extent independent of intercurrent non-thyroidal illnesses.

In the elderly, autoimmune hypothyroidism is particularly prevalent, hyperthyroidism is mainly characterized by cardiovascular symptoms and is frequently due to <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitres,</b> and differentiated thyroid carcinoma is more aggressive.

40|$|AIMS: To analyse the {{benefits}} and limitations of fine needle aspiration in the cytological differentiation of parenchymatous <b>nodular</b> <b>goitres</b> from follicular tumours in an endemic area. METHODS: Cytological smears of fine needle aspirates from 31 parenchymatous <b>nodular</b> <b>goitres</b> were studied. A sample from the punctured nodules was fixed in formalin and stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis. RESULTS: All nodules occurred in a multinodular gland, were well circumscribed, did not compress surrounding thyroid tissue, {{and for the most}} part, were unencapsulated. Two cases showed cytological features of <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre,</b> two of colloid cysts; the remaining 27 were cytologically indistinguishable from follicular lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the parenchymatous nodules studied had features suggestive of follicular lesions or neoplasia, but surgical treatment should only be considered after hormone treatment has proved unsuccessful, and when they are not suspected as malignant clinically. Fine needle aspiration is useful as a diagnostic and screening aid, but the results should be interpreted with caution to prevent unnecessary surgery...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:The interferon-gamma-inducible {{chemokine}} CXCL 10 {{is highly}} expressed in infiltrating inflammatory cells, and in thyrocytes {{in patients with}} Graves' disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure serum levels of CXCL 10 in relation to thyroid function and treatment. METHODS:Serum levels of CXCL 10 were measured in 22 patients with Graves' disease when hyperthyroid, when euthyroid under methimazole therapy, and 3 days after near-total thyroidectomy. They were compared with levels in three groups of age- and sex-matched controls: 44 subjects with no thyroid disorder, 44 patients with euthyroid autoimmune thyroiditis and 20 with <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre.</b> RESULTS:Basal serum levels of CXCL 10 in patients with Graves' disease were higher than levels in patients with <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> or no thyroid disorder, and similar to levels in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (mean(s. d.) 167 (121), 100 (24), 78 (46) and 142 (107) pg/ml respectively; P < 0. 010). Among patients with Graves' disease, serum levels of CXCL 10 were significantly higher in those aged over 50 years (P = 0. 010), with a hypoechoic pattern at thyroid ultrasonography (P < 0. 001) or with hypervascularity (P = 0. 001). CXCL 10 levels in patients with Graves' disease decreased significantly when euthyroidism was achieved by methimazole therapy (P < 0. 010), and a further decrease was observed after thyroidectomy (P < 0. 010). CONCLUSION:Serum levels of CXCL 10 are higher in newly diagnosed hyperthyroid patients with Graves' disease than in those with <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre,</b> and decrease when euthyroidism is achieved with antithyroid therapy. This high level may be related to the active inflammatory phase of Graves' disease. A further reduction of CXCL 10 levels after thyroidectomy indicates that it is produced mainly in the thyroid in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{prevalence}} of {{mitral valve prolapse}} was investigated in 126 patients with hyper-thyroidism due to Graves ' disease or <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> and that of hyperthyroidism in 64 patients with mitral valve prolapse.

Argyrophilic nucleolar organising region associated proteins (AgNORs) are synthesized from secondary constriction of acrocentric chromosome {{interested in a}} variety of diseases including thyroid disorders. Our aim was the comparison of the AgNOR count and AgNOR surface area/total nuclear surface area (NORa/TNa) proportions to different sex and age in cases with cystic <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre.</b> Materials and Methods: Twenty female (age range 26 - 78) and male (age range 26 - 79) whose fine needle aspiration (FNA) materials were compatible with cystic <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> were included in the study. Those biopsy materials were stained for AgNOR detection according to a specific protocol. 100 nuclei per individual have been evaluated, and both AgNOR count and NORa/TNa values of individual cells were detected for each group. Results: Female patients with cystic <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> had not significantly (p= 0. 131) higher AgNOR count (2. 05 ± 0. 46 %) and NORa/TNa (6. 53 ± 1. 21 %) than in males (2. 35 ± 0. 66 % and 7. 03 ± 1. 12 %) (p= 0. 211), respectively.

40|$|The use of radioiodine- 131 for the {{treatment}} of hyperthyroidism is a very simple and cheap form of therapy and highly effective and is now the predominant definitive therapy both as primary treatment and following relapse after anti thyroid drugs. This study was carried out in Khulna medical college from January 2002 to January 2003 to assess the degree of effectiveness of radioiodine therapy in case of hyperthyroidism. This was a prospective study of 50 patients with hyperthyroidism (28 female, 22 male, mean age 39. 87 years) treated with radioiodine- 131 and followed up for a period of one year. The dose of radioiodine- 131 ranged from 7 - 10 mci.

40|$|A high {{prevalence}} of antibodies to double-stranded DNA (AbDNAds) has been recently reported in serum {{of patients with}} autoimmune thyroid disorders, but the specificity of this finding has been questioned. For this reason, the {{prevalence of}} several antibodies to DNA-related nuclear antigens (AbDRENA) has been evaluated in sera of patients with autoimmune and non-autoimmune thyroid disease. The study group included: 46 Graves' disease patients, 28 Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients, 25 patients with <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> and 11 with non-toxic nodular goitre. Twenty-eight Graves' patients were retested during methimazole (MMI) therapy, and 5 after radioiodine administration. Twenty-two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and 28 normal subjects served as positive and negative controls, respectively. AbDRENA included: AbDNAds by RIA or immunofluorescence (IF); antibodies to single-stranded DNA (AbDNAss) and antibodies to histone (AbHist) by ELISA methods; antibodies to nuclear antigens (ANA) by immunofluorescence. RIA values {{were considered to be}} abnormal when 2 SD above the mean of normal controls. In our study 13 % of Graves' patients were positive for AbDNAds by RIA: all of them had negative tests by IF; 11 % were positive for AbDNAss, 2 % for AbHist and 7 % for ANA. A comparable prevalence of positive results for AbDNAds by RIA, with negative IF tests, was found in Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients. No significant changes of antibody levels were observed in Graves' patients during MMI treatment or after radioiodine administration. A positivity for AbDNAds or AbDNAss was found in 8 % of patients with <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre,</b> but in none of those with non-toxic goitre. All patients with systemic lupus erythematosus had positive tests for AbDNAds by both RIA and IF. In conclusion, {{the results of the present}} study indicate that: (i) the prevalence of anti-DNA antibodies is low and does not differ in the different groups of thyroid patients, irrespective of the presence of thyroid autoimmunity and/or thyroid hyperfunction; and (ii) different techniques (e. g.

40|$|BACKGROUND Multinodular <b>goitre</b> or <b>nodular</b> {{hyperplasia}} or adenomatoid goitre is {{the most}} common thyroid disease, which occurs due to deficient iodine intake. Initial hyperthyroid states, followed by follicular atrophy and secondary changes like haemorrhage, calcification and cystic degeneration occurs in most of the cases. Longstanding cases of <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> can be associated with carcinomas, usually follicular carcinomas, and rarely papillary carcinomas. [1] This study was done to know the incidence of coexisting malignancies, follicular and papillary carcinomas of thyroid, in longstanding <b>nodular</b> <b>goitres</b> of thyroid. METHODS All the cases of <b>nodular</b> <b>goitres</b> examined {{in the last two years}} were studied, including the thyroidectomy specimens and FNAC slides whichever was done. Extensive grossing of the thyroidectomy specimens was done to detect the possibility of malignancy in longstanding cases of <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> of thyroid. Review of FNAC slides was done in cases where cytodiagnosis of coexisting malignancy was missed and detected in histopathological examination. RESULTS In the present study, conducted over a two-year period, out of 50 cases of thyroidectomy specimens of multinodular goitres studied, six cases were diagnosed to be having coexisting malignancy of thyroid, of which four were follicular carcinomas of thyroid and two were papillary carcinomas of thyroid. FNAC diagnosis of coexisting malignancy was initially missed in FNAC in two cases, i. e. one case each of follicular carcinoma and papillary carcinoma. These FNAC slides were reviewed and the foci of malignancies detected. CONCLUSION There is a possibility of malignancy of thyroid coexisting with longstanding multinodular goitre of thyroid, which should be kept in mind, while performing the needle biopsy and thorough examination of FNAC slides is needed to avoid missing the possible detection of the coexisting malignant lesion. Thyroidectomy specimens should be extensively grossed to detect these coexisting lesions, and review of FNAC slides should be done whenever needed for correlation with histopathological findings. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Smoking {{has been}} {{associated}} with Graves ’ disease, but it remains unclear if the association is present in other thyroid disorders. Outcome variables: Graves ’ disease, Graves ’ ophthalmopathy, <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre,</b> non-toxic goitre, post-partum thyroid disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, or hypothyroidism. Material and methods: A search of MEDLINE identified 25 studies on the association between smoking and thyroid diseases. Results: In Graves ’ disease eight studies were available showing an odds ratio (OR) of 3. 30 (95 % con-fidence interval (CI) : 2. 09 – 5. 22) in current smokers compared with never smokers. In ex-smokers there was no significant excess risk of Graves ’ disease (OR 1 : 41; 95 % CI: 0. 77 – 2. 58). The OR associated with ever smoking in Graves ’ ophthalmopathy (4. 40, 95 % CI: 2. 88 – 6. 73, six studies) was significantly higher than in Graves ’ disease (1. 90, 95 % CI: 1. 42 – 2. 55, two-sided P-value, 0 : 01). Ever smoking was not associated with <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> (OR 1 : 27; 95 % CI: 0. 69 – 2. 33, three studies), while there was an increased risk of non-toxic goitre in smokers if men were excluded (OR 1 : 29; 95 % CI: 1. 01 – 1. 65, eight studies). The risk associated with smoking was sig-nificantly lower in men than in women for both Graves ’ disease and non-toxic goitre. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and post-partum thyroid dysfunction were also associated with smoking while the associ-ation with hypothyroidism did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Cessation of smoking seems associated with a lower risk of Graves ’ disease than current smoking. Smoking increases the risk of Graves ’ ophthalmopathy beyond the risk associated with Graves ’ disease alone. Smoking cessation may lead to a decrease in morbidity from Graves ’ disease, especially in women. European Journal of Endocrinology 146 153 – 16...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Variations in thyroid {{function}} {{are known}} to be associated with changes in adrenocortical activity. Previous studies in animals have suggested that long-standing hyperthyroidism may be associated with diminished adrenal functional reserve despite a continuing hyperactivity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. In humans, there has been no direct assessment of adrenal secretory reserve in clinical thyrotoxicosis. This study aimed to assess adrenocortical reserve in response to low-dose ACTH, following dexamethasone suppression, in patients with severe thyrotoxicosis. Design and methods: Ten patients (four men and six women, 30 – 45 years) with severe long-standing thyrotoxicosis due to Graves ’ disease (n = 6) or <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> (n = 4) were studied at diagnosis and again when in a stable euthyroid state following drug therapy for 8 – 12 months.

We also inquired into current {{practice for the}} follow-up of hyperthyroidism by other endocrinologists in Ireland. Seven cases of unrecognised hyperthyroidism (4 per cent) and one of unrecognised hypothyroidism were identified. Among patients with Graves' disease, of those treated with an antithyroid drug, 28 per cent were in remission, 68 per cent had relapsed and 4 per cent had become hypothyroid. Of those treated by sub-total thyroidectomy, 31 per cent were in remission, 19 per cent had relapsed, 19 per cent were hypothyroid and 31 per cent were sub-clinically hypothyroid.

40|$|<b>Nodular</b> <b>goitres</b> are enlargements of {{the thyroid}} gland. In {{the absence of}} thyroid dysfunction, {{autoimmune}} thyroid disease, thyroiditis and thyroid malignancy, they constitute an entity described as non-toxic <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre,</b> which occurs both endemically and sporadically. In the early phase of goitrogenesis, goitres are diffuse and, with time, such goitres tend to become nodular. Concomitantly, thyroid function often becomes autonomous, and therefore the patients gradually develop hyperthyroidism. Some non-toxic goitre patients have no symptoms at all, or just complaints of cosmetic disfigurement. In the diagnostic evaluation protocol, neck palpation and several imaging methods are available: ultrasonography (US), the new developed US elastography, scintigraphy, computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) provides the most direct and specific information about a thyroid nodule. Recently, a combination of cytology and molecular testing has shown significant improvement in the diagnostic accuracy and allowed for better prediction of malignancy in thyroid nodular diseas...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for culturing intact human thyroid follicles, {{based on the}} study of 40 thyroidectomy specimens from normal (n = 18) and diseased glands (n = 22). Reversal of the normal polarity of thyrocytes, whereby the microvilli move from the colloid edge to the vascular pole of the cells, occurs gradually when the amount of fetal calf serum (FCS) is changed from 0. 5 % to 10 %. The translocation of thyroid 'microvillar' antigens, (surface expression of 'microsomal' and a separate surface antigen) from the follicular to the vascular pole of thyrocytes was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence with human sera containing microsomal antibodies, as well as by electron microscopy. In normal and diseased thyroid glands up to 80 % of follicles became reversed after 5 - 10 days in high FCS and the microsomal/microvillar antigen persisted for about twice as long as in monolayer cultures. Spontaneous reversal of polarity was observed in six of eight glands from patients with Graves' thyrotoxicosis or <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> in freshly dispersed tissues or after 2 days in 0. 5 % FCS, unlike normal tissues where only a trace of reversal appeared after 7 days of culture under these conditions. It is postulated that polarity reversal {{may play a role in}} human thyroid autoimmunity as the normally secluded 'microvillar' antigens becomes transposed to the vascular pole of thyroid follicles where they are in direct contact with cytotoxic antibodies or sensitized immunocytes. This could initiate lesions in intact follicles. Inappropriate HLA-DR expression on thyrocytes, either stimulated by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or appearing spontaneously as an early marker of thyroiditis, did not correlate with reversal of polarity...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Neck nodules {{are common}} in {{clinical}} practice which are accessible to Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Thyroid being the commonest organ to present as the nodular lesions. Parathyroid lesions can be incidentally encountered during FNA of a thyroid nodule Fine needle aspiration cytology is a safe economical and leading investigation in the diagnosis of neck nodules. Thyroid and parathyroid nodules are indistinguishable clinically. An attempt is made to familiarise the pathologist about the cytomorphological features of parathyroid nodules and simple approach to differentiate from thyroid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS It is a retrospective study conducted {{over a period of}} 5 years from 2011 - 2016. Twelve cases of histologically proven parathyroidal lesions are the subjects of study of which 4 cases were diagnosed as parathyroidal cyst and rest as parathyroid adenoma. All the cases underwent fine needle aspiration cytology under ultrasound guidance, Smears were made, stained by H & E and PAP staining method, the slides were reviewed by two cytopathologists. Biochemical and radiological findings were evaluated before giving definitive cytological diagnosis. RESULTS A total number of 12 cases which were histologically proven as parathyroidal lesion. Out of which 4 were cystic lesions which were excluded from the study. Rest of the 8 cases confirmed as parathyroid adenoma which had FNAC were evaluated. 5 cases had positive cytohistological correlation. Three out of 8 cases were diagnosed as papillary carcinoma of thyroid, <b>Toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> and Hurthle cell neoplasm due to varied cytomorphology. CONCLUSION Parathyroidal lesions has got low sensitivity and specificity in cytology. The confident diagnosis of parathyroid neoplasm was made in conjunction with biochemical and advanced radiological imaging. In neck nodules which are asymptomatic and at abnormal locations, FNAC through its cytomorphological features has an edge in diagnosis. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:CXCL 10 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the initial phases of Graves' disease (GD) and autoimmune thyroiditis (AT); however, until now, CXCL 10 serum levels (sCXCL 10) in patients with GD have never been evaluated in relation to thyroid function and treatment. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate sCXCL 10 in GD. DESIGN:Cross-sectional. PATIENTS:One hundred and three GD, 164 AT, 20 nontoxic multinodular goitre (NTMNG), 16 <b>toxic</b> <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> (TNG) patients and 70 healthy controls (age- and sex-matched). MEASUREMENTS:We measured sCXCL 10 in patients and controls, to relate this parameter to the clinical phenotype. RESULTS:Mean sCXCL 10 in GD and AT patients were comparable (122 +/- 81 and 133 +/- 102 pg/ml) and significantly higher (P< 0. 01) than in controls or NTMNG patients (73 +/- 32 and 76 +/- 25 pg/ml, respectively). Hyperthyroid GD had significantly higher sCXCL 10 than euthyroid or hypothyroid GD (145 +/- 92, 107 +/- 56 and 105 +/- 46 pg/ml, respectively; P= 0. 01). GD patients with untreated hyperthyroidism had higher sCXCL 10 than hyperthyroid or euthyroid GD patients under methimazole (MMI) treatment (166 +/- 125, 124 +/- 41 and 94 +/- 35 pg/ml, respectively; P= 0. 006). Comparable sCXCL 10 levels were observed in newly diagnosed untreated hyperthyroid GD patients with respect to untreated patients with relapse of hyperthyroidism after a previous MMI course (176 +/- 125, 155 +/- 97 pg/ml, respectively). GD had similar sCXCL 10 to AT and higher than TNG patients or controls (all age- and sex-matched) (144 +/- 81, 149 +/- 114, 101 +/- 27 and 86 +/- 44 pg/ml, respectively; P= 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS:sCXCL 10 is associated with the active phase of GD in both newly diagnosed and relapsing hyperthyroid patients. The reduction in sCXCL 10 in treated patients with GD may be related to the immunomodulatory effects of MMI...|$|E
40|$|Thyroid {{surgical}} biopsies from 21 {{individuals were}} examined by a double immunoenzymatic technique {{with respect to}} HLA-DR expression and lymphocytic infiltration. HLA-DR positive thyrocytes were observed in two examined Hashimoto goitres and in nine of 11 specimens from patients with Graves' disease. HLA-DR positive thyrocytes were localized to areas harbouring infiltrating lymphocytes, whereas regions with no lymphocytes only rarely expressed HLA-DR antigens. In two specimens of <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> HLA-DR positive thyrocytes were observed {{in the vicinity of}} lymphocytic infiltration. Tissues from another three <b>nodular</b> <b>goitres,</b> from one follicular adenoma and from two normal individuals contained no HLA-DR positive thyrocytes and no or only a few lymphocytes. The lymphocytic infiltrates were dominated by cells with the Leu 3 a helper/inducer phenotype irrespective of underlying disease, although most pronounced in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The results indicate that HLA-DR antigens is expressed on thyrocytes in thyroid disorder. The extent of expression correlated with lymphocytic infiltration, which suggests that the two findings are related and of importance for the development of thyroid autoimmunity...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{radiation}} can induce vessel injury. The {{result of}} this injury can be severe and life-threatening. There are a few studies demonstrating an increase in intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA) after radiotherapy, especially in head and neck cancers. We evaluated the effect of I- 131 to the IMT of the CCA in the patients who were treated for hyperthyroidism. Methods: 38 patients (25 M, 13 W) referred to our department for radioiodine treatment with the diagnosis of <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> (25 patients) and diffuse hyperplasia (Graves disease (GD), 13 patients) were included to the prospective study. An USG was performed for all the patients before therapy, 3, 6 and 12 months after radioiodine therapy {{in order to measure}} IMT of CCA and the femoral artery (FA). The IMT was measured at the level of proximal part of bulbus anteriorly on the left and right side. The IMT of FA was measured just before the bifurcation. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in IMT of both CCA and FA bilaterally in nodular hyperthyroid patients. However, in the patients with Graves disease, there was only statistically significant increase in the left IMT of CCA at 0 - 3 rd, 0 - 6 th month measurements and in the right IMT of FA at 0 - 3 rd month measurements. Conclusion: Though the limitation of the study is the interobserver and intraobserver variability, it was seen that I- 131 therapy might affect the IMT of CCA in the patients with NG. I- 131 effect on the IMT of CCA in patients with <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> was higher than the IMT of CCA in patients with GD. I- 131 effect on the IMT of CCA might be due to administered dose and adjacency. The interesting point of our study was the increased thickness of IMT in FA. We think that the increase in IMT is due to the systemic effect of radioactivity circulating in the blood vessel. I- 131 effect on the IMT of FA in patients with <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> was higher than the IMT of FA in the patients with GD due to I- 131 uptake of thyroid gland. Because I- 131 uptake was lower in patients with <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre,</b> I- 131 in systemic circulation was highe...|$|R
40|$|In an {{investigation}} of autoimmune thyroiditis, two cases of chronic asymptomatic thyroiditis, two cases of <b>nodular</b> <b>goitre</b> with focal thyroiditis and two cases of Hashimoto goitre were studied with the electron microscope. The ultrastructural observations were similar in the six cases. Cytological alterations of the follicle cells were found, some of which suggested an increased metabolic activity. Lymphocytes and plasmocytes established close relationships with the thyroid cells: emperipolesis was encountered. © 1969 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
