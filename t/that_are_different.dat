5|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy have {{traditionally}} been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.|$|E
5|$|As deaf {{education}} and sign language research continued to evolve, {{so did the}} perception of ASL. With {{the publication of the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language, ASL began to be recognized as a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization {{and the development of a}} prestige dialect, which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University. Despite this standardization, ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages. Dialects <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized. As a non-standard dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to prestige dialects of ASL. This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to code switch to a prestige dialect when speaking with different groups of people, despite BASL being mutually intelligible with other dialects of ASL.|$|E
5|$|In such studies, and {{in general}} Latter Day Saint parlance, the -suffixed terms Josephite and Brighamite {{have been used for}} the Missouri-based Community of Christ and the Utah-based LDS Church respectively; these terms have {{sometimes}} been used to distinguish groups of denominations as well. Those denominations within each group share a common ancestry and basic beliefs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes among groups of denominations by use of commonly understood names such as Mormon fundamentalist or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group–for example, Joseph Smith III in reference to Community of Christ as well as various churches and factions that trace their origin to it.|$|E

25|$|Optical illusions (also called visual illusions) are {{characterized}} by visually perceived images that differ from objective reality.

Optical illusions can {{be the result of}} a variety of phenomena including physical effects that create images <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> from the objects that make them, the physiological effects on the eyes and brain of excessive stimulation (e.g. brightness, tilt, colour, movement), and cognitive illusions where the eye and brain make unconscious inferences.|$|E

Two striving irrigation districts of note <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> in size, and means of execution are: 1) Arenal-Tempisque Irrigation District (DRAT) which is a much larger district than the latter and grows staple crops; 2) and the Irrigation and Drainage of Small Areas (PARD) is smaller but benefits more families than DRAT and focuses on higher value crops.|$|E

25|$|Most reef fishes have body shapes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> {{from open}} water fishes. Open water fish are usually built for speed {{in the open}} sea, {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimise friction as they move through the water. Reef fish are operating in the relatively confined spaces and complex underwater landscapes of coral reefs. For this manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} straight line speed, so coral reef fish have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. They outwit predators by dodging into fissures in the reef or playing hide and seek around coral heads.|$|E
25|$|Filamentous carbon has {{thermodynamic}} properties <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> {{from those of}} graphite. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that the structure of filamentous carbon is more disordered than the structure of graphite. Other theories on the difference in properties include that the deviation is based on the formation of an intermediate phase of carbides. This theory was proposed by De Bokx et al. and Manning et al.. However, it is unlikely if the central metal atom is nickel because in that case, since carbides decompose at , and carbides formation was not observed during such a reaction.|$|E
25|$|Glutathione, {{along with}} {{oxidized}} glutathione (GSSG) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), {{have been found}} to bind to the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA and AMPA receptors (via their γ-glutamyl moieties), and may be endogenous neuromodulators. At millimolar concentrations, they may also modulate the redox state of the NMDA receptor complex. Glutathione has been found to bind to and activate ionotropic receptors <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>different</b> from any other excitatory amino acid receptor, and which may constitute glutathione receptors, potentially making it a neurotransmitter. Glutathione is also able to activate the purinergic P2X7 receptor from Müller glia, inducing acute calcium transient signals and GABA release from both retinal neurons and glial cells.|$|E
