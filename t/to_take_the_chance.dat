5|$|During a Friday night performance, Tony is drunk as {{he comes}} {{backstage}} during the interim between his part in Acts IV and V. Felicity is angry that Tony, a recovering alcoholic, got drunk again; she has had to issue several refunds because of his drunken behaviour on stage. She sends him into the shower to sober up, and summons Jim. He is unsure whether he knows the lines well enough to go onstage in Tony's place, but Laura encourages him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance.</b> As she hands him a prop dagger, he sees blood all over the dagger and her hands. Tony {{comes out of the}} shower and wants to finish the performance, so Jim allows him to go. Laura berates Jim for his lack of ambition. She is left alone in the dressing room and hears noises coming from the shower; but when she goes to look, it is empty. A scream is then heard from the stage.|$|E
25|$|Before he can {{execute the}} scientist, Templar's base is {{attacked}} by Marius, who is {{revealed to be}} working for the same prince Templar earlier saved. During the melee, one of Templar's men, Norman Kent, completes the Saint's orders and kills the scientist; he does so after determining that whoever killed the scientist would be likely to hang for murder if caught, and out of loyalty to Templar chose <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> himself. It is also revealed that Kent, who had only been mentioned briefly in previous Saint adventures, harboured an unrequited love for Patricia Holm, possibly originating from a Mediterranean cruise on which Templar had assigned Kent to take Holm to keep her out of trouble (as indicated in Enter the Saint).|$|E
25|$|Military {{training}} and strategy are two important matters {{on which the}} sources are more than usually silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, {{and so it is}} necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance. Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence gives the Impression that Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. If this is not solely due to the deficiencies of the sources, it would make England a special case. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on your side. But if you were in a position so advantageous that you were willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Unless, of course, he was Bede's Oswald and trusted in God. Anyway, battle put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown how few pitched battles successful Charlemagne and Richard I chose to fight.|$|E

6000|$|... "We are laying-to," [...] {{he said to}} Mr. Emery. [...] "There is a nasty sea on, and I didn't care <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of {{fighting}} against it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances,</b> you see, 'cause it wouldn't do {{to miss a}} fire like this," [...] Seth replied, half apologetically, and Dan {{cried in}} his shrill tone: ...|$|R
500|$|There is the {{question}} as to what to do with proposed [...] "compromise" [...] agreements where it is not certain that a benefit will ensue. In this situation, the courts have sometimes agreed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> as in Re Holt's Settlement; on other occasions, as in Re Cohen's Settlement Trusts [...] 3 All ER 139, they have found that if the claimant, a member of a class of beneficiaries, applies and cannot benefit (although other members of the class can), the court is obliged to refuse the request. It is debatable as to whether the intentions of the testator should be taken into account; in Re Steed's Will Trusts [...] 1 All ER the courts refused to alter a trust document, partially due to the testator's wishes; in Re Remnant's Settlement Trusts [...] 2 All ER 554, however, the court took the opposite view.|$|E
2500|$|The {{office complex}} housing his former {{practice}} was demolished on October 10, 2011. [...] Earlier, state police confiscated {{the contents of}} Bradley's storage locker in Rehoboth Beach and destroyed them; the items were to be auctioned off to satisfy unpaid rent, but Biden intervened {{on behalf of the}} victims to buy them for a symbolic $1 so as not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of them ever being used again.|$|E
2500|$|Sister Kenny is {{referenced}} in the TV movie An American Christmas Carol, {{in which}} the Tiny Tim character, Jonathan, would be sent for treatment for his disability (never referred to specifically, however, as polio). Her treatments are also suggested to {{be the basis for}} Livy Walton's recovery in The Waltons first-season episode [...] "An Easter Story". Livy's will to walk again after polio leads her <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> that Kenny's methods might work.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} it," [...] Darius {{said after}} a brief pause, during which we had {{looked at each other}} questioningly. [...] "I'm goin' <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of findin' out for myself." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{order that}} Captain Hanaford {{might be willing}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of losing his vessel, I showed him the {{guarantee}} we had received from Commodore Barney, and promised that {{when we got the}} money from the government he should share equally with us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{go after}} the beasts, and you shall stand here to keep watch over the harbor, for I am not minded <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of being surprised, ever though we {{have good reason to}} believe no {{mischief}} will be attempted until late in the night." ...|$|R
2500|$|Garry Sobers, {{who played}} {{against him in}} league cricket, said of Pepper that [...] "the reason why he never played county cricket was {{probably}} because of his overripe language. He was certainly good enough as a cricketer but no one wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance...</b> It is said that Sir Don Bradman once remarked that had Cec's mouth and his attitude been different, {{he would have been}} one of the greatest all-rounders the world has ever seen." ...|$|E
60|$|RIDGEON. Well, it's {{always the}} patient who has <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> when an {{experiment}} is necessary. And {{we can find}} out nothing without experiment.|$|E
60|$|His {{kindness}} was genuine, and she determined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> he gave her, although {{to talk to}} a man of such {{worth and}} authority made her heart beat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a bit. It {{was on my}} tongue's end {{to propose}} somethin' of the same kind; but we can't afford <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of makin' a move till yonder nest of snakes has settled down for the night. An hour from now, an' we'll all pull out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what if {{the boys}} went ashore to go home {{for a couple of}} days? That yarn will go down, I reckon, an' if it don't I'll have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> for <b>the</b> sake of gettin' you to Joshua Barney as soon as it can be done." ...|$|R
60|$|In the conning-tower was Captain Gridley, who, {{much against}} his will, was forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up his {{position}} in that partially sheltered place because {{the commander of the}} fleet was not willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> that all <b>the</b> chief officers of the ship should be exposed to death on the bridge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Tom, {{that would}} be very nice. But we can't afford <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance.</b> If some of those rascals get away, sooner or later they'll make more trouble for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is false! I {{say that}} it is false! Cleopatra goes not to Tarsus, and Antony comes not to Alexandria; or, if he come, it will be <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose you're giving Shanks {{his chance}} of making good. The trouble is, he's forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> whether he wants or not. Some folks would sooner live like dogs than decent citizens." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was a hanger-on, that's all," [...] {{came from}} Matt Gilroy. [...] "He was always afraid <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of being shot, but {{was on hand}} when the spoils were divided. They used him as a {{messenger}} and a spy, but I don't believe he ever really helped to hold up a coach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will one of {{your men}} stand by for our line, sir?" [...] I asked, because the pungy was bobbing around on the small waves ten feet or more from the ship's side, and I was not minded <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of jumping for the rail when there was good {{possibility}} of landing in the water.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Rames," [...] {{she murmured}} {{into his ear}} a minute later, [...] "I am drawing you to {{whatever}} may be found upon this breast of mine, love, or majesty, or shame, or ruin, or {{the death of one}} or both of us, or all of them together. Are you content <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of this high game, Rames?" ...|$|R
60|$|Archie {{thought from}} what he {{had heard of the}} MacDougall that his chance was a very slight one. Still, as the young ever cling to hope, and as he would assuredly be slain by the clansmen, he thought it better <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance,</b> small as it was, and so {{continued}} his march by the side of his captor's palfrey.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop! Hands up, or I'll shoot!" [...] Pat {{was taking}} the one chance open to him. If he allowed the man to get back inside the cabin {{there was no telling}} when he would show himself again. It was clear that he {{suspected}} something. It was better <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> that he would obey orders, knowing that some one had the drop on him, rather than be obliged to lay siege to the cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know it is}} so," [...] said Meta firmly, [...] "but risks must be run, and he {{is willing}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance.</b> I {{do not think it}} can be presumption, for, you know, I am strong; and Dr. May would say if he could not warrant me. I fancy {{household}} work would be more satisfactory and less tiring than doing a season thoroughly, and I mean to go through a course of Finchley manuals in preparation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Davis {{never allowed}} anythin' like that. He {{said after a}} spell, when I'd showed 'em I could 'tend to business, I might get a show; but you see, it ain't anyways certain that they'll do what Ninety-four's men have been countin' on. I've got <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances,</b> you know, and work my way in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If St. Leger {{knows that}} a man of Colonel Willett's rank was eager <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of leaving <b>the</b> {{fortification}} to summon assistance, he must believe the garrison is in sore straits, an' therefore it is that I believe the mistake was made in allowin' him to go out when {{there were plenty of}} others here willin' <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> chances." ...|$|R
6000|$|Was it {{possible}} that Hewson knew something of the neighborhood or its future, which encouraged him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of <b>the</b> property appreciating in value? This thought passed through St. John's mind, {{and he was not}} the man to let himself be overreached in a deal. [...] "The place ought to be worth thirty thousand," [...] he said, for a bluff.|$|R
60|$|He {{decided not}} to write to Marcia {{of the change in}} his affairs, but <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> of finding {{something}} better before she returned. There was very little time for him to turn round, and he was still without a place or any prospect when she came home. It had sufficed with his acquaintance when {{he said that he had}} left the Events because he could not get on with Witherby; but he was very much astonished when it seemed to suffice with her.|$|E
6000|$|MILDRED--How naive age makes one! But I said he did, Aunt. I {{even said}} he {{had given me a}} letter to them--which I had lost. And they were afraid <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> that I might be lying. [Excitedly.] So it's ho! for the stokehole. The second {{engineer}} is to escort me. [Looking at her watch again.] It's time. And here he comes, I think. [The SECOND ENGINEER enters, He is a husky, fine-looking man of thirty-five or so. He stops before the two and tips his cap, visibly embarrassed and ill-at-ease.] ...|$|E
60|$|Dare {{meanwhile}} {{had moved}} on without seeing his former employer, and Somerset resolved <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> that offered, and let him go. There was something so mysterious in their common presence simultaneously at one place, five hundred miles from where they had last met, that he exhausted conjecture on whether Dare's errand this way could {{have anything to do}} with his own, or whether their juxtaposition a second time was the result of pure accident. Greatly as he would have liked to get this answered by a direct question to Dare himself, he did not counteract his first instinct, and remained unseen.|$|E
60|$|Even {{though we}} were minded to be so {{reckless}} as <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> of disobeying an order, it could avail us nothing, for pursuit would be given immediately, and how might we hope to escape from a vessel of war's boat, manned most like by a dozen men, we being only two lads not overly well skilled in rowing.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no little}} danger {{in making the}} attempt, because I might thus arouse {{suspicion}} {{in the mind of}} the sentry, or be seen by an officer who would insist on knowing why I was there; but it was the only way by which I could have speech with Darius, if indeed he was a prisoner, and I determined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances.</b>|$|R
6000|$|DEAR JOE,--If {{you were}} here, I should say, [...] "Get you to Washington and beg Senator Jones <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> {{and put up}} about ten or [...] "--no, I wouldn't. The money would burn {{a hole in my}} pocket and get away from me if the {{furnisher}} of it were proceeding upon merely your judgment and mine and without other evidence. It is too much of a responsibility.|$|R
