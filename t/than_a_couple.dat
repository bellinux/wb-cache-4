The album has {{a variety of}} musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts – all of which were features of the progressive rock scene. Although the finished album runs as one continuous piece, it is made up of a medley of individual songs that run into each other, none of which individually lasts more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of minutes. Parts of the suite blend classical and folk music into the typical rock music framework.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{shortage}} of resources demands a consequent lightweight design with aluminium alloys. Process stability {{and a high}} seam quality in welding processes of this material are difficult to achieve. Bifocal hybrid laser welding (BHLW) demonstrates how this material can be welded reliably without defects. The used hybrid laser system consists of a Nd:YAG laser and a high power diode laser (HPDL). This leads to a high welding penetration in combination with a high seam quality. This publication demonstrates that the BHLW process is more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> deep penetration welding (DPW) process with a heat conduction welding (HCW) process. The synergetic effect is a better quality in the entire welding seam...|$|R

25|$|While the B class {{locomotives}} {{were highly}} successful on the expensively-engineered 1860s mainlines {{for which they}} were designed, they were less suited for the more cheaply built extensions to the VR system. Future VR express passenger locomotives were to use a four-wheel leading bogie to steer the locomotive, and from 1884 a class of 4-4-0 locomotives (later classed 'Old A') began to supplement, and eventually supersede the B class. Despite the delivery of the Old A, and the later and increasingly larger 'New A' and AA class 4-4-0s of 1889 and 1900 respectively, the entire B class (other <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of accident write-offs) lasted into the Twentieth century, with their roles ranging from double heading on express passenger trains down to shunting duties.|$|E

25|$|In June 2004 {{the first}} {{performances}} for about 70 years {{took place in}} the theatre, first in its foyer then in July in the theatre itself. Although conditions were far from ideal, the audience was able to see the potential of this very large space – originally seating 3,000, it cannot currently be licensed for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hundred. It is intended that the theatre will one day reopen, but much costly restoration will be required first. It will never again reach a seating capacity of 3,000 (not least because one balcony was removed {{in the early part of}} the 20th century as a fire precaution, when films started to be shown there), but it does seem likely that a capacity of more than 1,000 may one day be achieved. A major season of the theatre company Complicite was planned for 2005 but the project, which would have included some repair and access work, was cancelled due to higher-than-anticipated costs.|$|E

In the interim it operated out of Pearl as a training unit.

Again the Laurel Hill line repulsed the Union troops with heavy losses. Grant was forced to postpone his 5 p.m. coordinated assault until Warren could get his troops reformed. Not informed of the delay, Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott of the II Corps moved his division forward at 5 p.m. toward the tip of the Mule Shoe. When his men reached the open field, Confederate artillery ripped them to shreds, and they retreated. At around 6 p.m., Col. Emory Upton led a group of 12 hand-picked regiments, about 5,000 men in four battle lines, against an identified weak point {{on the west side of}} the Mule Shoe. The plan was for Upton's men to rush across the open field without pausing to fire and reload, reaching the earthworks before the Confederates could fire more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of shots. The plan worked well initially, but Generals Lee and Ewell were quick to organize a vigorous counterattack with brigades from all sectors of the Mule Shoe. No Union supporting units arrived.

500|$|When {{performed}} properly, deep frying {{does not}} make food excessively greasy, because the moisture in the food repels the oil. The hot oil heats the water within the food, steaming it; oil cannot go against the direction of this powerful flow because (due to its high temperature) the water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface. As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not immersed in the oil for too long, oil penetration will be confined to the outer surface. Foods deep-fried at proper temperatures typically absorb [...] "no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of tablespoons per [...] cups of oil" [...] used.

40|$|Tax {{scholarship}} has long struggled with whether married taxpayers should be taxed differently from unmarried taxpayers. Currently, married taxpayers {{are subject to}} different tax rates than unmarried taxpayers, and may file a joint tax return. <b>A</b> married <b>couple</b> may pay <b>a</b> higher or lower amount of tax <b>than</b> <b>an</b> unmarried <b>couple</b> with the same total income, and a single person generally pays more tax on <b>a</b> given income <b>than</b> <b>a</b> married <b>couple</b> with <b>a</b> single earner with the same income. These outcomes are difficult to reconcile with a commitment to income tax progressivity, which in theory requires that higher incomes be taxed at higher rates. Moreover, the system penalizes some marriages, and benefits other marriages. This article takes {{a fresh look at}} the problem of marriage bonuses and penalties, acknowledges that there may be difficulties with a separate filing system, but concludes that the joint return and special rates for married taxpayers should be abolished. In addition, drawing on the work of family law scholars, this article argues that a stronger case can be made for supporting parenting rather than marriage in the tax system...|$|R
