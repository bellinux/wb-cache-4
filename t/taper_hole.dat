Also, cutting force and the required energy were calculated and compared. To verify the results of analysis, a cutting dynamometer was used to analyze 3 -axis cutting force. Results of analysis showed that the specimen maintained a temperature of approximately 650 °, with rapid cooling after chips were formed from the specimen. The tool reached a maximum of 700 °, similarly to the chips. It is expected that these results will be utilized to optimize cutting processes and work conditions when drilling holes...|$|E

40|$|The forming of a micro <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> {{is based}} on {{nanosecond}} pulsed laser processing, which conforms to fast processing time and high throughput; however, the microhole quality should be improved. Micro stamping is a technology providing high precise size and speed. The greatest difficulty in forming a microhole by micro stamping is the precision alignment of the punch head to the lower die. In order to overcome the difficulty, we proposed a concept of stamping without die (SWD). Without a lower die, the tapered punch head was directly applied to the workpiece for micro stamping, and a thicker workpiece surrounding the punching area provides a better support to the stamping process. Thus, a successful forming of micro <b>tapered</b> <b>holes</b> is completed. The micro <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> depth is 300 μm, and the maximum ratio of inlet to outlet diameter is 18 : 1. In {{order to reduce the}} number of experiments, the finite element analysis software DEFORM- 3 D was used for forming analysis.

The exact solution of the corresponding flexural wave equation that exists for m = 2 has been used in the process of the numerical solution of the corresponding boundary problem. Note that this value of 171 belongs to the power-law range m >= 2 associated with zero reflection of quasi-plane waves from a <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> in geometrical acoustics approximation. Two cases of added damping in the central hole area have been considered: a thin absorbing layer and a constrained layer. Cross and point mobilities have been calculated for both these cases. The obtained results for point and cross mobilities show a substantial suppression of resonant peaks (up to 17 dB), in comparison with the cases of a plate with an uncovered hole of the same power-law profile and of a reference circular plate of constant thickness covered or uncovered by a thin absorbing layer. Further theoretical and experimental research is needed to examine applications of the obtained numerical results to more practical situations, e. g. to rectangular plates or other structures with arbitrary locations of <b>tapered</b> <b>holes.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It was a special EAA event ([URL] reduction of flexural vibration in thin plates is examined using the acoustic black hole effect associated with nearly zero reflection of quasi-plane waves from a lightly damped wedge or <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> where the profile varies according to a power-law. The flexural wave propagation can be determined through the application of geometrical acoustics approximation or exact analytical solutions. For a plate of thickness of power-law profile, the wave slows down and grows in amplitude. In the ideal case of no truncation of the quadratic (or higher) profile, the phase speed asymptotically decreases to zero and the wave never reaches the end. Manufactured plates always have a truncation, leading to relatively high reflection coefficients, however, the application of small damping layers leads to substantial decreases in the reflection coefficients and thus large reductions in mobility amplitudes. This paper contains the results of numerical models and experimental measurements of point mobility for structural plates incorporating <b>tapered</b> <b>holes</b> for validation. A rectangular plate with a 1 D wedge on one end is examined, in addition to a circular plate with a quadratic profile in the centre.

In thermal drilling process with CAMC hollow electrodes of different materials with internal water scavenging are investigated with regard to wear behaviour and removal rate. The graphite type EG 88 shows the longest electrode life, tested in plates of thickness from 20 mm up to 65 mm and using dielectric fluid both drinking water and deionized water. 14 holes were drilled in a plate of a thickness of 30 mm (adequate to 420 mm) without electrode-changing, in this time the wear on the length 16, 9 mm. Minor <b>tapered</b> <b>holes</b> and rough interior surfaces of the pearcing holes are the results. Fastening elements plug and blind rivet, which are customary in trade, have been investigated.

40|$|Thermoacoustic {{engines are}} an {{interesting}} alternative to conventional heat engines (such as Stirling engines) due {{to the absence of}} moving parts in the hot region and the small temperature difference required to operate. These engines can provide a durable solution in, for example, waste heat recovery applications. Using a traveling wave based configuration, consisting of a toroidal geometry, thermal-to-acoustic efficiencies of up to 30 % have been obtained. However, the traveling wave configuration has a major disadvantage: due to the closed looped geometry a time-averaged mass flow, known as "Gedeon streaming", can occur. This type of acoustic streaming can lead to a drastic reduction in efficiency or even prevent the engine from running. Therefore, control of Gedeon streaming is essential in the development of traveling wave thermoacoustic engines. A solution to avoid Gedeon streaming is the application of a jet pump, which is a component with one or more <b>tapered</b> <b>holes.</b> The oscillatory flow through such an asymmetric geometry results in a time-averaged pressure drop across the jet pump. By balancing this time-averaged pressure drop with the pressure drop that exists across the regenerator of the thermoacoustic device, Gedeon streaming can be suppressed. In this thesis, the oscillatory flow in jet pumps is analyzed. The relation between oscillatory flow features and the performance of jet pumps is investigated. Based on this, jet pump design guidelines have been formulated for laminar oscillatory flows. Flow separation is identified as a main source of performance loss in jet pumps and can be avoided by introducing a smooth transition to the tapered inner surface. Compact jet pump designs can be realized by using multiple smaller <b>tapered</b> <b>holes,</b> but this is accompanied by a slight reduction in performance due to the smaller diameter of the individual holes. Identifying and understanding the flow phenomena in jet pumps is shown to be the key to more reliable design calculations for jet pumps in thermoacoustic applications...|$|R
