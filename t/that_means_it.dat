5|$|According to Fitzgibbons, the rumours {{surrounding}} Cromwell's body {{immediately after}} his death are “merely good yarns born out of over-active imaginations”. One legend claims that he was conveyed secretly to Naseby, the site of his “greatest victory and glory”, for a midnight burial. The field was then ploughed over to hide evidence of the burial. Another legend, written in the 1730s by a John Oldmixon, claims that “a reliable Gentlewoman who attended Cromwell in his last sickness” had said the coffin was sunk in the deepest part of the River Thames the night following Cromwell's death. Fearful of royalists, “it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse. They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick burial...and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands, it was resolved {{to wrap it up}} in lead, to put it aboard a Barge, and sink it in the deepest part of the Thames, which was done the night following Cromwell's death.” In 1664, Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “Cromwell did, in his life, transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave to another, and by <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is not known certainly whether the head that is now set upon a post be that of Cromwell, or one of the Kings”. If this story had any accuracy, Fitzgibbons suggests the irony would be that the posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself. Another story even suggested that Cromwell's body was substituted for Charles I, adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “an even greater mockery of the events of 30 January 1649”. This story is known to be false; Charles' tomb was opened in 1813, and his remains, including the cut that severed his head, remained as they were in 1649.|$|E

25|$|Gliese 581g , unofficially {{known as}} Zarmina (or Zarmina's World), is an {{unconfirmed}} (and frequently disputed) exoplanet claimed to orbit within the Gliese 581 system, twenty light-years from Earth. It {{was discovered by}} the Lick–Carnegie Exoplanet Survey, and is the sixth planet orbiting the star; however, its existence could not be confirmed by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) / High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) survey team, and its existence remains controversial. It {{is thought to be}} near the middle of the habitable zone of its star. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> could sustain liquid water—a necessity for all known life—on its surface, if there are favorable atmospheric conditions on the planet.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} fossils of beetles known from this era, though the beetle fauna of the Paleocene is {{comparatively}} poorly investigated. In contrast, the knowledge on the Eocene beetle fauna is very good. The {{reason is the}} occurrence of fossil insects in amber and clay slate sediments. Amber is fossilized tree resin, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> consists of fossilized organic compounds, not minerals. Different amber is distinguished by location, age and species of the resin producing plant. For the research on the Oligocene beetle fauna, Baltic and Dominican amber is most important. Even with the insect fossils record in general lacking, the most diverse deposit being from the Fur Formation, Denmark; including giant ants and primitive moths (Noctuidae).|$|E
25|$|The SHE {{electrode}} can {{be connected}} to any other electrode by a salt bridge to form a cell. If the second electrode is also at standard conditions, then the measured cell potential is called the standard electrode potential for the electrode. The standard electrode potential for the SHE is zero, by definition. The polarity of the standard electrode potential provides information about the relative reduction potential of the electrode compared to the SHE. If the electrode has a positive potential {{with respect to the}} SHE, then <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is a strongly reducing electrode which forces the SHE to be the anode (an example is Cu in aqueous CuSO4 with a standard electrode potential of 0.337 V). Conversely, if the measured potential is negative, the electrode is more oxidizing than the SHE (such as Zn in ZnSO4 where the standard electrode potential is −0.76 V).|$|E
25|$|Once ashore, {{the pilot}} whale is killed by cutting the dorsal area {{through to the}} spinal cord with a special whaling knife, a mønustingari (spinal cord cutter), and after cutting it, the whaler must {{make sure that the}} whale is dead, he can do this by {{touching}} the whale's eye; before he cuts the neck open, so that as much blood as possible can run from the whale {{in order to get the}} best quality of meat. The neck is cut with a grindaknívur, but only after it has been killed. The mønustingari is a new invention which has been legal to use to kill pilot whales with since 2011, and since 1 May 2015 it is the only weapon allowed to slaughter a whale. The length of time it takes for a whale to die varies from a few seconds to a few minutes. Other observers complained that it took up to fifteen minutes for certain whales to die, they noted several cuts were sometimes made before a successful death and that some whales were not even killed properly until a vet finishes the job. With the new law which prohibits the whale hunters to stab the whales from the boats, this should not take place any more. According to the new Whaling Law (Grindalógin), it is only allowed to kill the whales from the shore, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is not the men who hunt the pilot whales with their boats who are slaughtering the whales, but men who are waiting on the beach with blowhole hooks with rope and spinal cord knives.|$|E

[...] When asked about the difference in terms of sound and direction between Psalms of the Moribund and Prelude to the Tragedy, Gruber stated, [...] "We got our own style on Psalms to the Moribund where Prelude to the Tragedy had very obvious hints of the bands we idolized.

She was initially reluctant {{to participate in}} the segment but agreed to after a visit from Timberlake in her dressing room. Beyoncé's choreographer, Frank Gatson Jr., expressed mixed emotions at the result, saying: [...] "I was upset because I know that Justin's a great dancer and if he learned the choreography, he could do it really well... If they're making parodies [...] just like they make parodies of politicians and presidents, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> must be big time. So in that respect, I have to take my hat off to them for doing it." [...] Later, Joe Jonas of the pop rock band Jonas Brothers posted a video on their YouTube account where he imitated the dance in a black leotard and heels. Irish pop duo Jedward parodied Beyoncé's dance moves for the video of their cover version of [...] "All the Small Things". In London, one hundred dancers wearing leotards similar to the one worn by Beyoncé performed the choreography on April 20, 2009, to promote Trident Unwrapped gum. On November 20, 2009, BBC Newsreaders including Fiona Bruce, Sophie Raworth, Kate Silverton, and Susanna Reid performed [...] "Single Ladies" [...] in black military-style uniforms. They were later joined onstage by their male newsreader colleagues Bill Turnbull, Ben Brown, Nicholas Owen, and Charlie Stayt before taking on Diversity, winners of the third series of Britain's Got Talent, in a dance-off.

2500|$|In Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes {{to produce}} manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg {{developed}} an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type.

Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: [...] "if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see {{this is a very}} shiny surface. When you write you use a water based ink, [...] you put your pen into it and it runs off. [...] Now [...] if you print that's exactly what you don't want.

2500|$|On 5 December, the United Nations Security Council imposed tougher {{sanctions}} on Eritrea {{due to its}} reported role in providing support to the Al-Shabaab militants. Observers {{and members of the}} allied forces subsequently expressed optimism that the long-standing civil conflict in southern Somalia would soon be resolved. Colonel Felix Kulayigye, a spokesman for AMISOM's Ugandan military contingent, indicated that [...] "Normally, sanctions are supposed to reduce the capability of the affected country in its financial muscle. And, therefore, if Eritrea faces sanctions, if they are comprehensive enough, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> will have not a spare penny to spend on negative elements". Political analyst Sheikh Abdisamad, the chairman of the research organisation Southlink, also suggested that [...] "If the sanctions become effective on Eritrea, what I'm sure is that they can easily defeat those militia within Somalia" [...] since sanctions would disrupt flights funnelling supplies to Al-Shabaab along the [...] "Eritrean route" [...] between Asmara in Eritrea and Kismayo in southern Somalia. Girma Asmerom, Eritrea's Ambassador to the AU, responded that the {{sanctions on}} his country would {{have a negative effect on}} both Eritrea's development and that of the larger East Africa region. He also indicated that he would not wish such restrictions on other nations, describing the United Nations' sanctions as [...] "illegal and unjust".|$|E
