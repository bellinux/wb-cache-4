In the greenhouse study, <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace amended {{at the rate of}} 1 % (w/v) was also able to obviously reduce the disease incidence of cabbage seedling damping-off by 40 % compared to untreated control. The pH values of BVB NO. 4 peat moss medium did not change significantly after <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace was amended at the rate of 1 % (w/v); however, <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace was able to stimulate the proliferation of microbial populations including fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes. The inhibition of cabbage seed colonization was not significantly nullified in autoclaved BVB NO. 4 peat moss medium with <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace. The results suggest that the inhibition of cabbage seed colonization by the pathogen in the amended medium might be due to the presence of chemical compounds with antifungal activity in <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> pomace. 採用種子誘釣法篩選具有抑制Rhizoctonia solani纏據甘藍種子效果的有機添加物，結果發現在BVB No. 4 泥炭苔中添加 2 % (w/v) 苦茶粕處理第 0 天（當天）即可降低種子纏據百分率達 68 %；處理一星期後，亦可得到類似的效果。栽培介質添加 1 %(w/v) 苦茶粕可顯著降低甘藍苗立枯病的發病率達 40 %。進一步，探討苦茶粕添加於BVB No. 4 泥炭苔中的其他效應，結果發現添加 1 %(w/v) 苦茶粕不會顯著改變BVB No. 4 泥炭苔的pH值，但却會提高微生物的族群量，其中細菌菌量增加 9 倍，真菌及放線菌則分別增加 2 ~ 3 倍。經高溫高壓滅菌後，去除BVB No. 4 泥炭苔及苦茶粕中的微生物，發現苦茶粕尚能降低R. solani AG- 4 纏據甘藍種子百分率達 30 %以上。本研究結果顯示苦茶粕的組成份中可能存在有抑菌化學物質，可有效抑制本病原菌纏據甘藍種子...|$|R

It is suggested to block the outlet of the farmland and strew the <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> meal after transplanting rice seedlings. Moreover, it is also recommended to irrigate the paddy field after two days in summer (the first crops) and three days in spring (the second crops). It's not recommended to drain water, so as to reduce the harm to creatures. Besides, the high water temperature in summer also has negative influence over the paddy field and creatures. 在台灣，?了防治福壽螺，無論有機農業或慣行農法皆於插秧期間在水田內施撒苦茶粕來抑制福壽螺生長。但是苦茶粕除了可抑制蟲害外，亦會撲殺具有黏液的軟體動物，引起水田所謂的生態浩劫。目前國內雖然有探討苦茶子內之皂素濃度對福壽螺之毒性等問題，但並未針對魚類探討。故本研究以香莢蘭醛－硫酸法及泥鰍田間生存試驗兩種方式，試圖找出苦茶粕對泥鰍之危害效期。由其結果可知，插秧後可封田施撒苦茶粕，並在夏季（二期作）兩天、春季（一期作）三天後再行引水灌溉對抑制福壽螺效果較佳。另建議施撒苦茶粕後以不排水為原則，以降低水路泥鰍危害的機率。此外，從現地實驗中可發現夏季的高水溫對水田及農水路之泥鰍亦有不良的影響...|$|R

40|$|The oil of <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> (Camellia oleifera Abel.) is used {{extensively}} in China as cooking oil. The objectives {{of this study}} were to investigate the antioxidant activity of <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil and its active compounds. Of the five solvent extracts, methanol extract of <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil exhibited the highest yield and the strongest antioxidant activity as determined by DPPH scavenging activity and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Two peaks separated from the methanol extract by HPLC contributed the most significant antioxidant activity. These two peaks were further identified as sesamin and a novel compound: 2, 5 -bis-benzo[1, 3]dioxol- 5 -yl-tetrahydro-furo [3, 4 -d][1, 3]dioxine (named compound B) by UV absorption and characterized by MS, IR, (1) H NMR, and (13) C NMR techniques. Sesamin and compound B decreased H(2) O(2) -mediated formation of reactive oxygen species in red blood cells (RBCs), inhibited RBCs hemolysis induced by AAPH, and increased the lag time of conjugated dienes formation in human low-density lipoprotein. The results indicate that both compounds isolated from <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil exhibit remarkable antioxidant activity.

40|$|The oil of <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> (Camellia oleifera Abel.) is used {{extensively}} in China for cooking. This {{study was designed}} to evaluate the effects of <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil on CCl 4 -induced acute hepatotoxicity in rats. Male SD rats (200 +/- 10 g) were pre-treated with <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil (50, 100, and 150 g/ kg diet) for six weeks before treatment with a single dose of CCl 4 (50 % CCl 4, 2 mL/kg of bw, intraperitoneally), the rats were sacrificed 24 h later, and blood samples were collected for assaying serum biochemical Parameters. The livers were excised for evaluating peroxidation products and antioxidant substances, as well as the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Pathological histology was also performed. The results showed that a <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil diet significantly (p < 0. 05) lowered the serum levels of hepatic enzyme markers (alanine amino-transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase), inhibited fatty degeneration, reduced the content of the peroxidation product malondialdehyde, and elevated the content of GSH. Pre-treatment of animals with <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil (150 g/kg diet) could increase the activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S transferase in liver when compared with CCl 4 -treated group (p < 0. 05). Therefore, {{the results of this study}} show that a <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil diet can be proposed to protect the liver against CCl 4 -induced oxidative damage in rats, and the hepatoprotective effect might be correlated with its antioxidant and free radical scavenger effects.

40|$|Purpose: The study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the fatty acid profile of Camellia oleifera (<b>tea)</b> <b>seed</b> oil and evaluate for cytotoxicity and activities on melanogenesis and antioxidant activity assays in order to utilize as the functional oil. Methods: The fatty acid profile of oil was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The cytotoxicity was performed by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay in B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells and 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. The melanogenesis assay, including melanin content and activities of tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein- 2 (TRP- 2), and antioxidant activity were evaluated. Results: Three major fatty acids of oil were oleic acid (87. 93 ± 0. 19 %), stearic (5. 14 ± 0. 06 %) and palmitic (5. 08 ± 0. 12 %) acids. The non-cytotoxicity of 5 % <b>tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil demonstrated the cell viabilities of 94. 59 ± 3. 41 % in B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells and 97. 57 ± 1. 62 % in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. <b>Tea</b> <b>seed</b> oil exhibited the inhibitory activity on melanogenesis assay via inhibition of tyrosinase and TRP- 2 activities.
