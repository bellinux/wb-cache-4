In 1995, <b>top</b> <b>birds</b> arrived {{back at the}} colony significantly earlier, had significantly shorter first and second incubation shifts and hatched larger chicks which grew significantly faster than bottom <b>birds.</b> In 1994, <b>top</b> <b>birds</b> also had larger hatchlings with higher rates of growth than bottom <b>birds.</b> In 1994, <b>top</b> <b>birds</b> had significantly higher hatching, fledging and therefore overall breeding success than bottom birds; very similar trends were evident in 1993 and 1995. Chick-rearing success and all indices of chick growth suggested that food availability was high in 1995 (and 1993) and low in 1994. Therefore the superior performance of <b>top</b> <b>birds</b> was maintained in years of very different conditions, with the chick-rearing period particularly critical. A simple model (using published demographic parameters for Grey-headed Albatrosses on South Georgia) suggests that <b>top</b> <b>birds</b> would produce 2. 5 more chicks over their lifetime than bottom birds.

5000|$|The Texas coast {{has been}} popular among bird watchers in the United States for decades. Located where the Central Flyway meets the Gulf coast and the Mississippi Flyway, the region sees {{a large number}} of migrants; in addition, the {{southern}} part of the Texas coast is far enough south to host a number of tropical species. [...] A 1991 American Birding Association (ABA) study by Roland Wauer showed that Texas was the <b>top</b> <b>bird</b> watching destination in the United States for its members. In 1993 the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department began a $1.5 million project to develop public and private resources to utilize as bird sanctuaries and observation sites. The plan and the concept were largely developed by Ted Eubanks and Madge Lindsay. Site improvements included trail markers, trail development, boardwalks, observation stations, and many others. The goal was both to encourage environmental protection and to establish a tourism network that would benefit businesses throughout the Texas Gulf Coast region catering to ecotourists.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{culture of the}} 19th century introduced some [...] "scientific" [...] rationalizations for the myth's origins, by suggesting that {{the origin of the}} myth of the roc may lie in embellishments of the often-witnessed power of the eagle that could carry away a newborn lamb. In 1863, Bianconi suggested the roc was a raptor (Hawkins and Goodman, 2003: 1031). Recently a giant subfossil eagle, the Malagasy crowned eagle, identified from Madagascar was actually implicated as a <b>top</b> <b>bird</b> predator of the island, whose megafauna once included giant lemurs and pygmy hippopotamuses.Another possible origin of the myth is accounts of eggs of another extinct Malagasy bird, the enormous Aepyornis elephant bird, hunted to extinction by the 16th century, that was three meters tall and flightless. There were reported elephant bird sightings at least in folklore memory as Étienne de Flacourt wrote in 1658. Its egg, live or subfossilised, was known as early as 1420, when sailors to the Cape of Good Hope found eggs of the roc, according to a caption in the 1456 Fra Mauro map of the world, which says that the roc [...] "carries away an elephant or any other great animal".|$|E

The publisher offered Bird Talk magazine to Fancy Publications, a small publishing company, which also published Dog Fancy, Cat Fancy and Horse Fancy magazines. Under Fancy Publications, Bird Talk was redesigned and published, in April 1984, with a new focus to provide bird care information to pet bird owners. The redesigned issued introduced new columns including Watch the Birdie and Causes and Cures. Its motto is Dedicated To Better Care For Pet Birds. The current editor Laura Doering, has worked for Bird Talk since 1998. In November 2006, Bird Talk launched their website BirdChannel.com.

40|$|International audienceFor coastal cliffs, {{the erosion}} {{monitoring}} is traditionally performed {{by studying the}} rates of retreat of a spatial object tracking over time, often the cliff <b>top</b> (<b>Bird,</b> 2008). This classic approach to coastal geomorphology is used, among others, for risk management. In France, for Risk Prevention Plan (MATE-METL, 1997), the average retreat rates are extrapolated over 100 years to demarcate the zoning of the hazard. However, these average retreat rates are incomplete information {{because they do not}} reflect the brutal nature of the hazard. This one results in falls that threaten populations located at the cliff top and at the cliff foot. But the monitoring of these jerks, a priori without warning signs, requires a high spatial resolution. Despite the quality of the methods and techniques used in recent decades (orthophotography, photogrammetry, airborne LIDAR), pluridecimeter or plurimeter margins of error affect quantification. Moreover, the vertical {{point of view of the}} data hides some changes (Young et al, 2009), especially scree phenomena, which according to some authors represent at least 10 % of the retreat (May and Heeps, 1985; Hénaff et al., 2002) and may be early signs of instability. In order to follow all changes affecting the cliff face and improve the knowledge of cliff retreat, we have used terrestrial laser scanning instrumentation, in collaboration with the laboratory Domaines Océaniques. It has been deployed along the coastal chalk cliffs of Upper Normandy (France), affected by decimeter annual retreat. The diachronic monitoring was conducted between 2010 and 2013, at high frequency (every 4 - 5 months) in order to have surveys every season. This study conducted at two sites (the former in a context of active cliff and the latter in a context of abandoned cliff), with similar lithostratigraphic characteristics, provides a quantification of the production of debris with centimeter precision (± 0. 01 to 0. 04 m) (Letortu, 2013). These surveys allow: - To measure the ablation rates at high resolution with retreat values that, unsurprisingly, prove more important in a context of active cliff than in a context of abandoned cliff; - To identify the significant part of scree production (about 25 %) in the total cliff retreat; - To emphasize that marine actions are not only a transport agent but also a particularly effective agent of erosion; - To visualize one of the modalities of cliff retreat with the creation of a wave notch which propagates instability towards the upper part of the cliff face. This instability generates mass movements coming from the whole cliff face...|$|E
