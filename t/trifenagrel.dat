40|$|The {{synthesis}} and preliminary biological {{investigation of}} three methylene bridged heterocyclic analogues of <b>trifenagrel,</b> a potent inhibitor of arachidonate-induced aggregation of platelets, is reported. The {{synthesis of the}} compounds {{is based on the}} cyclocondensation reaction of a tricyclic 1, 2 -diketone with an appropriate aldehyde, hydrazide or a diamine to form an imidazole, a 1, 2, 4 -triazine or a pyrazine moiety respectively. In comparison to <b>trifenagrel,</b> its methylene-bridged analogue had much reduced activity, while its pyrazine analogue was devoid of activity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} solid catalyst, mercaptopropylsilica (MPS), {{has been}} prepared by a modified procedure {{in water and}} its structure confirmed by solid state carbon- 13 CP-MAS NMR spectrum. This catalyst has been efficiently utilized for the synthesis {{of a wide variety}} of tri-, tetrasubstituted imidazoles and their bis-analogues at room temperature. The protocol was further explored for the synthesis of the drug <b>trifenagrel...</b>|$|E
40|$|A simple, high {{yielding}} {{synthesis of}} tri (3 a-i) and tetrasubstituted (4 a-g) imidazols from aldehydes is described. The cornerstone of this methodology involves the condensation of NH 4 OAc, substituted aldehydes, and benzoin, which is synthesized in situ from aldehydes catalyzed by N-heterocyclic carbine (NHC), under microwave irradiation in water to afford trisubstituted imidazoles (3 a-i). If arylamine is {{added in the}} solution, tetrasubstituted imidazoles (4 a-g) can be obtained. Lepidilines B and <b>trifenagrel</b> are also synthesized in high yield using this procedure. All the experiment deta are {{in agreement with the}} literature...|$|E
