5|$|McGregor {{was married}} to Jessie, and the couple had a {{daughter}} and a son, also named Jessie and William. A <b>teetotaller,</b> McGregor was {{a supporter of the}} Temperance movement, and was active in the local branch of the Liberal Party until his membership lapsed in 1882 due to the increasing amount of time he devoted to football. He was involved in the early attempts to establish a baseball league in the United Kingdom, and served as the honorary treasurer of the Baseball Association of Great Britain and Ireland. Despite his commitment to sport, he held desperately on to his drapery business throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|He married Ellen Negus in 1901, and {{the couple}} had two daughters. He was a {{supporter}} of the Liberal Party. He ran businesses throughout his career, with little success, and was declared bankrupt in July 1909 after his outfitting shop was damaged by fire. During the 1910s he ran a public house (despite being a <b>teetotaller)</b> and later pursued an interest in the film industry by buying shares in numerous Stretford cinemas in the 1930s. He also starred in 1926 picture The Ball of Fortune, playing himself as a football trainer; the film received generally positive reviews. In 1928, together with former colleague Charlie Roberts he became a coach for the ambitious but short-lived Manchester Central. Meredith's son-in-law, former City captain Charlie Pringle, was a player. He retained a passion for football, and spent much of his retirement discussing the game with former colleagues and regulars at his hotel, the Stretford Road Hotel, which he ran from 1930 to 1945. He rarely missed the chance to attend a Wales game in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Holst {{wrote the}} music for an {{operetta}} {{in the style of}} Gilbert and Sullivan, Lansdown Castle, or The Sorcerer of Tewkesbury. The piece was performed at Cheltenham Corn Exchange in February 1893; it was well received and its success encouraged him to persevere with composing. He applied for a scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London, but the composition scholarship for that year was won by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. Holst was accepted as a non-scholarship student, and Adolph borrowed £100 to cover the first year's expenses. Holst left Cheltenham for London in May 1893. Money was tight, and partly from frugality and partly from his own inclination he became a vegetarian and a <b>teetotaller.</b> Two years later he was finally granted a scholarship, which slightly eased his financial difficulties, but he retained his austere personal regime.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{moved to}} Drumcondra in October 1919, where Thomas {{found a job}} as a bank cashier. The job did not pay well, but the two managed on his meagre wages. In early 1920, they moved to Grove Road in the Rathmines district, and Brendan was born in October. Soon afterwards, Brendan and his mother were nearly killed when caught in the cross-fire between the controversial, mostly British {{temporary}} constables employed by the Royal Irish Constabulary—Black and Tans—and the Irish Republican Army (IRA). In 1921, Brendan's brother Raymond was born, followed by sisters Clare and Monica, and a brother, Kevin. The household was somewhat split over religious and political issues. Their father was a <b>teetotaller</b> and a strict Catholic. Their mother, however, encouraged the elder brothers to adopt a more liberal leaning in life. Brendan was educated at Synge Street and Marlborough Street. At 10, Brendan showed a keen interest in sport, particularly rugby.|$|E
5|$|Meredith {{was born}} in 1874 in Chirk, a small mining town in Denbighshire, Wales, just south of Wrexham. He started work at Black Park Colliery as a pit pony driver {{at the age of}} 12. His family were Primitive Methodists, and Meredith himself {{remained}} a lifelong <b>teetotaller.</b> He spent eight years working in the mines, and worked during a tough time for the industry, enduring a 25% pay cut which led to strike action in 1893; this experience helped to shape his political views, which would become significant later in his life. An interest in football was kindled by his elder brothers. Elias, the eldest, was a train driver for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. His work allowed him to take Meredith to watch professional teams such as Everton. Football was a keen pastime for the miners, and the standard of amateur teams from towns and villages in north east Wales was high as a result; Chirk won the Welsh Cup five times between 1887 and 1894, with miners making up {{a large proportion of the}} team. All the Meredith brothers played football, but Sam, two years older than Billy, was the first to make an impression. He left Chirk to attempt a professional career, and went on to play for Stoke City as a full-back.|$|E
5|$|The next USEE {{match at}} Leeds Holbeck {{followed}} the second Gentlemen v Players fixture and began on Thursday, 11 July. The opposition had 18 players and included the Yorkshire batsman Louis Hall, the lay preacher who was famously the sole <b>teetotaller</b> in the Yorkshire team at that time. Besides Grace himself, other noted {{players in the}} USEE team were Fred Grace, Billy Midwinter, Henry Charlwood and James Southerton. Grace took 20 wickets in the match and, batting at number six (he was habitually an opening batsman despite his status as an all-rounder), scored 22 and 73. The USEE won by 193 runs. The railways served Grace well in July and he was immediately away north to Newcastle upon Tyne for the next engagement against Eighteen of Newcastle upon Tyne, starting on Monday 15 July. The Newcastle team included Dick Barlow, Alex Watson and Arnold Fothergill so Grace may have bitten off {{more than he could}} chew. Fothergill dismissed him for 5 in the first innings after Newcastle had made a sizeable 251 (Barlow 42). The USEE were humiliatingly bowled out for 66 and had to follow on. Grace could only score 14 in a second innings total of 116 and Newcastle won the match in two days by an innings and 69 runs.|$|E
25|$|Jim Murphy {{is married}} with three {{children}} - Cara, Matthew and Daniel. He captained the Parliamentary Football Team. He is a vegetarian and a <b>teetotaller.</b>|$|E
25|$|Corrall {{went on to}} the {{first-class}} umpires {{list for}} the 1952 season and stayed there for six seasons, returning for occasional matches in the following two seasons. Later, although a lifelong <b>teetotaller,</b> he ran a pub.|$|E
25|$|Trumper was modest, {{retiring}} and generous. A <b>teetotaller</b> and non-smoker, {{his general}} conduct {{was an example}} to his fellow players, {{and he was a}} great favourite with the public both in England and Australia. Monty Noble had no hesitation in calling him the world's greatest batsman, a genius without compare.|$|E
25|$|He lived {{over the}} shop in Scott's Market (renamed Bogyoke Market after independence) as a boarder, {{doubling}} as librarian, and taught night classes to children from poor {{families in the}} neighbourhood. A keen sportsman, he played football for the Municipal team, exercised regularly and remained a <b>teetotaller</b> all his life.|$|E
25|$|Gayle {{was married}} to ex-professional {{football}}er and football pundit Mark Bright for 10 years, and had one son, Isaiah, with him. The couple separated in 2007. They officially divorced on 18 April 2008. Gayle is godmother to {{the daughter of the}} actress Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence, who played her on-screen mother, Etta Tavernier, in EastEnders. Gayle is a <b>teetotaller</b> and doesn't eat meat. On 4 August 2011 it was announced on The Wright Stuff that she was pregnant. On Twitter, she announced the birth of her son, Luke, on 2 November 2011.|$|E
25|$|The jury heard {{allegations}} that Sheridan had visited a swingers clubs in Manchester {{and engaged in}} adulterous affairs with two women. Sheridan, who {{claims to be a}} <b>teetotaller,</b> reportedly drank champagne and consumed cocaine during an extramarital liaison. Sheridan denies drinking the champagne and the claim of substance abuse. Eleven members of the SSP's executive committee testified that he admitted in an Executive committee meeting to attending a swingers club with women, but another four members of the SSP who were present at that Executive meeting backed Sheridan's claim that he made no such admission at that meeting.|$|E
25|$|Neil Livingstone was a Sunday {{school teacher}} and <b>teetotaller</b> who handed out Christian tracts on his travels as a {{door-to-door}} tea salesman. He extensively read books on theology, travel, and missionary enterprises. This rubbed {{off on the}} young David, who became an avid reader, but he also loved scouring the countryside for animal, plant, and geological specimens in local limestone quarries. Neil feared that science books were undermining Christianity and attempted to force his son to read nothing but theology, but David's deep interest in nature and science led him to investigate the relationship between religion and science. In 1832, he read Philosophy of a Future State, written by Thomas Dick, and he found the rationale {{that he needed to}} reconcile faith and science and, apart from the Bible, this book was perhaps his greatest philosophical influence.|$|E
25|$|In some matters, Lever was keen {{to allow}} the {{residents}} of Port Sunlight a degree of democratic control, and this seems to {{have led to a}} common conviction that he was in favour of women’s suffrage: a belief that possibly stems from a situation arising in connection the Bridge Inn, a Port Sunlight temperance “pub” that was opened in I900. Lever was a lifelong <b>teetotaller,</b> and he naturally assumed that the Bridge would be “dry”. Within two years of its opening, however, representations were made to change its status to a licensed house. Lever promptly announced that he would not impose his own views, and that the issue would be decided by a referendum; insisting somewhat unconventionally for that time that women would take part. With the added proviso that the Bridge would only become a true British “pub” if a supermajority of 75% was in favour, Lever probably felt confident that the outcome would support his abstemious sentiments, but in the event more than 80% voted for a liquor license and even though some people petitioned Lever urging him to use his absolute authority in Port Sunlight and ignore the referendum, he refused to do so.|$|E
500|$|Ferens was {{a lifelong}} <b>teetotaller</b> {{and a strong}} {{advocate}} of temperance. In his youth he attended Band of Hope meetings. In 1913 he was elected treasurer of the United Kingdom Alliance.|$|E
500|$|Raised as a Methodist, Jackson was {{a lifelong}} <b>teetotaller</b> and non-smoker. [...] He {{attended}} Birchgrove Public and Rozelle Junior Technical schools and represented New South Wales Schoolboys at football and cricket. Football talent {{ran in the}} family: his uncle Jimmy Jackson and cousin James Jackson were both professional footballers in Scotland and England, the latter captaining Liverpool.|$|E
500|$|Macartney married Anna Bruce, a schoolteacher, at Chatswood Presbyterian Church in December 1921. At the time, the NSW Railway & Tramway Magazine {{noted that}} he was a [...] "strict <b>teetotaller</b> and non-gambler" [...] who loved his pipe, tennis and music. After his marriage, Macartney {{described}} himself as a civil servant while he was not engaged in cricketing activities. Like most Australian cricketers of his era, Macartney was Protestant, and a freemason.|$|E
500|$|Edwards was a <b>teetotaller</b> {{and outside}} {{football}} {{was known as}} a very private individual, whose interests included fishing, playing cards and visiting the cinema. Although he attended dances with his team mates he was never confident in social surroundings. He was described by Jimmy Murphy as an [...] "unspoilt boy" [...] and retained a strong Black Country accent which his team mates would impersonate. He was once stopped by the police for riding his bicycle without lights and fined five shillings by the authorities and two weeks' wages by his club.|$|E
500|$|Harold Larwood {{was born}} on 14 November 1904 in the Nottinghamshire village of Nuncargate, near the coal mining town of Kirkby-in-Ashfield. He was the fourth of five sons born to Robert Larwood, a miner, and his wife Mary, née Sharman. Robert {{was a man of}} rigid principles, a disciplinarian <b>teetotaller</b> who was {{treasurer}} of the local Methodist chapel. His chief pastime was playing cricket for the village team, which he captained. Harold Larwood's biographer Duncan Hamilton writes that for Robert, cricket represented, [...] "along with his dedication to God... the core of his life".|$|E
500|$|When {{the gods}} return, they are furious and tell Thespis {{that he has}} [...] "deranged the whole scheme of society". [...] Thespis says that they should calm down, as the list of mortals' {{complaints}} {{is about to be}} read. [...] The gods watch incognito as Mercury presents the complaints: The actors have ruined the weather; caused strife among the nations; and there is no wine, since Bacchus is a <b>teetotaller.</b> [...] After listening to these grievances, the gods angrily shed their disguises. [...] The actors beg to stay on Olympus, but Jupiter punishes them for their folly by sending them back to earth cursed as [...] "eminent tragedians, whom no one ever goes to see".|$|E
500|$|Many nicknames {{attached}} {{themselves to}} Collins, including [...] "Lucky" [...] and [...] "Horseshoe" [...] {{as a result}} of his reputation for fortune, especially when it came to tossing the coin. His players called him [...] "Maudy" [...] (probably because of his left-handedness) and [...] "Nutty"; it is unclear if this was because he used his [...] "nut" [...] (head) or was a hard nut to crack. Mailey nicknamed him [...] "The squirrel", claiming that Collins eyes glowed at night, enabling him to see better at night than by day. Collins has a bohemian character who enjoyed all night poker and baccarat sessions and evenings at the opera. [...] "Poker Face", indeed, was another of his nicknames. He had a light tenor voice himself and would sometimes sing at parties. While in the army, Collins became a chain smoker but he remained a <b>teetotaller,</b> save for an occasional glass of celebratory champagne.|$|E
500|$|On 5March 1917, {{shortly after}} commencing {{operations}} with No.1 Squadron, Williams narrowly avoided crash-landing when his engine stopped {{while he was}} bombing the railway terminus at Tel el Sheria. At first believing {{that he had been}} struck by enemy fire, he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off. Within 500feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine back on and return to base. On 21April, Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant Adrian Cole, having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry whilst under [...] "intense anti-aircraft fire"; these two actions earned him the Distinguished Service Order for [...] "conspicuous gallantry". He was promoted major in May and given command of No.1 Squadron, which was re-equipped with Bristol Fighters later that year. [...] "Now for the first time," [...] wrote Williams, [...] "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with our enemy in the air." [...] His men knew him as a <b>teetotaller</b> and non-smoker, whose idea of swearing was an occasional [...] "Darn me!".|$|E
500|$|In March 1957, Hancock was one {{of three}} candidates, along with Air Vice Marshals Frederick Scherger and Allan Walters, touted as {{possible}} successors to Air Marshal Sir John McCauley as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. Scherger gained selection, and Hancock was posted in June to Malaya as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) No. 224 Group RAF, responsible for all Commonwealth air forces in the region. Though fastidious in appearance and a strict <b>teetotaller,</b> he was known for his enthusiasm in meeting staff and as [...] "an indefatigable participant in mess functions and games". He also made a point of getting out to units in the field, taking every opportunity to fly himself around his command. For his [...] "distinguished service in Malaya", Hancock was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 9December 1958. He returned to Australia in July 1959 to serve as AOC Operational Command (now Air Command). When Scherger's term as CAS was due to complete, Hancock and Walters were once more put forward to the Minister for Air as potential replacements. His [...] "professional ability, operational experience and personal qualities" [...] being deemed more appropriate for the role, Hancock was promoted to air marshal and took over as CAS in May 1961. In June, he met with his opposite numbers in the Army and Navy at a Chiefs of Staff Committee conference to discuss the necessity of Australia acquiring nuclear weapons; the chiefs agreed that the probability such a capability would be required was remote but that it should remain an option under certain circumstances, a position the defence forces maintained during the ensuing decade. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours, gazetted on 2June.|$|E

2500|$|Askew {{was born}} in Muskogee, Oklahoma, {{one of the six}} {{children}} of Leon G. Askew and Alberta (O'Donovan) Askew. His parents divorced, in part because of what Askew said was his father's [...] "serious drinking problem." [...] Two of his brothers later had similar problems. Askew chose to be a lifelong <b>teetotaller</b> and non-smoker.|$|E
2500|$|Yorkshire to 1883 was popularly {{viewed as}} a team of gifted players with a drink problem and was {{sometimes}} described as [...] "ten drunks and a parson", the odd man out being Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined the club in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first <b>teetotaller</b> ever to play for it.|$|E
2500|$|Morcom Snr. {{initially}} travelled to Reedy Creek to run {{a copper}} mine, then joined the Victorian gold rush before moving to Adelaide with his family, where he purchased a hotel in Hindley St, naming it [...] "Morcom's Temperance Hotel". In Adelaide he was a leading member in the local tent of the teetotal Independent Order of Rechabites, which held its meetings at his hotel. Morcom Jnr. also became a staunch <b>teetotaller,</b> and was described as having [...] "very steady habits".|$|E
2500|$|Though {{playing a}} raging alcoholic, Grant himself is a <b>teetotaller</b> with a health {{condition}} preventing him from properly processing alcohol. He had therefore never been drunk prior {{to making the}} film. Robinson decided {{that it would be}} impossible for Grant to play the character without having ever experienced inebriation and a hangover, and thus [...] "forced" [...] the actor on a drinking binge. Grant has stated that he was [...] "violently sick" [...] after each drink, and found the experience as a whole deeply unpleasant.|$|E
2500|$|Hafey was {{prepared}} to back his players and build their confidence, contributing to a strong team spirit. His approach differed from most successful coaches who remained aloof from their players. He focussed on the team's camaraderie, in many cases becoming intimately involved with {{the lives of his}} charges and he sought to mix with them in social situations even though he was a <b>teetotaller</b> and non-smoker. All four teams that he coached improved immediately after Hafey's appointment. However, he also [...] "lost" [...] his players several times during his career as they rebelled against his training requirements.|$|E

He is married to Patricia [...] "Trish" [...] Lauderdale and has two daughters, Jemma and Georgia. Jemma was born in August 2003, and Georgia in July 2006. Lauderdale was a finalist in the Miss South Africa pageant in the early '90s and also worked for MTN, a South African telecom company. He is a <b>teetotaller</b> and a devout Christian. Pollock is a graduate of the University of Natal with a bachelor's degree in commerce.|$|E
2500|$|The Lever {{family were}} Congregationalists and James Lever, a <b>teetotaller</b> and a non-smoker, applied its {{principles}} {{in his business}} {{life as well as}} in his personal life. In accordance with nonconformist tenets, the Lever family held frequent bible readings at home, and were regular worshipers at the local chapel. Thus, William’s circle of friends tended to comprise children of similar backgrounds and beliefs. Among these was Elizabeth Ellen Hulme (Dec 1850 – 24 July 1913) whose family also resided on Wood Street. In the tradition of the nineteenth-century well-to-do middle classes, William paid court to Elizabeth over several years and, when the financial circumstances allowed, he formally proposed marriage. On 17 April 1874, after a two-year engagement, they were married at the Church of St Andrew and St George (then Congregational, now United Reformed) on St Georges Road, Bolton.|$|E
2500|$|James Smith was an {{unemployed}} divorcé {{living in the}} Gorton area of Manchester. Described by acquaintances as [...] "house-proud and well-groomed", he was a <b>teetotaller</b> and non-smoker. His marriage had ended after ten years in 1980 due to his violence towards his wife. He had then commenced an affair between 19801982 with 20-year-old Tina Watson, whom he [...] "used as a punch-bag", even subjecting her to severe beatings while {{she was pregnant with}} his child. She said: [...] "At first it was now and again; just a little tap. But {{in the end it was}} every day. He would smack me in the face or hit me over the head with an ashtray. He would kick me in the legs or between the legs." [...] Watson managed to escape from the relationship, during which Smith had also attempted to drown her while she was bathing. In 1982 Smith then began a relationship with 15-year-old Wendy Mottershead, who was also a victim of his violence. In one attack he held her head under water in the kitchen sink in an attempt to drown her.|$|E
2500|$|Clark often {{expressed}} {{pleasure at}} the flogging of convicts, although rarely performed the punishment himself. After one incident, {{in which a}} particularly troublesome female convict, Elizbaeth Dudgeon, was punished for insulting a guard officer, he noted [...] "she has long been fishing for it, which she has at last got to her heart's content". He did, however, occasionally empathise with the convicts, especially when they were mistreated. Shortly after landing on Norfolk Island, Clark and Robert Kellow came across some convicts, including some women with their children, who {{had been forced to}} sleep in the open far from the main townsite, adequate accommodation being lacking: [...] "on the Road we met a great many of the Convicts both Men and Women Particular the women that have young children Who told me that the have been obliged to Sleep in the woods all night for the could not get into Town, poor Devils how they are Kick about from one place to a nother". Unusually for the time, Clark was effectively a <b>teetotaller,</b> preferring to drink only lemonade. He often privately chastised his fellow officers' drinking habits, boasting in his diary that he had only been intoxicated once—at his wedding.|$|E
