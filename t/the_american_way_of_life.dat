25|$|Kroc and the McDonald {{brothers}} feuded {{over control}} of the business, as documented in Kroc's autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was demolished in 1976 (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo restaurant chain. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, as well as a McDonald's and Route 66 museum. With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Japan {{would take}} {{advantage}} of Hitler's war in Europe to advance its own ambitions in the Far East. The Tripartite Pact guaranteed assistance if a signatory was attacked by any country not already involved {{in conflict with the}} signatory; this implicitly meant the U.S. By joining the pact, Japan gained geopolitical power and sent the unmistakable message that any U.S. military intervention risked war on both of her shores—with Germany and Italy on the Atlantic, and with Japan on the Pacific. The Roosevelt administration would not be dissuaded; believing <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> would be endangered if Europe and the Far East fell under military dictatorship, it committed to help the British and Chinese through loans of money and materiel, and pledged sufficient continuing aid to ensure their survival. Thus, the United States slowly moved from being a neutral power to one preparing for war.|$|E
25|$|However, the Communist Party's early {{labor and}} {{organizing}} successes did not last. As the decades progressed, the combined {{effects of the}} second Red Scare, McCarthyism, Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 Secret Speech denouncing the previous decades of Joseph Stalin's rule and the adversities of the continued Cold War mentality, steadily weakened the party's internal structure and confidence. The party's membership in the Comintern and its close adherence to the political positions of the Soviet Union made the party appear to most Americans as not only a threatening, subversive domestic entity, {{but also as a}} foreign agent fundamentally alien to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Internal and external crises swirled together, to the point where members who did not end up in prison for party activities tended either to disappear quietly from its ranks or to adopt more moderate political positions at odds with the Communists' party line. By 1957, membership had dwindled to less than 10,000, of whom some 1,500 were informants for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).|$|E

A Democratic Party supporter until the 1940 presidential election, when he switched allegiance to the Republicans, he became a generous donor to ThomasE.Dewey's 1944 bid for the presidency.

In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Disney testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike led by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|Sales {{of coins}} at the Exposition were {{handled by the}} Commission; those by mail were dealt with by the Franklin Trust Company. [...] The half dollar was priced at $1, and the quarter eagle at $4; however they did not sell well and the Commission's belief it could sell the entire mintage proved wildly optimistic. Although six million people visited the Exposition, 859,408 of the 1,000,000 half dollars were {{returned}} to the mint for melting. Similarly, 154,207 quarter eagles of the mintage of 200,000 were returned for melting. This {{did not take place}} all at once: 420,000 half dollars had been returned by January 1930, with the rest later. According to coin dealer B. Max Mehl in his 1937 volume on commemoratives, [...] "Philadelphia with a population of over 2,000,000 people... could and should have sold a greater number of coins". Arlie R. Slabaugh wrote in his 1975 book on the same subject, [...] "we have been called complacent about our independence and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in recent years—judging by the sale of these coins, it must have been much worse in 1926!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Captain Jack, {{like most}} army officers, looked upon {{reservations}} as temporary reserves where Indians {{would begin to}} learn about <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> [...] He believed that Indians were capable of great change and that private land ownership would lead to their ultimate assimilation into American society. [...] Captain Jack also believed Native Americans would observe modern life and different cultures, acquire new skills and customs, and change {{at their own pace}} and terms. Crawford was angry with the Indians about Custer and the Little Big Horn, and his early performances and poems portray the Indian as a dangerous but worthy opponent. [...] His later performances and poems are more sympathetic, and focus on shared universal emotions with whites. [...] Crawford held progressive views of Indians, including the sanctioning of interracial marriages, which he depicted in poetry and short stories. Captain Jack promoted Indian education and opposed off-reservation boarding schools. He believed that education should be provided close to home [...] "under the eyes of the parents, who must thereby learn to respect education. [...] "He had witnessed [...] "a child torn from his screaming mother's arms and hurried away" [...] and asked a reporter, [...] "Don't you suppose that mother has the same feeling in her breast for her young as your mother had for you?" [...] In 1889, Crawford served as special agent for the U.S. Justice Department of Justice, spending the next four years investigating illegal liquor traffic and fighting alcoholism on Indian reservations in the western states and territories.|$|E
2500|$|Possible {{reasons are}} firstly, {{the fact the}} English taught to Filipinos was the “egalitarian” English of the New World, and that the Americans who colonized the Philippines {{encountered}} lowland societies that already used Iberian linguistic class markers like [...] "Don" [...] and [...] "Doña." [...] Secondly, the fundamental contradiction of the American colonial project. The Americans who occupied the Philippines justified their actions through the rhetoric of [...] "benevolent assimilation". In other words, they were only subjugating Filipinos to teach them values like American egalitarianism, which {{is the opposite of}} colonial anti-equality. Thirdly, the power of American colonialism lays in its emphasis on education – an education that supposedly exposed Filipinos to the [...] "wonders" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Through education, the American colonial state bred a new elite of Filipinos trained in a new, more [...] "modern", American system. People with advanced degrees like law or engineering were at the apex of this system. Their prestige, as such, not only rested on their purported intelligence, but also their mastery of the colonizer’s way of life. This, Lisandro Claudio suspects, {{is the source of the}} magical and superstitious attachment Filipinos have to attorneys, architects and engineers. The language they use is still haunted by their colonial experience. They linguistically privilege professionals because their colonizers made us value a certain kind of white-collar work. Again, even expatriate professionals in the Philippines were affected by these reasons when they resided and married a Filipino or were naturalized so it's not unusual for them to be addressed Filipino style.|$|E

2500|$|The East German regime imposed an {{official}} ideology that {{was reflected in}} all its media and all the schools. Anyone who indicated the least deviation invited {{a visit from the}} Stasi (secret police). The official line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and in Dimitrov's theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of financial capitalism. The official party line stated that the United States had caused the breakup of the coalition against Hitler. It was now the bulwark of reaction worldwide, with a heavy reliance on warmongering {{for the benefit of the}} [...] "terrorist international of murderers on Wall Street". East Germans were told they had a heroic role to play as a front-line against the evil Americans. However Schnoor argues that few East Germans believed it. They had seen enough of the Russians since 1945—a half-million Soviet troops were still stationed in East Germany as late as 1989. Furthermore, they were exposed to information from relatives in the West, as well as the American Radio Free Europe broadcasts, and West German media. The official Communist media ridiculed the modernism and cosmopolitanism of American culture, and denigrated the features of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> especially jazz music and rock 'n roll. The East German regime relied heavily on its tight control of youth organizations to rally them, with scant success, against American popular culture. The older generations were more concerned with the poor quality of food, housing, and clothing, which stood in dramatic contrast to the prosperity of West Germany. Professionals in East Germany were watched for any sign of deviation from the party line; their privileges were at risk. The solution was to either comply or flee to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the crackdown and the Berlin wall of 1961.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he won the}} NIT-NACDA Athletic Directors Award, {{he said in his}} speech: [...] "I {{have always}} been a great believer in sports as part of our American way of living[...] [...] [...] [...] I am {{reminded}} of an experience I had of 40 years ago which brought home the real sudden realization of how important we are, and {{how important it is to}} have sports in our American way of life. I mentioned 40 years ago, that would bring us back to March of 1946. At that time I was involved in some high school work in Toledo, Ohio, as a football and a basketball coach. But in order to augment my income, because we weren't getting paid a great deal in those days, I was doing some officiating. I was very fortunate to be chosen by the Big Ten Conference to work the Final Four of the NCAA, which in that year was held in Madison Square Garden. I went a day or two early so I could watch the finals of the NIT Tournament. The two teams were Utah and Kentucky. On the Utah team was a little Japanese-American boy by the name of Walter Misaka. On the Kentucky team was a great basketball player, number one in the country, by the name of Ralph Beard. Misaka was about 5'10" [...] and probably weighed around 160 pounds. Beard was about 6'2" [...] or 6'3" [...] and weighed about 190 He was called 'Mr. Everything' in basketball. Nobody had ever heard of Walter, but in the man to man defense that the Utah coach, Peterson, used against Kentucky that night, Misaka was chosen to guard Ralph Beard. He held Ralph Beard to 3 points, one basket and one free throw, and as a result of the great work that this little guy did on Ralph Beard, and of course, the work of his teammates, Utah won the game and won the National Invitation Tournament Championship. Just before the end of the ballgame, with just about a minute to play, the Utah coach took Misaka out of the game. About 14,000 people in the Garden that night rose to a person and stood on their feet and cheered the great effort turned out by the little Japanese-American boy. As I reflected on it later, I thought what a great display of how sports are in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Remember, I mentioned the date was March, 1946. We had just finished a war with Japan. There were people in the audience who had lost loved ones in the Japanese conflict. There wasn't much love in the heart of any of those people or any American for that matter, for anyone of Japanese ancestry. Yet they could cast aside all of their dislike for the Japanese race and stand on their feet at a sports contest and cheer the efforts of a little Japanese-American boy. Since that time I realize how great our sports program is in America, and how much it means to the American way of life." ...|$|E
