5|$|Food is {{essential}} to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources. This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness—everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> costs of food packaging, transport (now {{a major part of}} global trade) and retail. Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture, organic farming and more sustainable business practices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Pay-per-use {{service by}} Cloud service {{providers}} has attracted {{customers in the}} recent past and is still evolving. Since <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> being dealt within Clouds are non-storable and <b>the</b> physical <b>resources</b> need to be replaced very often, pricing the service {{in a way that would}} return profit on the initial capital investments to the service providers has been a major issue. Moreover, to maintain Quality of Service (QoS) to customers who reserve <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> in advance and may or may not be using <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> at a future date makes <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> wasted, if not allocated to other on-demand users. Therefore, a need for a mechanism to guarantee <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> to reserved users whenever they need them, while keeping <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> busy all <b>the</b> time is in very high demand. The concept of federation of Cloud service providers has been proposed in <b>the</b> past wherein <b>resources</b> are traded between the providers whenever need arises. We propose a financial option based Cloud resources pricing model to address the above situation. This model allows a provider to hedge the critical and risky situation of reserved users requesting <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> while all <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> have been allocated to other users, by trading (buying or outsourcing) resources from other service providers in the Cloud federation. We show that using financial option based contracts between Cloud providers in a Cloud federation, providers are able to enhance profit and acquire <b>the</b> needed <b>resources</b> at any given time. It would also help creating a trust and goodwill from the clients on the Cloud service providers by less number of QoS violation...|$|R
