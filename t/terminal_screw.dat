50|$|This cycle {{results from}} the {{connection}} loosening slightly, with a reduced contact area at the connection leading to overheating, and allowing intermetallic steel/aluminum compounds to be formed between the conductor and the <b>terminal</b> <b>screw.</b> This resulted in a higher resistance junction, leading to additional overheating. Although many believe that oxidation was the issue, {{studies have shown that}} oxidation was not significant in these cases.|$|E
5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, a bootleg {{ground is}} an electrical ground that is wired from the neutral {{side of a}} receptacle or light fixture in an older 2-wire home. This essentially connects the neutral side of the receptacle to the casing of an appliance or lamp. It can be a hazard because the neutral wire is a current-carrying conductor, which means the casing can become energized. In addition, a fault condition to a bootleg ground will not trip a GFCI breaker or a receptacle that is wired from the load side of a GFCI receptacle. Bootleg grounding is illegal and against code in many places. A safer alternative Sec. 406.4(D)(2)(b) if a grounding connection is not practicable (where a local electrical code allows it) is to install a GFCI and leave the grounding <b>terminal</b> <b>screw</b> unconnected, then place a label that says [...] "No Equipment Ground" [...] on the GFCI and a marking that states “GFCI Protected” and “No Equipment Ground” on all downstream receptacles.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes a 3-way 2-circuit switch is {{incorporated}} {{together with a}} regular socket, {{to be used as}} the main lamp socket in a lamp with a night light. In this configuration, the switched lamp one live terminal for the night light socket is exposed externally on the base of the socket, to be wired to the remote candelabra socket. Hence, this type of socket has a Hot terminal, a Neutral terminal, and a switched Hot terminal. This creates a confusing situation in which a keyed 3-way socket (which has a 3-contact socket at the top of it) has only two <b>terminal</b> <b>screws,</b> while a night-light socket (which does not have a 3-contact socket at the top) has three <b>terminal</b> <b>screws</b> on the base.|$|R
50|$|Many {{electrical}} devices {{used in the}} 1960s had smaller plain steel <b>terminal</b> <b>screws,</b> which made the attachment of the aluminum wires being used {{at that time to}} these devices much more vulnerable to problems. In the late 1960s, a device specification known as CU/AL (meaning copper-aluminum) was created that specified standards for devices intended for use with aluminum wire. Some of these devices used larger undercut <b>screw</b> <b>terminals</b> to more securely hold the wire.|$|R

50|$|Improper installation, or poor workmanship, includes: not {{abrading}} {{the wires}} and applying a corrosion inhibitor; not wrapping wires around terminal screws; wrapping wires around <b>terminal</b> <b>screws</b> the wrong way; and inadequate torque on the connection screws. There {{can also be}} problems with connections made with too much torque on the connection screw as it causes damage to the wire, particularly with the softer aluminum wire.|$|R
5000|$|However, some {{manufacturers}} of CO/ALR devices recommend periodically checking/tightening the <b>terminal</b> <b>screws</b> on these devices {{which can be}} hazardous for unqualified individuals to attempt, and there is criticism of their use as a permanent repair as some CO/ALR devices have failed in tests when connected to [...] "old technology" [...] aluminum wire. [...] Furthermore, just installing CO/ALR devices (switches and receptacles) doesn't address potential hazards associated with other connections such as those at ceiling fans, lights and equipment.|$|R

40|$|A co-planar tab-slot type of {{interconnect}} demonstrator for connecting {{power switching}} devices and DC bus capacitors {{has been designed}} and constructed, aimed at low inductance switching. The demonstrator is composed of a double-sided tab connector and a dual polarity slot. This type of interconnect eliminates the use of <b>screw</b> <b>terminal</b> connection between a power module and the DC bus {{as well as between}} the DC bus and power capacitors, thus serves to maintain a coplanar current profile throughout the power distribution path. Parasitic analysis both in impedance testing and in Finite Element simulation suggests that the inductance in the bus loop of the demonstrator is approximately half of that achieved in an equally dimensioned busbar with conventional <b>screw</b> <b>terminals...</b>|$|R
50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. <b>Terminal</b> <b>screws</b> loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit breaker or fuse panel could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. Proper wire terminations inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|R
