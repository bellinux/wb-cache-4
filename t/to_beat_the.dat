5|$|Texas' win, by a {{score of}} 25–22, was the lowest scoring game Texas would {{experience}} all season, {{both in terms of}} points scored by Texas and total points. Fourth-ranked OSU became the highest-ranked non-conference opponent the Longhorns had ever beaten at an opponent's home stadium. The previous high came in 1983 when third-ranked Texas pulled off a 20–7 upset versus fifth-ranked Auburn. Texas became the first non-conference opponent <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Buckeyes in Ohio Stadium since 1990, putting an end to a 36-game home victory string over non-conference opponents. The Longhorns also were the first team <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Buckeyes in a night game at The Horseshoe and it was UT's 10thstraight victory in a night-game road contest. ESPN and College Football Rivals each named the game one of the best football games of the season.|$|E

It was a fitting way to send off long-serving coach Robbie Deans before he departed to coach Australia. It was also the last game for Crusaders stalwarts Caleb Ralph and former captain Reuben Thorne. In July that year former captain Todd Blackadder was appointed Crusaders coach, and his former teammates Mark Hammett and Daryl Gibson were appointed as assistants.|$|E
5|$|Babangida {{spent two}} more seasons at Roda JC. Babangida's 10 league goals in 1995–96, {{made him the}} club's top scorer that season. In 1995, Babangida made his European debut, scoring a goal in the UEFA Cup first-round win over Olimpija Ljubljana, Roda's first European {{campaign}} in five years. Roda went on <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Slovenian side 5–2 on aggregate, but lost to Benfica in the second round. Solid performances at both international and club level led to interest from Dutch side Ajax, as Louis van Gaal was looking to replace Babangida's compatriot Finidi George, who had recently departed to Real Betis.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} better {{team for the}} {{majority}} of the match, Liverpool were unable <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Independiente defence, with their shooting in front of goal being the culprit. Both sides questioned some of the referee's decisions. Liverpool believed they should have had two penalties, while Independiente felt that the assistant referee's decisions were questionable. Incidentally, the referee had served half of his two match ban handed out by the Brazilian Football Association.|$|E

Furthermore, we find that funds <b>beating</b> <b>the</b> median of fund performance show no significant decrease in risk.

On 30 January 1918 Mannerheim proclaimed to Russian soldiers in Finland that the White army did not fight against Russia: {{the goal of the}} White campaign was <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>the</b> Finnish Red rebels and the Russian troops supporting them.|$|E
