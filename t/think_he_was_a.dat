5|$|Philo of Alexandria, Josephus and Seneca {{state that}} Caligula was insane, but {{describe}} this madness as a personality trait {{that came through}} experience. Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from. According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> god. Philo of Alexandria reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37. Juvenal reports {{he was given a}} magic potion that drove him insane.|$|E

Richardson reported that he enjoyed working with Jude and Jessica Croft-Lane, the young actors who played Lucas and Leah. He reported that Jude was camera shy and liked to play with camera equipment during filming and that he told Croft-Lane that his name was actually Ste. Richardson concluded the storyline was different and he felt it gave him a chance to showcase his acting abilities.|$|E

25|$|Mickey Curtis said, {{also in a}} Criterion Collection interview, {{that he did not}} <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good actor, but Ichikawa said he {{just needed}} to act naturally. Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the {{characters}} in the story have eaten very little. Ichikawa specifically told each actor how he wanted them to react, and would not rehearse. Ichikawa expressed that the narrator (Tamura) could not be a cannibal because then he would have crossed the ultimate low. Ichikawa consulted with his wife, Natto Wada, and they decided against having him eat human flesh. As a result, Tamura never eats any in the film because his teeth are falling out.|$|E
25|$|Jandamarra The Play (2008) {{was sold}} out before its opening season premiere at the Perth International Arts Festival. As the {{director}} of Bunuba Films since 2000, Oscar {{was one of the}} driving forces in the company's marathon journey to bring Jandamarra's story to the stage. Jandamarra, a Bunuba warrior born in 1873, was famous for leading his people in an armed uprising against the British colonisation of their lands. He outsmarted the police and settlers in the Kimberley for years, before being killed in 1897 at the age of 24. Geoffrey Bolton, a distinguished Australian historian, compared Jandamarra to guerilla leaders like the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata and Sicilian rebel Salvatore Giuliano. Oscar said Jandamarra was fighting for his people’s freedom. “He was not an outlaw, he was fighting for his land, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> freedom fighter”.|$|E

Richardson said [...] "I'm not leaving, I'm staying put". He added his participation in the reality television series was for [...] "fun", and stating: [...] "I still want to stay at Hollyoaks and progress in my career there" [...] {{because he did not}} <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good enough actor to pursue other projects. However, he later revealed he was not sure executive producer Paul Marquess would renew his contract. In November 2010, Richardson commented on his future with the show, branding it a new era and thankful to be part of it. Richardson stated: [...] "Marquess loved everything I've been doing and wanted to keep me on. I'm hoping to stick with the show no matter what." ...|$|E

Psychologist Joseph G Ponterotto, from second-hand sources, concludes that [...] "Bobby did not meet all the necessary criteria to reach diagnoses of schizophrenia or Asperger syndrome. The evidence is stronger for paranoid personality disorder." [...] Magnús Skúlason, a chess player and a psychiatrist and head doctor of Sogn Mental Asylum for the Criminally Insane, befriended Fischer {{toward the end of}} Fischer's life. From Endgame, Fischer's 2011 biography by Frank Brady: Skulason was not [...] "Bobby's psychiatrist", as has been implied in the general press, nor did he offer Bobby any analysis or psychotherapy. He was at Bobby's bedside as a friend, to try to do anything he could for him. Because of his training, however, he couldn't fail to take note of Bobby's mental condition. [...] "He definitely was not schizophrenic", Skulason said. [...] "He had problems, possibly certain childhood traumas that had affected him. He was misunderstood. Underneath I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> caring sensitive person." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{reading the}} veiled accusations made {{against him in}} the Public Ledger, Kent {{determined}} to clear his name, and accompanied by a witness went to see John Moore. [...] The Methodist showed Kent the list of questions he and Parsons had drawn up for the ghost to answer. [...] One concerned William and Fanny's marital status, prompting Kent {{to admit that they}} never married. [...] Moore told him he did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> murderer, rather, he believed the spirit's presence indicated that [...] "there was something behind darker than all the rest, and that if he would go to Parson's house, he might be a witness to the same and convinced of its reality". [...] On 12January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Broughton, went to Cock Lane. [...] On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. [...] The audience sat around the bed, positioned in the centre of the room. [...] They were warned that the ghost was sensitive to disbelief and told that they should accord it due respect. [...] When the séance began, a relative of Parsons, Mary Frazer, ran around the room shouting [...] "Fanny, Fanny, why don't you come? [...] Do come, pray Fanny, come; dear Fanny, come!" [...] When nothing happened, Moore told the group the ghost would not come as they were making too much noise. [...] He asked them to leave the room, telling them he would try to contact the ghost by stamping his foot. [...] About ten minutes later they were told the ghost had returned and that they should re-enter the room. [...] Moore then started to run through his and Parsons' list of questions: ...|$|E
