5|$|The United States {{has been}} a leader in {{technological}} innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>system</b> of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.|$|E

25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>system</b> historically permitted a greater overall {{amount of light}} within the low beam, since the entire reflector and lens area is used, {{but at the same}} time, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>system</b> has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>system</b> makes it difficult to create markedly different low and high beam light distributions. The high beam is usually a rough copy of the low beam, shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced low beams containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the low beam. However, low beam focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for high beam formation, which facilitates the optimization of both low and high beams.|$|E
