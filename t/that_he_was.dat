Theories to explain Burnett's actions include <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, the idea <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trying to clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E

5|$|B'alam Nehn (often {{referred}} to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seventh in line from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'.

The stela dates to AD534, but the text is not well understood. B'alam Nehn undertook major construction projects in the Acropolis, building over an early palace {{with a number of}} important structures.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2009 season, Fredrikstad told Tegström <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{not part}} of the club's {{long-term}} plans and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> welcome to find another club.

Tegström spent most of the 2009 season on the bench, but in the 2009 Norwegian Football Cup tie against Ranheim, he came on as a substitute and scored two goals in the extra time.|$|E
