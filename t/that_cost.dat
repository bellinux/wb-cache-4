Within a year, Mac Bethad had deposed and killed Donnchad. The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh, and though no {{connection between the two}} events is clear it is likely that they were linked.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} {{conceived by}} Nuckols, laser-driven inertial fusion confinement {{was expected to}} require lasers {{of a few hundred}} kilojoules and use fuel droplets created by a perfume mister arrangement. LLNLs research since that time has demonstrated that such an arrangement cannot work, and requires machined assemblies for each shot. To be economically useful, an IFE machine would need to use fuel assemblies <b>that</b> <b>cost</b> pennies. Although LLNL does not release prices for their own targets, the similar system at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester makes targets for about $1 million each. It is suggested that NIF's targets cost more than $10,000.|$|E

Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half.

5|$|After Parliament was {{dissolved}} in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election <b>that</b> <b>cost</b> the candidates £35,000. With {{the death of}} William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which {{took the form of}} the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government apparently offered Coke a peerage, which he refused, and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery, which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806. Fox's death made Parliament lose some of its appeal to Coke, as they had been close friends. His attendance {{in the next two years}} was very limited, and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.|$|E
5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he would be left with a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and <b>that</b> <b>cost</b> per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, Lasker {{tried to}} attack but Schlechter had no {{difficulty}} defending, {{so that the}} first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder <b>that</b> <b>cost</b> him the game. Hence at {{the middle of the}} match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing. Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.|$|E
