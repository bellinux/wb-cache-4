25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to wrap the scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of the}} scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has <b>to</b> <b>unroll</b> and re-roll many other pages.|$|E
25|$|Mitigating {{damage to}} the {{environment}} was a concern, as part of creating an authentic experience of the landscape, which was <b>to</b> <b>unroll</b> like a movie from the motorist's perspective. The median strip was therefore relatively narrow; trees were retained close to the highway and sometimes, for example in the oak forest near Dessau, in the median. In fact the driver's experience of the forest, assigned symbolic importance in German Romanticism and particularly under the Nazis, was maximized by avoiding straightaways in forested areas so that the driver remained enclosed by the trees as long as possible. To some extent the autobahn landscapers were influenced in this emphasis on the natural environment by the American parkways; Todt had a 1934 USDA bulletin on Roadside Improvement reprinted for his planners' use, and Nazi designers visited Westchester County to study them, {{about the same time}} that the Westchester County Parks Commission (WCPC) was partly overseeing the construction of what is today the Taconic State Parkway's southern stretches. But the Reichsautobahn aimed for a more natural, less parklike view from the road, and although in both countries using natively occurring plants in highway landscaping was important, the Americans selectively emphasized those with an attractive appearance. Also, the autobahn was at the time presented, by Todt and others, as an improvement to the natural landscape; Todt refused to avoid the Siebengebirge, a protected conservation area, arguing not only that the area should be opened up for visits but that the road would make it more beautiful. This was not the policy in the U.S., where, most famously, the Blue Ridge Parkway was designed to be narrow and unobtrusive. Cost had the opposite effect with respect to plantings than it did with respect to curves: the Reichsautobahn landscapers had performed pioneering analyses of local ecosystems that led them to plant intensively in order to reconstruct what they determined would have been naturally present at the site, but at the end of 1936, as a result of cost overruns as well as his personal philosophy, Todt severely curtailed plantings, calling for an emphasis on open views.|$|E
40|$|Generating quasi-random {{sequences}} for Monte Carlo simulations {{has been}} proved of interest when comparing results with numbers coming from conventional pseudorandom sequences. Despite {{a fair amount of}} sound theoretical work on random number generation algorithms, theoretical gain is often eradicated by poor computer implementations. Recently, {{one of the authors of}} this paper showed that massive unrolling optimizations could now be efficiently applied to pseudo-random number generation on regular desktop computers. This technique does not depend on the generation algorithm but it only stems from the classical unrolling optimization. In this paper we extend this technique to quasi-random generation and we present a memory mapping technique which can be efficiently associated <b>to</b> <b>unrolling</b> <b>to</b> overcome the limits we had with our previous unrolling technique for pseudo random numbers. Both techniques presented are portable on Unix derived platforms. Every research field using quasi-Monte Carlo simulation can be concerned by this software optimization technique which is even more adapted to quasi-random numbers than to pseudo-random numbers...|$|R

Found under broadleaved trees in parks, it can be reliably distinguished from P.involutus (and other Paxillus species) by the presence of crystals up to 2.5μm long in the rhizomorphs, as the crystals found in rhizomorphs of other Paxillus species do not exceed 0.5μm long.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a family of {{architectures}} for polar decoders using a reduced-complexity successive-cancellation decoding algorithm that employs <b>unrolling</b> <b>to</b> achieve extremely high throughput values while retaining moderate implementation complexity. The resulting fully-unrolled, deeply-pipelined architecture is capable of achieving a coded throughput in excess of 1 Tbps on a 65 nm ASIC at 500 MHz [...] -three orders of magnitude greater than current state-of-the-art polar decoders. However, unrolled decoders are built for a specific, fixed code. Therefore we also present a new method to enable {{the use of multiple}} code lengths and rates in a fully-unrolled polar decoder architecture. This method leads to a length- and rate-flexible decoder while retaining the very high speed typical <b>to</b> <b>unrolled</b> decoders. The resulting decoders can decode a master polar code of a given rate and length, and several shorter codes of different rates and lengths. We present results for two versions of a multi-mode decoder supporting eight and ten different polar codes, respectively. Both are capable of a peak throughput of 25. 6 Gbps. For each decoder, the energy efficiency for the longest supported polar code is shown to be of 14. 8 pJ/bit at 250 MHz and of 8. 8 pJ/bit at 500 MHz.

40|$|Modern {{architectural}} {{trends in}} instruction-level parallelism (ILP) are {{to increase the}} computational power of microprocessors significantly. As a result, the demands on memory have increased. Unfortunately, memory systems have not kept pace. Even hierarchical cache structures are ineffective if programs do not exhibit cache locality. Because of this compilers {{need to be concerned}} not only with finding ILP to utilize machine resources effectively, but also with ensuring that the resulting code has a high degree of cache locality. One compiler transformation that is essential for a compiler to meet the above objectives is unroll-and-jam, or outer-loop unrolling. Previous work either has used a dependence-based model [7] <b>to</b> compute <b>unroll</b> amounts, significantly increasing the size of the dependence graph, or has applied a more brute force technique [16].

40|$|Modulo {{scheduling}} is {{a method}} for overlapping successive iterations of a loop {{in order to find}} sufficient instruction-level parallelism to fully utilize high-issue-rate processors. The achieved throughput modulo scheduled loop depends on the resource requirements, the dependence pattern, and the register requirements of the computation in the loop body. Traditionally, unrolling followed by acyclic scheduling of the unrolled body has been an alternative to modulo scheduling. However, there are benefits <b>to</b> <b>unrolling</b> even if the loop is to be modulo scheduled. Unrolling can improve the throughput by allowing a smaller non-integral effective initiation interval to be achieved. After unrolling, optimizations {{can be applied to the}} loop that reduce both the resource requirements and the height of the critical paths. Together, unrolling and unrolling-based optimizations can enable the completion of multiple iterations per cycle in some cases. This paper describes the benefits of unrolling and [...] ...|$|R

Thus pathways within the vascular system were reopened for fluid flow. On the other hand, hot-water soaking did not affect the vessel structure substantially, but there was a relocation and partial removal of the extractives encrusting the ray parenchyma cell walls and pit membranes, with a resultant increase in drying rate, which for flat-sawn boards was twice that of unsoaked controls...|$|R
