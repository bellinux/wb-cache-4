5|$|Enterprises' episodes {{were usually}} junked because their rights {{agreements}} with <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> writers {{to sell the}} programmes abroad had expired. With many broadcasters around the world now switching to colour transmission, it was not deemed worthwhile extending agreements to sell the older black-and-white material.|$|E
5|$|A brawl scene between Johnson's and Diesel's {{characters}} {{was considered}} difficult to choreograph. The characters were written {{to be equally}} formidable, so the fight was punctuated with moments of character development, as Moritz felt this made the fight more exciting. The scene required several weeks of rehearsal {{and more than a}} week of filming by <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> their stunt doubles, who incurred several minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Although Oriental was short-lived, {{several of}} <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> crew it hired {{went on to}} lengthy careers. Njoo, after {{handling}} two films for Majestic in 1941, {{spent much of the}} decade in theatre before returning to directing in the mid-1950s. Fifi Young, who continued acting for Njoo until their divorce in 1945, appeared in more than eighty films before her death in 1975. Dhalia and Soerip likewise had lengthy careers: both acted until the 1990s, Dhalia in 52 productions and Soerip in 25.|$|E

5|$|Avnet went to Aurelio De Laurentiis and {{convinced}} him to finance the film without a distribution deal. Nine months before filming, Avnet had Conran meet <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> begin rehearsals {{in an attempt to}} get the shy filmmaker out of his shell. Avnet set up a custom digital effects studio with a blue screen soundstage in an abandoned building in Van Nuys, California. A group of almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators and compositors created multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live action footage yet to be filmed.|$|E
5|$|Co-executive {{producer}} David Wilcox {{wrote the}} episode, while Paul Holahan served as its director. Andrew Orloff, the episode's visual effects supervisor, strived to makes the parasitic worms look {{as real as}} possible {{with the help of}} <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> camera angles. It featured one-time guest stars Tzi Ma, Colby Paul, Ingrid Torrance and Jack Yang.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> repeatedly bit them.|$|E

5|$|Firstly, he {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} about how serious {{the situation is}} already and how much worse it will get. Secondly, he examines the roots of denial, {{both in terms of}} resistance to the evidence and in relation to <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> agencies motivated to deny climate change. Lastly, he looks at some future scenarios and explains what people should do.|$|E
5|$|For {{the zero}} gravity sequences, the ILM team matched Visual Concepts Engineering's phaser blasts by hand-painting the effect in Photoshop. ILM also did minor touchup to the scenes as required, adding {{clothing}} tears where the phaser blasts hit <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> adding the hazy Klingon atmosphere to the computer-rendered objects. These zero gravity scenes {{were the most}} expensive sequences to complete.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, it was {{announced}} that Lee was to leave the show. Producers confirmed that Lee would film her last scenes the following month and they would air in Australia that November. Following the news, Lee said that she would miss the friendships that she had formed with <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> crew.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} used Asylum Visual Effects {{to create}} digital effects for Friday the 13th. Although director Marcus Nispel is {{a proponent of}} practical effects, Asylum had to digitally create some shots to protect <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> to allow the director to achieve a specific look. Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members {{to work on the}} visual effects; they first analyzed the script in pre-production to decide which shots would need digital effects. Asylum worked on 25 shots for the film.|$|E
5|$|The show {{takes place}} at the fictional Greendale Community College in Greendale, Colorado. Harmon based the show on his own {{experiences}} in community college, and partly modeled the character of Jeff Winger on himself. He emphasized the cast's importance to the show, and also credited some of the actors for their improvisational skills. The episode attracted generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised both <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> the comedy writing. The show received good viewership, and stood out in NBC's Thursday lineup, where the network's other shows suffered declines in ratings.|$|E
5|$|The {{thematic}} and period {{setting of}} Carnivàle required an unusual casting approach. While some actors were hired for their genetic disabilities, most actors were specifically cast for their unique and distinct looks {{to fit the}} 1930s period. Award-winning costumes and make-up enhanced the illusion. Reviews generally lauded <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> characters, and several actors received award recognition for their performances.|$|E

5|$|Unable to find wind {{machines}} {{powerful enough}} to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner brought in a jet engine to aim at <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers {{to see what a}} scene would look like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken to match up the details of the various scenes.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the quick}} {{schedule}} of the shoot, Industrial Light & Magic immediately began visual effects work. While the skeletal {{forms of the}} pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms had to convince in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition would not work. Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a reference plate with <b>the</b> <b>actors,</b> <b>and</b> then without them to add in the skeletons, an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski's decision to shoot the battles with handheld cameras. The actors also had to perform their scenes again on the motion capture stage. With the shoot only wrapping up four months before release, Verbinski spent 18-hour days on the edit, {{while at the same}} time spending time on 600 effects shots, 250 of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.|$|E

5|$|He {{was also}} {{famous for his}} love of cockfighting, hát bội (Vietnamese {{classical}} opera) and court dancing, {{all of which were}} popular with the common Vietnamese southerner. He reportedly gave a long speech praising cockfighting, in a joking manner, to Emperor Gia Long and sometimes beat the drum himself in order to encourage <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> actresses of the hát bội troupes when they were performing for him. He was also known for his patronage of goddess spirits that were popularly venerated by local southerners in folk religions. In addition, Duyệt was the instructor of three đình formalities, a code of ceremonial conduct and customs that were copies of royal rituals.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} make the show seem more realistic, Franks and other writers talked to his father, a former Los Angeles police officer, and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by <b>the</b> <b>actors,</b> <b>and</b> Roday {{included}} a pineapple in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show. James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down because it was too soon in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the film}} was planned as a short fiction, the project {{evolving}} during 2005. At the time, Nemescu also had planned what would later become the feature film California Dreamin', impossible to film at that moment, deciding that Marilena from P7 could prove a useful exercise for both director and actors. Thus the screenplay was rewritten and filming started with a very reduced budget of only US $14,000, which was collected by Nemescu by participating at various film festivals, with older short fictions. During development, however, the film received new funds, though still modest ones, thus <b>the</b> <b>actors</b> <b>and</b> {{a part of the}} team accepted to work for free.|$|E
