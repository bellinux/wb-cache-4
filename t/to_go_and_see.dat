25|$|Prior to 1922, Woodhaven Boulevard was {{the only}} {{important}} north-south street in town. However, it ended at Liberty Avenue. Then officials decided to expand Woodhaven Boulevard all the way south to the Rockaways and finally opened it to traffic in 1925. This made Ozone Park more accessible by both bus and car. Since cars were also becoming more popular at that time, the land became much more valuable, leading to a construction boom {{in an attempt to}} fill any empty lot. Between 1921 and 1930, Ozone Park saw a population increase of over 180% from 40,000 to 112,950 people. With this extraordinary increase in population came the need for schools and sources of entertainment. In response to this demand came the construction of John Adams High School in 1930. This school was built just as the construction boom slowed down and right before the Great Depression. Furthermore, in 1925 the development of the Cross-Bay Movie Theatre gave residents the ability <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> a show while also connecting with neighbors.|$|E
25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> They went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E

In Villalba all power was in their hands: church, Mafia, agricultural banks, latifundia, all {{in the hands of}} the same family … One used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> him and ask 'Can you do me this favour?' even for a little affair one had with some other person."' ...|$|E

Ben Ata returns with a large army and enters Zone Three unchallenged. He is not well received, but finds Al•Ith with {{a small band of}} followers who have moved to the frontier of Zone Two to be close to her. Ben Ata and Al•Ith reunite; he tells her of the reforms he has introduced in Zone Four and his taming of the [...] "wild one" [...] from Zone Five.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes began a {{relationship}} with Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace). He proposed marriage to her, but she refused. Mercedes has sex with a stranger; Metcalfe remarked, [...] "Sex usually makes her forget about everything else that's going on. But afterwards she still can't stop thinking about Malachy, so she decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> him to work out how she feels". Mercedes subsequently accepted Malachy's proposal and they marry. Mercedes found {{that she did not}} contract HIV from Malachy, but a Hollyoaks source described the news as [...] "bitter sweet" [...] because it was possible that her husband could die and leave her on her own. The source expanded on this, saying that if Mercedes had contracted HIV then the pair [...] "would be going through everything together".|$|E

500|$|With little {{care for}} his studies and [...] "itching for a chance <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> some excitement", Tracy enlisted in the United States Navy when he turned 18. He {{was sent to the}} Naval Training Station in North Chicago, where he was still a student when World War I came to an end. He {{achieved}} the rank of seaman second class, but never went to sea, and was discharged in February 1919. John Tracy's desire to see one of his sons gain a college degree drove Tracy back to high school to finish his diploma. Studies at two more institutions, plus the additional allowance of [...] "war credits", won Tracy a place at Ripon College. He entered Ripon in February 1921, declaring his intention to major in medicine.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening night}} {{audience}} was also delighted by the piece, preferring it {{even to the}} Offenbach work: [...] "To judge by the unceasing and almost boisterous hilarity which formed a sort of running commentary {{on the part of}} the audience, Trial by Jury suffered nothing whatever from so dangerous a juxtaposition [...] [...] On the contrary, it may fairly be said to have borne away the palm." [...] A reviewer noted that [...] "Laughter more frequent or more hearty was never heard in any theatre than that which more than once brought the action ...to a temporary standstill." [...] Another paper summed up its popular appeal: [...] "Trial by Jury is but a trifle–it pretends to be nothing more–but it is one of those merry bits of extravagance which a great many will go to see and hear, which they will laugh at, and which they will advise their friends <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see,</b> and therefore its success cannot be doubtful." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{last three}} decades of Moore's life {{continued}} in a similar vein; several major retrospectives took place around the world, notably a very prominent exhibition {{in the summer of}} 1972 in the grounds of the Forte di Belvedere overlooking Florence. Following the pioneering documentary 'Henry Moore', produced by John Read in 1951, he appeared in many films. In 1964, for instance, Moore was featured in the documentary [...] "5 British Sculptors (Work and Talk)" [...] by American filmmaker Warren Forma. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. The number of commissions continued to increase; he completed Knife Edge Two Piece in 1962 for College Green near the Houses of Parliament in London. According to Moore, [...] "When I was offered the site near the House of Lords... I liked the place so much that I didn't bother <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> an alternative site in Hyde Park—one lonely sculpture can be lost in a large park. The House of Lords site is quite different. It is next to a path where people walk and it has a few seats where they can sit and contemplate it." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{returned}} {{for the first}} Old Firm match of the season on 18 September 2011, but was substituted {{towards the end of}} the match after suffering a further recurrence of the injury. Neil Lennon said after the match that Brown had been one of Celtic's best players, as he had been involved in both of their goals during the 4–2 defeat. Celtic announced after the match that Brown would have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> a specialist and would be out of action for several months. Brown made his return on 30 November, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 loss against Atlético Madrid. The next day, he was able to talk with other clubs about signing a pre-contract agreement. However, Brown signed a new three-year deal on 3 December, with Celtic having the option of extending his contract for a further season. The deal had been delayed for so long because Celtic were not willing to pay the fee demanded by Brown's advisors. Brown continued his comeback by scoring in a 2–0 away win against St Mirren on 21 January 2012. He then scored a penalty against Falkirk, in a 3–1 League Cup semi-final win, on 30 January. [...] He followed this up with another penalty in Celtic's 2–0 win over Inverness five days later. Brown was then named Player of the Month for January 2012. On 25 March 2012, Brown scored a penalty in Celtic's 3–2 loss to Rangers.|$|E
500|$|... 2009 saw Sheen portray another public figure; he {{starred in}} The Damned United as the outspoken {{football}} manager Brian Clough. The Tom Hooper-directed film focused on Clough's disastrous 44-day tenure {{as manager of}} Leeds United and marked Sheen's fifth collaboration with writer Peter Morgan. The actor has said Clough is the real-life character he enjoyed playing most. The Guardian, writing in 2009, declared it the [...] "best performance of his big-screen career" [...] while The Times found him [...] "magnificent". USA Today praised [...] "Sheen's masterful performance" [...] while the Los Angeles Times felt he played the role with [...] "a cheeky, dark panache" [...] and [...] "skillful verve". Entertainment Weekly asserted that, despite American audiences' unfamiliarity with Clough, [...] "what's lost in translation is recovered easily enough in Michael Sheen's astonishing performance". Variety noted that his [...] "typically scrupulous channeling of Clough gets the tics and mannerisms right, but also carves a moving portrait of a braggart suddenly out of his depth". Also in 2009, Sheen reprised {{his role as a}} werewolf in , a prequel to the original film. Of his decision to take part, Sheen has said: [...] "My rule of thumb is that I want to do things I'd like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> myself." [...] The New York Times felt he was [...] "the movie's greatest asset ... a lively break from his usual high-crust duties to bring wit, actual acting and some unexpected musculature to the goth-horror flick". Variety said he hit [...] "all the right notes in a star-powered performance that will amuse, if not amaze, anyone who only knows the actor as Tony Blair or David Frost" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time noted that he [...] "tries bravely to keep a straight face" ...|$|E
