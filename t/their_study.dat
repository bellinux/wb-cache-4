30|$|As {{an example}} of the {{distinction}} between HP and OP toward studies, people with a predominant HP are highly invested in <b>their</b> <b>studies</b> yet very flexible in terms of their engagement. Specifically, even though they {{spend a lot of time}} and energy in <b>their</b> <b>studies,</b> they manage to balance their engagement with other life domains such as relationships, friendships, work, etc. Furthermore, they experience positive emotions such as feeling active and alert during and after engaging in <b>their</b> <b>studies.</b> Conversely, individuals with a predominant OP for <b>their</b> <b>studies</b> are also highly invested in them but they can’t help but to engage in <b>their</b> <b>studies.</b> <b>Their</b> <b>studies</b> become the core of their lives, thus creating much conflict with other important aspects of life that are often being neglected. People with an OP for <b>their</b> <b>studies</b> do experience positive emotions when engaging in <b>their</b> <b>studies</b> but to a lesser extent than individuals with an HP and they unfortunately experience negative emotions such as feeling nervous and guilty during and after engaging in <b>their</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|R

5|$|Since the {{original}} description, the systematic {{status of the}} tribe {{has been the focus}} of debate. Bolton (2003) was the first to suggest the taxonomic instability of Tatuidris within Myrmicinae and raised the genus to the level of a new subfamily, the Agroecomyrmecinae, suggesting that Agroecomyrmecinae might be the sister taxon to Myrmicinae. The subfamily rank was re-assessed by Baroni Urbani & de Andrade in 2007, this was the first attempt to include Tatuidris as a terminal taxon in a morphological cladistic analysis. In <b>their</b> <b>study,</b> Baroni Urbani & de Andrade identified morphological synapomorphies shared between Tatuidris and the dacetines, justifying the inclusion of the genus within Myrmicinae. In addition, two autapomorphies (a differently shaped petiolar tergum and sternum, and the eyes at or close to the apex of the antennal scrobe) separated Tatuidris from all other extant ant genera included in <b>their</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E
5|$|The emu {{was long}} classified, with its closest {{relatives}} the cassowaries, {{in the family}} Casuariidae, part of the ratite order Struthioniformes. However, an alternate classification was proposed in 2014 by Mitchell et al., based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA. This splits off the Casuariidae into their own order, the Casuariformes, and includes only the cassowaries in the family Casuariidae, placing the emus in their own family, Dromaiidae.

5|$|Culture: Although {{there are}} many {{differences}} between Eastern and Western cultures, including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures. In <b>their</b> <b>study</b> with subjects from Thailand, where the family name is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name. Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for initials in Japan, where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} {{though he had}} failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from <b>their</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a 2011 {{study by}} Nicolás Campione and David Evans, the authors {{conducted}} {{the first ever}} morphometric analysis to compare the various specimens assigned to Edmontosaurus. They concluded that only two species are valid: E. regalis, from the late Campanian, and E. annectens, from the late Maastrichtian. <b>Their</b> <b>study</b> provided further evidence that Anatotitan copei is a synonym of E. annectens; specifically, that the long, low skull of A. copei {{is the result of}} ontogenetic change and represents mature E. annectens individuals.|$|E
5|$|In a subsequent, more {{detailed}} report, on the eggshells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky {{concluded that the}} egg almost certainly belonged to Deinonychus, representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified. Moreover, the external surface of one eggshell was found {{in close contact with}} the gastralia suggesting that Deinonychus might have brooded its eggs. This implies that Deinonychus used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation, and indicates an endothermy similar to modern birds. Further study by Gregory Erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and its growth had plateaued. Unlike other theropods in <b>their</b> <b>study</b> of specimens found associated with eggs or nests, it had finished growing {{at the time of its}} death.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to the well-preserved rocks of the dry, {{central part of the}} Andes, the record that defines the southern sector is poorly preserved. Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record. Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well. <b>Their</b> <b>study</b> established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record, and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock.|$|E
