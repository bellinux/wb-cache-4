5|$|Bodily {{and spiritual}} needs were {{balanced}} symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (16) and the chapel (7) were both large two-storied halls, {{rising from the}} semi-basement to the first floor.

But <b>the</b> <b>servant</b> would not eat before he had told his tale. <b>The</b> <b>servant</b> told how God had greatly blessed Abraham with sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and asses, and a son and sole heir. <b>The</b> <b>servant</b> told how Abraham made him swear to go to Abraham's kindred to get Isaac a wife, and that God would send an angel to make his errand successful. And <b>the</b> <b>servant</b> told how he met Rebekah at <b>the</b> well. <b>The</b> <b>servant</b> then asked whether or not they meant to treat Abraham with true kindness, and Laban and Bethuel answered that the matter had been decreed by God and Rebekah could go and be Isaac's wife. <b>The</b> <b>servant</b> bowed low to God.

5|$|According to {{the later}} Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle {{occurred}} by accident: When Bolesław decided {{to throw a}} feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav's archers and scouts decided to create trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals and preparing them near the river. However, they only annoyed them enough that <b>the</b> <b>servants</b> themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav's surprised troops, who had been guarding the river. Bolesław learned of the skirmish sooner than Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav.|$|E

By {{the time of the}} 1900 US Census, Washington, recorded in the census as an inventor, was 29 years old and living in a rented house in Brooklyn with his 23-year-old wife, their three young children, his younger sister (age 25), three servants, and a child of two of <b>the</b> <b>servants.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about his sexual precocity. He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} sexual experience was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of <b>the</b> <b>servants.</b> He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17.

2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that the words of [...] {{regarding}} <b>the</b> Hebrew <b>servant,</b> [...] "he fares well with you," [...] indicate that <b>the</b> Hebrew <b>servant</b> had to be [...] "with" [...] – that is, equal to – the master in food and drink. Thus the master could not eat white bread and have <b>the</b> <b>servant</b> eat black bread. The master could not drink old wine and have <b>the</b> <b>servant</b> drink new wine. The master could not sleep on a feather bed and have <b>the</b> <b>servant</b> sleep on straw. Hence, they said that buying a Hebrew servant was like buying a master. Similarly, Rabbi Simeon deduced from the words of [...] "Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him," [...] that the master was liable to provide for <b>the</b> <b>servant's</b> children until <b>the</b> <b>servant</b> went out.

5|$|At first sight, Terahnee {{seems like}} a Utopia. Everyone lives in sumptuous palaces, and nobody goes hungry; in reality, the society is run by slave labor. After writing new Ages, the Terahnee people capture the {{inhabitants}} to use as slaves, considering themselves gods over their Ages. The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only <b>the</b> <b>servants</b> interact with the lower orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E

5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied <b>the</b> <b>servants</b> in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning {{the ways of the}} countryside, and trying to help as best he could.

Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E

5|$|Sir Arthur Elton (7th Bt) began {{updating}} {{the house before}} 1850 (and the lodge at the gate dates from 1851) {{but it was in}} 1860s that he made major changes. The west wing was extended and remodelled, this time with an Elizabethan style façade. Less obvious alterations to the east end (where <b>the</b> <b>servants</b> lived and worked) probably also date to this period. The fire of 1882 destroyed much of the western end of the house. In the rebuilding that followed, an even larger west end was constructed but Sir Arthur took pains to ensure that its Elizabethan south front was conserved and retained. Postcards of Clevedon reveal that the last change to the great hall window was made in about 1912, when it was given a square head again, in Elizabethan style.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the Palladian country house {{in the seventeenth century}} separated the family of the householder from <b>the</b> <b>servants.</b> Previously sharing the hall, and bedding down at a master's feet, or door, servants were now given separate small chambers. Sometimes these were placed on a mezzanine floor, as at Kinross. Servants were less visible, using backstairs that kept them away from members of the family and guests and they fulfilled necessary and sometimes unpleasant tasks. They were also fewer in number, of lower social status and predominately female. A country house could have 10 to 20 servants and large houses had more. A hierarchy of positions developed from the butler and housekeeper to footmen and maids. The sexes were increasingly segregated into their own quarters.|$|E
