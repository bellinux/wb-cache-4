Heindel's ‘Time’ magazine cover of Daniel Ellsberg resides in the permanent collection of The Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. In 2011, he was posthumously inducted into the Illustrators Hall of Fame. While Heindel benefited from advances in photography and publishing, he foresaw the impact technology would ultimately have on the commercial illustration business. Heindel was known to comment <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> needed to be prepared for a change in the illustration business, comparing 20th century illustrators to West Virginia coal miners. At the height of his illustration career in the 1980s, Heindel pivoted into fine art; instead of painting American football players for ‘Sports Illustrated,’ he began to paint dancers, something he had wanted to do since first seeing the Royal Ballet's Rudolph Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn dance ‘Paradise Lost’ in 1962.|$|E
5000|$|Bilveer Singh {{stated that}} the Hock Lee riots {{revealed}} “the ability of the communists to mobilise {{other elements of the}} United Front, such as the students.” Singh’s reconstruction of the Hock Lee riots rely on the works of Bloodworth, Drysdale, and Lee. His analysis agrees with the colonial perspective and concludes that the students’ involvement in the Hock Lee incident {{was part of a larger}} plan of communist subversion. Bloodworth starts his narrative by accusing the ‘communist’ students of being at the centre of the violence that occurred in the Hock Lee event. [...] He attributes the cause of the unrest to union leader, Fong Swee Suan and takes on a perspective which favours the actions of the bus company. The above conventional accounts commonly attribute the student involvement to be one of communist action and again do not give the students any form of political consciousness. The students who were involved in the riots were part of the Singapore Chinese Middle School Student Union (SCMSSU). The relationship between the workers and the students is one that is often overlooked in many accounts of history and thus leading to the common conclusion that students’ involvement was part of a violent extremist movement. The British adopted a substitution strategy to replace Chinese schools with English institution. A ten-year education plan unveiled by the colonial administration in 1949 sought to significantly decrease student enrolment in Chinese vernacular schools. Chinese students were faced with the implementation of high school exams that served little purpose in ensuring the students’ path into university. The National Service Ordinance act also disrupted the education of Chinese students as the colonial government was unwilling to allow them to defer if they had to sit for examinations. This eventually led to the May 13 incident in 1954. In January 1955, the students’ application to register the SCMSSU was rejected and subsequently met with many obstacles which the students felt were unreasonable demands by the colonial government to prevent the set up of the student union. Newspaper reports of the government not providing help or compensation to victims of World War Two in Singapore also served as a reminder <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were being asked to fight for a government that does not have their interests at heart. Students were seen to be the allies of the workers serving as a political force that could influence the decisions of the ruling elite. Loh et al. highlighted that many of the workers were ex-students and that the Chinese school students knew that the workers who were intertwined in labour negotiations was a reflection of their future. The anxieties of the students coupled with the students’ sympathy to the workers resulted in their support for the Hock Lee bus workers.|$|E

Descriptive Statement Patterns, relationships, and functions constitute a unifying theme of mathematics. From the earliest age, students should be encouraged to investigate the patterns that they find in numbers, shapes, and expressions, and, by doing so, to make mathematical discoveries. They should have opportunities to analyze, extend, and create a variety of patterns and to use pattern-based thinking to understand and represent mathematical and other real-world phenomena. These explorations present unlimited opportunities for problem solving, making and verifying generalizations, and building mathematical understanding and confidence. Meaning and Importance Mathematics is often regarded as the science of patterns.

The information and Communication Technologies changes how we interact with others and with the information. It can be really accessed at anytime and anywhere. Future professionals should be ready for this reality which requires changes in traditional teaching and learning methods. Challenge Based Learning is an example of them.

30|$|Part of the {{importance}} of including STEM tasks such as makerspaces into an academic curriculum is to help students form positive STEM interest. Students who have positive experiences with STEM-related activities develop a more enduring interest in STEM, possibly contributing to their decision to pursue STEM careers later on in their educational trajectory (Lent et al. 2002). Previous research has also shown that perceived competence and interest in performing STEM tasks are closely tied to the development of STEM identity, or students’ perception that who they are is consistent with becoming a member of the STEM community (e.g. becoming a scientist or engineer; Kim et al.  2018). Therefore, the decline in self-efficacy and interest as students participate in design-based makerspaces may be detrimental to the development of STEM identity. It signals <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> lack the skills and inclinations necessary {{to become part of the}} STEM community. Fostering student self-efficacy and interest in STEM-focused makerspaces go beyond motivating students towards the learning task at hand, but also have to do with preparing students to see themselves as someone who can “do STEM” in the future. Educators who are integrating makerspaces into schools need to have this broad view to ensure that the learning and design goals they set do not ultimately interfere with students’ positive development of STEM interest and identity.|$|E

40|$|Background: In the {{development}} and delivery of pre‑registration baccalaureate nursing programs, universities must address both the needs of industry and the registering authorities that regulate health professional practice. Balanced with this, providers of education at this level also wish to deliver an experience <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> both value and enjoy. Objective: This paper describes {{the findings of a}} study examining these factors {{in the first year of}} four pre‑registration programs at a rural campus and outreach centre of one Australian university. Design: A descriptive, exploratory survey was employed in this research, which is drawn from a larger study into entry pathway, success and academic experience. Results: Results indicate that students found units such as fundamental nursing subjects and law most enjoyable and valuable. Units with a sociological foundation were considered less enjoyable and valuable. Overall, students recognised the value of the bioscience units while contrarily not expressing enjoyment of this aspect of their studies. Conclusions: These findings have implications for nurse educators in respect of the content and delivery of pre‑registration nursing programs. As first year students, the participants may have been focused on learning fundamental nursing tasks, lacking an understanding of the breadth of knowledge required for their professional role. Future research into aspects of nursing studies found to be most valuable may provide a different perspective if conducted in the period post graduation...|$|E

My disenchantment turned to anger when I learned that my assigned lunch duty would be guarding the library’s entrance and turning students away.

Although there are common devices such as transformers and gener-ators that work because of Faraday’s law, it is not obvious <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> use them on a daily basis. We have developed an experiment using a simplified, scaled-up model of the computer hard drive to study Faraday’s law along with magnetic data storage and access. The difficulty of the lab can be adjusted, {{so it may be}} used from the high school through college level. Computers store and access information with the use of binary numbers, strings of ones and zeros. Therefore, all the letters, numbers, and symbols the computer stores have to be convert-ed into binary numbers. The binary numbers are permanently saved onto the hard drive as strings of magnets, referred to as magnetic bits. The hard drive is a highly advanced computer component, and its operation can be very com-plex. 1 The important components for the pur-pose of this lab are the platter and the read/write head. The platter is a disk coated with a magnet-ic material, which can be magnetized to store the binary numbers. The read/write head writes each binary number as a microscopic magnet onto the platter so its magnetization is in the plane of the platter. 2, 3 It also reads the polarity of each bit as the platter spins below it. The “write ” part of the head is an inductive coil, 1 while the “read ” portion of the head can be an inductive coil, a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor, or a giant magnetoresistive 4 (GMR) sensor. In the laboratory, students “write ” a word of their choosing onto a scaled-up model of the platter with the use of permanent magnets, and read it using a solenoid (read head) as shown i...|$|E

40|$|In this article, the co-authors {{argue that}} legal {{research}} and writing (LRW) teachers should use actual legal work to generate assignments. They recommend that clinical and LRW teachers work together to design, co-teach, and evaluate such courses. They describe two experimental courses they developed together and co-taught to support and clarify their arguments. They contend that actual legal work motivates students to learn the basic skills of research, analysis and writing, and thus helps to accomplish the primary goals of LRW courses. It also helps students to explore new dimensions of basic skills, including those related to the {{development and use of}} facts and the construction of legal arguments in response to indeterminate legal issues. Through actual legal work, they say, LRW teachers can achieve important secondary educational goals as well, including introducing students to a client-centered, problem-solving form of representation, professional responsibility issues (especially access-to-justice and pro bono issues), and critical analysis of law and justice systems. Engaging first-year students in actual legal work can bring real clients into the classroom, demonstrate <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can help others (and that they like doing so), and thereby reinforce their idealism. The authors say these are good refinements in the culture of traditional first-year legal education. Their proposal also would help individuals and community organizations obtain legal assistance they need to prevent and resolve legal problems. A LRW professor and students can provide representation that otherwise would not be provided. In the longer term, they argue that engaging students in law school in legal work on behalf of poor and underrepresented people and groups will encourage a number of them to provide legal services to similar clients in the future...|$|E
40|$|Speaking is {{considered}} to be difficult thing, moreover English as a foreign language. Students' performance depends on their personalities. Students who have low participation in speaking activity in the classroom lose their opportunity to practice their speaking skill which may cause poor speaking skill and achievement. However, some of students are active in speaking activity in the classroom that leads them to have good skill and achievement in speaking. This study attempts to reveal: (1) speaking strategies used by Indonesian tertiary students in terms of speaking English and strategies to improve their speaking ability, and (2) to identify speaking strategies mostly used by the students when they speak English and improve their speaking ability. This study is a descriptive research since its purpose is to describe the Indonesian tertiary students’ learning strategies in learning speaking English. The data from 15 tertiary students, who have good performance and achievement in speaking, from one of schools of higher education in Cimahi were collected using a 21 items questionnaire of a modified version of Strategy Inventory Language Learning (SILL) and 5 items interview questions. The result of the study revealed that some speaking strategies are used in terms of speaking English and improve speaking ability, namely cognitive, metacognitive and compensation strategy.

40|$|A scientifically literate {{person is}} one who understands the nature of science, its processes, products, and their {{appropriate}} application to decision-making contexts. The impetus {{to make informed decisions}} about environmental issues is environmental motivation. I examined students' environmental motivation, its relationship to scientific knowledge, and how environmental motivation can be fostered in a science classroom. This study took place in a college-level environmental biology course in which the instructor attempted to support students' basic psychological needs, as defined by self-determination theory (SDT). The first question was to what extent does an SDT-guided environmental biology course differ from a non-SDT-guided course in the degree to which it fostered self-determined motivation toward the environment. The administration of a well-validated scale to two sections before, after, and six months following the end of the course indicated that SDT-guided instruction is a plausible way to foster environmental motivation in the classroom. The second question was what are the multiple influences on fostering self-determined motivation toward the environment in an SDT-guided course. Path analysis indicated that environmental motivation can be partially accomplished in an environmental biology course by conveying <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are cared for, are connected to others, and can trust others while solving environmental problems. The third question sought to characterize students' scientific conceptualizations as they solve environmental problems {{and the extent to which}} their conceptualizations relate to the satisfaction of their need for competence. Students were videotaped during in-class problem-solving, after which stimulated-recall interviews were conducted. Grounded theory and an established coding scheme were combined to analyze these data, which resulted in three grounded hypotheses about what characterizes students' scientific knowledge when they feel highly competent about solving environmental problems. The final research question sought to identify which classroom features students cite when they indicate that their basic psychological needs are being fulfilled or undermined. Grounded analysis resulted in seven features of the instructional environment. This dissertation marks the first application of SDT to a formal environmental education setting in which a goal was to foster environmental motivation.

40|$|Can and do {{staff at}} {{contributing}} schools {{have an effect}} on the decisions parents and students make about their next school? The writer's experience as a past contributing primary school principal and a current intermediate school principal would suggest that the comments a teacher or principal makes about a another school may influence parents and students in their selection of their 'next' school. The study seeks to explore contributing school staff perceptions about the school/s they contribute to, their knowledge about the school/s, how they gain knowledge about the school/s, and the frequency they provide advice on school selection to parents or students. A key element of the study is the focus on the perceptions held by contributing school staff of the schools to which their school contributes. The New Zealand school system is an increasingly competitive school environment. New Zealand compulsory education is relatively fragmented with a wide range of schools being present within a self-managing framework overseen by a central Ministry of Education. Each school delivers individually tailored learning programmes based on a nationally mandated curriculum. This has resulted in a system of schooling that is inherently competitive and where parents have considerable choice about which schools their child may attend although enrolment zones or enrolment criteria can at times restrict this choice. The result of this environment is that many schools have to engage in both direct and indirect marketing to ensure their survival. This marketing may include a range of activities including open nights, community newsletters, a glossy school prospectus, or newspaper advertising. Contributing schools often act as information gatekeepers to prospective students and families, interpreting, allowing or not allowing information to pass on to students therefore the perceptions that contributing school staff have about a school may influence the advice they give or the access <b>to</b> <b>students</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> allow. A written survey was provided to all staff at three contributing schools. All three schools contributed to the same two intermediate schools. The survey contained multiple-choice questions, with a small number of open-ended questions. Staff in the case study schools showed little factual knowledge about the schools to which they contributed. The majority of staff felt they had no views for or against particular schools, nor were they asked directly for information about the 'next school' very often. The writer identifies an area for further study, suggesting a study involving Year 6 students, parents of year 6 students, contributing school staff and staff at the next school. This study would seek to compare the sources and type of information students and parents had about 'next school' selection and the influences contributing school staff may have on the type or content of information available...|$|E
