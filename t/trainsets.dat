5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less wear on the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the <b>trainsets</b> and ordered another four <b>trainsets,</b> which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase {{price for the}} six <b>trainsets</b> was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 <b>trainsets</b> for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. Doing so would have required a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{established}} a separate maintenance facility for all six <b>trainsets</b> in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, {{on the site}} of a former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad coach yard. This facility closed in 1981 after the withdrawal of the RTGs from service; according to Amtrak, the <b>trainsets</b> were too expensive to operate compared to conventional equipment. The <b>trainsets</b> were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to the withdrawal was the spike in fuel prices after the Yom Kippur War.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan High Speed Rail started {{operation}} with 30 THSR 700T <b>trainsets</b> supplied by a consortium led by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. In response to increasing ridership and new stations that would begin operation in 2015, THSRC signed the contract for four new 700T <b>trainsets</b> with the Kawasaki consortium on May 2012 in Tokyo, Japan.|$|E

25|$|On 1 March 2008, <b>trainset</b> 1192, {{travelling}} as ICE 23, {{collided with}} a tree which had fallen onto the track near Brühl after being blown down by Cyclone Emma. The driver suffered severe injuries. The <b>trainset</b> is back in service, its driving-car having been replaced with that from <b>trainset</b> 1106.|$|R
5|$|The three rebuilt RTG-II <b>trainsets</b> {{joined the}} RTL <b>trainsets</b> on the Empire Corridor in 1988. Insufficient {{maintenance}} {{in the early}} 1990s reduced reliability and led to several fires in 1993–1994. Amtrak retired the RTG-IIs after one caught fire in Pennsylvania Station in New York on September 11, 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{first five}} locomotives, Nos. 6220–6224, {{were built in}} 1937 at the LMS Crewe Works at an average cost of £11,641 each. They were all {{intended}} to haul the Coronation Scot, so the locomotives and the special <b>trainsets</b> bore a common livery. The locomotives were streamlined and painted Caledonian Railway blue with silver horizontal lines along {{each side of the}} locomotive. The special <b>trainsets</b> that they hauled were painted the same shade of blue and the silver lining was repeated along each side of the coaches.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered another seven Turboliner <b>trainsets,</b> {{which were}} {{delivered}} between 1976 and 1977. These were manufactured by Rohr Industries, and {{were known as}} RTL Turboliners. They {{were based on the}} earlier RTG series, but had American-style Janney couplers throughout and a different design of power car cab. The standard configuration of each set was five cars: power cars at either end, a food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each trainset could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach cut into the consist. These were the final gas turbine <b>trainsets</b> purchased by Amtrak; conventional diesel locomotive-hauled trains proved cheaper to operate.|$|E
25|$|On 8 November 2007, <b>trainset</b> 89, {{which had}} been {{shortened}} to about 200m, set a Swiss land speed record for railed vehicles during trial runs for the ETCS cab signalling inside the Lötschberg Base Tunnel. The <b>trainset</b> reached 288km/h. The <b>trainset</b> had a modified pantograph, {{but two of the}} eight traction motors had been disabled.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the station}} {{platform}} only allows {{room for a}} three-car <b>trainset,</b> when the station was first opened a six-car <b>trainset</b> was used on the line. In this case, only the first three train cars' doors opened at this station (selective door operation). It was not until July 22, 2006 that a dedicated three-car <b>trainset</b> began service on the line.|$|R

5|$|Following the Zephyr Budd {{built an}} {{identical}} trainset, the Flying Yankee, for the Boston and Maine railroad, {{and went on}} to build a series of larger and more powerful Zephyr <b>trainsets</b> for Burlington.|$|E
5|$|The second batch, {{known as}} RTL, {{were of a}} similar design but {{manufactured}} by Rohr Industries, an American company. These entered service on the Empire Corridor {{in the state of}} New York in 1976. The RTLs remained in service there through the 1990s, supplemented by several rebuilt RTGs. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, New York and Amtrak partnered to rebuild the RTLs for high-speed service; this project failed, and the last RTL <b>trainsets</b> left revenue service in 2003. After the settlement of legal issues, New York sold the remaining <b>trainsets</b> for scrap in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The two daily round-trips were branded Turboliner, {{replacing}} the individual names Abraham Lincoln and Prairie State. Amtrak repeated this {{experiment with the}} Detroit and Milwaukee corridors. Track conditions limited the new <b>trainsets</b> to , but they were clean, comfortable, quiet and reliable. In the first year, the Chicago–St. Louis running time dropped from 5.5 to 5 hours. The Federal Railroad Administration refused a request from Amtrak to raise the speed limit to , citing inadequate signalling along the route. The new trains {{had fallen out of}} favor by the end of 1974: food service was inadequate, and the five-car fixed consist could not handle demand. Amfleet coaches and new conventional diesels replaced both of the Turboliner <b>trainsets</b> in 1975.|$|E
50|$|Two eight-car sets can be coupled {{together}} for extra capacity: a sixteen-car E4 series formation <b>trainset</b> carries {{a total of}} 1,634 seated passengers - the highest-capacity high-speed rail <b>trainset</b> in the world.|$|R
50|$|The record runs {{took place}} in two {{separate}} campaigns, separated by a period of modifications to <b>trainset</b> 325. For each day of testing, the 325 was towed to the test site by TGV Atlantique <b>trainset</b> 308 because its 1500 V DC systems had been removed, preventing operations near Paris. <b>Trainset</b> 308 also performed a sweep of the test track at 350 km/h before each high-speed run.|$|R
50|$|A {{complete}} six-car <b>trainset</b> {{consists of}} an identical twin set of one driving trailer (DT) and two motor cars (M1 and M2) permanently coupled together. The configuration of a C151 <b>trainset</b> in revenue service is DT-M1-M2-M2-M1-DT.|$|R
5|$|On 13 April 2017, LTA {{released}} a tender for contract R151, {{which will be}} the replacement train for the current first-generation C151 <b>trainsets.</b> For the time being, LTA will work with SMRT to improve the reliability of the 66 first-generation trains until their replacement trains are ready.|$|E
5|$|Turboliners debuted on the Hiawatha {{corridor}} on June 1, 1975, {{and more}} <b>trainsets</b> began operating in 1976. As with the St. Louis and Detroit corridors, Amtrak dropped individual names {{in favor of}} the Turboliner branding in 1976, but reinstated these names in 1980. Turboliner equipment was withdrawn altogether in 1981. Their withdrawal was the end of Turboliner service in the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|Without the {{operation}} of Regional Eurostar services using the North of London <b>trainsets</b> across the rest of Britain, Eurostar has developed its connections with other transport services instead, such as integrating effectively with traditional UK rail operators' schedules and routes, {{making it possible for}} passengers to use Eurostar as a quick connection to further destinations on the continent.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Amtrak also {{purchased}} {{an additional}} Series IV <b>trainset</b> as a demonstrator for potential service between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. This <b>trainset</b> was built with two additional [...] "coach class" [...] coaches, {{for a total}} of 14 cars. The demonstration route was not funded and WSDOT purchased the <b>trainset</b> in 2004 to expand service. The purchase also allowed Amtrak and WSDOT to redistrubute the [...] "coach class" [...] coaches. By using the two additional coaches from this new <b>trainset</b> and placing the two coaches from the spare set into regular service, the agencies were able to create four 13-car trains and one 12-car train.|$|R
25|$|The train ran its {{assigned}} route {{until the}} United States entered World War II, {{during which time}} the <b>trainset</b> ran on many different routes. As 9908 Silver Charger could be detached from its <b>trainset,</b> it continued in service hauling other trains after {{the rest of the}} streamlined <b>trainset</b> was withdrawn. In this form it lasted in service until 1966, following which it was donated to the Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the route}} east of New Haven is {{electrified}} under Amtrak's 60 Hz traction power system, Shore Line East currently operates entirely with diesel locomotives. Once the full order of M8 railcars are in service, and Amtrak tests and approves the M8s for usage east of New Haven, ConnDOT {{plans to use}} 24 to 32 cars for electric SLE service to reduce diesel emissions. The diesel <b>trainsets</b> will be moved to service on the Danbury or Waterbury branches, or to the planned Hartford Line from New Haven to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|South of the station, {{underneath}} 92nd Street, is {{a diamond}} crossover allowing northbound trains from track S2 to terminate on either track, then {{go into the}} storage tracks or proceed south on track S1. A section of tunnel north of the station, built in the 1970s between 99th and 105th Streets, was renovated. The tail tracks north of the station, which currently end at 99th Street, can store four <b>trainsets,</b> two on each track.|$|E
5|$|The Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151, {{sometimes}} {{abbreviated to}} C151 or KHI C151 {{is the first}} generation electric multiple unit rolling stock in operation on the North South and East West Lines of Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. These are the oldest trains built for the system; they were introduced in 1987 and are still in operation. Sixty-six <b>trainsets</b> consisting of six cars each and a single money trainset consisting of four cars were purchased. These trains are operated by SMRT Trains.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant has}} also {{produced}} a <b>trainset</b> for the P'yŏngyang Metro, unveiled {{at a ceremony}} at the plant on 23 October 2015, with Kim Jong-un in attendance. The <b>trainset</b> was delivered in late 2015 and went into service in January 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>trainset</b> {{comprised}} three specially modified Duplex cars, {{fitted with}} two powered bogies {{similar to the}} AGV prototype, marshalled between the TGV POS power cars. The record <b>trainset,</b> configured as Bo'Bo'+2'Bo'Bo'2'+Bo'Bo', had four more powered axles than <b>trainset</b> 325 during the 1990 speed record, and had a theoretical maximum power output of [...] instead of the [...] on a standard TGV. Over 600 sensors were fitted on various parts of both the engines and the cars.|$|R

5|$|Two years later, four {{units of}} vacuum {{fluorescent}} displays (VFD) were {{mounted on the}} ceiling. Eight units of dynamic route maps were mounted above every door in each car in trainset 053/054 for a two-month trial. This new SMRT Active Route Map Information System (STARiS) was then progressively introduced to all C151 <b>trainsets,</b> and subsequently to C651 and C751B trains for a cost of S$12 million—S$20,000 per car. It became standard equipment on all new rolling stocks subsequently introduced on the East-West Line and North-South Line.|$|E
5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, electric <b>trainsets</b> are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E
5|$|Based on the study, Governor William O'Neill ordered ConnDOT in October 1986 to {{initiate}} rail {{service on the}} corridor. It was established as a temporary service to newly reopened local stations between Union Station in New Haven and Old Saybrook, to alleviate traffic congestion that arose from scheduled construction work on I-95. O'Neill introduced a $50 million transportation program that included $900,000 (later reduced to $500,000) for basic stations and $4 million to refurbish 12 Budd Rail Diesel Cars for rolling stock. The RDCs {{were found to be}} insufficient and two diesel <b>trainsets</b> were purchased from the defunct PATrain service in 1989 instead. Testing of the equipment on the Northeast Corridor began on December 2, 1989.|$|E

5000|$|On 9 May 1998, a {{truck was}} struck by a Thalys PBKA on an {{unprotected}} level crossing; it had attempted to cross the tracks at the crossing when the train arrived. The truck driver was killed in the impact and the train's power unit and first two-passenger carriages derailed; the <b>trainset</b> was left heavily damaged. Six passengers were injured and tracks and catenary were broken in the incident. Passenger carriages R1 and R2 had to be scrapped. The <b>trainset</b> was later repaired with the R1 and R2 carriages from a regular TGV <b>trainset.</b>|$|R
