5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, {{and many of its}} provisions were interpreted more narrowly than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding {{the free exercise of}} religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances.

5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of potato crops. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>today</b> {{considered to be}} the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of potato leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E

5|$|The Domesday {{survey of}} 1086 {{revealed}} 110 households which were mainly rural. In 1251, a survey showed an increase to 345 households with {{the start of}} urban living although still largely rural. By the 1416 survey there were 457 occupied premises {{in the city and}} many of the streets were arranged much as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> See also the cartographer John Speed's plan of Ely, 1610. In 1563 there were 800 households and by 1753 the population was recorded as 3,000.|$|E
5|$|The red {{and white}} variety of toy spaniel was first seen in {{paintings}} by Titian, including the Venus of Urbino (1538), where a small dog {{is used as a}} symbol of female seductiveness. Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century. These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses, although the muzzles were more pointed than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs. The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy-sized spaniels.|$|E
5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying over the area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today,</b> with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E

5|$|All lemurs, {{particularly}} the smaller species, {{are affected by}} predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs, despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native euplerids, such as the fossa, feral cats, domestic dogs, snakes, diurnal birds of prey, owls, and crocodiles. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus Aquila and the giant Malagasy crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus mahery), {{as well as the}} giant fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including the giant subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> Today, predator size only restricts owls to the smaller lemurs, usually 100g (3.5oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey, such as the Madagascan harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) and the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus).|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today,</b> Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{of human}} {{existence}} in the state dates back over 10,000 years, {{with some of the}} best-known remains at the San Dieguito Complex in the El Pinacate Desert. The first humans were nomadic hunter gatherers who used tools made from stones, seashells, and wood. During much of the prehistoric period, the environmental conditions were less severe than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today,</b> with similar but more dense vegetation spread over a wider area.|$|E
25|$|The use of provinces as {{divisions}} {{of political power}} was supplanted by the system of counties after the Norman invasion.

25|$|Until the 1970s, {{when women}} first started coming to YMCA facilities, wearing {{clothing}} {{of any type}} in YMCA pools was strictly forbidden. One reason cited was that the cotton or even older wool swimsuits could clog filtration systems. Another reason was dirt and soap could be released into the pool from the fibres of swim wear. Filtration systems used in swimming pools were not as effective as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today,</b> and far less chlorine was used thus allowing the growth of bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Throughout much of {{the history}} of the United States, the Supreme Court of the United States was clearly the least {{powerful}} branch of the government, and nominations to that body, although important, were not the source of great political controversy as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> Until the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist in 2005, the composition of the Supreme Court had remained unchanged since 1994, the second longest time period without a membership change in U.S. history (the longest having been from 1812–1823).|$|E
25|$|In any event, this {{migration}} {{was achieved}} during the closing {{stages of the}} Pleistocene epoch, when sea levels were typically much lower than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>today.</b> Repeated episodes of extended glaciation resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100–150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the Timor Sea than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass (known as Sahul), connected by an extensive land bridge across the Arafura Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.|$|E
