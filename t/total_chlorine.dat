The mean temporal evolution of the sum of their monthly mean abundance time series indicates that the <b>total</b> stratospheric inorganic <b>chlorine</b> loading (Cly) has decreased slowly (- 0. 7 +/- 0. 3 %/yr, 1 -sigma) since it peaked in late 1996, at the limit of being statistically significant at the 2 -sigma level.

Spores of nonvirulent Bacillus anthracis strains 7702, ANR- 1, and 9131 were mixed with water, flour paste, whole milk, or egg yolk emulsion and dried onto stainless-steel carriers. The carriers were exposed to various concentrations of peroxyacetic acid, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), or hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) for 10 min at 10, 20, or 30 °C, after which time the survivors were quantified. The relationship between peroxyacetic acid concentration, H 2 O 2 concentration, and spore inactivation followed a sigmoid curve that was accurately described using a four-parameter logistic model. At 20 °C, the minimum concentrations of peroxyacetic acid, H 2 O 2, and NaOCl (as <b>total</b> available <b>chlorine)</b> predicted to inactivate 6 log 10 CFU of B. anthracis spores with no food residue present were 1. 05, 23. 0, and 0. 78 %, respectively. At 10 °C, sodium hypochlorite at 5 % <b>total</b> available <b>chlorine</b> did not inactivate more than 4 log 10 CFU. The presence of the food residues had only a minimal effect on peroxyacetic acid and H 2 O 2 sporicidal efficacy, but the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite was markedly inhibited by whole-milk and egg yolk residues. Sodium hypochlorite at 5 % <b>total</b> available <b>chlorine</b> provided no greater than a 2 -log 10 CFU reduction when spores were {{in the presence}} of egg yolk residue.

40|$|We present {{chlorine}} budgets calculated between 2004 and 2009 {{for four}} latitude bands (70 ° N– 30 ° N, 30 ° N– 0 ° N, 0 ° N– 30 ° S, and 30 ° S– 70 ° S). The budgets were calculated using ACE-FTS version 3. 0 retrievals {{of the volume}} mixing ratios (VMRs) of 9 chlorine-containing species: CCl 4, CFC- 12 (CCl 2 F 2), CFC- 11 (CCl 3 F), COCl 2, COClF, HCFC- 22 (CHF 2 Cl), CH 3 Cl, HCl and ClONO 2. These data were supplemented with calculated VMRs from the SLIMCAT 3 -D chemical transport model (CFC- 113, CFC- 114, CFC- 115, H- 1211, H- 1301, HCFC- 141 b, HCFC- 142 b, ClO and HOCl). The <b>total</b> <b>chlorine</b> profiles are dominated by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons up to 24 km in the tropics and 19 km in the extra-tropics. In this altitude range CFCs and halons account for 58 % of the <b>total</b> <b>chlorine</b> VMR. Above this altitude HCl increasingly dominates the <b>total</b> <b>chlorine</b> profile, reaching a maximum of 95 % of <b>total</b> <b>chlorine</b> at 54 km. All <b>total</b> <b>chlorine</b> profiles exhibit a positive slope with altitude, suggesting that the <b>total</b> <b>chlorine</b> VMR is now decreasing with time. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} time series of the mean stratospheric <b>total</b> <b>chlorine</b> budgets which show mean decreases in total stratospheric chlorine of 0. 38 ± 0. 03 % per year in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics, 0. 35 ± 0. 07 % per year in the Northern Hemisphere tropical stratosphere, 0. 54 ± 0. 16 % per year in the Southern Hemisphere tropics and 0. 53 ± 0. 12 % per year in the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropical stratosphere for 2004 – 2009.

HCl vertical profiles obtained from 15. 0 to 31. 0 km are presented and analysed to estimate the contribution of very short-lived substances (VSLS) to <b>total</b> stratospheric <b>chlorine.</b> Both retrieved vertical profiles of HCl from these flights globally agree very well with each other, with estimated overall uncertainties of 6 % on vmr between 23 and 31 km. Upper limits of HCl vmr as low as (20 &plusmn; 20) pptv in June 2008 and (30 &plusmn; 30) pptv in June 2005 are inferred in {{the upper part of}} the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Backward trajectory calculations suggest that these low amounts were sampled in air masses corresponding to typical background conditions, i. e. neither influenced by recent tropospheric nor stratospheric air. Taking into account the recently reported VSLS source gas measurements obtained in similar conditions (Laube et al., 2008) and the main intermediate product gas (COCl 2 ), a VSLS contribution of about (85 &plusmn; 35 pptv) to <b>total</b> stratospheric <b>chlorine</b> is inferred. This refines the WMO (2007) estimation of 50 to 100 pptv, which was not taking into account any HCl contribution. In addition, comparisons of HCl measurements between SPIRALE and MLS-Aura satellite instrument in the tropical lower and middle stratosphere lead to a very good agreement. Since HCl modelled values derived from a <b>total</b> stratospheric <b>chlorine</b> budget including 100 pptv of VSLS agree with MLS measurements in the upper stratosphere, the consistency between SPIRALE and MLS measurements provides another evidence for this VSLS contribution...|$|R

After 6 months, extensive meta dechlorination and moderate ortho dechlorination of Aroclor 1260 occurred in all incubated cultures except for sterilized controls. Overall, <b>total</b> <b>chlorines</b> per biphenyl decreased by up to 34 %. meta chlorines per biphenyl decreased by 65, 55, and 45 % and ortho chlorines declined by 18, 12, and 9 %, respectively, when 2, 3, 4, 5 -CB, 2, 3, 5, 6 -CB, or no additional congener was supplied. This is the first confirmed report of microbial ortho dechlorination of a commercial polychlorinated biphenyl mixture. In addition, compared with incubated cultures supplied with Aroclor 1260 alone, the dechlorination of Aroclor 1260 plus 2, 3, 4, 5 -CB or 2, 3, 5, 6 -CB occurred with shorter lag times (31 to 60 days versus 90 days) and was more extensive, indicating that {{the addition of a}} single congener stimulated the dechlorination of Aroclor 1260...|$|R

With the purpose of finding an alternative to thermal sterilization, this research aimed at assessing the efficiency and ideal concentration of sodium hypochlorite for sterilization of culture media and glassware used during rooting of micropropagated Gerbera hybrida cv.

The average mixing ratios of <b>total</b> organic <b>chlorine</b> and <b>total</b> organic bromine were 3. 50 +/- 0. 06 ppbv and 21. 1 +/- 0. 8 pptv, respectively.
