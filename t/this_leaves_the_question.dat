However, the different equilibria {{are likely to have}} different distributional implications and may be ranked differently by any given social welfare function. Second, by the Hopf index theorem, in regular economies the number of equilibria will be finite and all of them will be locally unique. This means that comparative statics, or the analysis of how the equilibrium changes when there are shocks to the economy, can still be relevant as long as the shocks are not too large. But <b>this</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of the stability of the equilibrium unanswered as a comparative statics point of view does not allow one to know what happens when one moves from one equilibrium : it has no reason to move to a new one.|$|E

General Arthur Wellesley, more freewheeling {{than most of}} the British high command, accepts the idea of Temeraire as an officer in his own right, treating Temeraire thereafter with all the rights and responsibilities of any colonel (including chewing him out when his command goes wrong, which to Temeraire's credit he takes to heart). Sir Hew Dalrymple Ross commands the defense of London, though Wellesley dismisses the effort as a lost cause, now that Horatio Nelson and his twenty ships have been sent to Copenhagen. Regardless, the effort is made, augmented by tactics created by Temeraire and Perscitia, a violence-abhorring but very clever dragon who (amongst other things) has been entrusted to operate the militia's artillery. Both sides involve about thirty thousand men, but <b>this</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of where Marshal Davout has got to; after the battle is joined, he is discovered outflanking the British with an additional twenty thousand.

5000|$|Tort victims {{differ from}} {{commercial}} creditors {{because they have}} no ability to contract around limited liability, and are therefore regarded differently under most state laws. The theory developed in the mid-20th century that beyond the corporation itself, it was more appropriate for the law to recognize the economic [...] "enterprise", which usually composes groups of corporations, where the parent takes the benefit of a subsidiary's activities and is capable of exercising decisive influence. A concept of [...] "enterprise liability" [...] was developed in fields such tax law, accounting practices, and antitrust law that were gradually received into the courts' jurisprudence. Older cases had suggested that there was no special right to pierce the veil in favor of tort victims, even where pedestrians had been hit by a tram owned by a bankrupt-subsidiary corporation, or by taxi-cabs that were owned by undercapitalized subsidiary corporations. More modern authority suggested a different approach. In a case concerning one of the worst oil spills in history, caused by the Amoco Cadiz which was owned through subsidiaries of the Amoco Corporation, the Illinois court that heard the case stated that the parent corporation was liable by the fact of its group structure. The courts therefore [...] "usually apply more stringent standards to piercing the corporate veil in a contract case than they do in tort cases" [...] because tort claimants do not voluntarily accept limited liability. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the US Supreme Court in United States v Bestfoods held if a parent corporation [...] "actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of" [...] a subsidiary's facilities it [...] "may be held directly liable". <b>This</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> {{of the nature of the}} common law, in absence of a specific statute, or where a state law forbids piercing the veil except on very limited grounds. One possibility is that tort victims go uncompensated, even while a parent corporation is solvent and has insurance. A second possibility is that a compromise liability regime, such as pro rata rather than joint and several liability is imposed across all shareholders regardless of size. A third possibility, and one that does not interfere with the basics of corporate law, is that a direct duty of care could be owed in tort to the injured person by parent corporations and major shareholders to the extent they could exercise control. This route means corporate enterprise would not gain a subsidy at the expense of other people's health and environment, and that there is no need to pierce the veil.|$|E

While the current state of annulling the TTP talks and uncertainty around TTIP are not attributed to these concerns, ongoing mega-regional (and bilateral) negotiations must bear these policy aspects in mind.

30|$|Since the {{contraction}} (Tc) and re-solidification (Tr) temperatures observed by Khan (1985) did not change, while the reported softening temperature (Ts) plummeted {{with the increase}} of CO 2 pressure; we may conclude that the “softening effect” was subtle and had to be determined by either elimination of the baseline drift or its stabilization and baseline subtraction. These details were not provided in the published reports. Based upon discussions with Dr. Khan (Khan 2006), it was surmised that either one of the above baseline approaches was used in his study. Specifically, Khan (1985) presumably used a part of the test run (with a fresh sample) up to the temperature of 350  °C, and its extrapolation to higher temperatures as a baseline. <b>This</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of what alternative detection method was used for the lower softening temperatures (either around 60  °C or even if it were just under 350  °C) unanswered.|$|E
40|$|The {{years between}} 1900 and 1930 {{have been a}} crucial period for the {{formation}} of large organizations in the Western world.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the question of existence and uniqueness of absolutely continuous invariant measures for expanding C^ 1 maps of the circle. This is a question which arises naturally from results which are known {{in the case of}} expanding C^k maps of the circle where k≥ 2, or even C^ 1 +ϵ expanding maps of the circle. In these cases, it is known that there exists a unique absolutely continuous invariant probability measure by the so-called `Folklore Theorem'. It follows that this measure is ergodic. It has been shown however that for C^ 1 maps there need not be any such measure.
