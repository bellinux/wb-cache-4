Of these four sites, Škocjan Caves and the Primeval Beech Forests are natural sites while the other two are cultural sites, as determined by the organization's selection criteria.|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the war between Denmark and Germany in 1864, the area Dybbøl Banke {{is considered to be a}} national site of memory in Denmark as well as in Germany. The fact that both countries have this relation to the site makes it not only a national but also a <b>transnational</b> <b>site</b> of memory. History Centre Dybbøl Banke is placed at the original battlefield of the war in 1864. The communication at the centre tries to vitalise the story of the war through for instance activities, films and narratives. Through a study of the experiences and the activities that takes place at the centre, we seek to answer the question: How does the History Centre Dybbøl Banke combine dissemination of knowledge with the activities of experiences in their account of the history of 1864 ? This project also treats the issue of how the centre act regarding the circumstance that the position of the centre is located at a both national and <b>transnational</b> <b>site</b> of memory...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the recent debates and emerging concepts in the international business literature by applying a social-institutionalist perspective {{that focuses on the}} processes of institution building in ventures between Western multinational corporations and post-socialist enterprises. It is argued that the knowledge and learning processes within these <b>transnational</b> <b>sites</b> are constitutive of the actual management and organizational practices that emerge in these social microcosms of transformation. In transition and other emerging economic contexts, international ventures are typically based on asymmetrical relationships, in which the balance of power is structurally weighted in favor of the MNC. Notwithstanding this dominance structure, constructing new practices within the transnational social space is a socio-political process involving power-holders such as senior managers representing the Western MNC and the local enterprise. The paper argues that the strategic orientations of these key power-holders are critical variables in explaining the diversity of concrete patterns of institution building on <b>transnational</b> <b>sites.</b> Socio-political processes Management learning Transnational institution building Multinational corporations Transition and emerging economies...|$|R

40|$|A critical, albeit understudied, {{dimension}} of the backlash against women’s anti-violence advocacy is the rise of Indian men’s rights organizations formed to lobby for changes to, and in some cases, the complete abolition of vital legal protections for women. Utilizing cyber forums, public protests, and print media, these groups disseminate narratives of women wreaking destruction on the Indian family through their alleged misuse of “gender-biased” laws. These activities are significant because they operate as <b>transnational</b> <b>sites</b> of meaning making about the realities of violence against women in India and because they conspire in a distortion of reality that jeopardizes ongoing advocacy efforts...|$|R

We {{examined the relationship between}} the follow-up interval after an in-range (2. 0 - 3. 0) INR and anticoagulation control. METHODS: We studied 104, 451 patients receiving anticoagulation from 100 anticoagulation clinics in the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Most patients (98, 877) recorded at least one in-range INR followed by another INR within 56 days. For each such patient, we selected the last in-range INR and characterized the interval between this 2 ̆ 2 index value 2 ̆ 2 and the next INR. The independent variable was <b>site</b> <b>mean</b> follow-up interval after an in-range INR. The dependent variable was <b>site</b> <b>mean</b> risk-adjusted percent time in therapeutic range (TTR). RESULTS: <b>Site</b> <b>mean</b> interval varied from 25 - 38 days.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the Narmada damming project in India is constituted and contested by the state, affected tribal peoples (adivasis), and a transnational advocacy network {{led by the}} Narmada Bachao Andolan (Save the Narmada Movement). Based on ethnographic fieldwork, and employing critical anthropological perspectives on development and globalization, the power relations underlying dominance and resistance are mapped out. The conflicting discourses, strategies and practices of Narmada proponents and opponents are conceptualized within local, regional, national, and <b>transnational</b> <b>sites</b> and modalities. Further, the negotiation of state dominance and adivasi resistance is analyzed through contradictory practice and shifting political alignments. Lastly, this thesis delineates how the Narmada conflict is permeated by complex symbolic and moral mechanisms activated by both state authorities and activist resistors...|$|R

Responding to the call for a sociolinguistics of globalization that describes and interprets mobile linguistic resources, speakers, and markets, we draw on long-term ethnographic fieldwork to explore the transnational nature of these mobile and globalized sites, ideologies of Indigenous language and identity present there, and flexible language practices therein. From our analysis of selected narratives and interactions observed and recorded between 2004 and 2009, we argue that these sites, ideologies, and language practices constitute productive spaces for Indigenous language speakers to intervene in a historically and enduringly unequal, globalizing world...|$|R

40|$|The {{density and}} biomass {{of fish and}} crayfish, and the {{production}} of eels, was compared among streams in native forest, exotic forest, and pasture. Populations were estimated by multiple-pass electroshocking at 11 sites in hill-country streams in the Waikato region, North Island. Three sites were in native forest, four in exotic forest, and four in pasture. Length of stream sampled at each site was 46 - 94 m (41 - 246 m 2 in area), and catchment areas up stream of the sites ranged from 0. 44 to 2. 01 km 2. A total of 487 fish were caught. The species were longfinned and shortfinned eels, banded kokopu, Cran's and redfinned bullies, and common smelt. Eels were the most abundant fish in all three land-use types, and shortfinned eels were more abundant at pastoral <b>sites</b> (<b>mean</b> density 1. 11 fish m- 2) than longfinned eels (mean density 0. 129 fish m- 2). Banded kokopu were present only at forested <b>sites.</b> <b>Mean</b> fish densities were greater at pastoral sites (1. 55 fish m- 2) than under either native forest (0. 130 fish m- 2) or exotic forest (0. 229 fish m- 2). Mean fish biomass was also greater at pastoral sites (89. 7 g m- 2) than under native forest (12. 8 g m- 2) or exotic forest (19. 3 g m- 2). Longfinned eels made a greater contribution to the fish biomass at all sites than did shortfinned eels. Densities of crayfish were high (0. 46 - 5. 40 crayfish m- 2), but were not significantly different between land-use types. Crayfish biomass ranged from 1. 79 to 11. 2 g m- 2.

In so doing, it asks three principal research questions. First, how has the understanding of complementarity evolved since the ICC’s inception and what role have non-state actors, in particular, played in this evolution? Second, how have ICC judges understood and interpreted complementarity’s requirements in the courtroom, and how has the Office of the Prosecutor sought to implement it as a matter of policy? And third, to what extent and how have the ICC’s interventions in Uganda, Kenya and the DRC affected these countries’ institutional and normative frameworks for carrying out domestic criminal proceedings...|$|R
