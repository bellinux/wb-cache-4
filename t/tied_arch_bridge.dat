Investigation and {{analysis}} of the hanger arrangement and the structural stability of a Network <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> – a tied-arch bridge with inclined hangers that cross each other at least twice. It is also necessary to make a comparative analysis with other types of hanger arrangements. Methodology. The authors in their research investigated a large number of parameters to determine their influence in the force distribution in the arch. Eventually they determined optimal values for all parameters. These optimal values allowed developing a design guide that leads to optimal arch design. When solving this problem, the authors used three-dimensional finite element models and the objective was to determine the most suitable solution for a road bridge, with a span of 100 meters, consisting of two inclined steel arches, located on a road with two traffic lanes, subjected to medium traffic. The virtual prototype of the model is performed by finite element simulator Midas Civil. Findings. In this study, for the bridge deck, a concrete tie appears to be the best solution considering the structural behavior of network arches, but economic advantages caused by easier erection may lead to steel or a composite bridge deck as better alternatives. Design requirements and local conditions of each particular bridge project will decide the most economic deck design. Originality. To ensure passenger comfort and the stability and continuity of the track, deformations of bridges are constricted. A network arch is a stiff structure with small deflections and therefore suitable to comply with such demands even for high speed railway traffic.  A network <b>arch</b> <b>bridge</b> with a concrete tie usually saves more than half the steel required for <b>tied</b> <b>arches</b> with vertical hangers and concrete ties.

40|$|The {{arrangement}} of the hangers in <b>tied</b> <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> {{is one of the}} key issues in optimizing the design of this typology of bridges. Bending moments in the <b>arch</b> and the <b>tie</b> and axial forces in the hangers are usually the parameters on which attention is focused. The hangers are particularly vulnerable to fatigue phenomena but the variation of axial forces in hangers is not deeply studied despite the fact that it is an important parameter in relation to the fatigue behaviour of the hangers. In this context, this paper mainly deals with the reduction of fatigue stressing in hangers of road <b>arch</b> <b>bridges.</b> The analysis is carried out by varying the vehicular load position along the deck; the assumed parameters are the maximum variation and the average variation of the hanger force. Various hanger arrangements are considered: vertical, fan and network arrangement with inclined hangers having multiple intersections. One of the main results is that, on the one hand, vertical and fan arrangements are better than network ones if the fatigue in the hangers is considered as the only parameter, and, on the other hand, network arrangements are globally the best if the bending moments in the <b>arch</b> and the <b>tie</b> and the absolute values of the axial forces in hangers are also considered. Therefore, the work also focuses on decreasing the fatigue stressing of vertical, fan and network arrangements without increasing the bending moments in the <b>arch</b> and the <b>tie.</b> The results suggest that a slight modification of the radial arrangement near the arch springing points, namely using steeper hangers, leads to a smaller force variation in the hangers without increasing the bending moments in the <b>arch</b> and the <b>tie...</b>|$|R

40|$|The usual {{moderate}} {{dimensions of}} footbridges allow design architects (and sometimes engineers) {{to provide such}} structures with capricious forms. Under such circumstances, {{the analysis of the}} service state is usually very thorough, devoting {{to the study of the}} construction stages much less attention. However, it is very well known that the construction procedure can determine the service stage. Moreover, dimensions of footbridges also allow a wide range of construction procedures. For example, when cables are used to help to support the deck, as in cable stayed bridges, those are, namely, cantilever method, temporary support method, movement of the bridge to its final position as well as bridge launching. When the cables are used in <b>tied</b> <b>arch</b> <b>bridges</b> most of the previously mentioned methods might be used, especially temporary support method, movement of the bridge to its final position as well as bridge launching techniques. Having this in mind, it is crucial for the designer and for the contractor to have practical tools for construction control of the tensioning process of the stays, as this will condition the service stresses of the bridges. This is challenging, as the prestressing of one stay affects the stresses of the already installed stays. This paper will present a procedure to calculate the stress to be given to the first strand of a stay when the strand by strand tensioning technique is used. Also, a procedure to modify the tensioning process of a cable supported bridges to minimize deviation between design and actual stay stresses in service will be presented.

A damper with variable stiffness is tuned based on estimates of the real-time frequency response, facilitating optimal vibration mitigation. The performance of the developed routines is investigated on an existing <b>tied</b> <b>arch</b> railway <b>bridge.</b> Based on previous field measurements, resonant behaviour of several hangers was found. In combination with low structural damping, the induced stresses resulted in a reduced fatigue service life. Passive dampers are currently installed on the longer hangers, each tuned to the fundamental natural frequency of the individual hanger. However, increased axial force during train passage results in a significant variation in natural frequency, with an apparent risk of detuning the passive dampers. The predicted performance of an adaptive damping system to account for this variation in dynamic behaviour is presented and its potential application is discussed. QC 20130507 Long Life Bridge...|$|R
