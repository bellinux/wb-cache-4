5|$|In {{response}} to Uncle Tom's Cabin, {{writers in the}} Southern United States produced {{a number of books}} to rebut Stowe's novel. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> were a childlike people unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{tensions}} {{were growing}} between the North and South over various issues including slavery. The Wilmot Proviso, introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, {{it would have}} banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 brought a temporary respite, but the Dred Scott case, decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1857, spurred public debate. Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> had no standing as citizens under the constitution. Northerners were outraged and there was increasing talk in the South of secession from the Union.|$|E
5|$|United States President Woodrow Wilson {{pronounced}} white participants the instigators of {{the prolonged}} riots in Chicago and Washington, D.C.. As a result, {{he attempted to}} promote greater racial harmony through the promotion of voluntary organizations and through the enactment of legislative improvements by the United States Congress. He did not change the segregation of federal departments which he had imposed early during his first administration, however. The Chicago Race Riot of 1919 shocked the nation and raised awareness of the problems <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> faced {{every day in the}} 20th century United States.|$|E

Looking at the black community as a monolith may prevent us from seeing <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> women are the targets of specific social welfare policies or <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men are being disproportionately incarcerated. Both of these results stem from racism, but take on a gendered approach.|$|R

5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth and believed <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E
5|$|Abram Lincoln Harris, Jr. (January 17, 1899 – November 6, 1963) was an American economist, academic, {{anthropologist}} and {{a social}} critic {{of blacks in the}} United States. Considered by many as the first African American to achieve prominence in the field of economics, Harris was also known for his heavy influence on black radical and neo-conservative thought in the United States. As an economist, Harris is most famous for his 1931 collaboration with political scientist Sterling Spero to produce a study on African-American labor history titled The Black Worker and his 1936 work The Negro as Capitalist, in which he criticized black businessmen for not promoting interracial trade. He headed the economics department at Howard University from 1936 to 1945 and taught at the University of Chicago from then until his death. As a social critic, Harris took an active radical stance on racial relations by examining historical black involvement in the workplace, and suggested <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> needed to take more action in race relations.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} to enter World War I in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, Joel Spingarn, established a camp to train African Americans {{to serve as}} officers in the United States military. The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> should not participate in what they considered a white man's war. Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, Charles Young, on a pretense of ill health. The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks {{that came from the}} camp. Over 700,000 blacks enlisted {{on the first day of}} the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.|$|E

5|$|To {{defeat the}} Voting Rights Act, McCulloch {{introduced}} an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It {{would have allowed}} the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, {{and it would have}} imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats {{as an alternative to the}} Voting Rights Act. The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing the Voting Rights Act. However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the Voting Rights Act would legitimately ensure <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed the Voting Rights Act by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these suspicions, many African-American leaders {{supported}} efforts to supply birth control to the African-American community. In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's Urban League, asked Sanger to open a clinic in Harlem.Engelman, p. 160. Sanger secured funding from the Julius Rosenwald Fund and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the Birth Control Federation of America (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS).Engelman, pp. 175–177. As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> {{were more likely to}} take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.Allegations of racism can be found in Franks, Angela (2005), Margaret Sanger's Eugenic Legacy: The Control of Female Fertility, McFarland; and in Davis, Angela (1981), Women, Race, and Class.|$|E

The researcher utilized a quantitative research design by collecting survey data from 71 charter school parents. The findings indicate the following reasons <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> parents remove their students from traditional public schools: their desire for a safer schooling environment, higher expectations for their students, individualized attention, and a college-going atmosphere. Recommendations are made for traditional public school leaders to consider the implementation of these practices...|$|R

25|$|After emancipation, unique African-American traditions {{continued}} to flourish, as distinctive traditions or radical innovations in music, art, literature, religion, cuisine, and other fields. 20th-century sociologists, such as Gunnar Myrdal, believed <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> had {{lost most of}} their cultural ties with Africa.
