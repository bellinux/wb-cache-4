5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats <b>to</b> <b>Bruce</b> and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Demi Moore was {{a budding}} A-list film star {{who had been}} married <b>to</b> <b>Bruce</b> Willis since 1987.

Following the photo, she would earn $3 million for her 1992 role in A Few Good Men and $5 million apiece for roles in Indecent Proposal (1993), Disclosure (1994) and The Scarlet Letter (1995).|$|E
5|$|Originally {{called the}} Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo, the award was first {{presented}} <b>to</b> <b>Bruce</b> Springsteen in 1988 for the album Tunnel of Love. Since then, the award {{was presented in}} 1992 and 1994, and has been awarded each year since 2005. Beginning with the 2005 ceremony, {{the name of the}} award was changed to Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. For these years, the award combined and replaced the gender-specific awards for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. This fusion has been criticized, especially when females are not nominated under the solo category. The Academy has cited a lack of eligible recordings in the female rock category as the reason for the mergers.|$|E

5|$|Bruce {{began to}} attract the {{attention}} of big-name clubs in late 1987, with Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Rangers all reported to be interested in signing him. Manchester United quickly emerged as the front runners for his signature, and Bruce publicly expressed his desire to sign for the club. The deal came close to collapsing when Norwich asked for a transfer fee of £900,000 after initially agreeing to accept £800,000, leading <b>to</b> <b>Bruce</b> refusing to play any further matches for the club, which he felt was jeopardising his dream move. On 17 December 1987, shortly before his 27th birthday, the deal was concluded and Bruce officially left Carrow Road, for a fee reported as £800,000 or £825,000. Norwich fans remembered his contribution, and in 2002 voted him into the Norwich City Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Bruce missed {{several weeks}} of the 1991–92 season when he {{underwent}} an operation on a longstanding hernia problem, in which Leeds United, after a season-long tussle, beat Manchester United to the championship by four points. Bruce helped United win their first-ever League Cup in April 1992, captaining the team in the final {{in place of the}} injured Bryan Robson. Injuries continued to take their toll upon Robson during the 1992–93 season, leading <b>to</b> <b>Bruce</b> captaining the team in the majority of United's matches during the first season of the new Premier League. Bruce scored two late goals in a win over Sheffield Wednesday which proved decisive in United winning the inaugural Premier League title, the first time the club had won the championship of English football since 1967, and he and Robson received the trophy jointly after the home victory over Blackburn Rovers on 3 May.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of the School's operation, the {{character}} of the area had changed beyond recognition. Historically, Tottenham had consisted of four villages on Ermine Street (later the A10 road), surrounded by marshland and farmland. The construction of the Northern and Eastern Railway in 1840, with stations at Tottenham Hale and Marsh Lane (later Northumberland Park), made commuting from Tottenham to central London feasible for the first time (albeit by a circuitous eight-mile route via Stratford, more than double the distance of the direct road route), as well as providing direct connections to the Port of London. In 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a direct line from Enfield to Liverpool Street station, including a station at Bruce Grove, close <b>to</b> <b>Bruce</b> Castle; the railway provided subsidised workmen's fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in central London. As a major rail hub, Tottenham grew into a significant residential and industrial area; {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the only remaining undeveloped areas were the grounds of Bruce Castle itself, and the waterlogged floodplains of the River Lea at Tottenham Marshes and of the River Moselle at Broadwater Farm.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Bruce,</b> {{men were}} needed to allow Australia's {{extensive}} resources to be developed. In 1923, much of Australia's land was virtually unoccupied, and Bruce believed Australia {{had the potential to}} be one of the most fertile and productive nations in the world, which could sustain populations upward of 100 million over time more than 16 times the population of his time. Despite dissenting voices from scientists, who noted that poor climate, soils and water availability were significant barriers to large populations, the Bruce-Page government enacted policies to encourage large numbers of British to migrate to Australia. Under the auspices of the new Development and Migration Commission, £34 million in loans took place over the decade starting in 1924 to facilitate immigrant settlement through improvements to rural infrastructure, land access, and subsidising immigrant journeys ("passages"). Estimates as high as half a million British immigrants over ten years were predicted at the start of the policy, whereas just over 200,000 travelled to Australia during that time period. Bruce's settlement plan rested on rural growth. Migrants were often selected on the basis of their willingness to work on the land; state and Commonwealth governments concentrated their investment on rural development and encouraged returned servicemen to take up farms on the periphery of settled areas. Despite this, a majority of these migrants settled in urban areas, as Australia's rural areas were far more remote and difficult to work (than for example England's) and many of those taking advantage of the assistance scheme were urban workers or family and friends of those already settled. Immigration from outside Great Britain and her dominions was considered unpalatable the Bruce government upheld the White Australia policy by placing strong restrictions on immigration from other areas, notwithstanding its population growth targets.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Yankees in the {{eleventh}} {{game of the}} season. It {{was the first of}} three road games the Browns were scheduled to play in a span of eight days. The Browns opened the scoring early in the first quarter with a screen pass from Graham to Motley, who ran 78 yards for a touchdown. An interception by Parseghian on the Yankees' next possession set up another Browns touchdown, a one-yard run by Edgar Jones. The Yankees responded with two touchdowns of their own in the second quarter. The first was a long pass from Pete Layden <b>to</b> <b>Bruce</b> Alford early in the period. On Cleveland's next possession, Graham threw a pass to John Yonakor, but as Yonakor was waiting for the ball to arrive, New York's Otto Schnellbacher jumped {{in front of him and}} made an interception. Schnellbacher had a clear shot at Cleveland's end zone and ran it in for a touchdown that tied the game at 14 points. An interception by Yonakor later in the quarter set up a Groza field goal, and the Browns pulled away as halfback Bob Cowan ran for a touchdown and Groza added another field goal before halftime. Another touchdown by Motley in the third quarter put the Browns ahead by 20 points. The Yankees scored a final touchdown in the fourth quarter to cap a 45-yard drive, but the Browns won the game 34–21. Lavelli was hit in the eye early in the game and had to sit out. Tackle Chubby Grigg and Edgar Jones were also hurt in the game, adding to Cleveland's long list of injured players.|$|E
