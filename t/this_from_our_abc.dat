60|$|About {{the middle}} of the {{afternoon}} came a summons for Manchon and me to go to Joan's dungeon--a summons from Cauchon. But by that time distrust had already taken possession of the English and their soldiery again, and all Rouen was in an angry and threatening mood.

40|$|We {{prove that}} if Gj are right orderable groups with non-trivial cyclic subgroups Cj (j = 1, 2), then the (group) free product of G 1 and G 2 with C 1 and C 2 amalgamated is right orderable. We will deduce <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> main theorem that every lattice-ordered group can be {{embedded}} in {{one in which}} there are precisely four conjugacy classes. As a consequence of our method, we also show that every right ordered group can be embedded in a right ordered group in which any two non-identity elements are conjugate...|$|R

40|$|One {{consequence}} of globalisation is the demand on academics to better {{prepare students for}} work and life in an interconnected world through curriculum internationalisation. Many academics are hesitant, resistant, or ill-prepared to engage with curriculum internationalisation. This paper explores how this can be addressed by reconfiguring the way academic developers engage with academics within their teaching/program teams at the discipline level. Drawing on Star Trek and nomadic space, we theorise a participatory, situative approach to engaging disciplinary academic teams in the internationalisation of the curriculum process. We illustrate <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> work with teaching/program teams in two Australian universities...|$|R

25|$|The point {{really about}} all <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> {{perspective}} {{has been that}} the critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs.
