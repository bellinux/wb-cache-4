25|$|The script {{laid out}} quite {{specifically}} how characters were {{to move and}} behave, but the actors themselves chose how to bring these directions <b>to</b> <b>life.</b> <b>For</b> example, when Alec Hardy tells Ellie Miller that her husband is the murderer, the script called for Hardy to come round to Miller's {{side of the table}} and for Miller to vomit after the revelation. David Tennant was allowed to improvise how he came round the table and whether he sat or stood. Olivia Colman improvised the portrayal of nausea by rising, crouching, turning to the wall, and vomiting. Director James Strong knew that this put stress on his technical crew, who often had to guess what technical adjustments had to be made (such as lighting or the placement of microphones) in order to accommodate this unusual style of direction and acting. But he felt this spontaneity freed the cast and permitted them to deliver far more intense performances. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right, as Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes.|$|E

500|$|Pliny's Natural History {{was written}} {{alongside}} other substantial works (which {{have since been}} lost). Pliny (23–79) combined his scholarly activities with a busy career as an imperial administrator for the emperor Vespasian.

The two men joined again for the 19851987 Voyage of Rediscovery to New Zealand, again with Nainoa as principal navigator and Mau as mentor.

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1863, the 1st Kentucky Brigade formed a part of General Braxton Bragg's counteroffensive against Union Major General William Rosecrans in Chattanooga, Tennessee. At 9:30 am on September 20, 1863, the {{divisions}} of Generals Breckinridge and Patrick Cleburne were ordered to move forward. Helm's brigade and the others in Breckinridge's division drove into the Federals' left. General Cleburne's division, which was intended to strike {{near the center of}} the line, was delayed by heavy fire from Union soldiers, leaving the left flank unguarded. Repeated attempts to overwhelm the Federals were in vain, though some of Helm's Kentuckians and Alabamans managed to reach within [...] of the Federal line. In less than an hour of the order given to advance, fully one third of the Orphan Brigade had been lost. While the remainder of Helm's men clashed with the Union line, a sharpshooter from the 15th Kentucky Union Infantry shot Helm in the chest. Bleeding profusely, he remained in the saddle a few moments before toppling to the ground. After being carried off the battlefield, Helm's surgeons concluded that his wounds would be fatal. Helm clung <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> several hours. Knowing that his health was deteriorating, he asked who had won the battle. When assured that the Confederates had carried the day, he muttered: [...] "Victory!, Victory!, Victory!". On September 21, 1863, Gen. Helm succumbed to his wounds.|$|E
500|$|Kumi Tanioka has {{described}} the musical style for the soundtrack to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles as being based on [...] "ancient instruments".

The piano performances in the Ring of Fates soundtrack were done by Kumi Tanioka. She did the performances herself rather than use an outside performer as most Final Fantasy soundtracks have done primarily because she [...] "likes to play piano", and were done without any sheet music, as she preferred instead to improvise. She took extensive piano lessons as a child, and lists piano and choral music as the biggest influences on her musical style. [...] She also claims to have been influenced by music {{from a wide variety of}} cultures, such as Indonesian, Irish and Balinese music.
