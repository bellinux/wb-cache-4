5|$|Much {{public outrage}} {{resulted}} from the mystery shrouding Claudius' death and the death itself; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> desire among the people of Rome that anyone suspected in Claudius' murder be executed and this included Halotus; he was not killed, and Nero allowed him to retain his position throughout his reign.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Claudius, much public outrage ensued, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> desire in the general public that Halotus and several other {{suspects}} (such as Tigellinus, another servant who served Claudius), be executed. Nero, who acceded to the throne, allowed Halotus to continue as chief steward and taster; Halotus served Nero until the latter's death in 68, and Galba's assumption of the throne.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Labour's 1997 election victory, referendums {{were held in}} Scotland and Wales regarding devolution. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> majority supporting devolution in Scotland and a narrower majority in Wales; Scotland received a stronger degree of devolution than Wales. The Labour government passed laws in 1998 to establish a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, the first elections for these were held in 1999. Blair attempted to continue peace negotiations in Northern Ireland by offering {{the creation of a}} regional parliament and government. In 1998, the Good Friday Agreement was made, which allowed for a 108-member elected assembly and a power-sharing arrangement between nationalists and unionists. Blair was personally involved in these negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Technically, the Kleinschmidt orthography {{focused upon}} morphology: the same derivational affix would {{be written in}} the same way in {{different}} contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter) whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> {{majority}} in the English Parliament for removing James and offering the throne to Mary; William's demand he be made joint monarch and sole ruler {{in the event of}} Mary's death was far more controversial and only narrowly approved. In Scotland, William was the main prize, not Mary; as a fellow Calvinist, the Presbyterian majority saw him as a natural ally in regaining control of Kirk and government. The Episcopalian minority who formed the existing government recognised his support {{was the only way to}} preserve their power. As a result, on 7th January 1689 the Scottish Privy Council asked William to take over the government in Scotland pending a formal Settlement.|$|E

5|$|Although a Junimist for a {{large part}} of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a {{precursor}} in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a piece by Heliade in the Conservative Party's main journal, Epoca. One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher Marius Chicoş Rostogan, shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories. Developing his own theory, he claimed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> difference between, on one hand, the generation of Heliade Rădulescu, Ion Câmpineanu, and Nicolae Bălcescu, and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu—he identified the latter grouping with hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption, while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.|$|E
5|$|The fen was {{inundated}} in 1798, and {{the civil}} engineers William Jessop and John Rennie were asked to assist the local engineers Edward Hare and George Maxwell. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> understanding that the outfalls were too high to allow proper drainage by gravity, and two possible solutions were considered. The first was an outfall at a lower level, which would involve hugh expense in its construction, and the second, favoured by Jessop and Rennie, was the provision of steam pumping engines at Pode Hole. These would pump water from the internal drains of the fen to Vernatt's Drain, and the lower internal water levels would allow the existing wind-powered drainage mills to work efficiently. A report was produced, which {{formed the basis for}} the Deeping Fen Act of 1801. The channel of the Welland above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains which crossed the fen to join Vernatt's Drain at Pode Hole were made deeper. At the time there were no steam engines working in the fens, and Rennie's recommendation of a steam pumping station at Pode Hole was not implemented.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} Henry’s {{assemblage}} of domains was largely {{dependent on the}} ruling family, influencing the opinion of most historians that this instability made it unlikely to endure. The French custom of partible inheritance at the time would lead to political fragmentation. Indeed, if Henry II's sons Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany had not died young, the inheritance of 1189 would have been fundamentally altered. Henry and Richard both planned for partition on their deaths while attempting to provide overriding sovereignty to hold the lands together. For example, in 1173 and 1183 Henry tried to force Richard to acknowledge allegiance to his older brother for the duchy of Aquitaine and later Richard would confiscate Ireland from John. This was complicated by the Angevins' being subjects of the kings of France, who felt these feudal rights of homage {{and the right of}} allegiance more legally belonged to them. This was particularly true when the wardship of Geoffrey's son Arthur and lordship of Brittany was contended between 1202 and 1204. On the Young King’s death in 1183, Richard became heir in chief, but refused to give up Aquitaine to give John an inheritance. More by accident than design this meant that, while Richard inherited the patrimony, John would become lord of Ireland and Arthur would be duke of Brittany. By the mid-thirteenth century <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> unified patrimony and Plantagenet empire but this cannot be called an Angevin Empire as by this date Anjou and most of the continental lands had been lost.|$|E
