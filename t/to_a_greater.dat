5|$|Actual {{rates of}} {{diffusion}} and perfusion, and solubility of gases in specific physiological tissues are not generally known, and vary considerably.

In personal dive computers, they produce a real-time estimate of decompression status and display it for the diver.|$|E
5|$|Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and the Gilded Age of Paleontology (2005) is {{a graphic}} novel written by Jim Ottaviani and {{illustrated}} by the company Big Time Attic. The book tells a slightly fictionalized account of the Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry which led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States. This novel is the first semi-fictional work written by Ottaviani; previously, he had taken no creative license with the characters he depicted, portraying them strictly according to historical sources.|$|E

5|$|F. rubiginosa is {{exclusively}} pollinated in {{a symbiotic}} relationship with Pleistodontes imperialis, a species of fig wasp. Biologist Eleanor Haine and colleagues analysed the DNA of the wasp across the fig's range and determined four cryptic lineages forming what they term the P. imperialis species complex. They diverge <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> degree than some distinct wasp species, yet form a monophyletic group; this indicates that the wasp lineages have split without a change of host.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} are {{unwilling or unable to}} take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.|$|E

5|$|Osteopathic {{physicians}} have historically entered primary care fields {{at a higher}} rate than their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining. Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E

5|$|Preliminary {{design work}} for the Montana class began before the US entry into World War II. The first two vessels were {{approved}} by Congress in 1939 following {{the passage of the}} Second Vinson Act. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor delayed construction of the Montana class. The success of carrier combat at the Battle of the Coral Sea and, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> extent, the Battle of Midway, diminished the value of the battleship. Consequently, the US Navy chose to cancel the Montana class in favor of more urgently needed aircraft carriers, amphibious and anti-submarine vessels.|$|E
5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of {{a small fraction of}} the total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> extent than NAP.|$|E
5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. <b>To</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
