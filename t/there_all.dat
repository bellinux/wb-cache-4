5|$|The Rangers {{arrived in}} Korea on 24 March. They disembarked from the Army Transport Ship at Pusan. After {{spending}} {{a night or}} two <b>there,</b> <b>all</b> three companies continued on to Inchon on an LST Landing Ship, Tank, arriving at Inchon on 31 March.

5|$|During April 2011 {{internal}} deliberations of the president's innermost {{circle of}} advisors {{over whether to}} order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton {{was among those who}} argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan. Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden's death, Clinton {{played a key role in}} the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader. During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops <b>there</b> (<b>all</b> ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).|$|E

5|$|Gaelic football, hurling and {{handball}} are {{the best-known}} of the Irish traditional sports, collectively known as Gaelic games. Gaelic games {{are governed by}} the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), {{with the exception of}} ladies' Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500 capacity Croke Park in north Dublin. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007–10, international rugby and soccer were played <b>there.</b> <b>All</b> GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.|$|E

5|$|The North Korean 4th and 9th Divisions {{were almost}} {{completely}} {{destroyed in the}} battles at Naktong Bulge. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men {{at the beginning of}} the offensive on September 1. The 4th Division numbered 5,500. Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. The majority of the North Korean troops had been killed, captured or deserted. The exact number of North Korean casualties at Yongsan is impossible to determine, but a substantial amount of the attacking force was lost <b>there.</b> <b>All</b> of NK II Corps was in a similar state, and the North Korean army, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat.|$|E
5|$|The man is now standing, {{his arms}} crossed, and watches with {{pleasure}} as Beyoncé continues the private dance. After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently <b>there</b> <b>all</b> along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E
5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating <b>there</b> <b>all</b> the energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive broach, which completely machines the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the broach machines outward from <b>there.</b> <b>All</b> of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|E
5|$|Although Chang'an was {{the capital}} of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after {{subsequent}} destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8km) of outer walls running north to south. The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's central axis. From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from <b>there</b> <b>all</b> the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple city blocks. The city was made famous for this checkerboard pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems. During the Heian period, the city of Heian kyō (present-day Kyoto) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an. Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc. Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Daoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju football. In 662, Emperor Gaozong moved the imperial court to the Daming Palace, which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.|$|E
