40|$|AZD 5206 {{is a novel}} {{antimicrobial}} agent with potent in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus. We evaluated the in vitro pharmacodynamics of AZD 5206 against a standard wild-type methicillin-susceptible strain (ATCC 29213) and a clinical strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (SA 62). Overall, bacterial killing against a low baseline inoculum was more remarkable. Low dos-ing exposures and/or high baseline inoculum resulted in early reduction in bacterial burden, followed by regrowth and selective amplification of the resistant population. Staphylococcus aureus is a clinically important pathogen and acommon cause of bloodstream, surgical site, skin, and skin structure infections, as well as nosocomial pneumonia (1). AZD 5206 is a novel (nonfluoroquinolone) bacterial type II <b>topo-isomerase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> under investigation; it exhibits potent in vitro activity against S. aureus by interfering with DNA replication. To facilitate the preclinical and clinical development of this agent, we evaluated the in vitro pharmacodynamics of AZD 5206...|$|E
40|$|Topoisomerase inhibitors {{comprise}} {{an important}} group of agents {{that is used}} in cancer treatment. Because the development of resistance to can-cer chemotherapeutic agents repre-sents a major limitation of can-cer chemotherapy, we investigated the mechanism of resistance by murine P 388 leukemia to camptothecin (topo-isomerase I inhibitor) or amsacrine (topoisomerase II inhibitor). The resis-tant cells contained reduced levels of topoisomerase activity and messenger RNA. The topoisomerase gene of these cells was rearranged (only in one al-lele) and hypermethylated. These topo-isomerase gene alterations probably re-sulted in reduced transcription and, thus, enzyme production, which was correlated with resistance to the <b>topo-isomerase</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> [J Natl Cancer Inst 81 : 1732 - 1735, 1989] Interest in eukaryotic topoisomerase I and II was heightened when {{it was discovered that}} these enzymes were the targets of a number of anticancer drugs (7, 2). A major limitation of can-cer chemotherapy is the development of resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug. Drug resistance may be due to de-creased uptake, efficient drug removal (mediated by P-glycoprotein), drug detoxification, e. g., by increased levels of cellular glutathione, enhanced DNA repair in the case of DNA-damaging drugs, gene amplification and sub-sequent overexpression of the target molecule, or alteration in drug target specificity (3 - 5). Resistance to topo-isomerase inhibitors was correlated with an altered topoisomerase activ-ity (6 - 8). We found that resistance to topoisomerase I or II inhibitors by murine leukemia drug-resistant cell lines was correlated with a reduced level of topoisomerase that resulted from the rearrangement of one of the alleles of the topoisomerase gene. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism of drug resistance...|$|E
40|$|Missense {{mutations}} in ATM kinase, a master regulator of DNA damage responses, {{are found in}} many cancers, but their impact on ATM function and implications for cancer therapy are largely unknown. Here we report that 72 % of cancer-associated ATM mutations are missense mutations that are enriched around the kinase domain. Expression of kinase-dead ATM (Atm(KD/-)) is more oncogenic than loss of ATM (Atm(-/-)) in mouse models, leading to earlier and more frequent lymphomas with Pten deletions. Kinase-dead ATM protein (Atm-KD), but not loss of ATM (Atm-null), prevents replication-dependent removal of Topo-isomerase I-DNA adducts at the step of strand cleavage, leading to severe genomic instability and hypersensitivity to <b>Topo-isomerase</b> I <b>inhibitors.</b> Correspondingly, <b>Topo-isomerase</b> I <b>inhibitors</b> effectively and preferentially eliminate Atm(KD/-), but not Atm-proficientor Atm(-/-) leukemia in animal models. These findings identify ATM kinase-domain missense mutations as a potent oncogenic event and a biomarker for <b>Topo-isomerase</b> I <b>inhibitor</b> based therapy...|$|R
40|$|Chk 1 {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of the S and G 2 /M checkpoints and {{is activated}} following DNA damage by agents such as the <b>topo-isomerase</b> I <b>inhibitor</b> camptothecin (CPT). It has been proposed that Chk 1 inhibitors used in combination with such a DNA damaging agent to treat tumors would potentiate cytotoxicity and increase the therapeutic index, particularly in tumors lack-ing functional p 53. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether gene expression analysis could be used to inform lead optimization of a novel series of Chk 1 inhibitors. The candidate small-molecule Chk 1 inhibitors were used in combination with CPT to identify potential markers of functional Chk 1 inhibition, as well as resulting cell cycle progression, using cDNA-based microarrays. Differential expression of several of these putative marker genes was further validated by RT-PCR for use as a medium-throughput assay. In the presence of DNA damage, Chk 1 inhibitors altered CPT-dependent effects on the expression of cell cycle and DNA repair genes in a manner consistent with a Chk 1 -specific mechanism of action. Furthermore, differential expression of selected marker genes, cyclin E 2, EGR 1, and DDIT 3, was dose dependent for Chk 1 inhibition. RT-PCR results for these genes following treatment with a panel of Chk 1 inhibitors showed a strong correlation between marker gene response and the ability of each compound to abrogate cell cycle arrest in situ following CPT-induced DNA damage. These results demonstrate the utility of global expression analysis to identify surrogate markers, providing an alternative method for rapid compound characterization to support advancement decisions in early drug discovery.
