40|$|What the Middle Neolithic Alvastra pile {{dwelling}} in Östergötland, Sweden, {{was used}} for has been discussed since the site was discovered in early 20 th century. <b>The</b> <b>interpretation</b> by Mats Malmer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pile dwelling as a ceremonial settlement is until today the most widely accepted.

5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{has been}} used by {{scientists}} in <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene (66 to 55mya) and might have evolved from early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil primates such as Djebelemur, 'Anchomomys' milleri, and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record prior to 40mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa.|$|E

5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther.

He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the idea, but ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E

5|$|In archaeology, {{the study}} of {{mortuary}} context, that is, <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> postmortem treatment of the dead, whether an individual or as pertains to patterns within a group, {{has led to the}} development of hypotheses on social status and/or hierarchy regarding many cultures, ancient and extant. In addition, the determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred prior to death has a bearing on analyses of the mother's population, as the concentration of trace elements differ markedly between the skeletons of prepartum adult women (before giving birth) and women who are lactating; the identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of the number of lactating women in a population or the rate of maternal mortality. It is therefore necessary for investigators to be able to recognize postmortem fetal extrusion when encountered in an excavated burial.|$|E
