5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E

5|$|Dalhousie is a {{publicly}} funded research university, {{and a member}} of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, as well as the U15, a group of Canadian research-intensive universities. , there were 18,220 students enrolled at the university and 3,700 courses in over 190 degree programs. Dalhousie offers more than 3,700 courses and 190 degree programs in twelve undergraduate, graduate, and professional faculties. <b>The</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> admission differ between students from Nova Scotia, students from other provinces in Canada, and international students due to lack of uniformity in marking schemes. <b>The</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> admission also differ depending on the program. In 2011, the secondary school average for incoming first-year undergraduate students was 85 percent.|$|E

With phosphorus, however, maximal growth was reached at lower levels than those required for maximal alkaloid production. Sulfur was required in smaller amounts for peak alkaloid production than for maximal growth. In the case of iron and zinc, <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> maximal alkaloid production was greater than for growth.

However, in its 1966 Defence White Paper, the Government decided {{to cancel the}} two new carriers, which led to reductions in the total order for the Royal Navy's Phantoms. Initially 143 were ordered, which was cut to 110, and finally just 50, with options for another seven. The intention was to form a pair of front-line squadrons, each of twelve aircraft, that would operate from the two remaining, heavily modernised fleet carriers. The rest of the aircraft would be a reserve and for training.|$|E
5|$|Dana discovers Em {{was killed}} by Lester Majak, an aging local celebrity. Majak was a {{physical}} trainer who was convinced his fitness regime would extend his life. When he began to notice his growing frailty, he researched a legend of immortality from India. A particular creek near Wausau met <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> the legend, and Majak murdered Em near it in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an imbalance that resulted in Revival Day. The imbalance is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten all life on Earth. To restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul and permanently dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with their souls as well.|$|E
