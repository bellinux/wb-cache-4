25|$|The fewer {{the number}} of combat-experienced {{divisions}} the British had left {{at the end of}} the war, the smaller Britain’s influence in Europe was likely to be, compared to the emerging superpowers of the USA and the USSR.

25|$|However, ATU's {{greatest}} {{success to}} date, where it {{emerged as a}} serious opponent to the Gazette, was at the North West Regional Branch Conference, held on 2006-01-21.

25|$|Judicial Commissioner Menon also {{disagreed}} with the submission by counsel for the Law Society that to base the decision of bias solely on this cross-examination was taking too narrow {{a view of the}} case. He pointed out that the cross-examination had played a large part in Shankar's hearing, and had been relied on by the Disciplinary Committee to determine which set of evidence it chose to believe. Thus, such a focus on the cross-examination was necessary and crucial to the case. He further held that in any case, once a court had found that a reasonable suspicion of bias might arise, it could not be argued that there was no danger of harm because the matter that aroused the suspicion could be isolated. The principle that justice had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be done would still apply.|$|E

25|$|The case of R. v. Sussex Justices, {{ex parte}} McCarthy (1923) {{provides}} {{an illustration of}} the differences. In that case, the person who acted as clerk to certain magistrates {{was a member of}} a law firm that represented a party with an interest in the outcome of a matter being decided by the magistrates. When the magistrates withdrew to consider the matter, the clerk went with them in case they needed advice on any legal issues. However, the magistrates reached a decision without consulting the clerk. Thus, on the facts of the case, there was no possibility of actual bias whatsoever. Yet the decision in question was set aside because justice had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be done. Judicial Commissioner Menon highlighted that the underlying principle protected the appearance of justice being done, and reasoned that it would not be relevant under such a principle to consider whether justice was actually done. Nor did he think that Gough could be reconciled with ex parte McCarthy, despite the attempt in Gough attempt to confine the latter case to its own facts. In his view, the two tests were therefore different in substance, in addition to the different perspective that each test adopted. Furthermore, those differences were sometimes material in deciding a case; for example, the choice of the real likelihood test was a deciding factor of the result in Gough.|$|E
25|$|In Indian philosophy, Maharishi Kanada was {{the first}} to {{systematically}} develop a theory of atomism around 200 BCE though some authors have allotted him an earlier era in the 6th century BCE. It was further elaborated by the Buddhist atomists Dharmakirti and Dignāga during the 1st millennium CE. Pakudha Kaccayana, a 6th-century BCE Indian philosopher and contemporary of Gautama Buddha, had also propounded ideas about the atomic constitution of the material world. These philosophers believed that other elements (except ether) were physically palpable and hence comprised minuscule particles of matter. The last minuscule particle of matter that could not be subdivided further was termed Parmanu. These philosophers considered the atom to be indestructible and hence eternal. The Buddhists thought atoms to be minute objects unable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> the naked eye that come into being and vanish in an instant. The Vaisheshika school of philosophers believed that an atom was a mere point in space. It was also first to depict relations between motion and force applied. Indian theories about the atom are greatly abstract and enmeshed in philosophy as they were based on logic and not on personal experience or experimentation. In Indian astronomy, Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya (499 CE) proposed the Earth's rotation, while Nilakantha Somayaji (1444–1544) of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics proposed a semi-heliocentric model resembling the Tychonic system.|$|E

5000|$|By {{repeatedly}} chanting the Avalokiteshvara sutra (Kanzeon Bosatsu Fumonbon) (chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra), for example, one instills the Bodhisattva's ideals into one's mind. The {{ultimate goal}} is given {{in the end of}} the sutra, which states, [...] "In the morning, be one with Avalokiteshvara; in the evening, be one with Avalokiteshvara". Through the realization of emptiness and the Mahayana notion that all things have Buddha-nature, one understands that there is no difference between the cosmic bodhisattva and oneself.
