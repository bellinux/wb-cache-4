Rewards differed depending on the mission - from cash, gems to esoteric hardware such as a cloaking device.|$|E

In later life he suffered from gout, a common complaint among middle-class males in the Victorian period. Morris's ethos was that one should [...] "have nothing in your houses <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful."

500|$|Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art, {{described}} by Pabon as [...] "a form of self defense {{disguised as a}} dance." [...] Its influence on breaking is disputed and debated; one side believes that breaking came from capoeira, while the other side denies this. Capoeira is hundreds of years older than breaking, and uprock is similar in purpose to capoeira in that both translate aggressive combat movements into stylized dance. Both breaking and capoeira are performed to music and, since both art forms are acrobatic, some moves look similar to each other. However, capoeira is more rule-oriented. One rule in capoeira is that a capoeirista's back can never touch the ground. In contrast, a breaker's back is almost always on the ground, and the only rule in breaking is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> touch your opponent during a battle.|$|E

Production and additional writing on the songs were done by Greg Wells, who previously worked with the singer on her second studio album, One of the Boys (2008). Perry considers it {{to be like that}} of a two-part song because she had started working on [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] before she met Brand, and completed it after they began dating. She stated it is a [...] "really special" [...] song to her because, at {{the first part of the}} track, it is a story that she needed to let out, which was claiming to know something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> actually know. Perry later expressed relief at being able to put all of her feelings into [...] "Not Like the Movies".|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{initially}} {{created the}} game Confusion in the 1970s, {{and had it}} in finished form by 1980. The game was published in Germany by Franjos in 1992; Abbott was not satisfied with this version, however, due to several flaws in it. The rules {{were published in the}} Spanish translation of his book Abbott's New Card Games in 2008, but the game did not get published in North America until 2011. This Stronghold Games version was named [...] "Best New Abstract Strategy Game" [...] for 2012 by GAMES Magazine. The game is based on the idea of not knowing what your pieces are or what they do {{at the beginning of the}} game. His game Eleusis uses a similar idea, in <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know how cards are to be played at the beginning; George Brancaccio, someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York, commented on this, saying [...] "In your game Eleusis, you don't know what cards can be played. Why don't you make a board game where you don't know how pieces move?" [...] This is what gave Abbott the idea, and he began work on it soon after.|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 1816, {{at the age}} {{of seven}} years, Mendelssohn was baptised with his brother and sisters in a home {{ceremony}} by Johann Jakob Stegemann, minister of the Evangelical congregation of Berlin's Jerusalem Church and New Church. Although Mendelssohn was a conforming Christian {{as a member of the}} Reformed Church, he was both conscious and proud of his Jewish ancestry and notably of his connection with his grandfather Moses Mendelssohn. He was the prime mover in proposing to the publisher Heinrich Brockhaus a complete edition of Moses's works, which continued with the support of his uncle Joseph Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn was notably reluctant, either in his letters or conversation, to comment on his innermost beliefs; his friend Devrient wrote that [...] " [...] deep convictions were never uttered in intercourse with the world; only in rare and intimate moments did they ever appear, and then only in the slightest and most humorous allusions". Thus for example in a letter to his sister Rebecka, Mendelssohn rebukes her complaint about an unpleasant relative: [...] "What do you mean by saying you are not hostile to Jews? I hope this was a joke It is really sweet of you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> despise your family, isn't it?" [...] Some modern scholars have devoted considerable energy to demonstrate either that Mendelssohn was deeply sympathetic to his ancestors' Jewish beliefs, or that he was hostile to this and sincere in his Christian beliefs.|$|E

2500|$|According to Laughlin (2005), {{for many}} {{particle}} systems, {{nothing can be}} calculated exactly from the microscopic equations, and macroscopic systems are characterised by broken symmetry: the symmetry present in the microscopic equations is not present in the macroscopic system, due to phase transitions. As a result, these macroscopic systems are described in their own terminology, and have properties that do not depend on many microscopic details. This {{does not mean that}} the microscopic interactions are irrelevant, but simply <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> see them anymore— you only see a renormalized effect of them. Laughlin is a pragmatic theoretical physicist: if you cannot, possibly ever, calculate the broken symmetry macroscopic properties from the microscopic equations, then what is the point of talking about reducibility? ...|$|E
