5|$|In December 2016, a homebrew remake was {{released}} that, {{for the most}} part, kept the original game the same. However, the mechanic of E.T. falling into the pit was amended so that a keypress was required before the player fell into the pit. <b>The</b> <b>holes</b> were also visually removed and were discovered with an indicator at the bottom left of the screen.|$|E
5|$|Photonic {{crystals}} can {{be formed}} in different ways. In Parides sesostris, the emerald-patched cattleheart butterfly, photonic crystals are formed of arrays of nano-sized {{holes in the}} chitin of the wing scales. <b>The</b> <b>holes</b> have a diameter of about 150 nanometres and {{are about the same}} distance apart. <b>The</b> <b>holes</b> are arranged regularly in small patches; neighbouring patches contain arrays with differing orientations. The result is that these emerald-patched cattleheart scales reflect green light evenly at different angles instead of being iridescent. In Lamprocyphus augustus, a weevil from Brazil, the chitin exoskeleton is covered in iridescent green oval scales. These contain diamond-based crystal lattices oriented in all directions to give a brilliant green coloration that hardly varies with angle. The scales are effectively divided into pixels about a micrometre wide. Each such pixel is a single crystal and reflects light in a direction different from its neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> {{in the top of the}} stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> are probably too deep for that to have been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E

50|$|In rock drilling, <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> {{is usually}} not made through a {{circular}} cutting motion, though the bit is usually rotated. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> is usually made by hammering a drill bit into <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> with quickly repeated short movements.

5|$|In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to identify the priority targets from the year before. A chartered aircraft landed on the ice at three of the locations, a hole was drilled through the ice, and a small sector-scan sonar was used to image the sea bottom. Unfortunately, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, {{it was not possible}} to exactly confirm the locations of <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> and nothing was found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the locations that were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.|$|E
5|$|The cycle repeats at a {{frequency}} relative to {{how long it}} takes a wave to travel to the first open hole and back twice (i.e. four times the length of the pipe). For example: when all <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.|$|E

3000|$|As it is {{seen from}} the graphs, {{the effect of the}} {{screening}} of <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> is larger {{in the case of the}} smaller electron velocity 1 a.u. in Figure 3 a.

5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{stricken}} from the Navy List on 30 November and salvage work began on 5 December. <b>The</b> <b>holes</b> in the ship's hull {{had to be}} sealed to pump the water out and decrease her draft. The remains of her flight deck and upper hangar could not be made watertight and were removed using dynamite. Pontoons were used to right the ship and she was refloated on 31 July 1946. The salvage job was conducted by the Hitachi Zosen facility in Kure and they scrapped the ship afterward. The job was completed by 12 December 1947.|$|E

5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} forts, the {{garrison}} itself was heavily expanded {{during the initial}} construction years and became the largest garrison in Sweden, taking an exceptional position in Swedish military history of the 20th century; even {{at the start of}} the 21st century, Boden was the largest garrison city in the Swedish Army. Still, no other fortifications than the forts themselves were finished by 1908, and work now started to fill <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in between them. It was realised that prepared positions were needed for the mobile batteries, and apart from those, three larger battery positions (sometimes called fästen, strongholds) were also constructed at Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Svedjeberget. These works were started in 1911 and were finished during the First World War. The last of the three strongholds was positioned in the mountain itself with embrasures in the mountain side, and Leåkersberget had parts of the battery position inside the mountain, but the gun emplacements outsidethe other positions were concrete fortifications above the ground, some inside a bunker and others behind a parapet.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E

5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in the main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as {{there was no other}} suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for {{the race}} were overshadowed by {{speculation}} over IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard's job, after he tweeted that some team owners {{were trying to get}} him fired. Dixon claimed pole position {{for the race}}, the first IndyCar event in Detroit since 2008, and maintained his lead throughout the race. After 38 laps, James Hinchcliffe hit a dislodged piece of the track and continued straight into the tire wall. Further investigation discovered that the track was disintegrating in various places, and the event was red flagged. After a two-hour break, in which track officials ripped out the damaged sections of track and filled <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> with concrete, the race was restarted, shortened to 60 laps. Rain also started to fall lightly, and shortly after the restart a caution was issued when Hélio Castroneves spun. Dario Franchitti gained four places after the red flag, benefiting from his softer red tires, to finish second behind his teammate.|$|E
5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex decidua), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> giving them a donut appearance from above.|$|E

5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>holes</b> in the cuticle {{which allow}} for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose {{a challenge for}} the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E
