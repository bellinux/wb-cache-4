5|$|In 2006, Microsoft {{announced}} an episodic video game {{to be developed}} by film director Peter Jackson's Wingnut Interactive. The game, dubbed Halo: Chronicles, was confirmed to be in development in 2007, and by 2008 was still hiring for positions on the development team. Jackson told game blog Joystiq in July 2009 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> {{was no longer in}} development. Jackson's manager Ken Kamins explained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was cancelled as part of budget cuts tied to job layoffs in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|Public opinion seems “guardedly supportive, with a {{majority}} of residents saying they favor it”. A poll taken by a local newspaper among 500 Cologne residents showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> is supported by 63%, of whom 27% want its size to be reduced.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>projects</b> {{has been}} planned to goes as usual, with Luyang Assemblyman Hiew King Cheu calling the state {{government}} to start <b>the</b> <b>projects</b> without any further delays despite the concerns from conservationists as <b>the</b> <b>projects</b> could bring lots of job and economic opportunities to the locals, with environmental upgrade and rejuvenate more interest for people to visit and live in. Kota Kinabalu City Hall Mayor Yeo Boon Hai also hails <b>the</b> <b>projects</b> and brush aside critics prediction <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project's</b> will be failed due to {{the state government}}'s incompetence along with claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>projects</b> will bring a disaster to environment, which is also supported by Chief Minister Musa Aman.|$|R

5|$|Although {{multiple}} {{funding sources}} were originally {{considered by the}} NEDA to fund the airport's construction, it was decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> should avail of an official development assistance facility offered by the Japanese government through the then-newly formed Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). After almost two years of negotiations, and after initially refusing to bankroll the project, the JBIC extended a 6.2 billion peso (US$152million) loan to the Philippine government in August 2000.|$|E
5|$|An early plan {{conceived}} by British Rail {{in the early}} 1970s for a route passing through Tonbridge met considerable opposition on environmental and social grounds, especially from the Leigh Action Group and Surrey & Kent Action on Rail (SKAR). A committee {{was set up to}} examine the proposal under Sir Alexander Cairncross; but in due course environment minister Anthony Crosland announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> had been cancelled, together with the plan for the tunnel itself.|$|E
5|$|Crytek then {{pitched the}} game to {{different}} publishers, and eventually, in 2009, the company pitched the two projects to Microsoft. According to Nick Button-Brown, the general manager at Crytek, the game was not functional at that time, and only served {{to prove to the}} publisher that a first-person melee game was fun for players. The representative from Microsoft, Phil Spencer, admired Crytek's intention to expand, and thought that Microsoft's games line up for the Xbox 360 was lacking a first-person melee-combat game. As a result, they accepted to publish Kingdoms, and rejected Kings. The two companies agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> would be a natural fit for Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced Kinect.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{concerns}} {{raised by}} Crozier in 2006 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> would be halted {{after the first}} phase, which were dismissed at the time, no further work has actually been completed on the Essex Bypass since 2012, and the section between Essex and Ruthven remains a two lane highway. It is still considered as a future project by the MTO, with no time line set.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a {{multi-media}} project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{rejection}} of the script, Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel. After his assistant Susan Sackett showed him the manuscript of a novel that actor Walter Koenig had asked her to type, Roddenberry sought Koenig's collaboration on The God Thing. Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he handed it to Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, an {{animated}} television series called Lupin VIII was planned as a French-Japanese co-production, featuring {{the descendants of}} Lupin, Goemon, Jigen, and Zenigata, but was never completed. Created by DiC Animation, with Rintaro directing, and character designs by Shingo Araki; two scripts were written, and one episode was fully animated with a music and sound effects track, but the voice-overs were never recorded. It has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was stopped due to Leblanc's estate wanting {{a large amount of}} money for use of the Lupin name. The single episode was later included in the 2012 Lupin III Master File box set.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the {{government}} unveiled {{a proposal to}} redevelop the area surrounding the historic Albert Hall into a tourist and dining precinct. This included the building of an eight-storey building and the rezoning of some waterfront land currently designated as cultural to commercial. It was met with widespread hostility from heritage activists and the general community, which submitted more than 3,300 signatories in a petition against the scheme. One of the criticisms was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was tilted too heavily towards business, and neglected the arts and community events. The proposal was scrapped in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, it was {{announced}} that MacFarlane would be reviving The Flintstones for the Fox network, with the first episode airing in 2013. MacFarlane said that he would provide the voice of Barney Rubble. However, at the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2012, while promoting Ted, MacFarlane revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> had been shelved due to the unimpressed response garnered by Fox.|$|E

5|$|In November 2006, Woods {{announced}} {{his intention to}} begin designing golf courses around the world through a new company, Tiger Woods Design. A month later, he announced that the company's first course would be in Dubai {{as part of a}} 25.3 million-square-foot development, The Tiger Woods Dubai. The Al Ruwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009. As of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, The New York Times reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> had been shelved permanently. In 2013, the partnership between Tiger Woods Design and Dubai Holding was dissolved.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, The Guardian {{reported}} on concerns regarding {{funding for the}} Tablighi Jamaat's construction project. Documentation filed with the Charity Commission indicated that 's annual donations {{were in the order}} of only £500,000, suggesting the need for significant extra financial support to fund the building project. It was suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> would be funded by Saudi Salafi groups. This was based on Tablighi Jamaat's being a Deobandi Muslim organisation that has close links with the form of the religion practised by the Saudi royal family.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} this geopolitical perspective, Pablo {{argued that the}} only way the Trotskyists could avoid {{isolation}} was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term entryism in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties. This tactic was known as entrism sui generis, to distinguish it from the short-term entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} McClory again {{started working on}} a project to bring a Thunderball {{adaptation}} to production and, with the working title Warhead, he brought writer Len Deighton together with Sean Connery {{to work on a}} script. The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the Thunderball novel only, and once again the project was deferred.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} letter, Gruening also {{promoted}} {{the possibility of}} the dam creating a thriving tourism industry in Interior Alaska, a hypothesis that was raised by other dam supporters as well.
