40|$|When {{listening}} to music the gap between two songs, with different tempo, can be made less abrupt if the <b>tempo</b> <b>of</b> the songs are changed to be the same. How-ever, when the tempo is changed, so is the pitch. This is an unwanted property that is accounted for by using pitch scaling. To {{be able to change}} the tempo in a correct way, the tempos of the songs has to be known. The tempos are estimated using Beat Tracking. In this master thesis an algorithm that mixes music automatically is presented. The algorithm estimates the tempos of two songs, changes the <b>tempo</b> <b>of</b> the upcoming song to have the <b>tempo</b> <b>of</b> the song playing, and merges the songs so that their beats occur at the same time instants. The tempo is then changed stepwise to be the <b>tempo</b> <b>of</b> the upcoming song. On top of this the algorithm maintains the pitch of the songs while their tempos are changed.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to provide data on the cognitive interaction between the speed of motion perceived and the <b>tempo</b> <b>of</b> music heard simultaneously. Subjects choose the most suitable speed of motion displayed on the computer screen while they hear the music played at a level <b>of</b> <b>tempo.</b> We use two computer systems; one for the visual stimulus of motion and another for playing music using MIDI. We could precisely control both of the speed of motion and the <b>tempo</b> <b>of</b> music. We tested at the various levels <b>of</b> <b>tempo</b> <b>of</b> playing music and let subjects choose the appropriate speed of moving. We found that the strong positive correlation between the perceived motion speed and simultaneously heard music tempo. We concluded that we tend to recognize that the faster motion matches for the faster music...|$|R
