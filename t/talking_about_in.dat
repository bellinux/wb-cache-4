500|$|Veronica Mars was one {{of roughly}} five series being {{considered}} for cancellation by the network in 2007. At The CW's upfront conference, critic Michael Ausiello asked Ostroff {{about the fate of}} the show. She responded that Thomas and Bell could work together on another show for the network, but she thought that this possibility was unlikely. She said that [...] "it could come back in some form, but I don't know what form that would be". Thomas responded, [...] "I assume that anything Dawn would be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> the realm of a Rob–Kristen project would involve a new from-scratch pilot as they don't have me in a deal, and they'll lose Kristen in a couple of weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the film's US {{television}} debut, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times {{was critical}} of the film's objectives: [...] "he trouble with The Girl is that it tries to psychoanalyze Hitchcock but fails by trying to know the man too much. It's a movie about Hitchcock that ignores his best advice: 'Suspense is like a woman. The more left to the imagination, the more the excitement. Richard Brody of The New Yorker also gave the film a negative review, writing that, {{instead of being a}} drama, the film is an unoriginal work of criticism which [...] "points to what everyone ought already to have been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> the first place: not least, that it's no surprise to learn that a filmmaker whose art is devoted to pain, fear, control, and sexual obsession also experienced and inflicted them in life". On the day of its UK premiere, James Rampton of The Independent wrote that The Girl was [...] "no mere black-and-white hatchet job on Hitch. It does not seek to portray him as an unambiguous monster; rather, it highlights the profound psychological damage that plagued the director throughout his life". The Guardians Deborah Orr was generally positive about the film: [...] "here was only one thing wrong with The Girl. There was no Hitchcock in the director's chair to make it the utterly compelling psychological drama that it could have been." ...|$|E

From a pro-life view of the world: If abortion is murder then we have a million murders a year through abortion. And the few thousand homicides that will be prevented according to our analysis are just nothing—they are a pebble in the ocean relative to the tragedy that is abortion. So, my own view, when we [...] the study and it hasn't changed is that: our study shouldn't change anybody's opinion about whether abortion should be legal and easily available or not. It's really a study about crime, not abortion." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 22, 2014, in an {{interview}} with New York-radio station Hot 97, Schoolboy Q explained the [...] "oxymoron" [...] his album title refers to, [...] "The oxymoron in this album is that I'm doing all this bad to do good for my daughter. That's why I'm robbin'. That's why I'm stealin'.....Whatever it is that I'm <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> my album [...] negative, it's always for a good cause, for my daughter." [...] That is why he chose to feature his daughter Joy, on the standard edition of the album cover. That month, Schoolboy Q revealed to DJ Whoo Kid that Oxymoron being the representation of the bad things he does {{to take care of his}} daughter, who is pictured on the cover scowling, all the while depicting innocence.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{talks about}} the same things he's been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> all his writings, self-knowledge. He says, [...] "Everyone else would presumably {{understand}} that self-knowledge is a difficult matter; although {{it is easy to}} understand the rest of the world, the understanding suddenly changes very substantially when it pertains to oneself." [...] He speaks of choosing oneself in Either/Or, [...] "When a person considers himself esthetically his soul is like soil out of which grow all sorts of herbs, all with equal claim to flourish; his self consists of this multiplicity, and he has no self that is higher than this (...) Someone who views the personality ethically has at once an absolute difference: namely, the difference between good and evil. And if he finds more of evil in him than of good, this still does not mean that it is the evil that is to advance, but it means that it is the evil that is to recede and the good that is to advance. (...) It truly takes considerable ethical courage to acknowledge the good as the highest, because one thereby falls into altogether universal categories." ...|$|E

60|$|Missing {{the point}} is a very fine art; and has been carried to {{something}} like perfection by politicians and Pressmen to-day. For {{the point is}} generally a very sharp point; and is, moreover, sharp at both ends. That {{is to say that}} both parties would probably impale themselves in an uncomfortable manner if they did not manage to avoid it altogether. I have just been looking at the election address of the official Liberal candidate for the part of the country in which I live; and though it is, if anything, rather more logical and free from cant than most other documents of the sort it is an excellent example of missing the point. The candidate has to go boring on about Free Trade and Land Reform and Education; and nobody reading it could possibly imagine that in the town of Wycombe, where the poll will be declared, the capital of the Wycombe division of Bucks which the candidate is contesting, centre of the important and vital trade on which it has thriven, a savage struggle about justice has been raging for months past between the poor and rich, as real as the French Revolution. The man offering himself at Wycombe as representative of the Wycombe division simply says nothing about it at all. It is as if a man at the crisis of the French Terror had offered himself as a deputy for the town of Paris, and had said nothing about the Monarchy, nothing about the Republic, nothing about the massacres, nothing about the war; but had explained with great clearness his views on the suppression of the Jansenists, the literary style of Racine, the suitability of Turenae for the post of commander-in-chief, and the religious reflections of Madame de Maintenon. For, at their best, the candidate's topics are not topical. Home Rule is a very good thing, and modern education is a very bad thing; but neither of them are things that anybody is <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> High Wycombe. This is the first and simplest way of missing the point: deliberately to avoid and ignore it.|$|E
6000|$|The {{evidence}} {{of this is to}} be found also in his pictures, for I ought already to have mentioned that, for these many years (they are beginning to be many), he has indulged in the luxury of color. It is not probable that he regards himself in the first place as an illustrator, in the sense to which the term is usually restricted. He is a very vigorous and various painter, and at the Salon a constant and conspicuous exhibitor. He is fond of experiments, difficulties and dangers, and I divine that it would be his preference to be known best by his painting, in which he handles landscape with equal veracity. It is a pity that the critic is unable to contend with him on such a point without appearing to underestimate that work. Mr. Reinhart has so much to show for his preference that I am conscious of its taking some assurance to say that I am not sure he is right. This would be the case even if he had nothing else to show than the admirable picture entitled [...] "Washed Ashore" [...] ("Un Epave [...] ") which made such an impression in the Salon of 1887. It represents the dead body of an unknown man whom the tide has cast up, lying on his back, feet forward, disfigured, dishonored by the sea. A small group of villagers are collected near it, divided by the desire to look and the fear to see. A gendarme, official and responsible, his uniform contrasting with the mortal disrepair of the victim, takes down in his note-book the procès-verbal of the incident, and an old sailor, pointing away with a stiffened arm, gives him the benefit of what he knows about the matter. Plain, pitying, fish-wives, hushed, with their shawls in their mouths, hang back, as if from a combination too solemn--the mixture of death and the law. Three or four men seem to be glad it isn't they. The thing is a masterpiece of direct representation, and has wonderfully the air of something seen, found without being looked for. Excellently composed but not artificial, deeply touching but not sentimental, large, close and sober, this important work gives the full measure of Mr. Reinhart's great talent and constitutes a kind of pledge. It may be perverse on my part to see in it the big banknote, as it were, which may be changed into a multitude of gold and silver pieces. I cannot, however, help doing so. [...] "Washed Ashore" [...] is painted as only a painter paints, but I irreverently translate it into its equivalent in [...] "illustrations"--half a hundred little examples, in black and white, of the same sort of observation. For this observation, immediate, familiar, sympathetic, human, and not involving a quest of style for which color is really indispensable, is a mistress at whose service there is no derogation in placing one's self. To do little things instead of big may be a derogation; a great deal will depend upon the way the little things are done. Besides, no work of art is absolutely little. I grow bold and even impertinent as I think of the way Mr. Rein-hart might scatter the smaller coin. At any rate, whatever proportion his work in this line may bear to the rest, it is to be hoped that nothing will prevent him from turning out more and more to play the rare faculty that produces it. His studies of American moeurs in association with Mr. Warner went so far on the right road that we would fain see him make {{all the rest of the}} journey. They made us ask straightway for more, and were full of intimations of what was behind. They showed what there is to see--what there is to guess. Let him carry the same inquiry further, let him carry it all the way. It would be serious work and would abound in reality; it would help us, as it were, to know what we are <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>In</b> saying this I feel how much I confirm the great claims I just made for the revival of illustration.|$|E
