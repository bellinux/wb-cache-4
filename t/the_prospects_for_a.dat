5|$|Following Operation Tungsten, British {{intelligence}} assessed that Tirpitz {{would be}} repaired within six months. Accordingly, Cunningham directed Fraser on 13 April to launch another {{attack on the}} battleship. While Cunningham {{did not believe that}} Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, he hoped that further air strikes would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. Fraser initially resisted Cunningham's order, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> successful raid were poor as the Germans would have reinforced the defences around Tirpitz and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. He eventually relented, and Moore sailed from Scapa Flow on 21 April to attack Kaafjord again. This raid, designated Operation Planet, was called off on 24 April due to bad weather over the target area. Two other attacks, Operation Brawn and Operation Tiger Claw, also had to be cancelled on 15 and 28 May respectively because of adverse weather. Further carrier raids were attempted in July and August after Allied intelligence determined that the repairs to Tirpitz were nearing completion. During Operation Mascot a force of 42 Barracudas and 40 fighters attacked Tirpitz on 17 July, but did not score any hits as the battleship was hidden by a smokescreen. A further four carrier raids were conducted against Kaafjord between 22 and 29 August during Operation Goodwood, but these caused only light damage to the battleship.|$|E

25|$|Having {{become aware}} that the British Army was not longer likely to order the Ultra-light, Fairey instead {{promoted}} the type for its potential use within the Royal Navy. While some trials were conducts, including one prototype being successfully tested for suitability on board an aircraft carrier, the Navy appeared to lack enthusiasm for the Ultra-light and {{it became clear that}} the Ministry would not be providing any further funding for its development. Recognising that <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> military order from the British services to have become very limited, the company decided to re-orientate the Ultra-light to conform with the preferences and needs of civil operators instead.|$|E

25|$|On 19 January 1944, the Gestapo arrested von Moltke’s {{husband for}} warning an {{acquaintance}} of that person’s impending arrest. She was allowed to visit him under benign conditions and found that he could continue to work and receive papers. On 20 July 1944 there was an attempt on Hitler's life, which the Gestapo used as a pretext to eliminate perceived opponents to the Nazi regime. In January 1945, Helmuth von Moltke was tried, convicted, and executed by a Gestapo “People's Court” for treason, having discussed with the Kreisau Circle group <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Germany based on moral and democratic principles that could develop after Hitler.|$|E
25|$|Following on {{from the}} Delta 1, the Ministry of Supply {{requested}} that Fairey conduct a further model programme {{for the purpose of}} transonic investigations. However, Fairey did not find this proposal attractive, believing that a piloted aircraft would be mandatory if the project was to produce any worthwhile data. Fairey commenced work on a highly swept twin-engine aircraft; however, the Ministry lacked enthusiasm for the twin-engine configuration, largely due to an existing rival project underway to produce a twin-engine supersonic aircraft - this would become the English Electric Lightning. In February 1949, it was suggested that Fairey examine <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single-engine transonic aircraft as an alternative; {{by the end of the}} year, the company had produced their new project, out of which the Fairey Delta 2 (FD2) would directly originate. Accordingly, the Ministry issued Air Ministry Specification ER.103 for the project, ordering that a pair of prototype aircraft be produced.|$|E
25|$|Thus when Sverre came to Norway {{he found}} <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{successful}} uprising to be small. Distraught, he travelled east {{and came to}} Östergötland in Sweden just before Christmas. There {{he met with the}} local ruler, Birger Brosa, who was married to Sigurd Munn’s sister, Brigit Haraldsdotter. Sverre revealed to Birger Brosa his claim to the throne, but Birger was at first unwilling to give any aid. He was already supporting another group, the Birkebeiners — the Birchlegs. This group had risen in 1174 under the leadership of Øystein Møyla who claimed to be the son of King Øystein Haraldsson. They had received the name Birkebeiners because their poverty led some of them to wind the bark of the birch about their legs, instead of wearing shoes. But in January 1177, the Birkebeiners met a crushing defeat at the Battle of Re and Øystein fell. Sverre met with the remnants in Värmland. After some initial doubts, Sverre let himself be persuaded to become the Birkebeiners’ next leader.|$|E

500|$|As the Republican presidential {{nomination}} race {{went into the}} primaries season, Romney had not endorsed anyone but {{was one of the}} Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman Donald Trump. Romney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes, saying there might be a [...] "bombshell" [...] in them. Trump responded by calling Romney [...] "one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics." [...] Then Romney gave a speech on March 3, 2016, at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, that represented a scathing attack on Trump's personal behavior, business performance, and domestic and foreign policy stances. He said Trump was [...] "a phony, a fraud ... He's playing members of the American public for suckers" [...] and that [...] "If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished." [...] In response Trump dismissed Romney as a [...] "choke artist". [...] Romney's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party's most recent presidential nominee against the party's current front-runner for the nomination. Romney encouraged Republicans to engage in tactical voting, by supporting whichever of the remaining rivals had the best chance to beat Trump in any given state, and as such Romney announced he was voting for, although not endorsing, Ted Cruz for president prior to the March 22 Utah caucus. [...] As the race went on, there was some evidence of tactical voting occurring, and some partial arrangements were formed among candidates, but by May 3 Trump had defeated all his opponents and became the party's presumptive nominee. [...] Romney then announced that he would not support Trump in the general election, saying, [...] "I am dismayed at where we are now, I wish we had better choices".|$|E

Pegram attended the Advisory Committee on Uranium meeting on April 27, along with Fermi, Szilard and Wigner where <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> chain reaction were discussed. On May 14, he was able to report that Szilard and Fermi had found that graphite indeed had a small neutron absorption cross section, and would make an effective moderator.

But after the Corps' survey was complete, Congress authorized the Secretary of War to expend $5,000 ($ in [...] dollars) on a bridge design competition. To help improve <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bridge, a [...] "National Memorial Bridge Association" [...] was formed. In July, four prominent bridge engineers from New York City — George S. Morrison, Leffert L. Buck, William H. Burr, and William R. Hutton — were invited to submit designs for a memorial bridge to honor American war dead. A five-member board appointed by the Secretary of War selected a design by William H. Burr and architect Edward P. Casey (designer of the Taft Bridge). Their design, based on the 1887 winning plan, called for a drawbridge made of steel and stone with 36 arches. A [...] "classical" [...] tower sat over {{each end of the}} draw span, on top of which would stand bronze statues of Victory. Statues of famous generals and statesmen (in either bronze or granite) would line both sides of the bridge.|$|E
