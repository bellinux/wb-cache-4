This thesis tests {{the hypothesis that}} mainstream parties have reacted {{to the rise of}} an anti-immigration party by taking up more restrictive immigration positions. Previous research on the impact of the rise of an anti-immigration party on immigration positioning is sparse, and centres mostly on the supply side of the political market using one-dimensional left-right explanations, which generally do not provide a satisfactory framework to explain party movement. This thesis is based on a spatial two-dimensional model of political competition and combines analyses of the demand and the supply side of the political market. Focusing on the cases of the Netherlands, Flanders and the UK in the time-period 1987 - 2010 it shows that parties ultimately respond to electoral pressure when choosing their immigration strategy. The thesis has three main findings. Firstly, voters perceive their parties to have too liberal immigration preferences, causing a persistent anti-immigrant gap to exist. In combination with high divisiveness of the immigration issue for mainstream party constituencies the antiimmigrant gap provides opportunities for an anti-immigration party <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>strongly</b> in multi-party systems. Secondly, the electoral market on immigration is characterised by conflicting incentives, which makes successfully reacting to an anti-immigration party very difficult, especially for traditional mainstream parties. Thirdly, patterns of political competition on the immigration dimension reflect these conflicting incentives. On the one hand, the high divisiveness of the issue at party level urges mainstream parties of left, centre and right equally to depoliticise. Accordingly, parties tend to compete with relatively liberal immigration positions {{in the absence of a}} credible threat by an anti-immigration party. On the other hand, a correlation between the left-right and the immigration dimension on the demand side of the political market at party system level creates a pull towards restrictionism, which is stronger for parties on the right. Once an anti-immigration party presents a credible threat parties indeed react by moving their immigration position closer to that of the anti-immigration party following a left-right logic, sometimes dramatically so. The party system strongly impacts the dynamics of indirect impact: in the UK mainstream parties never lose the initiative on immigration to an anti-immigration party...|$|E

40|$|In 1964 Melvin Webber {{challenged}} {{the notions of}} community and centrality used in urban studies by demonstrating that "community without propinquity" was emerging within certain social networks. He argued that individuals were enmeshed in an overlapping range of groups, and that increasingly these social networks were not limited by physical or geographical location. His definition of community acknowledges a differentiated range of "non-place" cultures. It reflects a change to a process, rather than product oriented view of urban form, triggered {{in part by the}} influence of general systems theory. Webber influenced and was influenced by the emergence of an orientation towards non-physical aspects of community, and a participatory approach <b>to</b> design which <b>emerged</b> <b>strongly</b> during the seventies. Reexamination of Webber's work in the light of current information technology offers some insight into the nature of the globalisation of the world economy, and consequent impacts on nationality and sovereignty. The technologies that will be commonplace {{by the end of the}} century can both empower and disempower and it will be necessary to reconsider our current notions of both citizenship and of access to and control of such crucial resources. Opportunities offered by IT for marginalised or peripheral groups, whether at the level of nation, region or local community, will challenge existing definitions of centre and periphery. The moral panics surrounding such activities as "hacking" and its supporting "cyberpunk" sub culture demonstrate a growing awareness of the importance of emerging non-space communities...|$|R
40|$|We use the {{observational}} Hubble parameter data (OHD), both the latest observational dataset (Stern et al. 2010, {{referred to as}} SJVKS) and the simulated datasets, to constrain Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) void models. The necessity of the consistency check on OHD itself in the LTB cosmology is stressed. Three voids are chosen as test models and are constrained using the Union 2 dataset of SN Ia as well as OHD. Despite their different parametrization, the results from our test models show some indicating similarities, e. g., the best-fit voids obtained from OHD are all considerably broader than those from SN Ia. Due to {{the small size of}} the SJVKS dataset, the constraints are not conclusive. The constraining power of the future OHD observations are therefore investigated, through a Figure of Merit (FoM) analysis based on the Monte Carlo simulated data. We found that, in the case that the future OHD become more consistent with SN Ia, the results from the test models are almost unanimous: 1) as many as 32 OHD data points at the SJVKS-like uncertainty level are needed to give a higher FoM than the Union 2 dataset of SN Ia; 2) precise observation helps reduce this required number; 3) increasing the survey depth does not always increase the FoM. On the other hand, if the future OHD and the Union 2 dataset keep favor different voids, in a similar manner as they do at present, the 1 σ confidence regions obtained from the two probes should finally separate. We test this conjecture and found that, the minimum observational requirement (the size of the dataset, the uncertainty level and the survey depth) for this inconsistency <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> depends <b>strongly</b> on the void model.

This situation has substantially been improved {{in the novel}} relaxor ferroelectric single-phase (BiFe 0. 9 Co 0. 1 O 3) 0. 4 -(Bi 1 / 2 K 1 / 2 TiO 3) 0. 6, where polar nanoregions (PNR) transform into static-PNR (SPNR) as evidenced by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and simultaneously enable congruent multiferroic clusters (MFC) <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> from inherent <b>strongly</b> magnetic Bi(Fe,Co) O 3 rich regions as verified by magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).

On these MFC, exceptionally large direct and converse magnetoelectric coupling coefficients, α ≈ 1. 0 x 10 - 5 s/m at room-temperature, were measured by PFM and MFM respectively. We expect the non-ergodic relaxor properties which are governed by the Bi 1 / 2 K 1 / 2 TiO 3 component to {{play a vital role}} in the strong ME coupling, by providing an electrically and mechanically flexible environment to MFC. This new class of non-ergodic relaxor multiferroics bears great potential for applications. Especially the prospect of a ME nanodot storage device seems appealing...|$|R

40|$|The Reynolds–Anmatjira Ranges, central Australia, {{form part}} of a {{high-grade}} basement terrane dissected by intensely metasomatized transpressional shear zones active during the Ordovician–Carboniferous Alice Springs Orogeny. Unlike typical retrograde structures associated with discrete fluid flow, the mid-crustal setting and intracontinental nature of these shear systems present significant problems for the source and ingress mechanism of the fluid involved in their rehydration. To address these issues, we describe two detailed traverses across deformed and metasomatized basement rocks in this region, and interrogate their record of fluid–rock interaction from various perspectives. Both traverses combine structural and petrological observations with Zr-in-rutile and Ti-in-quartz thermobarometry, oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope analysis, and major, trace and rare earth element mobility trends. Each technique is critically evaluated for its utility {{in this study and}} its more widespread applicability to alternative field areas, providing a strategic framework for the general investigation of fluid-affected shear zones. Ultimately, the integrated data sets specify pressure–temperature conditions of ∼ 530 °C and 4 – 5 kbar, implying average apparent thermal gradients of 29 – 36 °C km− 1 and depths of 14 – 18 km. Other characteristic features <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> include <b>strongly</b> variable element mobilities and pronounced isotopic depletion fronts consistent with the alteration effects of an externally derived, non-equilibrium fluid. This is confirmed by calculated fluid compositions indicative of contributions from a fluid of meteoric origin, with estimated δ 18 O and δD values as low as 2. 3 ‰ and − 59. 8 ‰, respectively. We propose that these surficial fluid signatures are imposed on the mid-crust by the prograde burial and dehydration of hydrothermally altered fault panels produced during pre-orogenic basin formation. Progressive fluid release with continued subsidence then leads to the accumulation of increasing fluid volumes {{in the vicinity of the}} brittle–ductile transition, promoting extensive hydration, metasomatism and reaction softening at the locus of stress transmission from plate-boundary sources. The sustained injection of externally derived fluids into refractory crustal material may thus stimulate a critical reduction in the long-term strength of the lithosphere, providing strong impetus for the initiation and advancement of intracontinental orogenesis.

40|$|We analyse a {{sequence}} of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of a sunspot taken at the 1 -m SST, to determine the nature of flux emergence in a light bridge and the processes related to its evolution in the photosphere and chromosphere. Blueshifts of about 2 km/s are seen near the entrance of a granular light bridge on the limbward side of the spot. They lie next to a strongly redshifted patch that appeared 6 mins earlier. Both patches are seen for 25 mins {{until the end of}} the sequence. The blueshifts coincide with an elongated emerging granule, while the redshifts appear at the end of it. In the photosphere, the development of the blueshifts is accompanied by a simultaneous increase in field strength and inclination, with the field becoming nearly horizontal. In the redshifted patch, the magnetic field is equally horizontal but of opposite polarity. An intense brightening is seen in the Ca filtergrams over these features, 17 mins after they emerge in the photosphere. The brightening is due to emission in the blue wing of the Ca line, close to its knee. Non-LTE inversions reveal that the asymmetric emission is caused by a temperature enhancement of about 700 K between - 5. 0 <log tau<- 3. 0 and a blueshift of 3 km/s at log tau=- 2. 3. The photospheric blueshifts and redshifts seem to be caused by the emergence of a small-scale, flat Omega-loop with highly inclined footpoints of opposite polarity. The gas motions detected in the two footpoints are reminiscent of a siphon flow. The rising loop is probably confined to the lower atmosphere by the overlying sunspot magnetic field and the subsequent interaction may be responsible for temperature enhancements in the upper photosphere/lower chromosphere. This is the first time that magnetic flux is observed <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> in the <b>strongly</b> magnetised environment of sunspots, pushed upward by the convective flows of a granular light bridge.
