5|$|Although the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 were {{supposed}} {{to end the war}} in Vietnam, fighting continued between South Vietnam and North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. Despite a pledge of support from U.S. President Richard Nixon, military aid to South Vietnam was sharply reduced. By the end of 1972 the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was the fourth largest air force in the world, with 2,075 aircraft and over 61,000 personnel. However, Republic of Vietnam Air Force operations were severely affected by cutbacks in military aid, flying hours had to be reduced by 51% and bomb loads on fighter aircraft halved from four to <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> ordnance.|$|E

5|$|Kapena married Kahilipulu on September 2, 1846, in Honolulu, Oʻahu. Kapena {{was also}} {{married to a}} sister of Joshua Kekaulahao. She died before 1858. Kapena led the {{procession}} at the funeral of all six of her family members including her two brothers, nephew, cousin and father. It is not known if these <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> information refer to the same person. Nothing beyond that is known about Kapena's marital status. In the Hawaiian tradition of hānai (a form of informal adoption), he adopted his nephew John Makini Kapena (1843–1887), the only son of Makini and Naʻawa, a relative of King Kalākaua. John Kapena {{went on to become}} an important government minister under the reign of Kalākaua in the 1870s. The younger Kapena also married Emma Aʻalailoa Malo (1846–1886), the only daughter of David Malo, the elder Kapena's Lahainaluna classmate.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E

5|$|The video shifts {{again to}} Björk {{buried in the}} sand under the rain of ashes. The <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> rock appear again, this time each one with a Björk-shaped strata. The strata also sing parts of the song, and two arms come out from the {{floating}} rocks and their hands barely brush against each other. The rocks unite once again as the chorus begins for the second time. During {{this part of the}} video, images of Björk singing in a smoky setting alternate with more rocks uniting to the main two, while their Björk-shaped strata secrete a substance similar to lava from their mouth. All the rocks are now united, forming a big volcano, whose crater is shaped like two opposite Björk-shaped rocks. The volcano finally erupts in an explosion of magma, while a thunderstorm occurs in the background. The video ends as the volcano fades out and all that remains visible is ash and smoke.|$|E
5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint, lap joint, corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.|$|E

5|$|Continuing their charge after McCausland's Brigade, the Union cavalry charged {{into the}} camp of the 16th Virginia Cavalry, which fled without resisting. Conger's 3rd West Virginia turned eastward and pursued rebels fleeing east {{down the road}} to Wardensville and Winchester. The 17th Virginia Cavalry was camped near some woods east of the main road, and had more time to prepare for the attack. They formed a battle line while three {{companies}} waited behind a fence. Initially, they repulsed Conger's men, forcing them to retreat. However, Conger was soon reinforced by Colonel Powell and the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, which was commanded by Colonel Henry Capehart. The two regiments charged the Virginians and drove them down the road or into the woods. During this time, Conger was killed by a lieutenant from the 17th Virginia. The Virginian was wearing a blue coat that fooled Conger into thinking he was from Conger's regiment. The two West Virginia regiments continued to pursue the Confederates down the road, and captured McCausland's <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> artillery. Eventually, some of the fleeing rebels ran into Major Work's 22nd Pennsylvania, and had to scatter to the woods. Work's men captured 34 of them.|$|E
5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E
5|$|François de Vergy, {{a member}} of the House of Vergy, had been {{informed}} of this attack by the townspeople, and he arrived in Besançon at dawn. He asked the soldiers if they were friendly, after which the insurgents responded with violence. After several exchanges of gunfire, the battle moved to the high street where the Protestants were armed with <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> artillery near the Battant. Two hours after the battle moved to the high street, de Vergy led a group of monks and priests to the battle, equipped with three cannons. The first two cannons did not fire, which caused doubt in the Catholic ranks, despite having over 300 men, many more than the Protestant forces. However, the third cannon fired, successfully causing panic among the Protestants. The Protestants continued their fight regardless, using cannons, firearms, and knives in an attempt to stop the Catholic forces and Claude de La Baume, their leader. The Protestant leader was severely injured and his horse was hit, causing disorder in the ranks of Huguenot troops, ultimately resulting in them attempting to retreat from the city.|$|E

5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{becoming}} a hurricane, Felix developed a well-defined eye as Hurricane Hunters began investigating the storm. Beginning at 1200UTC on August11, the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening, {{and by the}} next day, concentric eyewalls were observed, indicative of a strong storm. On August12, the Hurricane Hunters observed flight-level winds of , suggesting peak surface winds of 140mph (220km/h). At that time, Felix was located north of the Lesser Antilles, moving to the north-northwest due to an approaching trough weakening the ridge. After peak winds, Felix weakened due to stronger wind shear and its eyewall replacement cycle. The eye became indistinct and opened on August13, {{and it became a}} minimal hurricane by August14 with a broad inner core. Late on August14, Hurricane Felix turned more to the west-northwest, after the trough that previously brought it northward split into <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> energy, one moving southward and the other moving northeastward. On August15, the hurricane passed about 75mi (120km) south of Bermuda, and a building ridge was anticipated to allow Felix to continue its trajectory toward North Carolina.|$|E
