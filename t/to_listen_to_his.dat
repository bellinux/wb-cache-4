5|$|Shoup {{joined the}} Business Executives Move for Vietnam Peace. By 1971, Shoup {{publicly}} endorsed the anti-war veteran group Vietnam Veterans Against the War. As Vietnamization had reduced {{the visibility of}} the anti-war movement, and Shoup's criticism was not as prominent in the public arena. Fulbright and other senators urged the White House <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> criticisms, but Shoup's broader critique of American society and militarism was seen as more extreme than other officers who had simply criticized the strategy of the war.|$|E

Not realizing the devastating nature of the storms coming, London sets out to force Lexer <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> warnings by hacking the system and causing a cascading chain reaction that knocks {{out all of the}} power in Chicago.

Bronn defeats Lysa's champion Ser Vardis Egen by tiring the heavily armored knight and kicking him out the Moon Door, and Tyrion is allowed to walk free with Bronn as his escort, much to the dismay of the Tully sisters.|$|E
50|$|Bragg {{was born}} in the small city of Piedmont in northeastern Alabama and grew up in the small {{community}} of Possum Trot near Jacksonville. He credited <b>his</b> ability <b>to</b> write <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> family tell stories.

5|$|Michael Jackson, {{a former}} Motown star who by {{the start of}} {{development}} on The Wiz in 1977, had left Motown for Epic Records with his brothers The Jacksons, was cast as the Scarecrow. Jackson was dedicated to the role, and watched videotapes of gazelles, cheetahs, and panthers in order to learn graceful movements for his part. However Jackson's father Joseph Jackson didn't want him to land the role, as he was managing him at the time, but Jackson refused <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father and decided to be on the movie. Ted Ross and Mabel King were brought in to reprise their respective roles from the stage musical, while Nipsey Russell was cast as the Tin Man. Lena Horne, mother-in-law to Sidney Lumet during the time of production, was cast as Glinda the Good Witch, and comedian Richard Pryor portrayed The Wiz.|$|E
5|$|Tulsidas {{hints at}} several places in his works, {{that he had}} met {{face to face with}} Hanuman and Rama. The {{detailed}} account of his meetings with Hanuman and Rama are given in the Bhaktirasbodhini of Priyadas. According to Priyadas' account, Tulsidas used to visit the woods outside Varanasi for his morning ablutions with a water pot. On his return to the city, he used to offer the remaining water to a certain tree. This quenched the thirst of a Preta (a type of ghost believed to be ever thirsty for water), who appeared to Tulsidas and offered him a boon. Tulsidas said he wished to see Rama with his eyes, to which the Preta responded that it was beyond him. However, the Preta said that he could guide Tulsidas to Hanuman, who could grant the boon Tulsidas asked for. The Preta told Tulsidas that Hanuman comes everyday disguised in the mean attire of a leper <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Katha, he is the first to arrive and last to leave.|$|E

Brian becomes interested in Carolyn, and the two begin to date.

Brian realizes that Stewie is right and decides <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> advice. However, he finds out that Carolyn has begun to date Cleveland, since Brian did not want to have sex for the three weeks they have dated, and assumed he just wanted to be friends.

Apologizing for his botched attempt to help him out, Stewie suggests that he can convince Cleveland's ex-wife, Loretta, to reconcile with him.|$|E
5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E

25|$|Ivinskaya, of German-Polish descent, {{was born}} in Tambov to a provincial high school teacher. In 1915, {{the family moved to}} Moscow. After graduating from the Editorial Workers Institute in Moscow in 1936, she worked as an editor at various {{literary}} magazines. She was an admirer of Pasternak since her adolescence, attending literary gatherings <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> poetry. She married twice: the first time to Ivan Emelianov in 1936, who hanged himself in 1939, having one daughter, Irina Emelianova; the second time in 1941 to Alexander Vinogradov (later killed in the war), producing one son, Dmitry Vinogradov.|$|E
25|$|As the {{takeoff roll}} began, {{the first officer}} noted several times to the captain that the {{instrument}} panel readings he was seeing {{did not seem to}} reflect reality (he was referring {{to the fact that the}} plane did not appear to have developed as much power as it needed for takeoff, despite the instruments indicating otherwise). The captain dismissed these concerns and let the takeoff proceed. Investigators later determined that there was plenty of time and space on the runway for the captain to have aborted the takeoff, and criticized his refusal <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> first officer, who was correct that the instrument panel readings were wrong. The pilot was told not to delay because another aircraft was 2.5 miles out (4km) on final approach to the same runway. The following is a transcript of Flight 90's cockpit voice recorder during the plane's acceleration down the runway.|$|E
25|$|Ãgedei {{was also}} {{known to be}} a humble man, who did not believe himself to be a genius, and who was willing to listen to and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable. He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a dictator. Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to {{establish}} a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> generals and adapt to circumstances. He was an extremely pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.|$|E

25|$|Columbus made {{a fourth}} voyage, {{nominally}} {{in search of}} a westward passage to the Indian Ocean. Accompanied by his stepbrother Bartolomeo, Diego Mendez, and his son Fernando, he left CÃ¡diz, Spain on May 12, 1502, with his flagship, Capitana, as well as the Gallega, VizcaÃ­na, and Santiago de Palos. He sailed to Arzila on the Moroccan coast to rescue the Portuguese soldiers who he heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, 1502, they landed at Carbet on the island of Martinique (Martinica). A hurricane was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at Santo Domingo on June 29, 1502, but was denied port, and the new governor refused <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered {{at the mouth of the}} Jaina River, the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. The only ship to reach Spain had Columbus's money and belongings on it, and all of his former enemies (and a few friends) had drowned, including Francisco de Bobadilla, who'd had Columbus sent back to Spain in chains two years earlier.|$|E
25|$|William II, who {{was more}} popular than his father, was also more willing <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> advisors. When the Revolutions of 1848 raged {{throughout}} Europe, with nationalists and liberals revolting and sometimes killing noblemen and royals in the process, William II was genuinely concerned for his safety and to lose his powers. Overnight, he changed from a conservative to a liberal, and agreed to the far-reaching Constitutional Reform of 1848 on 11 October 1848. He accepted the introduction of full ministerial responsibility in the constitution, leading {{to a system of}} parliamentary democracy, with the House of Representatives directly elected by the voters within a system of single-winner electoral districts. Parliament was accorded the right to amend government law proposals and to hold investigative hearings. The States-Provincial, themselves elected by the voter, appointed by majorities for each province the members of the Senate from a select group of upper class citizens. A commission chaired by the liberal Thorbecke was appointed to draft the new proposed constitution, which was finished on 19 June. Suffrage was enlarged (though still limited to census suffrage), as was the bill of rights with the freedom of assembly, the privacy of correspondence, freedom of ecclesiastical organisation and the freedom of education.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{how fast}} the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the {{children}} all drive to the beach {{in order to get}} the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (because since nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who tell him how they're glad that the land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to get some of the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some time do they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, who suddenly decided <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father and come help the children kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).|$|E
