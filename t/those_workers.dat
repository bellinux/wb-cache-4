Until the 1990s, workers then came {{primarily from the}} Philippines; the percentage is now shifting from Philippine workers to Indonesian and other nationalities. During the 1990s Indonesia and Thailand followed the Filipino model of labour export to deal with domestic economic crises, and Hong Kong families began hiring workers from those countries as well. The Indonesians provided competition, since <b>those</b> <b>workers</b> were often prepared to accept half the minimum wage.|$|E
5|$|Among the ECSC's {{greatest}} achievements {{are those}} on welfare issues. Some mines, for example, were clearly unsustainable without government subsidies. Some miners had extremely poor housing. Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers {{to buy a}} home they could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of <b>those</b> <b>workers</b> who have lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal and steel sector by some of its members.|$|E

But detection of cases of excessive exposure of harmful agents on <b>those</b> <b>workers</b> who properly used and maintained approved respirators (with high efficiency filters), has prompted experts to change their opinions.

25|$|Speaking at Taipei Grand Mosque in December 2001 during Eid al-Fitr, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou {{thanked the}} Indonesian workers for their {{contribution}} to Taiwan and gave them festive greeting. The mayor was spotted wearing Jinnah cap while greeting the workers and spoke a bit of Indonesian language. He cited that 20,000 among 36,000 foreign workers in Taipei were Indonesians, which had contributed much to the construction and household assistance of Taipei City. He also said that if all of <b>those</b> <b>workers</b> took the same day off, one-quarter of the city would be paralyzed.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked about}} the working {{condition}} in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior {{by the standards of}} developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' standard of living, <b>those</b> <b>workers</b> would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over subsistence farming and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or starvation by unemployment.|$|E
25|$|D. maculata is {{characterized}} by low paternity, worker reproduction and queen-worker conflict. Divergent genetic interests between workers and their queen cause intra-nest struggle for control, which disrupts social organization. Because of haplodiploidy, workers are unable to mate. However, their unfertilized eggs become males. Workers and their queens are most related to their own sons. Natural selection will therefore favor <b>those</b> <b>workers</b> who produce their own sons rather than rearing the queen’s brood. In a sampling of seven D. maculata nests, 20.9% of males were produced by workers. The percentage of males who were worker’s sons did not correlate with the time during which nests were collected or colony size.|$|E

25|$|Three general {{forms of}} egg {{policing}} {{are found to}} conclusively contribute to reproduction ratios of D. norwegica. All three forms targeting worker-laid eggs over queen-laid eggs. Two forms that are probably most influential of policing are worker policing and selfish policing. Despite being more related to other workers’ sons, worker-laid eggs were consumed by other workers. Approximately two thirds of <b>those</b> <b>workers</b> were reproductive workers. Occasionally these workers replaced the egg with {{one of their own}} (in 31% of the cases were due to selfish policing). Workers never removed their own eggs and if a non-reproductive worker removed a worker-laid egg, then the queen would replace it with her own egg.|$|E
25|$|In August 2013, {{during the}} Muslims's grand festival Eid al-Fitr {{after the end}} of fasting month, the Taipei City Government opened two major venues in Taipei for people to gather and {{celebrate}} the festival, in which the majority of them are Indonesian blue-collar workers. Those two venues are at a square northwest of Taipei Railway Station and the other is at Daan Forest Park. The reason to choose the park because the park is located just across the Taipei Grand Mosque. Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin made a remark urging Taiwanese to be more considerate to foreign workers, telling them that <b>those</b> <b>workers</b> have help to make Taipei a better city to live, thus Taiwanese should treat them like families.|$|E
25|$|One {{positive}} outcome {{has been the}} end of jurisdictional warfare between the UFW and Teamsters. The UFW signed an agreement with the Teamsters in March 1977 in which the UFW agreed to seek to organize only <b>those</b> <b>workers</b> covered by CALRA, while the Teamsters agreed to organize all other agricultural workers. The agreement also led the UFW to end its boycott of lettuce, grapes, and wine in February 1978. Why did the two unions sign the agreement? UFW officials claimed the Teamsters {{were on the verge of}} losing a jurisdictional battle for 50,000 workers being decided by the ALRB, but at least one press report indicated that the scandal-scarred union wished to burnish its public image.|$|E

25|$|When V. crabro sexual {{behaviors}} were first studied, the colony {{seemed to be}} under pheromone control by the queen because none of the workers reproduced. However, new evidence has shown that though each of the workers has the machinery to reproduce, they only do so after weighing {{the costs and benefits}} of laying eggs versus the queen laying eggs. In a colony with a queen, the workers are more related to the queen’s larvae than their own. Contrary to previous assumptions, the workers were actually enforcing sterility in one another. Worker policing is the behavior exhibited to prevent other workers within the colony from producing males. This can be completed by either physically destroying worker-laid eggs or by discriminating against <b>those</b> <b>workers</b> that wish to reproduce.|$|E
25|$|A huge torchlight march {{took place}} the next night, {{attended}} by an estimated 15,000 Chicagoans.

Machine shops, factories, and mills were swept up in the strike wave. Employers and law enforcement authorities launched an offensive of their own, bringing about the firing of Workingmen's Party leader Albert Parsons from his job as a printer, and breaking up a WP meeting attended by 5,000 striking workers, family members and sympathizers through the copious use of nightsticks.|$|E

The governor and legislature failed to pass a state budget by the constitutional deadline of midnight on June 30, 2005 and therefore had no authority to pay thousands of the state’s employees for work performed. The politicians further attempted to divide state employees by deeming some “essential,” and sending the rest home.
