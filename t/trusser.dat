40|$|The study {{presents}} a new church for Novy Liskovec in Brno. The site {{is situated in}} the middle of housing estate close to public transport, on a rocky southern slope. The proposed building is used for local citizens and the christian community. For the project to be beneficial to all people concerned, I suggest layout features on culture, recreation, services and church. The open building design creates a natural social center. The church acts as a social center - multi-functional building. The basic inspirational impulse for the general shape and formal concept of the house is the existing passage through the plot, the need for social meetingpoint and the relationship to the surrounding landscape. Abstracted belt runs continuously through the construction; gradually defines and separates the social, secular and sacred space. To the visitor the house reveals a play of light, shadows and glimpses of the horizon. The project is divided into three parts: connected community center and church which are accompanied by multi-functional car park with shops and playground. The described objects create two building complexes that stand opposite to each other on the western and eastern edge of the plot. Among them, these create a town-square motif, leaving free space - the rock. The architectural concept of the church as a meandering path is expressed in the material solution of the construction. Path - the band that wraps the space has a different outer and inner material surface. The wrapped ribbon motif embracing and defining the space comes alive and changes with the movement of man in the enclosed space. Construction works as a series of leaflets - images that tell the story. The main axis of the object is oriented in the north-south direction thus offering views of open countryside and horizon, binds the building to the landscape. The structural design of the church is designed from concrete walls and steel <b>trussers.</b> The main load-bearing structures are embedded with self standing boxes from wooden KLH boards (laminated solid wood) as additional space separators...|$|R
60|$|The <b>trusser</b> and {{his family}} {{proceeded}} on their way, and soon entered the Fair-field, which showed standing-places and pens where many hundreds of horses and sheep had been exhibited and sold in the forenoon, but were now in great part taken away. At present, as their informant had observed, but little real business remained on hand, the chief being the sale by auction of a few inferior animals, that could not otherwise be disposed of, and had been absolutely refused by the better class of traders, who came and went early. Yet the crowd was denser now than during the morning hours, the frivolous contingent of visitors, including journeymen out for a holiday, a stray soldier or two come on furlough, village shopkeepers, and the like, having latterly flocked in; persons whose activities found a congenial field among the peep-shows, toy-stands, waxworks, inspired monsters, disinterested medical men who travelled for the public good, thimble-riggers, nick-nack vendors, and readers of Fate.|$|E
