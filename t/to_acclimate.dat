5|$|Goldman {{found it}} {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>acclimate</b> to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her outspokenness about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist Rebecca West arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher Bertrand Russell, novelist H. G. Wells, and more than 200 other guests. When she spoke of her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government, the audience was shocked. Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment. Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcon {{recovery}} teams breed {{the species}} in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute {{or with a}} hand puppet mimicking a peregrine's head, so they cannot see to imprint on the human trainers. Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called hacking back to the wild. To release a captive-bred falcon, the bird is placed in a special cage {{at the top of}} a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>acclimate</b> itself to its future environment.|$|E
5|$|Pong was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Atari. After producing Computer Space, Bushnell decided to form a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies. The first contract was with Bally Manufacturing Corporation for a driving game. Soon after the founding, Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn because of his experience with electrical engineering and computer science; Bushnell and Dabney also had previously worked with him at Ampex. Prior to working at Atari, Alcorn had no experience with video games. <b>To</b> <b>acclimate</b> Alcorn to creating games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly {{meant to be a}} warm-up exercise. Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product, and asked Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping. In 2011, Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before; Bushnell played a version on a PDP-1 computer in 1964 while attending college. However, Alcorn has claimed it was in direct response to Bushnell's viewing of the Magnavox Odyssey's Tennis game. In May 1972, Bushnell had visited the Magnavox Profit Caravan in Burlingame, California where he played the Magnavox Odyssey demonstration, specifically the table tennis game. Though he thought the game lacked quality, seeing it prompted Bushnell to assign the project to Alcorn.|$|E

40|$|The {{significant}} influence of thermal acclimation on physiological and behavioral performance {{has been documented}} in many ectothermic animals, but such studies are still limited in turtle species. We acclimated hatchling soft-shelled turtles Pelodiscus sinensis under three thermal conditions (10, 20 and 30 °C) for 4 weeks, and then measured selected body temperature (Tsel), critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax), and locomotor performance at different body temperatures. Thermal acclimation significantly affected thermal preference and resistance of P. sinensis hatchlings. Hatchling turtles <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 10 °C selected relatively lower body temperatures and were less resistant to high temperatures than those <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 20 °C and 30 °C. The turtles’ resistance to low temperatures increased with a decreasing acclimation temperature. The thermal resistance range (i. e. the difference between CTMax and CTMin, TRR) was widest in turtles <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 20 °C, and narrowest in those <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 10 °C. The locomotor performance of turtles was affected by both body temperature and acclimation temperature. Hatchling turtles <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> relatively higher temperatures swam faster than did those <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> lower temperatures. Accordingly, hatchling turtles <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> a particular temperature may not enhance the performance at that temperature. Instead, hatchlings <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> relatively warm temperatures have a better performance, supporting the “hotter is better” hypothesis [Current Zoology 59 (6) : 718 – 724, 2013]...|$|R

25|$|The {{drip line}} or trickle acclimating method {{is a safe}} and gentle way to {{introduce}} saltwater fish into a new home, and is a fairly simple one to perform. This procedure can be used <b>to</b> <b>acclimate</b> all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and the bucket is then set {{on the floor next}} to the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to the bucket. Tank water is allowed to drip slowly into the bucket, using the gang valve to adjust the drip rate, until the water dripped into the bucket equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water in the bucket to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed into the tank.|$|E

40|$|In vivo {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine how the physiological response to exhaustive exercise in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is affected by environmental temperature. The white muscle acid–base status (e. g. pH, PCO∑, HCO 3 � and �H + m) and metabolite (e. g. lactate, phosphocreatine, ATP and glycogen) content, and the acid–base status and lactate concentrations in the blood, were measured at rest and during recovery from burst exercise in rainbow trout <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> either 5 or 18 ˚C. Trout <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> the warmer temperature had higher resting levels of white muscle phosphocreatine (PCr) and also utilized a greater proportion of their muscle ATP and glycogen stores during burst activity compared with trout <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> the colder temperature. Recovery of muscle PCr and glycogen levels was independent of acclimation temperature, but muscle ATP levels recovered faster at 18 ˚C. Exhaustive exercise resulted in a similar lactacidosis in the muscle of trout <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> either temperature. In contrast, temperature had a marked influence on the lactacidosis in the blood. Blood lactate and metabolic proton concentrations following exercise were about twofold greater in fish <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 18 ˚C than in fish <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 5 ˚C. Despite the more severe acidosis and the greater lactate accumulation in the plasma of fish <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> warmer temperatures, the time required for recovery of these variables was similar to that at 5 ˚C. Taken together, these results suggest that acclimation temperature does not significantly affect anaerobic capacity in rainbow trout, but may account for much of the documented variability in the dynamics of the lactacidosis in blood following exhaustive exercise in fish...|$|R

40|$|Summary Internal {{conductance}} to CO 2 {{transfer from}} inter-cellular spaces to chloroplasts (gi) poses a major limitation to photosynthesis, but only three studies {{have investigated the}} temperature dependance of gi. The {{aim of this study}} was to de-termine whether acclimation to 15 versus 30 °C affects the temperature response of photosynthesis and gi in seedlings of the evergreen tree species Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. Six-month-old seedlings were <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 15 or 30 °C for 6 weeks before gi was estimated by simultaneous measure-ments of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence (variable J method). There was little evidence for acclimation of photo-synthesis to growth temperature. In seedlings <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> ei-ther 15 or 30 °C, the maximum rate of net photosynthesis peaked at around 30 or 35 °C. Such lack of temperature accli-mation may be related to the constant day and night tempera-ture acclimation regime, which differed from most other stud-ies in which night temperatures were lower than day tempera-tures. Internal conductance averaged 0. 25 mol m – 2 s– 1 at 25 °C and increased threefold from 10 to 35 °C. There was some evi-dence that gi was greater in seedlings <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 15 than to 30 °C, which resulted in seedlings <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 15 °C having, if anything, a smaller relative limitation due to gi than seedlings <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 30 °C. Stomatal limitations were also smaller in seedlings <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 15 °C than in seedlings <b>acclimated</b> <b>to</b> 30 °C. Based on chloroplast CO 2 concentration, neither maxi-mum rates of carboxylation nor RuBP-limited rate of electron transport peaked between 10 and 35 °C. Both were described well by an Arrhenius function and had similar activation ener-gies (57 – 70 kJ mol– 1).
