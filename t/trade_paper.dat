5|$|In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman Martin Quigley, {{editor of}} the {{prominent}} <b>trade</b> <b>paper</b> Motion Picture Herald, and Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit priest, created a code of standards (which Hays liked immensely), and submitted it to the studios. Lord's concerns centered on the effects sound film had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure. Several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), met with Lord and Quigley in February 1930. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention. It was {{the responsibility of the}} Studio Relations Committee, headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, to supervise film production and advise the studios when changes or cuts were required.|$|E

TheWrap said that the studio focused on theatrical releases in other territories where Cruise [...] "remains a major force" [...] in drawing audiences. Variety, writing from the US perspective, said, [...] "Media reports {{have been quick to}} speculate that Edge of Tomorrow {{may be one of the}} summer's first big bombs based on the lack of enthusiasm by U.S. audiences.

In the United States, the film received mixed reviews from critics, however in Germany, there were different reports about how Valkyrie was received. The New York Times wrote, [...] "It has been greeted with a measured and hospitable reception in Germany, where it was once viewed with suspicion." [...] The <b>trade</b> <b>paper</b> Variety reported that despite the controversy over Cruise's ties to Scientology, [...] "nitial reviews have been positive, with many observers now hailing Cruise and predicting the pic will even improve the country's image abroad." [...] Der Spiegel said that the film and its supporting actors were praised, but that Cruise was panned by German critics for [...] "a surprisingly low-key performance that fails to convey the charisma with which Stauffenberg inspired fellow plotters". The AFP also said that the German critics [...] "savaged Tom Cruise's portrayal" [...] of von Stauffenberg, yet [...] "relished a homegrown hero getting the Hollywood treatment".|$|E

500|$|In July 2008, United Artists {{president}} of worldwide marketing Dennis Rice {{was replaced by}} Michael Vollman, who was tasked to develop a marketing strategy for the [...] "troubled" [...] Valkyrie, which had been [...] "battered by constant media sniping". Under Vollman, by August 2008, the release date was changed to December 26, 2008, with reports citing commercial reasons for the move after a successful test screening. (The film was ultimately released on Christmas Day, December 25, 2008.) The release date was {{before the end of}} December, which [...] "crucially" [...] helped the film with a home distribution deal with the subscription channel Showtime. In the same month of August, Paula Wagner left her position with the studio during the film's post-production. The changing release date for Valkyrie drew criticism about the viability of United Artists, and the studio aimed to combat the criticism leading up to the film's eventual release. [...] In addition, the first theatrical trailer, released early in 2008, received [...] "mixed buzz" [...] over Tom Cruise's portraying von Stauffenberg with an American accent. The <b>trade</b> <b>paper</b> Variety described the trailer as [...] "dour and ... like it was selling a talky stage play with a cast of old British actors". Images of Tom Cruise as Colonel von Stauffenberg that surfaced during filming were widely ridiculed.

[...] Variety Weekly called it [...] "an out-and-out box office flop" [...] only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that [...] "nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time" [...] and that despite its [...] "excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story... it does not entertain." [...] In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, Exceptional Photoplays called it [...] "one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. But the point is that it was never intended to be a pleasant picture." [...] In the February 1925 issue of Theatre Magazine, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that [...] "the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism." [...] Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM [...] "clipped this production as much as they dared... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning." [...] In a Life Magazine article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim [...] "a genius... badly in need of a stopwatch." [...] Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying [...] "a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in."
