40|$|Abstract — Most {{work flow}} {{management}} systems and methodologies to support workflow management separate <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workflow process from <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{organization and the}} resources within the organization. The distinction between these two aspects is illustrated, which relates the process dimension. There are many reasons for decoupling these two dimensions when specifying a workflow. The complexity is reduced, reuse is stimulated, {{and it is possible}} to modify a process without changing <b>the</b> organizational <b>model</b> (and vice-versa). In this paper we show that Petri nets are suitable for <b>the</b> <b>modeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process dimension...|$|R

5|$|Near the aircraft, a {{point cloud}} in three {{dimensions}} is acquired by changing {{the orientation of the}} laser scanning sensors fixed on pan-tilt units. After filtering data to remove floor- or insufficiently large dot clusters, a registration technique with <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft is used to estimate the static orientation of the robot. The robot moves and holds this orientation by considering its wheel odometry, its inertial unit and visual odometry.|$|E

5|$|Douglas Trumbull was {{the visual}} effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi {{designed}} the aliens. Trumbull joked that the visual effects budget, at $3.3million, {{could have been}} used to produce an additional film. His work helped lead to advances in motion control photography. The mother ship was designed by Ralph McQuarrie and built by Greg Jein. The look of the ship was inspired by an oil refinery Spielberg saw at night in India. Instead of the metallic hardware look used in Star Wars, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look for the UFOs. One of the UFO models was an oxygen mask with lights attached to it, used because of its irregular shape. As a subtle in-joke, Dennis Muren (who had just finished working on Star Wars) put a small R2-D2 model onto the underside of the mothership. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mothership is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Shamrock Rovers F.C. is a members' club {{owned by}} the Shamrock Rovers Members Club. The Shamrock Rovers Members Club was {{originally}} formed as the 400 Club in November 2002, by the then privately owned football club's board of directors, to raise funds through the fan base, with {{the sole purpose of}} facilitating a mortgage {{for the development of the}} stalled stadium project in Tallaght. The monthly membership fee was set at €40. However, it became apparent to the members that the funds raised were being used for purposes outside of the stated objective. As a result, the membership took control of the 400 Club, adopted a transparent structure and constitution, and declared itself totally independent of the then board of Shamrock Rovers. The 400 Club consortium played a crucial role in the survival of Shamrock Rovers when the club entered examinership in April 2005. They paid off a portion of the club's debts and assumed responsibility for running it. After the successful acquisition of the club through the examinership process, the 400 Club Trustees became the Board of Directors of Shamrock Rovers Football Club and began the process of building a sustainable club through sensible business practices. Numerous clubs and supporters groups subsequently sought their advice with regard to using <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 400 club elsewhere. At the annual meeting of the 400 Club in 2006, the members voted to rename it as the SRFC Members Club, reflecting the reality of their ownership of the football club. At the 2008 meeting, the monthly membership fee was increased to €50. In January 2012, there were more than 400 members of the club. Membership is open to all.|$|E
