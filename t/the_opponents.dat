5|$|Pacification, {{to quell}} a {{potential}} civil war after a disputed election, to pacify <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> through political concessions. Five such sejms were held (in 1598, 1673, 1698, 1699 and 1735).|$|E
5|$|After Boroughbridge Pembroke {{found himself}} in a {{difficult}} situation. <b>The</b> <b>opponents</b> of Hugh Despenser and his father had lost all faith in him, {{but at the same time}} he found himself marginalised at court where the Despensers' power grew more and more complete. On top of this came his financial problems. On 24 June 1324, while on an embassy to France, he suddenly collapsed and died while lodging somewhere in Picardy.|$|E
5|$|If a ball travels {{outside of}} the playing area, play is {{restarted}} by possession being awarded to <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> of the team which last touched the ball, unless the ball goes out of bounds due to a shot or a deflected shot. In that case, possession is awarded to the player that is closest to the ball when it leaves the playing area.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>opponent</b> {{is lying}} {{face down on}} the ground. The wrestler kneels over <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> thighs with his left leg between <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> leg, then bends <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> left leg around his left thigh. After that they place <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> right leg over <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> left ankle and put their own right leg under <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> left ankle. Finally, they put both of their feet over <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> right foot and presses on it.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler stands behind, {{slightly}} {{to one side}} of and facing <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> <b>The</b> wrestler reaches under one of <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms with his/her corresponding arm and places the palm of his/her hand on the neck of <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> thereby forcing <b>the</b> arm of <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> up into <b>the</b> air (the half nelson). The wrestler then uses his/her other arm to pull <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> other arm behind <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> head, so both opponent's arms are pinned. The wrestler then hooks <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> near leg and throws themselves backwards, driving <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> back-first to <b>the</b> ground.|$|R
50|$|In the half-nelson, the attacking wrestler {{is on top}} of <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> on <b>the</b> {{ground with}} both wrestlers face down; a half nelson can be used to turn <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> over. <b>The</b> attacker's arm is pushed below <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> {{shoulder}} from <b>the</b> outside, and across and behind <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck. <b>The</b> attacker's arm lifts <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> shoulder while <b>the</b> attacker's hand presses his neck down; simultaneously the attacker drives forward perpendicularly to <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> body to roll him over onto his back. With <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> on his back and the attacker perpendicular to him chest-on-chest, the attacker tightens his arm around <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck, often also controlling <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> lower body by hooking the free arm in <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> crotch or around the near or far thigh.|$|R
5|$|In February 2010, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) {{rejected}} {{an injunction}} petition {{to halt the}} LHC's operation as unfounded, without hearing the case, stating that <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> had failed to produce plausible evidence for their theories. A subsequent petition {{was rejected by the}} Administrative Court of Cologne in January 2011. An appeal against the latter ruling was rejected by the Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine-Westphalia in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, he was {{selected}} for the Norway national under-21 football team for the final match of the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification. He played the full match against Portugal, as a forward, {{but was unable to}} prevent <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> from winning 2–1, despite being named Man of the Match.|$|E
5|$|Peruvian viceroy Joaquín de la Pezuela had {{instructions}} from Spain {{to negotiate with}} the patriots. Under an armistice <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> celebrated a meeting in Miraflores. The viceroy's deputies proposed to adopt the liberal Spanish constitution if San Martín left the country, but his deputies requested instead that Spain grant the independence of Peru. The negotiations did not bear fruit.|$|E
50|$|The {{attacker}} faces {{a standing}} opponent with {{one side of}} the ring immediately behind <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> <b>The</b> attacker applies a front facelock to <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> takes hold of <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> with his/her free hand, then lifts <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> until he/she is nearly vertical. The attacker then falls forward so that the torso of <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> bounces off <b>the</b> top ring rope, and uses this momentum to quickly lift <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> overhead once more and falls backwards, driving the back and shoulders of <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> into <b>the</b> ground.|$|R
50|$|The hold sets up {{the same}} as the sharpshooter, with <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> supine on <b>the</b> mat with the {{applying}} wrestler stepping between <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> legs with his/her right leg and wraps <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> legs at shin level around that leg. However, instead of stepping over <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> to flip <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> <b>the</b> applying wrestler flips the wrestler over from left-to-right, keeping <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> in front of him/her. The applying wrestler then leans over <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> and grabs his/her arms, applying a double chicken wing to <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> <b>The</b> applying wrestler then squats back, lifting <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> torso into <b>the</b> air. The move was used by Bull Nakano and later used by current WWE wrestler Paige.|$|R
50|$|This move {{sees the}} wrestler stand behind <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> put their head {{under one of}} <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms, and lift <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> into a belly-to-back suplex. The wrestler then pushes <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> upwards before turning and {{transitioning}} into a side slam, so <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> is dropped from an elevated position.|$|R
5|$|Teams {{are ranked}} {{according}} to the match points won in every round. In case of same number of match points by two or more teams, the tie-breaker was decided by applying: 1. The Sonneborn-Berger system; 2. Total game points scored; 3. Sum of the match points of <b>the</b> <b>opponents,</b> excluding the lowest one.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{foundation}} of IFK Göteborg, the dominant club in the Gothenburg area was Örgryte IS, which was considered a middle and upper class club. IFK became popular amongst the working class, creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and social class. In the early 20th century, supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen, applauding and supporting both their own team, and <b>the</b> <b>opponents.</b> However, this proved a hard task for supporters of the Gothenburg teams. Local patriotism and class differences sometimes resulted in fights and pitch invasions, making the Swedish press view IFK and Örgryte fans as the scum of Swedish football.|$|E
5|$|Each round {{began with}} a toss-up {{physical}} challenge in which both teams competed, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host began asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earned a monetary award, and allowed the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turned control over to <b>the</b> <b>opponents.</b> However, the team could dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> could double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control was challenged to a double dare, they had to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awarded both control and the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the team that issued it. The second round played the same as the first, with question values doubled. On Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, a question was initially worth $10. On Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, a question was initially worth $25.|$|E
50|$|The wrestler stands behind, {{slightly}} {{to one side}} of and facing <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> <b>The</b> wrestler reaches under one of <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms with their corresponding arm and places the palm of their hand on the back of <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck, thereby forcing the arm of <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> up into <b>the</b> air to complete the half nelson. The wrestler then lifts <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> up, turns, and falls forward, slamming <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> back-first into <b>the</b> mat.|$|R
50|$|The hold has <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> wrestler {{lying on}} their back. Standing {{at the feet}} of <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> <b>the</b> attacking wrestler then lifts <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> legs from behind the knees. Still {{gripping}} <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> legs, <b>the</b> attacking wrestler then flips forward, over <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> and plants their feet on the mat while bridging the back to add leverage.|$|R
50|$|Also {{called the}} roaring elbow, the wrestler {{facing away from}} <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> {{spinning}} 180° from the direction he stood, and then striking <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> with an elbow smash. Another variation sees the wrestler first facing <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> spins a full 360° to face <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> again to hit <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> an elbow smash.|$|R
5|$|He won {{his first}} title with Galatasaray on 5 May, with a 4–2 win over Sivasspor. In Galatasary's derby match against Istanbul rivals Fenerbahçe on 12 May, Drogba and his Ivorian {{teammate}} Emmanuel Eboue were subjects of racist chants from opposing fans in the team's 2–1 loss, but no fine or bans were handed down to the supporters or the club. On 11 August, he scored the only goal in the 2013 Turkish Super Cup against the same opponents, and he scored two second-half goals in a 2–1 away win against fellow city rivals Beşiktaş on 22 September, although the match was abandoned due to hooliganism from fans of <b>the</b> <b>opponents.</b>|$|E
5|$|It portrayed Hall as a humourless moralist {{who had a}} {{great deal}} in common with <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> of her novel. One illustration, picking up on the theme of {{religious}} martyrdom in The Well, showed Hall nailed to a cross. The image horrified Hall; her guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, The Master of the House.|$|E
5|$|Long-standing rivalries {{result in}} {{numerous}} rematches, especially {{if one of}} the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This {{is one of the reasons}} that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate <b>the</b> <b>opponents.</b> On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} a keylock. This armlock sees the wrestler {{grappling}} <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> wrist with his similar hand (for example, if he uses the right arm, he would grab <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> right wrist), and with <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> wrist still clutched, the wrestler bend <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arm (of <b>the</b> grappled wrist) it towards or behind <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> head (both variations are possible). Then, the wrestler passes his other free arm through the [...] "hole" [...] formed by <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> bent arm under the biceps, and then catches <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> grappled wrist. This would result in <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arm to be shaped into a 4. As <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> wrist is grabbed by both opponent's hands, along with the bent arm, this applies effective pressure into <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> <b>The</b> maneuver can be executed on a standing or a downed (facing upwards) opponent. Triple H popularized this move.|$|R
50|$|In wrestling, a bear hug, {{also known}} as a bodylock, is a {{grappling}} clinch hold and stand-up grappling position where the arms are wrapped around <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> either around <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> chest, midsection, or thighs, sometimes with one or both of <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms pinned to <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> body. <b>The</b> hands are locked around <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> and <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> is held tightly to the chest. The bear hug is a dominant position, with great control over <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> and also allows an easy takedown to the back mount position.|$|R
50|$|A single underhook {{can be used}} as a {{takedown}} maneuver. The protagonist underhooks one arm of <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> {{and extends}} his underhooking arm partly or mostly across <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> back, while using his other hand to pull <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> other elbow across <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> body, and drives forward into the underhooked side of <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b>|$|R
5|$|Manchester City's League Cup run saw two notable debuts {{for young}} players. In the Second round against Leicester City, Stan Bowles scored {{twice in a}} 4–0 win. In the next round against Blackpool, Joe Corrigan made {{the first of his}} 605 {{appearances}} for the club. City progressed after a replay. Fulham were <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> in the Fourth round, meaning City visited Craven Cottage {{for the second time in}} as many weeks. However, they could not replicate their league win, and lost 3–2.|$|E
5|$|Since 1912 {{the teams}} {{have played the}} game at the Cotton Bowl stadium in Dallas, Texas, amid the {{atmosphere}} of the adjacent Texas State Fair. This is unusual because most college football games alternate between <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> home stadiums. Dallas was chosen as the neutral site because it is approximately halfway between the two schools. The stadium is divided down the 50-yard line, with half of the stadium predominantly clad in the crimson and cream colors of Oklahoma, and the other half mostly wearing the burnt orange and white of Texas.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{considered}} the bill between June 22 and 24, 1965. An amendment by Rhode Island Senator John Pastore to remove silver entirely from the half dollar failed, 32—60. A number of senators wished to retain {{silver in the}} dime and quarter, and called {{for them to be}} made from 40 percent silver, but an amendment to that effect was defeated. There were other failed amendments, including one by Bible to prohibit melting of silver coins by the public. Robertson was determined to prevent any changes to the bill, which had been unanimously approved by his committee, and each attempt failed. The bill passed the Senate, 74—9, <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> being Bible and other Western senators.|$|E
50|$|The double overhooks are {{generally}} considered inferior to double underhooks, {{and are often}} used in response to double underhooks by <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> hands can be locked to <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> body {{it is possible to}} advance into a bear hug, with <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms pinned. Most commonly however, the overhooks are used to prevent <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> from advancing into a bear hug, by locking the double overhooks around <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> double underhooks.|$|R
5000|$|A tackle {{where the}} {{intention}} is to force <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> down on their back by tackling them at their waist or upper thighs. This usually involves grabbing <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> with both arms around <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> legs while keeping the chest close to <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> and using this position to force <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> to <b>the</b> floor [...]|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the vertebreaker, this move is {{executed}} from a position in which <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> is standing behind the wrestler, the wrestler underhooks his/her arms under <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms. Then <b>the</b> wrestler twists his / her body around so that the wrestler is facing the ground and <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> is standing with his / her back resting against the wrestler's back. Then the wrestler stands while <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> is in an upside down position while both <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> and <b>the</b> wrestler's arms are still hooked. The wrestler then drops to a sitting position. Another way to get <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> into <b>the</b> position is to approach a standing opponent from behind, hook <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> arms, bend forward under <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> and then rise up, raising <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> upside down.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} season, Manchester City did {{not challenge}} for the title. However, they found more success in the FA Cup. Young played in every round as the club reached the 1969 FA Cup Final. <b>The</b> <b>opponents</b> in the final were Leicester City. As Leicester were struggling against relegation Manchester City were strong favourites. However, the game was a close affair. Midway through the first half, Mike Summerbee crossed the ball from the right, and Young hit a left foot shot past Peter Shilton into {{the roof of the}} net. The match finished 1–0, Young's goal winning the Cup for Manchester City.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{techniques}} differ {{amongst the}} bovid families and also {{depend on their}} build. While the hartebeest fight on knees, others usually fight on all fours. Gazelles of various sizes use different methods of combat. Gazelles usually box, and in serious fights may clash and fence, consisting of hard blows from short range. Ibex, goat and sheep males stand upright and clash into each other downwards. Wildebeest use powerful head butting in aggressive clashes. If horns become entangled, <b>the</b> <b>opponents</b> move in a circular manner to unlock them. Muskoxen will ram into each other at high speeds. As a rule, only two bovids of equal build and level of defence engage in a fight, which is intended to determine the superior of the two. Individuals that are evidently inferior to others would rather flee than fight; for example, immature males do not fight with the mature bulls. Generally, bovids direct their attacks on the opponent's head rather than its body. The S-shaped horns, such as those on the impala, have various sections that help in ramming, holding, and stabbing. Serious fights leading to injury are rare.|$|E
50|$|This move is {{also known}} as a sambo suplex or side suplex. To perform it, the wrestler stands {{face-to-face}} with <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> slightly to their side. The wrestler tucks their head under <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> near arm, and reaches across <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> chest and around their neck with their near arm. The wrestler then simultaneously lifts <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> up, turns 180° and falls backwards, bringing <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> over them and slamming <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> back-first on <b>the</b> mat.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler {{stands in}} front of, facing away from and {{slightly}} {{to one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> <b>The</b> wrestler then reaches behind themselves and applies a three-quarter facelock to <b>the</b> <b>opponent.</b> <b>The</b> wrestler then hooks <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> near leg with their own near leg and sweeps the leg away, simultaneously throwing themselves backwards, thus driving <b>the</b> <b>opponent</b> to <b>the</b> ground (with the weight of the wrestler on top of them) and wrenching <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> neck.|$|R
50|$|A single overhook {{can be used}} to take an <b>opponent</b> down. <b>The</b> protagonist hooks {{over one}} arm of <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> {{simultaneously}} moving to that side of <b>the</b> <b>opponent,</b> often while holding <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> other upper arm or elbow with his other hand. He puts his weight on <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> hooked arm, forcing him to the ground, and then steps over <b>the</b> <b>opponent's</b> back.|$|R
