50|$|The <b>total</b> <b>alkali</b> {{content in}} {{analyzed}} samples of Egyptian blue {{is greater than}} 1%, suggesting the alkali was introduced deliberately into the mixture and not as an impurity from other components. Sources of alkali could either have been natron from areas such as Wadi Natroun and El-Kab, or plant ash. By measuring the amounts of potash and magnesia in the samples of Egyptian blue, it is generally possible to identify which source of alkali had been used, since the plant ash contains higher amounts of potash and magnesia than the natron. However, due to the low concentration of alkali in Egyptian blue, which is a mere 4% or less, compared to glass, for example, which is at 10-20%, identifying the source is not always easy. The alkali source likely was natron, although {{the reasons for this}} assumption are unclear. However, analysis by Jaksch et al. of various samples of Egyptian blue identified variable amounts of phosphorus (up to 2 wt %), suggesting the alkali source used was in actuality plant ash and not natron. Since the glass industry during the Late Bronze Age used plant ash as its source of alkali, there might have possibly been a link in terms of the alkali used for Egyptian blue before and after the introduction of the glass industry.|$|E

50|$|Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) {{and their}} {{intrusive}} equivalents, gabbros, are the characteristic igneous rocks formed at mid-ocean ridges. They are tholeiitic basalts particularly low in <b>total</b> <b>alkalis</b> and in incompatible trace elements, {{and they have}} relatively flat rare earth element (REE) patterns normalized to mantle or chondrite values. In contrast, alkali basalts have normalized patterns highly enriched in the light REE, and with greater abundances of the REE and of other incompatible elements. Because MORB basalt is considered a key to understanding plate tectonics, its compositions have been much studied. Although MORB compositions are distinctive relative to average compositions of basalts erupted in other environments, they are not uniform. For instance, compositions change with position along the Mid-Atlantic ridge, and the compositions also define different ranges in different ocean basins. Mid-ocean ridge basalts have been subdivided into varieties such as normal (NMORB) and those slightly more enriched in incompatible elements (EMORB).|$|R

We have studied acid-base balance in 19 stable CAPD patients attending the peritoneal dialysis clinic of Mount Sinai Hospital. They obtained a 24 hour collection of peritoneal dialysis fluid and urine while consuming their usual diet and performing their usual activities. <b>Total</b> <b>alkali</b> gain was calculated from net GI alkali absorption plus urinary net acid excretion plus alkali gain from dialysate, while total acid production was measured directly from the urinary and dialysate excretions of sulfate and organic anions. Net GI alkali absorption was estimated from the difference between cations (Na + K + Ca + Mg) and anions (Cl + 1. 8 P) in the 24 hour dialysate and urine collections minus the daily total amount of lactate infused. All of our patients had a normal or high serum bicarbonate concentration, which was stable with time. <b>Total</b> <b>alkali</b> gain was virtually identical to total acid production (54. 2 vs. 52. 4 mEq/day) which suggests that these patients were in neutral acid-base balance. Net GI alkali absorption (22. 7 mEq/day) {{was one of the}} same range as that of chronic renal failure patients not on dialysis and represented almost one half of the total daily alkali gain. The daily acid production of 52. 4 mEq/day was numerically equal to 84 % of the protein catabolic rate expressed as g/day, which is similar to the predicted value of 77 % of PCR reported in the literature. However, the main source of alkali loss, that is, acid production, was the loss of organic anions in dialysate and urine. Daily sulfate excretion (16 mEq/day) was lower than expected for the level of protein intake (protein catabolic rate of 62 g/day).

40|$|Abstrpct: In {{order to}} create a {{sustainable}} classification of igneous rocks which all geologists might use, an international body was set up by the IUGS: the IUGS Subcommission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks. In the course of creating the classification, the Subcommission has established ten principles for its construction and for defining an appropriate nomenclature. The principles are: (1) use descriptive attributes; (2) use actual properties; (3) ensure suitability for all geologists; (4) use current terminology; (5) define boundaries of rock species; (6) keep it simple to apply; (7) follow natural relations; (8) use modal mineralogy; (9) if mode not feasible, use chemistry; (10) follow terminology of other IUGS advisory bodies. These principles and their rationale have not previously been enunciated. The classification separates and individually classifies the pyroclastic, carbonatitic, melititic, lamprophyric and charnockitic rocks before entering the main QAPF classification for plutonic and volcanic rocks which is based on the modal mineral proportions of quartz (Q), alkali feldspar (A) and plagioclase (P) or of alkali feldspar (A), plagioclase (P) and feldspathoids (F).

40|$|Alkali silica reation (ASR) is {{a common}} {{deterioration}} mechanism of concrete. During ASR, reactive aggregate containing silicon oxide (SiO 2) can react with the alkaline fluid in the concrete pores. To test whether a concrete mix is prone to ASR, several concrete prism tests (CPT) are developed. Performance tests are defined as a CPT where the alkali content in the concrete is {{comparable to that of}} a conventional concrete. During CPT, leaching or ingress of alkalis can affect the result of the test, as proven by Lindgård et al. (2013 b). However, Lindgård measured leaching and ingress by testing the leachate, lining and wrapping in the test container for alkali, but not the prisms themselves. In my master thesis project, I have investigated four concrete prisms that have been tested with different concrete prism performance tests. The prisms had experienced different degrees of leaching or ingress according to Lindgårds measurements. The prisms were cut and ground to give concrete powder samples that I tested using cold water extraction (CWE) and hot acid extraction (HAE). Aggregates were also ground and tested with these methods to account for alkali contribution from the aggregates during CWE and HAE. All samples were tested with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to investigate the paste content. CWE and HAE produced solutions which were measured for alkali content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results were compared to the expected alkali content in the prisms given from the alkali content in the cement from the recipe, minus the measured leaching or ingress. I have investigated all measurements and calculations, and calculated the error based on these. The calculations of errors are based on the principle of error propagation, and I assume all errors are uncorrelated. My results show that HAE is not suitable for measuring <b>total</b> <b>alkali</b> content. CWE does not measure the expected 50 - 60 % of the expected alkali content, but gives consistent results that are not affected by contribution from the aggregates.

With respect to melt rate, the general trend to improve melt rate has been to enhance the <b>total</b> <b>alkali</b> concentration in the glass system by increasing the alkali concentration in the frit, utilizing (or targeting) a less washed sludge, or {{using a combination of}} the two. Cozzi et al. (2002) defined thirty-one glasses that intentionally challenged either the current durability model over an extremely broad compositional region or the Salkali and Al 2 O 3 criteria proposed by Herman et al. (2002). These glasses were batched, melted, and subjected to the PCT. In this report, the results of both compositional analysis and PCT response are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Mantle {{temperature}} variation and plate spreading rate variation {{have been considered}} to be the two fundamental variables that determine the extent of mantle melting and ocean crust production. Along the length of a ~ 200 km portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) between the Oceanographer (35 °N) and Hayes (33 °N) transforms, the mantle potential temperature is the same, the plate spreading rate is the same, but the extent of mantle melting and crustal production vary drastically. In addition to the typical crustal thickness variation on ridge segment scales at the MAR, i. e. thicker at segment centers and thinner at segment ends, there exist between-segment differences. For example, the ~ 90 km long segment OH- 1 is magmatically robust with a central topographic high, thick crust, and a large negative gravity anomaly whereas the ~ 45 km long segment OH- 3 is magmatically starved with a deep rift valley, thin crust and a weak negative gravity anomaly. We demonstrate that the observed differences in the extent of mantle melting, melt production and crustal mass between segments OH- 1 and OH- 3 are ultimately controlled by their fertile mantle source compositional difference as reflected by the lava compositional differences between the two segments: > 70 % of OH- 1 samples studied (N = 57) are enriched MORB with [La/Sm] > 1, but > 85 % of OH- 3 samples studied (N = 42) are depleted MORB with [La/Sm] < 1. Calculations show that the mean OH- 1 source is more enriched in incompatible elements, <b>total</b> <b>alkalis</b> (~ 0. 36 wt% NaO and ~ 0. 09 % KO) and HO content (~ 280 ppm) than the mean OH- 3 source, which is depleted of incompatible elements, <b>total</b> <b>alkalis</b> (< 0. 17 % NaO and < 0. 01 % KO) and HO content (~ 70 ppm). These fertile compositional differences result in significantly reduced solidus temperature of OH- 1 source over that of OH- 3 source, and allows melting to begin at a significantly greater depth beneath OH- 1 (~ 90 km) than beneath OH- 3 (< 60 km), leading to a taller melting column, higher degrees of decompression melting, greater melt production, thus thicker crust and more negative gravity anomaly at OH- 1 than at OH- 3. We emphasize that fertile mantle source compositional variation is as important as mantle {{temperature variation}} and plate spreading rate variation in governing the extent of mantle melting, crustal production, and MORB chemistry. The buoyancy-driven focused mantle upwelling model better explains the observations than the subcrustal melt migration model. Future mantle flow models that consider the effect of fertile mantle compositional variation are expected to succeed in producing along-axis wavelengths of buoyant flow comparable to the observed size of ridge segments at the MAR. We propose that the size and fertility of the enriched mantle heterogeneities may actually control the initiation and evolution of ridge segments bounded by non-rigid discontinuities at slow-spreading ridges...|$|R
40|$|Within the Panxi rift of the Permian Emeishan large igneous {{province}} (ELIP), SW China, a 20  km 2 quartz-bearing fayalite syenitic pluton intrudes the 260  Ma Baima igneous complex (BIC). The fayalite syenite is dated using SHRIMP zircon U-Pb techniques at 252 ± 2. 5  Ma. The Panxi fayalite syenite {{is mainly}} composed of alkali feldspar, ferroan augite, fayalite, quartz and Fe-Ti oxides and contains 61. 8 - 63. 7  wt. % SiO 2, 5. 0 - 7. 3  wt. % Fe 2 O 3 t and 9. 9 - 12. 1  wt. % <b>total</b> <b>alkalis,</b> belonging to an A-type variety of ferroan alkalic metaluminous granitoids. The fayalite syenite displays positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0. 9 - 8. 9) and is enriched in LREE [(La/Yb) N = 6. 6 - 11. 5]. The e{open}Nd values and (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) initial ratios of the fayalite syenite range from + 1. 3 to + 1. 9 and from 0. 7035 to 0. 7068, respectively. The fayalite syenite and the BIC {{had the same}} mantle source; however the 8  myr age gap between them suggests the fayalite syenite formed by remelting of underplated mafic magmas injected into the crust during ELIP magmatism. The ages of the fayalite syenite and BIC are coincident with two Permian mass extinction events and suggest that ELIP may have influenced both. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding of the {{geologic}} {{evolution of}} Mars {{has been greatly}} improved by recent orbital(1 - 3), in situ(4, 5) and meteorite(6 - 8) data, but insights into the earliest period of Martian magmatism (4. 1 to 3. 7 billion years ago) remain scarce(9). The landing site of NASA's Curiosity rover, Gale crater, which formed 3. 61 billion years ago(10) within older terrain(11), provides a window into this earliest igneous history. Along its traverse, Curiosity has discovered light-toned rocks that contrast with basaltic samples found in younger regions(12). Here we present geochemical data and images of 22 specimens analysed by Curiosity that demonstrate that these light-toned materials are feldspar-rich magmatic rocks. The rocks belong to two distinct geochemical types: alkaline compositions containing up to 67 wt% SiO 2 and 14 wt% <b>total</b> <b>alkalis</b> (Na 2 O + K 2 O) with fine-grained to porphyritic textures on the one hand, and coarser-grained textures consistent with quartz diorite and granodiorite on the other hand. Our analysis reveals unexpected magmatic diversity and the widespread presence of silica- and feldspar-rich materials {{in the vicinity of}} the landing site at Gale crater. Combined with the identification of feldspar-rich rocks elsewhere(9, 13, 14) and the low average density of the crust in the Martian southern hemisphere(15), we conclude that silica-rich magmatic rocks may constitute a significant fraction of ancient Martian crust and may be analogous to the earliest continental crust on Earth...|$|R
