In addition, a polymer bound tosyl chloride reagent has also been shown to effect this transformation. Chlorination of ketones at the α-position has classically involved acid or light initiated addition of chlorine to ketones. 1 These conditions can be somewhat limited in scope for several reasons, for instance these are also the conditions used to halogenate olefins. Alternatively, the reaction of ketones with copper (II) chloride has been used to prepare α-chloroketones. 2 This provides a selective method for the chlorination of an unsymmetrical ketone at the more highly substituted α-carbon atom. To effect the α-chlorination of a ketone at the less substituted carbon, the reaction sequence involves the initial formation of an intermediate such as a silyl enol ether. 3 Other methods reported for the preparation of α-chloroketones use <b>trichloroisocyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> 4, N-chlorosuccinimide 5, sulfuryl chloride 6 and polymer-supported chlorine. 7 During our investigations probing the selective formation of alkynes 8 a and allenes 8 b via the elimination reactions of O-substituted enols we observed...|$|E
