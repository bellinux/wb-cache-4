ChuckA report by Jon Heyman listed the sale price at $570 million. At least one group whose approval was needed, Monarch Alternative Capital, refused to sign off on the sale. Monarch Alternative Capital, which purchased a portion of Hicks Sports Group's debt after HSG defaulted, believed Hicks passed up on a better purchase deal from Jim Crane, who was speculated by the December 29 email to have made a higher offer. The reported gap between creditors demands and payment offered by HSG was $270 million and $300 million and would have been resolved if the amount Hicks was to receive from the land sale was lowered to increase the creditors for the debt. MLB's commissioner, Bud Selig, expressed his interest in the deal being approved by the creditors no later than April 9, 2010, and indicated that MLB could become more directly involved in the sale process.|$|E

There is one break we get here in Florida though, and that is we can go bathing and lay on the beach wile you are wrapped up in heavy winter clothing to keep warm. The ocean temperature averages around 70 or 75 degrees in the winter and it sure feels good. Even this simmer we are getting the breaks. So far the hottest day we have had has been 86 and I’ve seen by the Providence Papers that you have had much warmer days even though you can look forward to a cool day now <b>and</b> then.
