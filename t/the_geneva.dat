5|$|Additionally, {{despite the}} initial {{positive}} response to <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> experts' report, data gathered from Hardtack operations of 1958 (namely the underground Rainier shot) would further complication verification provisions as US scientists, including Hans Bethe (who backed a ban), {{became convinced that}} <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> findings were too optimistic regarding detection of underground tests, though Macmillan warned that using the data to block progress on a test ban might be perceived in the public as a political ploy. In early 1959, Wadsworth told Tsarapkin of new US skepticism towards <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> System. While <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> experts believed the system could detect underground tests down to five kilotons, the US now believed that it could only detect tests down to 20 kilotons (in comparison, the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima had an official yield of 13 kilotons). As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Geneva</b> detection regime {{and the number of}} control posts would have to be significantly expanded, including new posts within the Soviet Union. The Soviets dismissed the US argument as a ruse, suggesting that the Hardtack data had been falsified.|$|E

Bảo Đại appointed Diệm as his Prime Minister, hoping Diệm would be able to attract American aid as the French withdrew from Southeast Asia. Diệm returned to Vietnam in June 1954 and took up the post on July 7, 1954. After a series of disagreements, Diệm deposed Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum on October 23, 1955, and declared himself president of the newly-proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later. Diệm received support from the US and other anti-communist countries {{in the midst of the}} Cold War. He refused to hold national reunification elections scheduled in 1956, and asserted that Ho would rig the ballots in the north, although he had done so himself in deposing Bảo Đại.

40|$|Introduction: <b>The</b> revised <b>Geneva</b> score, a {{standardized}} clinical decision {{rule in the}} diagnosis of PE, was recently developed. The Wells clinical decision is widely used but lacks full standardization since it includes subjective clinician's judgment. We have compared the performance of <b>the</b> revised <b>Geneva</b> score with <b>the</b> Wells rule and their usefulness to rule out PE in combination with D-dimer measurement. Methods: In 300 consecutive patients, the clinical probability of PE was assessed prospectively by the Wells rule and retrospectively using <b>the</b> revised <b>Geneva</b> score. Patients were a random sample from a single centre, participating in a large prospective multi-centre diagnostic study. The predictive accuracy of both scores was compared by AUC of ROC-curves. Results: The overall prevalence of PE was 16 %. The prevalence of PE in the low, intermediate and high probability categories as classified by <b>the</b> revised <b>Geneva</b> score {{was similar to that}} of the original derivation set. The performance of <b>the</b> revised <b>Geneva</b> score as measured by the AUC in a ROC analysis did not differ statistically from the Wells rule. After 3 months of follow up, no patient classified into the low or intermediate clinical probability score by <b>the</b> revised <b>Geneva</b> score and a normal D-dimer result was subsequently diagnosed with acute VTE. Conclusion: This study suggests that the performance of <b>the</b> revised <b>Geneva</b> score is equivalent to that of the Wells rule. In addition, it seems safe to exclude PE in patients by the combination of a low or intermediate clinical probability by <b>the</b> revised <b>Geneva</b> score and a normal D-dimer level.
