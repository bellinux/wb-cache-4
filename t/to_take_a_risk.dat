5|$|The {{settings}} for {{the stories are}} primarily high fantasy worlds, with the producers opting not to use a dark or science fiction-based setting. An exception is Xillia 2, which mostly {{took place in a}} modern setting, and explored darker themes than usual. This direction was confirmed as a one-off experiment for the series. The main characters {{play a key role in}} the Tales games, as it is partially through them that the main theme of each entry is depicted. For Abyss, it was decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> and create an unorthodox protagonist that would be initially unlikable. For Vesperia, the team opted to raise the age limit of the target audience, showing this in the game by making the main protagonist a more mature type. A female main protagonist was included for the first time in Xillia in the form of Milla Maxwell alongside male protagonist Jude Mathis, although at the time it was stated that there were no solid plans to create a game with a single female protagonist. A sole main female character, called Velvet, was eventually included in Berseria. The way the characters interact with each other during the narrative forms one of the core aspects of designing each game. Another main priority is for players to see a part of themselves in the characters.|$|E

Australia {{continued to play}} defensively, and after making 42 in the second innings, the skipper declared and set the tourists 271 {{in less than a}} day, and the matched petered into a draw with Australia still behind in the series. Another draw in the Sixth Test meant that Australia needed a win to draw the series and retain the Ashes. After taking a 235-run first innings lead, England did not need <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> with their series lead with a bold declaration and set Australia a world-record 469 runs for victory. The hosts were 3/328 when time ran out, and Lawry made only 10 and 21. Lawry had batted for more than 24 hours in the series, averaging around 13 runs an hour.|$|E

500|$|According to Nintendo Power, Dragon Quest VI was {{originally}} planned for North American release {{in the spring}} of 1996 under the title [...] "Dragon Warrior V." [...] However, the Super Nintendo localization of the game never happened, Enix having already given up on the U.S. market. Square, one of the only companies still willing to bring console role-playing video games to the United States, was also still struggling to get their games to sell in the United States, and therefore, Dragon Quest VI had no companies willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> for it. In Nintendo Power vol. 81, the staff wrote an article on Dragon Quest VI, hoping the game would find a North American release. They also suggested why the series might not appeal to the American audience: there is too much fighting and not enough adventuring. Other critics have mentioned that class building becomes tedious and that the dual worlds are too overwhelming, both possible reasons against a US release. Dragon Quest VI was listed as #7 among the 10 Best Japanese Games Never Released in the U.S. by GamePro magazine in their May 2005 issue.|$|E
500|$|Later, {{his style}} of {{scouting}} {{was used as a}} blueprint by scouts to evaluate players. He usually ignored the obvious tools such as ability to hit, size, speed, and human power, saying that [...] "any dope" [...] could see it. When he scouted a prospect, his top priority was checking that the subject could handle the pressure of playing Major League Baseball. When he got word of a promising player, he went to see him play. If Krichell liked what he saw, he discussed the player's goals and motivation with him and his family. He decided whether the player was ready for the Yankees or one of their farm teams to use. He tended <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> with players passed by other teams. He discounted some of a player's weaknesses if their remaining skills were up to par, for example with Tony Lazzeri, who was a poor fielder. Krichell also {{was one of the first}} to notice that intelligence mattered in a game filled with uneducated people. Most of his signings were college graduates who Krichell believed could take advantage of their ability to think.|$|E

500|$|Bradman then played 11 balls from Young without scoring. Yardley {{used the}} spin of Young and Compton for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made {{little effort to}} score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed {{at one end and}} Bradman at the other; neither looked to rotate the strike with singles. Bradman only played eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled that Morris wanted a single that he sent him back. The {{tourists}} thereafter batted safely in a defensive manner to ensure a draw. They ended at 1/92 in 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, with 35 maidens, which was the slowest innings run rate to date in the series. Bradman finished unbeaten on 30 from 146 balls when the oft-interrupted match was finally terminated by a series of periodic rain interruptions. O'Reilly criticised the approach taken by the Australians in the closing stages of the match, attributing it to Bradman's orders. He said that the pitch was made so tame by the heavy rain that they could have played in a natural and attractive manner to entertain the spectators, rather than defending carefully. He said that Bradman's [...] "unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> or to accept the challenging call of some particular phase of the game {{is one of the greatest}} flaws" [...] in his leadership.|$|E
500|$|In June 2006, McEvilly {{was set to}} join for Bradford City on a free {{transfer}} after agreeing {{a contract}} with the club. Despite McEvilly passing a medical, the move fell through as he was unwilling to train with Bradford during their pre-season without guarantee of a contract. Bradford City manager Colin Todd explained; [...] "We were concerned about an old injury to his foot which has resulted in it being pinned and we are not prepared <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> with him". McEvilly opted to sign a new two-year contract with Wrexham. During pre-season with Wrexham, McEvilly broke his other foot, having previously broke the same bone twice in four-months during the previous season. His first appearance of the 2006–07 season, was on 25 November at home against Lincoln City in the 2–1 win in League Two, when he came on as a substitute for Kevin Smith in the 80th minute. McEvilly went on to make 28 appearances in League Two, scoring eight goals and a further two appearances in the FA Cup, scoring once against Championship side Derby County in their 3–1 defeat at Pride Park on 6 January. His contract was cancelled by mutual consent {{at the end of the}} season. Wrexham manager Brian Carey said that they are [...] "well covered in terms of strikers" [...] and [...] "he is some way down the pecking order".|$|E
500|$|When Roberts & Vinter {{made the}} {{decision}} to close down New Worlds in 1963, Moorcock and Ballard considered publishing a new magazine that would be willing, as Carnell had been, to publish experimental material. [...] Moorcock assembled a dummy issue, and later described his intentions: [...] "It would be on art paper, to take good quality illustrations; it would be the size of, say, Playboy so that it would get good display space on the newsstands; it would specialise in experimental work by writers like [...] Burroughs and [...] Paolozzi, but it would be 'popular', it would seek to publicise such experimenters; it would publish all those writers who had become demoralised by a lack of sympathetic publishers and by baffled critics; it would attempt a cross-fertilization of popular sf, science and the work of the literary and artistic avant garde." [...] Moorcock also wrote a letter to Carnell setting out his thoughts on what science fiction needed: [...] "Editors who are willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> on a story and run it even though this may bring criticism on their heads." [...] The letter was published in the final Nova Publications issue, which also carried the announcement that Moorcock would be taking over from Carnell as editor of New Worlds, though Moorcock had been unaware he would be considered for the post when he wrote his letter.|$|E

Bradman only played eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled by his partner's desire for a single that he sent him back.

500|$|In the 1990s, the {{television}} industry made wide use of spec scripts, or episode scripts solicited from freelance writers. While The X-Files {{had a large}} staff of writers, the staff would occasionally have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> on a teleplay written by an unaffiliated writer {{to fill out a}} full season order. [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] was such a case, being written by sisters Vivian Mayhew and Valerie Mayhew. This marked their first experience with writing a one-hour network program, and they would later write several episodes in {{the television}} series Charmed. Prior to having their script picked up by the series, the sisters asked staff writers Glen Morgan and James Wong for writing suggestions. Morgan and Wong told them that [...] "the scariest things are those which repeat every day". Soon thereafter, Vivian was paged by a number she did not recognize. She realized that pagers in their own way are scary, because an unknown person can connect to the pager's owner. The Mayhews then went from focusing on pagers to the group of people who normally use them: doctors. It was then that they realized a plot about doctors losing control and being bewitched could make for a good episode. After writing their spec script, they presented it to Morgan and Wong, who suggested they change the villain from a woman to a man as [...] "plastic surgery is related to vanity, and everyone expects that from a woman, but not a man." [...] After the script was submitted, it was selected to become a full episode.|$|E
500|$|Writers {{agree that}} the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British {{newspaper}} The Observer writes [...] "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated {{for the past six}} seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practised by Ally McBeal, the Buffy musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." [...] Johnston in the Sunday Herald Sun says, [...] "There is just so much to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases and pull it off", while Debi Enker in The Age comments, [...] "Whedon demonstrates yet again what Buffy aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> make his television efforts rise way above the pack." [...] Steve Murray in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution characterizes the episode as [...] "scary in a brand-new way", saying [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] is [...] "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes 'Hush' and 'The Body; the episode is [...] "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as [...] "(b)oth spoof and homage, [...] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".|$|E
