5|$|The Finnish Civil War (27 January – 15 May 1918) {{concerned}} {{leadership and}} control of Finland during {{the transition from a}} Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire to an independent state. The conflict formed a part of the national, political, and social turmoil caused by World War I (Eastern Front) in Europe. The war was fought between the Reds, led by the Social Democratic Party and the Whites, conducted by the non-socialist, conservative-led senate. <b>The</b> <b>paramilitary</b> Red Guards, composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centers of southern Finland. <b>The</b> <b>paramilitary</b> White Guards, composed of peasants and middle-class and upper-class factions, controlled rural central and northern Finland.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>paramilitaries</b> were <b>the</b> White Eagles {{under the}} control of Vojislav Šešelj. He visited Voćin in the {{following}} month and incited <b>the</b> <b>paramilitaries</b> to persecute <b>the</b> Croat population. According to testimonies of surviving residents of Voćin, the White Eagles and several local Serbs terrorised the Croat population, reduced to 80 by late 1991. Prior to the war, ethnic Serbs formed eighty percent of the village's population.|$|R
50|$|Money {{from drug}} {{trafficking}} allowed paramilitaries to develop extensive military capabilities. In <b>the</b> late 1990s, <b>paramilitaries</b> consolidated {{into a single}} coordinating body called the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia that had national spokesmen who claimed to share political ideas. <b>The</b> <b>paramilitaries</b> became a valid and recognized part of government that stood against liberal ideology. Soon <b>the</b> <b>paramilitaries</b> began to increase troops and enforce combat squads that often resulted in massacres targeting civilian populations. This violence was once again a terror-filled way to control resources such as land, drug production, and trafficking routes.|$|R

As he searches for Genesis, Zack discovers Genesis' origin, Project G, and how it is related to two other high-ranking SOLDIERs; Sephiroth and Angeal Hewley. The game's storyline takes the player from the war between the megacorporation Shinra and the people of Wutai to the events in Nibelheim, ending just before the beginning of Final Fantasy VII.|$|E
5|$|With 1,300 deputies {{still in}} Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers {{was unable to}} control the army he had created.

Over-65s were quickly released by the Norwegian government. Most controversially, the Jews's property was confiscated by the state.|$|E
40|$|A {{domestic}} power {{faces an}} enemy and commits terrorist atrocities {{to increase the}} likelihood of victory.

5|$|After Arias' {{death in}} 1988, Endara became a leading {{opponent}} of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by <b>the</b> <b>paramilitary</b> Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama, and swore in Endara as the new president {{on the first night}} of the invasion on a U.S. military base.|$|E
5|$|An attack {{started on}} 6 December, spearheaded by Soviet T-54 and T-55 tanks and {{reportedly}} coordinated by advisors from the Soviet Union and East Germany, brought {{the fall of}} the capital on 16 December. The Libyan force, numbering between 7,000 and 9,000 men of regular units and <b>the</b> <b>paramilitary</b> Pan-African Islamic Legion, 60 tanks, and other armored vehicles, had been ferried across 1,100 kilometers of desert from Libya's southern border, partly by airlift and tank transporters and partly under its own power. The border itself was 1,000 to 1,100 kilometers from Libya's main bases on the Mediterranean coast. Wright states that the Libyan intervention demonstrated an impressive logistical ability, and provided Gaddafi with his first military victory and a substantial political achievement.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} guerrilla war would spread south, the South African {{government}} pressured Rhodesia {{to advance the}} process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina {{at her home in}} Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within <b>the</b> <b>paramilitary</b> group, predominantly between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.|$|E
5|$|The JNA, {{supported}} by <b>the</b> <b>paramilitaries</b> and <b>the</b> TO, entered Lovas unopposed {{on the morning}} of 10 October. According to court testimony of one of <b>the</b> <b>paramilitaries</b> {{who took part in the}} events, the troops moving against Lovas were told to expect 300–400 ZNG troops defending the village. Once the attacking force entered the village, the troops continued to throw grenades and shoot at houses at random for several hours. During the assault, 22 civilians were killed in their homes or back yards. In the immediate aftermath of the takeover of Lovas, Croat civilians were required to wear white armbands and their houses were marked using white sheets. The marked houses were looted and torched by <b>the</b> TO and <b>paramilitaries.</b> Authority in <b>the</b> village was turned over to Ljuban Devetak, a member of <b>the</b> Dušan Silni <b>paramilitaries.</b> He was styled as the commander of the village, but the JNA remained in overall control of the entire region. Over the following week, 23 more civilians were killed by <b>the</b> <b>paramilitaries</b> and <b>the</b> TO troops in improvised detention facilities. The improvised prisons were also used for torture and abuse of captives, including war rape, causing serious injuries to 18 civilians.|$|R
30|$|Regarding the construal {{of death}} as a thing, not only were nominalizations more {{frequent}} in <b>the</b> <b>paramilitaries</b> subcorpora in both periods, but also perpetrators were systematically occluded. That is to say, constructions such as Masacre en Urabá (Massacre in Urabá - nominalized process, occluded perpetrator) are significantly more frequent in <b>the</b> <b>paramilitaries</b> subcorpora than structures of the type Masacre de Farc en Urabá (Farc massacre in Urabá - explicit perpetrator) or Farc masacró 19 campesinos en Urabá (Farc massacred 19 peasants in Urabá - death as process, explicit perpetrator).|$|R
40|$|A {{domestic}} power {{faces an}} enemy and commits terrorist atrocities {{to increase its}} likelihood of victory. A foreign patron can grant aid to the power but prefers fewer or no atrocities. To avoid the need to compromise with the foreign patron, the domestic power may create (or stop suppressing) independent paramilitaries that commit even more atrocities. Once <b>the</b> <b>paramilitaries</b> are set up, aid flows and the atrocity level is high.

5|$|In 1964–65 {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in Shanina arose in the Soviet press, largely due to the publication of her diary. The newspaper Severny Komsomolets asked Shanina's contemporaries to write what they knew about her. Streets in Arkhangelsk, Shangaly and Stroyevskoye were named after her, and the village of Yedma has a museum dedicated to Shanina. The local school where she studied in 1931–35 has a commemorative plate. In Arkhangelsk, regular shooting competitions were organized among members of <b>the</b> <b>paramilitary</b> DOSAAF sport organisation for the Roza Shanina Prize, while Novodvinsk organized an open shooting sports championship in her memory. The village of Malinovka in Ustyansky District started to hold annual cross-country ski races for the Roza Shanina Prize.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1904, Piłsudski formed a {{paramilitary}} unit (the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, or bojówki) aiming to create an armed resistance movement against the Russian authorities. The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in Warsaw; on 28 October 1904, Russian Cossack cavalry attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military. Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 <b>the</b> <b>paramilitary</b> began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.|$|E
5|$|On 18 July, Casares Quiroga refused {{an offer}} of help from the CNT and UGT, proclaiming that nowhere outside Spanish Morocco had joined the rebels and that the populace should trust legal methods {{to deal with the}} uprising. Handing out weapons would be illegal. The CNT and UGT proclaimed a general strike, in effect mobilising. They opened weapons caches, some buried since the 1934 risings. <b>The</b> <b>paramilitary</b> forces, better trained than the army, often waited to see the outcome of militia action before either joining or suppressing the rebellion. Quick action by either the rebels or anarchist militias was often enough to decide the fate of a town. General Queipo de Llano managed to secure Seville for the rebels, arresting a number of other officers.|$|E
50|$|Piłsudski {{anticipated}} {{a coming}} European {{war and the}} need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish Army which could help win Polands independence from the three empires that had partitioned her out of political existence in the late 18th century.

5|$|Soegijapranata {{was unable}} to prevent Japanese torture of prisoners of war, {{including}} the clergy, but was himself well-treated by the Japanese forces; he was often invited to Japanese ceremonies, but never attended, sending bouquets in his stead. He used this position of respect to lobby for fair treatment of those interned. He successfully petitioned the Japanese overlords to exempt nuns from <b>the</b> <b>paramilitary</b> draft {{and allow them to}} work at hospitals. He and the Catholic populace also gathered food and other supplies for interned clergy, and Soegijapranata kept in contact with the prisoners, supplying and receiving news, such as recent deaths, and other information.|$|E

5|$|The siege {{continued}} on 6 July. Negotiation talks continued between the besieged Lal Masjid administration and government authorities, without resolution. Twenty-one additional students surrendered to authorities, and two students {{were killed in}} a shooting incident. The government decided to delay the assault, hoping for the safe evacuation of more students from the besieged mosque. President Pervez Musharraf issued an ultimatum on the evening of 7 July.

5|$|Survivors {{who took}} shelter in basements or cornfields, {{as well as}} a {{captured}} member of <b>the</b> <b>paramilitary</b> forces, later testified about the killings and identified the White Eagles as the perpetrators. In addition, the withdrawing paramilitaries left critical evidence behind, including personnel records, which confirmed that the force had been White Eagles associated with Šešelj. An American war crimes investigator for the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Special Agent John Cencich, corroborated the information in an interview with a high-level inside witness linking Slobodan Milošević, then president of Serbia to the killings. The ICTY charged Milošević with the deaths of 32 civilians in Voćin. Milošević was subsequently arrested and tried, but he died before his trial was completed. The ICTY also charged Šešelj with involvement in the forced deportation of non-Serb civilians from Voćin. Šešelj was ultimately acquitted of all charges.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{meetings}} with Habicht, Meyszner was appointed deputy leader of the Central Styria Sturmabteilung-Brigade, with the rank of SA-Obersturmbannführer. The Sturmabteilung (SA) was <b>the</b> <b>paramilitary</b> wing of the Nazi Party. He travelled widely, meeting Nazi leaders in Hungary and Yugoslavia. In February 1934 he was interned in the Wöllersdorf concentration camp for three-and-a-half months for Nazi activities. Following a hunger strike and half-hearted prison revolt, he was released. Soon after, the leaders of the Styrian Home Guard were arrested and Meyszner took control of the organisation. Arrested shortly after the abortive July Putsch was launched, during which Dollfuss was assassinated, Meyszner escaped police custody on 27 July and fled to Yugoslavia. Austrian authorities suspected that he had encouraged participation and provided supplies to the conspirators. His exact role in the July Putsch remains in question. The Styrian Home Guard and Styrian SA brigades played significant parts in the attempted putsch. According to the Austrian historian Hans Schafranek, Meyszner, along with Rauter and Kammerhofer, who led the Upper Styrian SA-Brigade, conspired with Habicht and the SS against the SA, effectively bypassing the leadership of the Austrian SA when they quickly supported the coup.|$|E
