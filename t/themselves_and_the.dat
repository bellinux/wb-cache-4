5|$|As part of {{the first}} {{amendment}} to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.|$|E

Now, as well as fighting a rearguard action, they had to capture positions between <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> railway line. Captain Lionel Queripel of 10 Para was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration, for his actions while in command of the battalion's rear guard.|$|E
5|$|Even {{prior to}} the cost {{increases}} which plagued the design and construction of the tram, the project has been subject to criticism from the public. Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram's route object to the tram's presence. The cost increases <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial. Some consider the project an unworthy use of public funds at any price, either {{due to a lack}} of benefit for those not associated with OHSU, or due to opposition to such projects in general.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the endomembrane system {{is linked to the}} origin of eukaryotes <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria.

The most recent concept {{suggests}} that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for the origin of the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount of novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E

5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, {{it employs}} advanced graphics {{technologies such as}} high dynamic range, global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.|$|E
5|$|However, landing paratroopers, and {{especially}} gliders, without {{the cover of}} darkness left them exceedingly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. The official history of the British Airborne Divisions highlights {{the cost of this}} trade-off, stating that of the 416 gliders that landed, only 88 remained undamaged by enemy fire, and that between 20–30percent of the glider pilots were casualties. Another historian argues that the gliders landing in daylight was a calamity, with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment having two-thirds of their gliders hit by ground fire and suffering heavy casualties as they landed. The casualty rates were worsened by the slow rates of release and descent of the gliders <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fact that each aircraft towed two gliders, slowing them even further; as the time to release a glider unit was 3–4 times longer than a parachute unit, the gliders were vulnerable to flak.|$|E
5|$|Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, {{and pain}} as {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} karma. Various types of karma are classified according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> intentions behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution. The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.|$|E

Mansell's flag captain {{came up with the}} strategy on how to tackle Spinola; he predicted that Spinola would try to sail close to the English coast. Acting on this hunch Mansell set one ship a good distance from another using flyboats so that a good communication system was erected between <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dutch fleet off the Flemish coast under acting Vice-Admiral Jan Cant. On the 3rd Mansell was soon joined by two Dutch flyboats, Samson, and the Moon to improve communication and now Spinola was effectively sailing into a trap.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November Soviet forces {{began to}} cross the Don River and {{continued}} their advance towards the town of Kalach. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, {{were not aware of}} the Soviet offensive until 21 November, and even then did not know in what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach was given to the Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle to approach it and fire on the guards. Soviet forces broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army's 4th Mechanized Corps approaching from the south. The encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps.|$|E
5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and comply with the requirements of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E

5|$|The DNOG sailed for the British {{colony of}} Sierra Leone on 31 July. Since other allied {{countries}} helped with logistics, little {{was provided by}} Brazil aside from the ships <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> men crewing them. Despite {{the threat of a}} U-boat attack, they were forced to stop several times so Belmonte could transfer necessities such as coal and water to the other ships. They reached Freetown safely on 9 August and remained in the port until 23 August when they departed for Dakar. While on this section of the voyage, Bahia, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio Grande do Norte, Belmonte and Laurindo Pita spotted an apparent torpedo heading for Belmonte, but it missed. Rio Grande do Norte then fired several shots and depth-charged what the force believed to be a U-boat. While the official Brazilian history of the ship definitively claims to have sunk a submarine, author Robert Scheina notes that this action was never confirmed, and works published about U-boat losses in the war do not agree.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{uses the}} {{standard}} setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series {{centers on a}} family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle. However, because of its animated nature, The Simpsons scope is larger {{than that of a}} regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment {{on the state of the}} environment. Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education.
