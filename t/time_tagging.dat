50|$|To deduce {{the range}} or {{velocity}} {{of a target}} relative to a multistatic system, knowledge of the spatial location of transmitters and receivers is required. A shared time and frequency standard must be also be maintained if the receiver has no direct line {{of sight of the}} transmitter. As in bistatic radar, without this knowledge there would be inaccuracy in the information reported by the radar. For systems exploiting data fusion before detection, {{there is a need for}} accurate time and or phase synchronisation of the different receivers. For plot level fusion, <b>time</b> <b>tagging</b> using a standard GPS clock (or similar) is more than sufficient.|$|E
50|$|Another {{key benefit}} to TML {{is that by}} {{bringing}} both data and metadata from multiple time-varying sources of data into a single stream in a common format, data and metadata archiving, retrieval, analysis and processing can be more easily performed across disparate hardware and software systems. The <b>time</b> <b>tagging</b> of both the data and metadata allows precise determination {{of the state of}} a system, and therefore whether its data is of interest, regardless of whether that system remains static or has elements removed, replaced or added. This permits searching for data at a finer granularity than previously possible, while still supporting higher-level data discovery if a user so desires, since the use of individual fields within a TML system description is optional.|$|E
5000|$|Defensively in baseball, left-handedness is {{considered}} an advantage for first basemen because they are better suited to fielding balls hit in the gap between first and second base, and {{because they do not}} have to pivot their body around before throwing the ball to another infielder. For the same reason, the other infielder's positions are seen as being advantageous to right-handed throwers. Historically, there have been few left-handed catchers because of the perceived disadvantage a left-handed catcher would have in making the throw to third base, especially with a right-handed hitter at the plate. A left-handed catcher would have a potentially more dangerous <b>time</b> <b>tagging</b> out a baserunner trying to score. With the ball in the glove on the right hand, a left-handed catcher would have to turn his body to the left to tag a runner. In doing so, he can lose the opportunity to brace himself for an impending collision. The lack of left-handed catchers might be due to traditions.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{original}} post-launch calibration of the FHSTs (Fixed Head Star Trackers) on EUVE (Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer) and UARS (Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite), the Flight Dynamics task {{has continued to}} analyze the FHST performance. The algorithm used for inflight alignment of spacecraft sensors is described and the equations for the errors in the relative alignment for the simple 2 star tracker case are shown. Simulated data and real data are used to compute the covariance of the relative alignment errors. Several methods for correcting the alignment are compared and results analyzed. The specific problems seen on orbit with UARS and EUVE are then discussed. UARS has experienced anomalous tracker performance on an FHST resulting in continuous variation in apparent tracker alignment. On EUVE, the FHST residuals from the attitude determination algorithm showed a dependence on the direction of roll during survey mode. This dependence is traced back to <b>time</b> <b>tagging</b> errors and {{the original}} post launch alignment {{is found to be}} in error due to the impact of the <b>time</b> <b>tagging</b> errors on the alignment algorithm.

(2013) instead of the observation data acquired by the Arase. The time resolution of a <b>time</b> <b>tag</b> in the simulation is constant because the simulation advances waves and particles in each discretized time step. The algorithm of the S-WPIA is executed by referring the <b>time</b> <b>tag.</b> With respect to the <b>time</b> <b>tag</b> of individual particles in the simulation data, we calculated and accumulated W using wave fields with corresponding timing. The calculation results generated by the onboard S-WPIA and by Katoh et al. (2013) are shown in Fig.  5. In the same manner as the simulation, particles with a pitch angle of 100 ^∘– 110 ^∘ and energy values ranging from 200 to 400 keV were used in the S-WPIA. The resolution of ζ was 15 ^∘ in the simulation, whereas the minimum resolution of ζ in the onboard S-WPIA is 30 ^∘. The results of the time variation W_int of integrated E_w·v and the ζ distribution obtained by the S-WPIA show good agreement with those from the simulation obtained by Katoh et al. (2013).
