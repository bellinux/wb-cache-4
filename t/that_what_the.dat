5|$|The Driver {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Man With No Name, a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and instead have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge of Variety opined <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>The</b> Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, mentioned in the film, which in turn evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.|$|E

25|$|Frederick III died about 11:00 on 15 June 1888. Once the Emperor's {{death was}} announced, {{his son and}} {{successor}} William II ordered the occupation of the imperial residence by soldiers. The chambers of Frederick and Victoria were carefully checked to find incriminating documents. However, the search was unsuccessful because all the couple's correspondence had been taken to Windsor Castle the previous year. Several years later, William II stated {{that the purpose of}} this research was to find state documents. Currently, however, many historians (as Hannah Pakula and Franz Herre) suggest <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Emperor wanted was to recover documents that could threaten his reputation.|$|E

25|$|Agent (substance)-causal {{accounts}} {{have been}} suggested by both George Berkeley and Thomas Reid. It is required <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> agent causes is not causally determined by prior events. It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, {{it is difficult to}} establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by luck (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind – a common problem associated with interactionalist dualism.|$|E
25|$|The European Council did {{not specify}} what forms the legal {{guarantees}} would take.

Previous examples of Decisions and/or Declarations following a referendum rejection include the 1992 Edinburgh Agreement (following the first Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty) and the 2002 Seville Declaration (following the first Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice). French President Nicolas Sarkozy, speaking to the European Parliament in his capacity as President of the European Council during the six-month presidency of that body by France, stated that the legal guarantees would be added as a protocol later to the treaty, enabling Croatia to join the European Union legally.|$|E

Finally, he argued that if this was the interpretation to be adopted, then Taw Cheng Kong [...] "suggests <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Singapore courts recognize as a customary rule of international law that has been received into the common-law could determine or condition the proper interpretation to be given to a statutory provision, or could at least be relied upon to determine the true intent of Parliament".|$|E

Her $100,000 budget for the film's costumes was supplemented by help from friends throughout the industry. Ultimately, she believes, at least $1 million worth of clothing was used in the film, {{making it one of the}} most expensively costumed movies in cinema history. The single priciest item was a $100,000 Fred Leighton necklace on Streep.|$|E
500|$|Bennett {{realized}} he faced {{a serious challenge}} in developing the new Star Trek movie, partly due to his never having seen the television show. To compensate, Bennett watched all the original episodes. This immersion convinced Bennett <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> first movie lacked was a real villain; after seeing the episode [...] "Space Seed", he decided that the character of Khan Noonien Singh was the perfect enemy for the new film. Before the script was settled upon, Bennett gathered his production staff. He selected Robert Sallin, a director of television commercials and a college friend, to produce the film. Sallin's job would be to produce Star Trek II quickly and cheaply. Bennett also hired Michael Minor as art director to shape {{the direction of the}} film.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} sequence {{within the}} episode was the time-shift which ends in Tommy returning to 1918.

Anthony Lewis described the wind machine used as [...] "the biggest wind machine I've {{ever seen in my}} life". [...] He comments that the intensity of the wind machine and the lighting enabled an [...] "instant-made reaction" [...] from himself and Mori. Goddard added that his first assistant director was [...] "instrumental in gearing up all the extras into a frenzy". The episode's soundtrack included the song [...] "One of These Mornings" [...] by Moby, which featured the vocals of Patti Labelle, from his 2002 album, 18.

500|$|Principal {{photography}} on Her {{took place}} in mid-2012, with a production budget of $23 million. It was primarily filmed in Los Angeles with an additional two weeks of filming in Shanghai. During production of the film, actress Samantha Morton performed the role of Samantha by acting on set [...] "in a four-by-four carpeted soundproof booth made of black painted plywood and soft, noise-muffling fabric". At Jonze's suggestion, she and Joaquin Phoenix avoided seeing each other on set during filming. Morton was later replaced by Scarlett Johansson. Jonze explained: [...] "It was only in post production, when we started editing, that we realized <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> character/movie needed was different from what Samantha and I had created together. So we recast and since then Scarlett has taken over that role." [...] Jonze met Johansson {{in the spring of}} 2013 and worked with her for four months. Following the recast, new scenes were shot in August 2013, which were either [...] "newly imagined" [...] or [...] "new scenes that [...] had wanted to shoot originally but didn't".|$|E
