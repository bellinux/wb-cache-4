25|$|Rather than {{populate}} the film with many characters, {{as in his}} previous films, here the story focuses on the compelling relationship at its center: the actress and her kidnapper literally struggling for power and desperate for love. The film's <b>title</b> <b>line</b> Tie Me Up! is unexpectedly uttered by the actress as a genuine request. She does not know if she will try to escape or not, and when she realizes she has feelings for her captor, she prefers not {{to be given a}} chance. In spite of some dark elements, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! can be described as a romantic comedy, and the director's most clear love story, with a plot similar to William Wyler's thriller The Collector.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{specified}} {{in some of}} the album's negative reviews, mainly its length and the repetition of the <b>title</b> <b>line.</b> [...] Writing for Rolling Stone, Matt Birkbeck referred to the songs, naming [...] "Objects", as [...] "harmless, low-octane operatic drivel" [...] with [...] "insufferably long Steinman compositions with equally long names." [...] The Fort Worth Star-Telegram also referred to the length of the songs on the album, in which Steinman [...] "vomits up 75 minutes of endlessly repeated choruses." ...|$|E

'Told myself that you were right for me but felt so lonely in your company' – simple, pure, and devastating. None more than the <b>title</b> <b>line</b> when it speaks of the end of love with prosaic brutality: 'Now you're just somebody that I used to know.' Great video, powerful lyrics, and a stunning voice. Oh, and Kimbra... my poor heart..." ...|$|E
500|$|The musical {{structuring}} of [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] {{uses the}} AABA form, {{in which the}} song's title serves as {{the main source of}} needed repetition. When used to the maximum, this structuring, also known as the thirty-two-bar form, has the title repeat itself in the same place, in {{at least two of the}} three A verses. Author Sheila Davis' book, The Craft of Lyric Writing, notes that [...] "the repeated <b>title</b> <b>line</b> simultaneously outlines the framework of the design and drives home the main point of the lyric". Jackson's [...] "She's Out of My Life" [...] also uses this musical structuring, as does [...] "Body and Soul", [...] "Oh, Lady Be Good!" [...] and [...] "Try a Little Tenderness". The musical chords in [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] are seen in several songs written by Jackson. [...] "That's What You Get for Being Polite", from The Jacksons' Destiny album, and two unreleased songs ("Why Can't I Be" [...] and [...] "Thank You for Life") used the chords before [...] "The Girl Is Mine".|$|E

2500|$|The <b>title</b> <b>line</b> is {{an example}} of a {{negative}} concord. Jagger sings the verses in a tone hovering between cynical commentary and frustrated protest, and then leaps half singing and half yelling into the chorus, where the guitar riff reappears. The lyrics outline the singer's irritation with the increasing commercialism of the modern world, where the radio broadcasts [...] "useless information" [...] and a man on television tells him [...] "how white my shirts can be – but he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me." [...] Jagger also describes the stress of being a celebrity, and the tensions of touring. The reference in the verse to not getting any [...] "girl reaction" [...] was fairly controversial in its day, interpreted by some listeners (and radio programmers) as meaning a girl willing to have sex. Jagger commented that they [...] "didn't understand the dirtiest line", as afterwards the girl asks him to return the following week as she is [...] "on a losing streak," [...] an apparent reference to menstruation. The song closes with a fairly subdued repetition of the song's title, followed suddenly by a full shout of the line, with the final words repeated into the fade-out.|$|E
