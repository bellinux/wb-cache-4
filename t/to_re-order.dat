25|$|Magee {{involved}} {{himself in}} a dispute with the Friends of St Colman's Cathedral, a local conservationist group in Cobh which organised an effective and professional opposition to the Bishop's plans <b>to</b> <b>re-order</b> the interior of Cobh Cathedral, plans similar to previous re-orderings in Killarney, Cork and Limerick cathedrals. In an oral hearing conducted by An Bord Pleanála, the Irish Planning Board, it emerged that irregularities had occurred in the planning application that were traced to Cobh Town Council which accommodated the Bishop's plans to modify the Victorian interior designed by E W Pugin and George Ashlin. On 2 June 2006, when Bishop Magee was in Lourdes, An Bord Pleanála directed Cobh Town Council to refuse the Bishop's application.|$|E
500|$|Cutts ordered Brigadier-General Archibald Rowe's brigade to attack. The English {{infantry}} {{rose from}} the edge of the Nebel, and silently marched towards Blenheim, a distance of some [...] John Ferguson's Scottish brigade supported Rowe's left, and moved in perfect order towards the barricades between the village and the river, defended by Hautefeuille's dragoons. As the range closed to within , the French fired a deadly volley. Rowe had ordered that there should be no firing from his men until he struck his sword upon the palisades, but as he stepped forward to give the signal, he fell mortally wounded. The survivors of the leading companies closed up the gaps in their torn ranks and rushed forward. Small parties penetrated the defences, but repeated French volleys forced the English back towards the Nebel, sustaining heavy casualties. As the attack faltered, eight squadrons of elite Gens d'Armes, commanded by the veteran Swiss officer, Beat-Jacques von Zurlauben, fell upon the English troops, cutting at the exposed flank of Rowe's own regiment. However, Wilkes' Hessian brigade, lying nearby in the marshy grass at the water's edge, stood firm and repulsed the Gens d'Armes with steady fire, enabling the English and Hessians <b>to</b> <b>re-order</b> and launch another attack.|$|E
500|$|Einstein's {{scientific}} publications {{are listed}} below in four tables: journal articles, book chapters, books and authorized translations. [...] Each publication is {{indexed in the}} first column by its number in the Schilpp bibliography (Albert Einstein: Philosopher–Scientist, pp.694–730) and by its article number in Einstein's Collected Papers. [...] Complete references for these two bibliographies may be found below in the Bibliography section. [...] The Schilpp numbers are used for cross-referencing in the Notes (the final column of each table), since they cover a greater time period of Einstein's life at present. [...] The English translations of titles are generally taken from the published volumes of the Collected Papers. [...] For some publications, however, such official translations are not available; unofficial translations are indicated with a § superscript. Although the tables are presented in chronological order by default, each table can be re-arranged in alphabetical order for any column by the reader clicking on the arrows {{at the top of}} that column. [...] For illustration, <b>to</b> <b>re-order</b> a table by subject—e.g., to group together articles that pertain to [...] "General relativity" [...] or [...] "Specific heats"—one need only click on the arrows in the [...] "Classification and Notes" [...] columns. [...] To print out the re-sorted table, one may print it directly by using the web-browser Print option; the [...] "Printable version" [...] link at the left gives only the default sorting. [...] Collaborative works by Einstein are highlighted in lavender, with the co-author(s) provided in the final column of the table.|$|E

2500|$|Damasus had {{instructed}} Jerome {{to be conservative}} in his revision of the Old Latin Gospels, {{and it is possible}} to see Jerome's obedience to this injunction in the preservation in the Vulgate of variant Latin vocabulary for the same Greek terms. Hence, [...] "high priest" [...] is rendered [...] in Vulgate Matthew; as [...] in Vulgate Mark; and as [...] in Vulgate John. Comparison of Jerome's Gospel texts with those in Old Latin witnesses, suggests that his revision was substantially concerned with redacting the expanded phraseology characteristic of the Western text-type, in accordance with early Byzantine and Alexandrian witnesses. [...] One major change introduced by Jerome was <b>to</b> <b>re-order</b> the Latin Gospels. Old Latin gospel books generally followed the [...] "Western Order" [...] – Matthew, John, Luke, Mark; where Jerome adopted the [...] "Greek Order" [...] – Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. [...] It appears that he followed this order in his programme of work; as his revisions become progressively less frequent and less consistent in the gospels presumably done later. [...] In places Jerome adopted readings that did not correspond to a straightforward rendering either of the Old Latin or the Greek text, so reflecting a particular doctrinal interpretation; as in his rewording panem nostrum supersubstantialem at [...]|$|E

Due to Cannon's work, most of the then-existing classes of stars were thrown out as redundant. Afterward, astronomy was left with the seven primary classes recognized today, in order: O, B, A, F, G, K, M; that has since been extended.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The camphor-grown {{pristine}} carbon nanotubes (CNT) was annealed by a single-stage {{thermal annealing}} system through controlled ambient in air, argon and nitrogen, are reported. Field emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} images confirmed that the heat treatment process gives a place <b>to</b> <b>re-ordering</b> carbon nanostructures which involves: (i) an elimination of structural defects and (ii) better graphitization of the amorphous carbon phase without damaging CNT structure. The room temperature micro-Raman measurements showed that no significant changes on the D and G-line position. However, different annealing gas ambient could give different values degree of graphitization (ID/IG ratio) {{due to the nature}} of gas itself.
