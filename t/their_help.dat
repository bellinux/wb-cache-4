5|$|The game {{begins in}} 1911, where former outlaw John Marston (Rob Wiethoff) {{is taken from}} his family by the Bureau of Investigation, and will only be granted amnesty when he brings the {{remaining}} members of his old gang to justice. Marston sets off to track down Bill Williamson (Steve J. Palmer), who now runs his own gang. Marston confronts Williamson at his stronghold, Fort Mercer, only to be shot and left for dead. Local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane (Kimberly Irion) finds him critically wounded and takes him to her ranch for recovery. Several days later, Marston begins repaying the MacFarlanes for <b>their</b> <b>help</b> {{in the form of}} odd-jobs around the ranch. During this time he works with U.S. Marshal Leigh Johnson (Anthony De Longis) and his deputies, con artist Nigel West Dickens (Don Creech), treasure hunter and grave robber Seth Briars (Kevin Glikmann), and an unreliable alcoholic arms dealer known only as Irish (K. Harrison Sweeney). Marston performs various tasks and favours in exchange for <b>their</b> <b>help</b> with organizing an attack on Fort Mercer. Marston and his group then breach the fort and defeat Williamson's gang only to find that Williamson had fled to Mexico to seek help from Javier Escuella (Antonio Jaramillo), another member of Marston's former gang.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{considered}} affect-related variables {{as predictors of}} the quality of helping relationships between older mothers and their adult daughters. Specifically, self-reported and observed emotional responses to the dyadic discussion of a disagreement between mothers and daughters, as well as baseline measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia were considered as predictors of mothers' and daughters' satisfaction with <b>their</b> <b>helping</b> relationships. Relationship satisfaction was measured by considering mothers' and daughters' subjective well-being specifically in regards to the help they gave and received. Overall, these variables predicted more variance in mothers' satisfaction with <b>their</b> <b>helping</b> relationships than daughters', and RSA (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) was a stronger predictor than the self-reported or observed emotional reactions to the dyadic discussion of a disagreement. Implications of these findings and limitations to the current study are discussed...|$|R

5|$|After {{returning}} to Kathmandu, in complicity with Rana Bahadur, Bhimsen indulged in appropriating the palaces and properties of deposed members of Shah family, which he shared {{between himself and}} his supporter Rangnath Paudel.

They were also wary of Bhimsen's growing power.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his own developers, Schafer reached out to players who had created unofficial patches and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in ResidualVM, and gained <b>their</b> <b>help</b> to improve the game's assets for the remastered version. One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the game's movement controls from the tank-style controls to a point and click-style interface. Schafer noted they created the game with tank-style control as it was popular with other games like Resident Evil at the time, but recognized it did not work well within the adventure game genre. Schafer contacted Tobias Pfaff who created the point-and-click modification to obtain access to his code to incorporate into the remastered version.|$|E
