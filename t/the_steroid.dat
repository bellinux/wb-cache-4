5|$|When a T-cell {{encounters}} a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor. This {{is essentially a}} signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D, <b>the</b> <b>steroid</b> hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to <b>the</b> <b>steroid</b> hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into <b>the</b> <b>steroid</b> hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators.

Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E

5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom {{is low in}} fat and digestible carbohydrates, and high in protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including <b>the</b> <b>steroid</b> derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E

40|$|Normal, {{hyperplastic}} and adenocarcinomatous human {{prostatic tissue}} was perfused in vitro with radioactively labelled androstenedione, testosterone and 5 α-dihydrotestosterone {{with and without}} added oestradiol- 17 β. Various parameters of tissue–steroid relationship were measured at the steady state. When oestradiol (0. 11 or 0. 22 μmol/l) {{was added to the}} perfusing medium, the entry of <b>the</b> <b>steroids</b> into <b>the</b> tissue and their metabolism was increased in the majority of the glands studied. The `uptake' of all <b>the</b> <b>steroids</b> varied, in response to the addition of oestradiol, in both normal and adenocarcinomatous glands in a way differing from the response of hyperplastic glands.

5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds.

As <b>the</b> <b>steroid</b> controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} has emerged showing that lipid signaling {{is a vital}} part of the cell signaling. Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein-coupled or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization, cell growth, and apoptosis; diacylglycerol (DAG) and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), involved in calcium-mediated activation of protein kinase C; the prostaglandins, which are one type of fatty-acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity; <b>the</b> <b>steroid</b> hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction, metabolism and blood pressure; and the oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists. Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or pieces of cells. They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases, which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids. After this occurs, other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells or cell fragments exposing them.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Effects of {{preoperative}} steroids on {{morbidity and}} mortality after transsternal thymectomy are analyzed. Methods: There were 620 transsternal thymectomies for myasthenia gravis performed in the period 1973 – 2002. There were 547 patients with nonthymomatous myasthenia, including 17 patients submitted to repeated thymectomy (rethymectomy) and 46 patients with thymoma. There were 522 upper median sternotomies performed in the period 1973 – 1997 and 98 complete median sternotomies performed in the period 1998 – 2002 (74 patients without thymoma, 7 thymomas and 17 rethymectomies). One hundred and seventeen of these 620 patients were taking <b>steroids</b> preoperatively. <b>The</b> impact of <b>steroids</b> use on postoperative respiratory insufficiency (ventilator), need for tracheostomy, superficial wound dehiscence, superficial wound suppuration, sternal dehiscence and mortality was analyzed. Results: The rate of {{morbidity and mortality}} in <b>the</b> <b>steroids</b> and <b>the</b> no-steroids groups included respiratory insufficiency necessitating the use of a ventilator in 46 / 503 patients from the no-steroids group (9. 1 %) and 8 / 117 patients from <b>the</b> <b>steroids</b> group (6. 8 %; P 0 : 4260), need for tracheostomy in 14 / 503 patients from the no-steroids group (2. 8 %) and 3 / 117 patients from <b>the</b> <b>steroids</b> group (2. 6 %; P 0 : 9054).
