From what you say {{about the state of the}} house, I {{conclude}} that your health suffers from that cause precisely; and that when you are warmly and dryly walled in, you will be less liable to these attacks, grievous to your friends as to you. Oh, I don't praise anybody, I assure you, for wishing to entice you to live near them. We come over the Alps for a sunny climate; what should we not do for a moral atmosphere like yours? I dare say you have chosen excellently your new residence, and I hope you will get over the fuss of it with great courage, remembering the advantages which it is likely to secure to you. Tell me as much as you can about it all, that I may shift the scene in the right grooves, and be able to imagine you to myself out of Three Mile Cross. You have the local feeling so eminently that I have long been resolved on never asking you to migrate. Doves won't travel with swallows; who should persuade them? This is no migration--only a shifting from one branch to another. With Reading on one side of you still, you will lose nothing, neither sight nor friend. Oh, do write to me as soon as you can, and say that the deepening summer has done you good and given you strength; say it, if possible. I shall be very anxious for the next letter.... My only objection to Florence is the distance from London, and the expense of the journey.

5000|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Student Volunteer Movement during this period provide vivid illustration of the general trends in American Protestantism.

5000|$|Rabbi Avraham al-Naddaf’s view is {{corroborated by}} an ancient Jewish source {{contemporaneous}} with Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah before his momentous work reached Yemen, in which Jewish scholars in Yemen had debated {{on how to}} arrange the second blessing after the Shema during the Evening Prayer. The source was copied down by Yiḥyah Salaḥ from the glosses of the Baladi-rite Prayer Book (Tiklāl) written by Rabbi Yihye Bashiri (d. 1661), and who, in turn, copied it {{from the work of}} a Yemenite Jewish scholar, entitled Epistle: Garden of Flowers (...) , in which he wrote the following: Now what you have mentioned <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> great geon, even our teacher and our Rabbi, Moses Maimonides (may his God keep him), how that by his magnanimity enjoins us to say, Borukh shomer 'amo yisroel (Blessed be He who guards His people Israel ברוך שומר עמו ישראל), it is most correct what has been transmitted unto him. Who is it that knows to do such a thing, save that man whom the spirit of the holy God is within him? For the Rabbis have spoken of only two blessings coming after it (i.e. after Qiryath Shema), but not three! Now, as for us, concerning our composition of the order of prayers, and its arrangement and its custom which was written in the language of our Sages and used by some of the students, we have asked this question during our debates on the aforesaid composition, and we were indecisive about it due to its ambiguity, but we arranged the verses after Hashkiveinu (...) {{in such a way that}} they do not conclude after them with a blessing employing God's name, and forthwith will we stand up in prayer. After your letter reached us, teaching us about its proper application, we returned to its proper application! We succeeded in our composition to write the verses in such a way as to be identical with that which was written by him! Even so, his words seem to be even more exact than our own, proof of which is shown by what is written in Tractate Berakhoth: Mar says he reads verses of Qiryath Shema and prays. This supports what was said by Rabbi Yohanan, ‘Who is he that is a son of the world to come? He who juxtaposes the word, Geulah, in the Evening Prayer with the actual Amidah itself!’ Moreover, they have said: Although one must say Hashkiveinu (Cause us to lie down in peace, etc.) between Geulah and the standing prayer itself, this does not constitute a break in continuity. [...] For since the Rabbis enacted the saying of Hashkiveinu (Cause us to lie down in peace, etc.) in that part of the benediction which comes directly after Geulah, it is as if the benediction of Geulah was protracted! Now had it been like our words, he should have rather said: Although the Rabbis enacted Hashkiveinu and certain verses which come after it, etc. But since he did not say this, except only Haskiveinu, learn from it that at the end he concludes a blessing employing God's name! Now this blessing is as one continuous thing, and not two things. Based on this testimony it is evident that the Talmud, along with Maimonides’ order of the prayer as transcribed in his Mishneh Torah, have been used together to establish the final textual form of the Baladi-rite prayer commonly used in Yemen. Prior to Maimonides, the general trend in Yemen was also to follow the halakhic rulings of the geonim, including their format used in the blessings. Rabbi Saʻīd ibn Daoud al-ʻAdeni, in a commentary which he wrote on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah (ca. 1420 - 1482), writes of the final blessing said over wine: [...] "What is found in the writings of most of the geonim is to conclude the blessing after drinking the fruit of the vine by saying, art Thou, O Lord, for the vine and the fruit of the vine,' and thus is it found written in the majority of the prayer books in the cities throughout Yemen." [...] However, today, in all the Baladi-rite prayer books, the custom after drinking wine is to conclude the blessing with the format that is brought down in Maimonides, [...] "Blessed art Thou, O Lord, for the land and for its fruits", showing that Maimonides' impact over the development of the Yemenite Siddur has been vital.|$|E
