40|$|The {{status of}} {{selenium}} supplementation of 123 mares and 87 foals during pregnancy, lactation and rearing was investigated at four Thoroughbred breeding farms in different {{regions in the}} southwest of Germany. Feed, blood plasma and whole blood was analysed for selenium content. The plasma glutathione peroxidase activity was determined. General health and reproductive performance data of the mares and foals were recorded by questionnaires. At one farm the selenium status of thirteen pregnant mares and foals was investigated {{over a period of}} ten months. The selenium supply of the four herds showed differences from marginal (0, 09 ppm) to adequate (0, 25 ppm). The mean value of plasma selenium concentration in the different fedlots related to selenium intake. However, within the herds with equal selenium intake, the plasma selenium concentration showed great individual differences. The plasma selenium concentration of unweaned foals up to four months of age was significant lower than the one of their mares. The ratio between plasma selenium concentration of mare and foal was roughly 2 : 1. No significant difference was found between the plasma selenium concentration of sound mares and foals compared to sick horses and those with reproductive disorders. The follow-up studies revealed a decrease of plasma selenium concentration in mares that were in an advanced state of pregnancy (week 40 - 48). The suckling foals plasma selenium concentration showed little changes. After weaning the plasma selenium concentration increased significantly. Selenium concentration in plasma and whole blood correlated closely, the ratio of the two being roughly 1, 4 : 1. Both methods of analysis are equally sufficient to determine the selenium status of Thoroughbred mares and foals. However, the plasma selenium concentration does not yield reliable information on the selenium status of other tissues. As selenium is harvested partly in Erythrocytes, and changes in selenium intake will cause delayed alterations in whole blood selenium concentration (mean RBC life span 120 days), this has to be kept in mind, if whole blood is used to estimate the selenium status of horses. There was no significant relation between glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma and plasma selenium concentration. Glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma is no reliable parameter for information of selenium supply. Because of the great variability of plasma selenium concentration within the herds it is advisable <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> from different animals to ascertain the selenium status of the herd...|$|E
40|$|Rationale : In {{previous}} research, {{we found}} that flattened diurnal cortisol predicted early mortality with breast cancer, independent of other known risk factors, and this has since been confirmed among patients with lung cancer. In that study, loss of diurnal variation in cortisol was associated with self-reported awakenings during the night, implying an interaction with sleep disruption. This suggested that objective measures of sleep would clarify the relationship between disruption of circadian cortisol rhythms and sleep disturbance. Methods : Here we recruited 101 women with metastatic breast cancer and 16 age- and socioeconomic status-matched controls. We measured sleep using full electroencephalographic (EEG), electro-oculographic, and electromyographic recordings in the clinical research center, where we were also able <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> throughout the night using a long IV line {{through a hole in}} the wall. Sleep measures were confirmed with two nights of home EEG recordings and 2 weeks of actigraphy. Results : Among 63 for whom complete cortisol and sleep data are now available, we observed a phase shift in the relationship between the peak of cortisol and wake time such that patients woke earlier than their cortisol peak. Controls woke on average 1 h 20 min before the cortisol peak, whereas patients woke 1 h 54 min before. This control&#x 2013;patient difference was not statistically significant. However, among all subjects, there was a significant. 38 correlation between diurnal cortisol slope and time from waking to the cortisol peak, such that those who woke earlier in relation to the cortisol peak had flatter cortisol slopes. Among the patients alone, the correlation was. 43. This suggests that flattening of diurnal cortisol is associated with early morning waking. In the sample of 101, we found a relationship between misalignment of preferred and actual bedtimes and disease-free interval (DFI), the time from initial breast cancer diagnosis to date of metastasis. Shorter DFI is a strong predictor of reduced survival time. Going to bed earlier or later than preferred bedtime was associated with shorter DFIs, compared with aligned bedtime (HR&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 3. 25, 95 %CI&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 1. 17 &#x 2013; 8. 98, p=. 023, and HR&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 3. 55, 95 %CI&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 1. 33 &#x 2013; 9. 45, p=. 011, respectively). Mean DFI was 92. 1 months (preferred), 39. 8 months (earlier than preferred), and 54. 1 months (later than preferred; Log Rank p=. 002). Conclusions : Thus waking ahead of the normal morning cortisol peak was related to flatter diurnal cortisol, and misalignment of preferred and actual sleep times was also associated with poor prognosis...|$|E

30|$|Overall, pharmacists {{reported}} greatest self-confidence in {{the domains}} of therapeutic drug monitoring, followed by dosing advice and least confident to providing advice on intravenous administration of vancomycin and managing infusion related reactions.

Trained field workers interviewed subjects to obtain demographic, dietary and life-style data, <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> fasting <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> {{for the analysis of}} plasma lipids, and to take anthropometric measurements. Nutrient intake was assessed using a validated quantified food frequency questionnaire. Blood pressure was measured according to the guidelines of the American Heart Association.

Dietary fat intake comprised 32. 4 % of total energy intake, which is in line with the prudent dietary guidelines. The inadequate fibre intake (mean = 17 (8) g/day) was attributed to the low consumption of fruit and vegetables.

40|$|There is {{a strong}} trend in {{fabricating}} miniaturized total analytical systems, µTAS, for various biochemical and cell biology applications. These miniaturized systems could e. g. gain better separation performances, be faster, consume less expensive reagents and be used for studies {{that are difficult to}} access in the macro world. Disposable µTAS eliminate the risk of carry-over and can be fabricated to a low cost. This work focused on the development of µTAS modules with the intentional use for miniaturized diagnostics. Modules for blood separation, desalting, enrichment, separation and ESI-MS detection were successfully fabricated. Surface coatings were additionally developed and evaluated for applications in µTAS with complex biological samples. The first heparin coating could be easily immobilized in a one-step-process, whereas the second heparin coating was aimed to form a hydrophilic surface that was able <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>blood</b> or plasma <b>samples</b> into a microfluidic system by capillary forces.

30|$|Several {{investigators}} have proposed flow-through <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> detectors. Advantages of continuously measuring blood radioactivity are much shorter sampling times, higher statistical accuracy and reduced manual labour, and moreover reduction of radiation dose <b>to</b> the technologist <b>drawing</b> <b>blood</b> <b>samples.</b> A <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> flow-through detector {{can rely on}} detection of emitted positrons or single and/or coincidence detection of annihilation photons from blood in the catheter lumen. The advantage of photon detection is that sensitivity does neither depend on positron energy nor on tubing and detector casing so that even a low positron energy emitter such as 18 F can be measured. Hutchins et al. [10] and Kanno et al. [11] used flow-through plastic scintillators to detect positrons. Both found the necessity to shield the detector from high levels of background radiation from the patient. Other authors have described systems based on detection of one or both annihilation photons, at cost of a higher sensitivity to background radioactivity. Nelson et al. [12] reported on a sodium iodide (NaI)-based detector whereas Ranicar et al. [13] and Eriksson et al. [14, 15] reported on bismuth germanate (BGO)-based detectors applicable to human PET studies. In the later publication, a well-shaped scintillator geometry was used that allowed counting both 511 - and 1, 022 -keV summation peaks. A pico-count flow-through detector where no dispersion correction is needed was described by Votaw and Shulman [16] and is operating in coincidence detection mode of the two 511 -keV gamma-ray photons with BGO detectors. At about the same time, a BGO/photomultiplier tube (PMT) system consisting of four detector units assembled in a whirlpool shape for rabbit PET studies was proposed by Tadokoro et al. [17]. Because of the large field of view (FOV) of 20  mm Ø × 30  mm, a half-looped extension tube was used for <b>blood</b> <b>sampling.</b> One of the first applications of a flow-through system in preclinical studies was demonstrated by Ingvar et al. [18]. Here, an automatic <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> system developed for human studies [14] was used for a rat study operating via a femoral arterio-venous shunt. Recently, a phoswich detector based on the gadolinium oxyorthosilicate (GSO) scintillator with different decay times has been proposed by Yamamoto et al. [19], where the front layer detects positrons and background gamma-ray photons, whereas the back layer detects background gamma-ray photons only.|$|R

40|$|Down {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{the most}} common chromosomal abnormality, with an incidence of approximately 1 per 500 to 800 live births. The first-trimester combined test is mostly used for the prenatal prediction of carrying a child with DS. The test is composed of the maternal serum parameters pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and the free beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (f?-hCG), and an ultrasound measurement of the foetal nuchal translucency (NT), combined with maternal age. The detection rate (DR) of DS screening in the Netherlands is currently 70 - 75 %, which is rather low as compared to other countries. The aim of this research was to investigate ways to improve the performance of the current DS screening programme. The extra chromosome in DS not only leads to anomalies of the foetus, but also of the placenta. The inability of placental cells to develop properly is associated with a decrease of trophoblastic products. If this differential expression is traceable in maternal blood these products could have potential as new screening markers. Several markers have been investigated and found to be potentially useful as predictors of DS. One of those markers is placental protein 13 (PP 13) which was found to be decreased in DS pregnancies. Moreover, serum concentrations of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 12 (ADAM 12) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are decreased, while total hCG (thCG) is increased in first-trimester DS pregnancies. However, the addition of these markers to the current first-trimester combined test only slightly increases the DR. Therefore, a dedicated search for more markers was set up. An extensive review of the literature was carried out to study normal placental development and function during early pregnancy. Furthermore, a bioinformatics approach was developed using data from the literature on genes and protein expression. This way, a list of potential DS screening markers was generated. The list included three biomarkers that are already used for DS screening and several others, among which PP 13 and PlGF. A more experimental approach was carried out by analyzing 90 different proteins from a pre-existing immunoassay. By comparing the protein concentrations in a small cohort of DS and control sera, seven potential screening markers were identified. To confirm the predictive value of these seven markers a subsequent validation study was carried out. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EN-RAGE were confirmed to be potential screening markers for DS and improved the DR of the current first-trimester combined test with approximately 6 %. In addition, Cancer Antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9), was found to be strongly predictive for DS and even further increased the DR. It turned out that the predictive power of serum markers differs within the first trimester. Therefore, it would be useful <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> two separate <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> and analyze several markers to increase the DR of first-trimester screening to almost 90 %. If such a screening test is to be developed, simultaneous assessment of markers is crucial and demands innovation of the test, i. e. by using Antibody microarrays...|$|R
