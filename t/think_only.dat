5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We <b>think</b> <b>only</b> of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E

You can <b>think</b> <b>only</b> about the mathematics. Everything else is human weakness. Accepting prizes is showing weakness.” The article is accompanied by a full page cartoon that has garnered controversy, discussed below.|$|E

25|$|Ships of the Mediterranean Fleet {{operating}} from Alexandria began making heavy radio {{traffic in the}} hope of diverting Luftwaffe attention to possible preparations for a major operation in the eastern Mediterranean. On 24 September Admiral Somerville shifted his flag from Nelson to Rodney and Nelson sailed west into the Atlantic at 18:15 escorted by Garland, Piorun and Isaac Sweers to give the impression the strength of Force H was being reduced. Nelson turned back after dusk to join the merchant ships from convoy WS 11X, now redesignated convoy GM 2 as the second convoy from Gibraltar to Malta. Force H separated from the merchant ships {{in the early hours of}} 25 September so Axis aerial reconnaissance might <b>think</b> <b>only</b> Force H was at sea. Fulmars from Ark Royal provided air cover over the convoy.|$|E
25|$|In a dark, private lair in a tower {{high above}} the park, the Phantom (now {{revealed}} as Phantasma's owner and mastermind) interacts with an automaton that resembles Christine ("The Aerie"). In spite of the years that have passed and his many successes, the Phantom still longs {{to be reunited with}} her ("Til I Hear You Sing"). Meg intrudes and presses the Phantom for feedback on her performance, but he is distracted by his thoughts of Christine and dismisses Meg as an annoyance. Madame Giry is irritated that the Phantom still seems to <b>think</b> <b>only</b> of Christine after all that she and Meg have done for him over the years. Giry recounts how she and Meg helped smuggle him out of Paris and to a ship departing from Calais, on which they escaped to America. Ignoring her, the Phantom summons Miss Fleck, who appears with two other freak show performers, Dr. Gangle and Mr. Squelch. The Phantom has them dispatch a letter to Christine, inviting her to come and perform at Phantasma ("Giry confronts The Phantom/Til' I Hear You Sing (Reprise)").|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga the Grammy {{performance}} {{was inspired by}} many things, including Gregorian music, Alvin Ailey dance moves and Martha Graham's dance energy. On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to [...] "whip my hair {{back and forth on}} stage," [...] referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice. The idea occurred to her when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos. She had thought to herself, [...] "Gosh, the thing I hate most about doing award shows is, it can be [...] distracting... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage. I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just <b>think</b> <b>only</b> about my performance, <b>think</b> <b>only</b> about the album, <b>think</b> <b>only</b> about the future of my fans. So that's what I did." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the {{performance was}} [...] "surprisingly" [...] sparse compared to Gaga's previous [...] "over-the-top" [...] endeavors. Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the [...] "highly expected" [...] performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography. Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as [...] "spirited", and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards. Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was {{one of the highlights of}} the show. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that [...] "It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga's performance of her new single 'Born This Way' was the evening's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle." ...|$|E

500|$|Brand {{was never}} able to put behind him the idea that he might have saved a million lives. In 1961 Life {{magazine}} called him [...] "a man who lives in the shadows with a broken heart". He died of a heart attack, aged 58, during a visit to Germany in July 1964, telling an interviewer shortly before his death: [...] "An accident of life placed the fate of one million human beings on my shoulders.

[...] It was written by Minaj, Daniel James, Leah Haywood, Ross Golan and Rotem. Rotem and Dreamlab produced the track, with vocal production handled by Nicholas Cooper. Ariel Chobaz & Gelly Kusuma recorded and mixed [...] "Marilyn Monroe" [...] with assistance from Jon Sher at Conway Studios and Beluga Heights Studio, both studios in Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Many energy markets, institutions, and {{policies}} {{have been developed to}} support the production and use of fossil fuels. Newer and cleaner technologies may offer social and environmental benefits, but utility operators often reject renewable resources because they are trained to <b>think</b> <b>only</b> in terms of big, conventional power plants. Consumers often ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption. Intentional market distortions (such as subsidies), and unintentional market distortions (such as split incentives) may work against renewables. Benjamin K. Sovacool has argued that [...] "some of the most surreptitious, yet powerful, impediments facing renewable energy and energy efficiency in the United States are more about culture and institutions than engineering and science".|$|E
500|$|The song {{deals with}} a feminist theme of the war of the sexes. It is a [...] "feminist plea about women's place in history" [...] with the title {{referring}} to the [...] "cowardice of men". In the song, Farmer [...] "reverses the roles", and [...] "presents women as warriors". In the first couplet, she evokes [...] "the {{role of women in}} History", recalling that [...] "all the great men had on their side a woman to support, assist and advise them". However, the singer said that [...] "all this was done to the detriment of women and cites as example, Mary, Jesus Christ's mother, a symbol of martyrdom and self-sacrifice". She denounces [...] "the hypocrisy and the chatter of men who <b>think</b> <b>only</b> about power and sex". In the refrain, she advises women to rebel by taking up arms.|$|E

500|$|Geisel gave two conflicting, partly fictionalized {{accounts}} of the book's creation in two articles, [...] "How Orlo Got His Book" [...] in The New York Times Book Review and [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language" [...] in the Chicago Tribune, both published on November 17, 1957. In [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", he wrote about his proposal to a [...] "distinguished schoolbook publisher" [...] {{to write a book}} for young children about [...] "scaling the peaks of Everest at 60 degrees below". The publisher was intrigued but informed him that, because of the word list, [...] "you can't use the word scaling. You can't use the word peaks. You can't use Everest. You can't use 60. You can't use degrees. You can't..." [...] Geisel gave a similar account to Robert Cahn for an article in the July 6, 1957, edition of The Saturday Evening Post. In [...] "My Hassle With the First Grade Language", he also told a story of the [...] "three excruciatingly painful weeks" [...] in which he worked on a story about a King Cat and a Queen Cat. However, [...] "queen" [...] was not on the word list, nor did his first grade nephew, Norval, recognize it. So Geisel returned to the work but could then <b>think</b> <b>only</b> of words that started with the letter [...] "q", which did not appear in any word on the list. He then had a similar fascination with the letter [...] "z", which also did not appear in any word on the list. When he did finally finish the book and showed it to his nephew, Norval had already graduated from the first grade and was learning calculus. Philip Nel notes, in his dissection of the article, that Norval was Geisel's invention. Geisel's niece, Peggy Owens, did have a son, but he was only a one-year-old when the article was published.|$|E

This unit fought under Micuta {{for the remainder of the}} uprising, according to Micuta [...] " [...] like mad... I <b>think</b> <b>only</b> three of them survived." ...|$|E

2500|$|Execution {{by hanging}} and burning {{was set for}} Wednesday 26 October. At nine o‘clock, Gilles and his two accomplices made their way in {{procession}} {{to the place of}} execution on the Ile de Biesse. Gilles is said to have addressed the crowd with contrite piety and exhorted Henriet and Poitou to die bravely and <b>think</b> <b>only</b> of salvation. Gilles' request {{to be the first to}} die had been granted the day before. At eleven o'clock, the brush at the platform was set afire and Rais was hanged. His body was cut down before being consumed by the flames and claimed by [...] "four ladies of high rank" [...] for burial. Henriet and Poitou were executed in similar fashion but their bodies were reduced to ashes in the flames and then scattered.|$|E
2500|$|The Chicago Sun-Times’ Roger Ebert {{responded to}} these criticisms by saying: Terrence Malick's [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] has been praised for its painterly images and evocative score, but criticized for its muted emotions: Although passions erupt in a deadly love triangle, all the {{feelings}} are somehow held at arm's length. This observation is true enough, if you <b>think</b> <b>only</b> about {{the actions of}} the adults in the story. But watching this 1978 film again recently, I was struck more than ever with the conviction that {{this is the story of}} a teenage girl, told by her, and its subject is the way that hope and cheer have been beaten down in her heart. We do not feel the full passion of the adults because it is not her passion: It is seen at a distance, as a phenomenon, like the weather, or the plague of grasshoppers that signals the beginning of the end.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{takes place}} [...] "in ages past, when the pantheon was still home to countless gods from all empires." [...] However, it {{is a time}} when the gods have lost their purpose; Jupiter is {{interested}} only in eating and drinking; Horus thinks of nothing except his pyramids; and Ch'ih-yu simply wants to eat livestock. The story begins with HE, the [...] "Unknown God", and creator of all gods, summoning the lesser gods to HIM, and telling them [...] "for eons, you <b>think</b> <b>only</b> of pleasure, and now even the lowliest men say, [...] "these drunks don't do anything for us. Let's go over their heads to the boss"." [...] HE is afraid this will lead to monotheism, which HE wants to avoid, as HE has neither the time nor inclination to govern all of humanity himself. As a result, HE commands each of them [...] "to pick one who is the best of your people," [...] and have him lead a war against the other two peoples. The two gods whose people lose will be punished by repainting the universe white. Jupiter picks Septimus Marius, a sea merchant; Horus picks Ramadamses, a sculptor; and Ch'ih-yu picks Tsu-Tang, a rice farmer.|$|E
