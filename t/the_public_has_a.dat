25|$|A similar {{breakdown}} {{is employed}} in environmental analysis of total economic value. Both {{costs and benefits}} can be diverse. Financial costs tend to be most thoroughly represented in cost-benefit analyses due to relatively abundant market data.

The guiding principle of evaluating benefits is to list all (categories of) parties affected by an intervention and add the (positive or negative) value, usually monetary, that they ascribe to its effect on their welfare.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the First and the Seventh Circuits, both the Ninth and Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals have held that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> First Amendment right to record public officials. In 2000, in Smith v. City of Cumming, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the First Amendment protects the right of citizens to film [...] the police. Likewise, in 1995, in Fordyce v. City of Seattle, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a private citizen could film police conduct at a protest because the First Amendment protects the [...] "right to film matters of public interest". However, both the Third Circuit in Kelly v. Borough of Carlisle (2010) and the Fourth Circuit in Szymecki v. Houck (2009) have held {{that even if the}} constitution protects the right to film the police, such a right was [...] "not clearly established for the purposes of qualified immunity in those cases’ factual contexts". Additionally, the Fifth Circuit ruled in Turner v. Driver (2017) that while the officers were entitled to qualified immunity in that case, the First Amendment protects the right to record police, subject only to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. Some scholars suggest these various rulings present the potential for a circuit split in cases that involve the filming of police conduct, while others have described the different rulings among circuit courts as [...] " [...] an artificial split—not on the merits of the First Amendment right violated, but on technical qualified immunity ground".|$|E

The Crown and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interest in these cases: the Crown <b>has</b> such <b>an</b> interest because, in Scotland, all fees on the registration of armorial bearings and pedigrees are payable to HM Treasury; <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> interest {{in terms of the}} prevention of fraud and of the misappropriation of property.

2500|$|The {{majority}} {{also criticized}} Austin's reasoning that the [...] "distorting effect" [...] of large corporate expenditures constituted {{a risk of}} corruption or the appearance of corruption.

[...] <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to have access to all information and to determine the reliability and importance of the information.

2500|$|A multi-format points {{system was}} first {{introduced}} for the 2013 Women's Ashes series in England; the series consisted of one Test match, three One Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for winning the Test match, with two points each if drawn, and two points for winning a limited overs match, and one point each if the match was drawn. Talking about the points system, then England captain Charlotte Edwards said [...] " [...] It preserves Test cricket, {{which is the most}} important thing, but equally we get to play the more popular formats which are one day and Twenty20 which the media and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> huge demand for." [...] England won the series 12–4 after the test match was drawn, Australia won one ODI and England won two ODIs and all three T20Is. The system was used again in the 2013–14 women's Ashes in Australia, with England winning 10–8, despite winning fewer matches; England won the test match, one ODI and one T20I, while Australia won two ODIs and two T20Is.|$|E

60|$|I am not fond of {{attempting}} to raise public expectations by great promises. At this time, there is much cause to consider, and very little to presume. We seem to be approaching to a great crisis in our affairs, which calls for the whole wisdom of the wisest among us, {{without being able to}} assure ourselves that any wisdom can preserve us from many and great inconveniences. You know I speak of our unhappy contest with America. I confess, it is a matter on which I look down as from a precipice. It is difficult in itself, and it is rendered more intricate by a great variety of plans of conduct. I do not mean to enter into them. I will not suspect a want of good intention in framing them. But however pure the intentions of their authors may have been, we all know that the event has been unfortunate. The means of recovering our affairs are not obvious. So many great questions of commerce, of finance, of constitution, and of policy are involved in this American deliberation, that I dare engage for nothing, but that I shall give it, without any predilection to former opinions, or any sinister bias whatsoever, the most honest and impartial consideration of which I am capable. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> full right to it; and this great city, a main pillar in the commercial interest of Great Britain, must totter on its base by the slightest mistake with regard to our American measures.|$|E

60|$|At {{the same}} time, if I am able, and if I shall be permitted, I will lend an humble helping hand {{to any other}} good work which is going on. I have not, Sir, the frantic {{presumption}} to suppose that this plan contains in it the whole of what <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to expect in the great work of reformation they call for. Indeed, it falls infinitely short of it. It falls short even of my own ideas. I have some thoughts, not yet fully ripened, relative to a reform in the customs and excise, {{as well as in}} some other branches of financial administration. There are other things, too, which form essential parts in a great plan for the purpose of restoring the independence of Parliament. The contractors' bill of last year it is fit to revive; and I rejoice that it is in better hands than mine. The bill for suspending the votes of custom-house officers, brought into Parliament several years ago by one of our worthiest and wisest members,[45]--would to God we could along with the plan revive the person who designed it! but a man of very real integrity, honor, and ability will be found to take his place, and to carry his idea into full execution. You all see how necessary it is to review our military expenses for some years past, and, if possible, to bind up and close that bleeding artery of profusion; but that business also, I have reason to hope, will be undertaken by abilities that are fully adequate to it. Something must be devised (if possible) to check the ruinous expense of elections.|$|E
60|$|To imagine another contingency, {{perhaps more}} likely to be {{realised}} than the one last mentioned. There is confessedly a strong tendency in the modern world towards a democratic constitution of society, accompanied or not by popular political institutions. It is affirmed that in the country where this tendency is most completely realised--where both society and the government are most democratic--the United States--the feeling of the majority, to whom any appearance of a more showy or costly style of living than they can hope to rival is disagreeable, operates as a tolerably effectual sumptuary law, and that {{in many parts of the}} Union it is really difficult for a person possessing a very large income, to find any mode of spending it, which will not incur popular disapprobation. Though such statements as these are doubtless much exaggerated as a representation of existing facts, the state of things they describe is not only a conceivable and possible, but a probable result of democratic feeling, combined with the notion that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to a veto on the manner in which individuals shall spend their incomes. We have only further to suppose a considerable diffusion of Socialist opinions, and it may become infamous in the eyes of the majority to possess more property than some very small amount, or any income not earned by manual labour. Opinions similar in principle to these, already prevail widely among the artisan class, and weigh oppressively on those who are amenable to the opinion chiefly of that class, namely, its own members. It is known that the bad workmen who form the majority of the operatives in many branches of industry, are decidedly of opinion that bad workmen ought to receive the same wages as good, and that no one ought to be allowed, through piecework or otherwise, to earn by superior skill or industry more than others can without it. And they employ a moral police, which occasionally becomes a physical one, to deter skilful workmen from receiving, and employers from giving, a larger remuneration for a more useful service. If the public have any jurisdiction over private concerns, I cannot see that these people are in fault, or that any individual's particular public can be blamed for asserting the same authority over his individual conduct, which the general public asserts over people in general.|$|E
