5|$|Although the Rzeczpospolita had not {{formally}} participated {{directly in the}} Thirty Years' War, the alliance with the Habsburg Monarchy contributed to getting Poland involved in new wars with the Ottoman Empire, Sweden and Russia, and therefore led to significant Commonwealth influence {{over the course of}} the Thirty Years' War.

5|$|If {{the hostages}} were still {{held by the}} Scots a decade later, they may well have feared for their lives. For in 1275, <b>the</b> <b>continuation</b> of the twelfth-century Historia rerum Anglicarum, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, and the fourteenth-century Chronicle of Lanercost reveal that Guðrøðr led a revolt on the island against the Scottish Crown. According to <b>the</b> <b>continuation</b> of Historia rerum Anglicarum, Guðrøðr took {{possession}} of the island's strongholds, ejecting the Scottish representatives in the process. Alexander III quickly responded by sending a great fleet, drawn from the Hebrides and Galloway, to invade the island and restore Scottish royal authority. The commanders of this enterprise were: John de Vesci (died 1289), John Comyn I, Lord of Badenoch (died c. 1277), Alan, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll (died 1310), and Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí (died ×1296). The identities of these men suggest that the Scottish force was composed of a small component of heavily armed knights, a contingent of infantry troops levied from the common army of Galloway, and a fleet of galleys gathered from the Hebrides.|$|E
