25|$|Much of {{the early}} {{development}} of electric locomotion was driven by {{the increasing use of}} tunnels, particularly in urban areas. Smoke from steam locomotives was noxious and municipalities were increasingly inclined to prohibit their use within their limits.

It opened in 1890, using electric locomotives built by Mather and Platt. Electricity quickly became <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> of <b>choice</b> for subways, abetted by the Sprague's invention of multiple-unit train control in 1897.

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} for removing pollutants from waste gasses, released by industry and <b>power</b> plants, provide <b>the</b> means for removing COx, Nox, sulfur and fine dust particles. These technologies impose very stringent requirements on <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> of the high-voltage supply {{can play an}} important role in the optimization of electrostatic precipitators. Widely discussed, the environmental pollution problems are the outcome of the world wide increase in energy consumption and industrial growth. The overall amount of waste gasses has increased, including the emission of fine, 1 – 50 µm particles, particularly harmful and being a well known health risk. Therefore, both large industrial sites and <b>the</b> <b>power</b> plants require dust cleaning equipment and on-line pollution control. Automated control is required for the equipment to operate on its own, without the need for a continuous operator intervention. Control goals include the need to meet the environmental regulations, keeping at the same time <b>the</b> <b>power</b> losses and <b>the</b> overall energy consumption under control, in order to reach the energy efficiency goals. In this article, an overview of electric filter performance problems is discussed, and the summary of available technologies and solutions is outlined.

40|$|Manned Mars {{missions}} (and some unmanned precursor missions) {{are expected}} to be long duration expeditions that rely on the utilization of in-situ resources to the maximum extent possible. Traditionally, nuclear energy has been suggested as <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> of <b>choice</b> for such missions. However, in the event that nuclear power is unavailable, solar energy is <b>the</b> only alternative <b>power</b> source that has received significant study to date. Unfortunately, the periodic and long duration dust storms on Mars drive the need for extensive solar arrays to provide energy needs. This work considers the possibility that wind energy may provide a secondary power source in an all-solar mission. Previous studies have shown that a viable Martian wind energy system must be ultra-lightweight, deployable, and robust. In this study, the possibility of meeting these criteria with buoyant wind energy conversion structures is studied. Conceptual designs have been assessed in terms of mass, volume, and power production. Based on current estimates of solar energy production efficiency during dust storm conditions, the design constraints on a complimentary wind energy system are determined. Using system mass per kW-hour as a figure of merit, the feasible wind speeds for three Martian buoyant wind energy conversion systems (a Savonius, a Darrieus, and a spherical) were determined and compared to previous rigid designs. The large sizes required for buoyant systems resulted in large turbines producing 10 to 30 kW in 25 m/s winds. The efficient inclusion of the buoyant chambers into the structure was found to be critical, as the mass of the balloon is significant. As a result the spherical system was seen to provide the best design. Although it is aerodynamically inefficient and untested, it was found to be feasible in a 29 m/s wind based on an estimated mass of 429 kg and 19 kW estimated power...|$|R

25|$|<b>Power</b> <b>supply</b> {{imperfections}} (e.g., <b>power</b> signal ripple, non-zero source impedance) {{may lead}} to noticeable deviations from ideal operational amplifier behavior. For example, operational amplifiers have a specified <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> rejection ratio that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> inputs. <b>Power</b> <b>supply</b> inputs are often noisy in large designs because <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once.

40|$|A {{micro-controller}} based {{embedded system}} has been designed and developed to monitor and control the operation of various types of <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> required for <b>the</b> super conducting cyclotron, from the front panel {{as well as from}} the remote terminal.
