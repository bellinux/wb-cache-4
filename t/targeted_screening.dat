5000|$|When {{considering}} universal newborn hearing screenings, {{an important}} ethical requirement is {{the delivery of}} equitable access to all babies. However, {{due to lack of}} resources in some settings and communities, a more targeted hearing screening approach may serve as a good take-off point for universal newborn hearing screenings. A <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> approach limits the screenings to babies who exhibit some risk factors for hearing loss. Risk factors for hearing loss are provided below in the table titled, [...] "Risk Factors For Hearing Loss in Newborns (JCIH, 2000)." [...] <b>Targeted</b> <b>screening</b> has been shown to identify approximately 50% of babies with moderate to profound hearing loss (Vohr et al., 2000; Watkin et al., 1991). Unfortunately, this low number is due to the limitations of high risk factors either being difficult to detect at birth or during early childhood and lack of education of the high risk factors for hearing loss, especially in developing countries (Derekoy, 2000; Gray, 1989; Minja, 1998). As mentioned previously, targeted screenings may be useful in establishing universal newborn hearing screenings in specific communities and educate communities on the predominant risk factors of hearing loss while establishing a more effective and culturally-appropriate universal hearing screening program.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{characterisation}} study of water samples collected from an Advanced Water Recycling Plant (AWRP) operating in Perth, Western Australia are presented. The AWRP treats secondary wastewater by ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis (RO) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) to produce recycled water for groundwater replenishment. Water samples collected after RO and UV treatment were characterised by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, using an established protocol for <b>target</b> <b>screening.</b> The <b>target</b> <b>screening</b> of 291 compounds detected a total of 13 chemicals in post-RO and post-UV water, including 2 corrosion inhibitors (4 + 5 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole, benzotriazole), 3 pesticides (metolachlor, propiconazol, prosulfocarb), 3 pharmaceuticals (lamotrigin, metformin, tramadol), 1 personal care product (galaxalidone), 3 artificial sweeteners (saccharin, acesulfame, sucralose) and 1 flame retardant (triethyl phosphate). The corrosion inhibitors benzotriazole and 4 + 5 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole, and the pharmaceutical metformin were detected in hundreds of ng L− 1, while the other compounds were present in low ng L− 1 concentrations. Analysis of UV treated water samples showed that UV treatment also helped to reduced UV degradable compounds such as the corrosion inhibitors (> 50 % removal), triethyl phosphate (~ 50 % removal) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (~ 95 % removal). Overall, the detection of 13 chemicals through <b>target</b> <b>screening</b> analyses did {{not account for the}} residual dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in post RO water, the majority of which is still an intriguing unknown. However, the <b>target</b> <b>screening</b> did show that there were no obvious “known” anthropogenic contaminants contributing to the majority of the DOC in post-RO and post-UV treated water. Calculated risk quotients (RQ) for all detected chemicals in UV treated water were 2 to 6 order of magnitude below 1, implying an high degree of safety associated with human consumption of recycled water. Overall the chemicals screening provided further evidence of the overall safety of the use of recycled wastewater treated by RO and UV as a potable water source...|$|R

50|$|The {{increased}} use of CT scans has been the greatest in two fields: screening of adults (screening CT of the lung in smokers, virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, and whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients) and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, {{is one of the}} main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population (especially for the diagnosis of appendicitis). As of 2007 in the United States a proportion of CT scans are performed unnecessarily. Some estimates place this number at 30%. There are a number of reasons for this including: legal concerns, financial incentives, and desire by the public. For example, some healthy people avidly pay to receive full-body CT scans as screening, but it is not at all clear that the benefits outweigh the risks and costs, because deciding whether and how to treat incidentalomas is fraught with complexity, radiation exposure is cumulative and not negligible, and the money for the scans involves opportunity cost (it may have been more effectively spent on more <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> or other health care strategies).|$|E
50|$|Most {{surgeons}} ask patients about recent general {{medical examination}} results {{in order to}} proceed with surgery 1 even though there are arguments for and against most screening interventions. Advantages include detection and subsequent prevention or early treatment of conditions such as high blood pressure, alcohol abuse, smoking, unhealthy diet, obesity and cancers. Moreover, they could improve the patient-physician relationship and decrease patient anxiety. More and more private insurance companies and even Medicare include annual physicals in their coverage. Some employers require mandatory health checkup before hiring a candidate even though it is now well known that some of the components of the prophylactic annual visit may actually cause harm. For example, lab tests and exams that are performed on healthy patients (as opposed to people with symptoms or known illnesses) are statistically more likely to be “false positives” — that is, when test results suggest a problem that doesn’t exist. Disadvantages cited include the time and money that could be saved by <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> (health economics argument), increased anxiety over health risks (medicalisation), overdiagnosis, wrong diagnosis (for example Athletic heart syndrome misdiagnosed as Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and harm, or even death, resulting from unnecessary testing to detect or confirm, often non-existent, medical problems or while performing routine procedures as a followup after screening.|$|E

30|$|The first {{objective}} of Study 2 was {{to replicate the}} similarity effect on reaction time in a more realistic context than in Study 1.

Although this variation did not originate from a theoretical framework but rather from a real-life scenario, the splitting of the search space into two screens was thought likely to have a systematic effect on reaction times. Therefore, Study 2 consisted of a three-factorial within-design (2 × 2 × 2) with the independent factors TDS, DDS, and <b>target</b> <b>screen</b> and the dependent variable reaction time.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an evidence-based vascular assessment method to guide podiatrists’ decision-making processes to aid in timely vascular assessment in at risk populations. Method: The sample underwent brachial pressure measurement, ankle pressures, toe pressure and Doppler waveform with colour duplex ultrasound (CFDU) used as the reference standard. Both the <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> method and the American Heart Association (AHA) guideline for vascular screening were then applied to the data set and sensitivity and specificity of each method was calculated. Results: One hundred nineteen participants were included. Sensitivity of the <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> method (62 %, 95 % CI 47. 17 – 75. 35) was higher than the AHA method (49 %, 95 % CI 34. 75 – 63. 40), however, specificity of the AHA method (94 %, 95 % CI 85. 62 – 98. 37) was higher than the <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> method (85 %, 95 % CI 74. 26 – 92. 60).

Subjects engaged in two tasks that required them to access different <b>target</b> <b>screens</b> from various starting screens in a 290 -screen MFD.

Aims To conduct a cost analysis of <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> and subsequent treatment for cCMV-related sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in an, otherwise, asymptomatic infant, {{from the perspective of the}} UK National Health Service (NHS). Methods Using data from the newborn hearing screening programme (NHSP) in England and a recent study of <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> for cCMV using salivary swabs within the NHSP, we estimate the cost (in UK pounds (£)) to the NHS. The cost of screening (time, swabs and PCR), assessing, treating and following up cases is calculated. The cost per case of preventing hearing deterioration secondary to cCMV with <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> is calculated. Results The cost of identifying, assessing and treating a case of cCMV-related SNHL through targeted cCMV screening is estimated to be £ 6683.

40|$|PURPOSE: Screening {{guidelines}} for {{type 2 diabetes}} recommend targeting high-risk individuals. Our objective was to assess whether diagnosis of type 2 diabetes based on opportunistic <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> results in lower vascular event rates compared with diagnosis {{on the basis of}} clinical signs or symptoms. METHODS: In a prospective, nonrandomized, observational study, we enrolled patients aged 45 to 75 years from 10 family practices in the Netherlands with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, detected either by (1) opportunistic <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> (n = 359) or (2) clinical signs or symptoms (n = 206). Patients in both groups received the same guideline-concordant diabetes care. The main group outcome measure was a composite of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. RESULTS: Baseline vascular disease was more prevalent in the opportunistic <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> group, mainly ischemic heart disease (12. 3 % vs 3. 9 %, P =. 001) and nephropathy (16. 9 % vs 7. 1 %, P =. 002). After a mean follow-up of 7. 7 years (SD = 2. 4 years) and 7. 1 years (SD = 2. 7 years) for the opportunistic <b>targeted</b> <b>screening</b> and clinical diagnosis groups, respectively, composite primary event rates did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (9. 5 % vs 10. 2 %, P =. 78; adjusted hazard ratio 0. 67, 95 % confidence interval, 0. 36 - 1. 25; P =. 21). There were also no significant differences in the separate event rates of deaths from CVD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal strokes.
