5|$|The {{primary reason}} {{construction}} halted {{on the four}} ships was the shifting of construction materials and manpower from capital ships to U-boats {{in the last two}} years of the war. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918 stating <b>that</b> <b>capital</b> ship construction had ground to a halt primarily for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see <b>that</b> <b>capital</b> could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being <b>that</b> <b>capital</b> is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must be true that no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E

5|$|During {{the design}} process, {{it was decided}} that the utmost concern was that the ships could be built quickly and placed into service. The ships were to discard the use of {{broadside}} belt armor below the waterline, the attachment of which was an extremely long process. It was believed that the higher speed of the class——would make up for the vulnerability to torpedo attack and make the armor unnecessary.The initial designs called for three main battery turrets, each mounting a pair of new 42cm guns, though this was later increased to four twin turrets. However, the work that would have been necessary to design and test the new turret clashed with U-boat construction, which had become the priority of the Navy. Krupp, the firm that had been awarded the contract to conduct the testing, informed the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—the Imperial Navy Office) that design work on the new turret would have to wait. Capelle accepted the news without much objection. Nevertheless, the ships were never built. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918, which stated <b>that</b> <b>capital</b> ship construction had ground to a halt, primarily due to the shifting priorities to the U-boat war.|$|E
5|$|On Rubicun III, the Edo {{explain to}} Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Worf <b>that</b> <b>capital</b> {{punishment}} {{is used to}} enforce their laws. The away team rush to warn Wesley, only to discover he has accidentally broken a greenhouse while playing catch with the Edo youths. An Edo policeman attempts to give Wesley a lethal injection for this infraction of the law, but Yar and Worf draw their phasers. On the ship, the sphere leaves Data's body and departs. Picard, upon hearing of the situation with Wesley, transports to the surface. He meets {{with representatives of the}} Edo in a council chamber and explains that Earth no longer practices capital punishment. Some Edo interpret this stance as an attempt by the Federation to push their superiority and suggest that Picard should mount a rescue effort for the boy. He says he cannot, quoting the Prime Directive.|$|E
5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, and zero {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and <b>that</b> <b>capital</b> mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E

5000|$|Catherine Hakim's {{theory of}} erotic <b>capital</b> argues <b>that</b> erotic <b>capital</b> is an {{important}} fourth personal asset, alongside economic capital, cultural/human capital and social capital; <b>that</b> erotic <b>capital</b> is increasingly important in affluent modern societies; that women generally have more erotic capital than men, and <b>that</b> erotic <b>capital</b> has social benefits and privileges that benefit the female gender. [...] This definition of erotic capital has been contested by some sociologists who reject the idea <b>that</b> erotic <b>capital</b> / sexual capital is something individuals possess, like a portable portfolio of resources, with no implicit link to the particular sexual field in which such characteristics are deemed desirable (For more, see Green, Adam Isaiah. 2013. [...] "Erotic Capital and the Power of Desirability: Why 'Honey Money' is a Bad Collective Strategy for Remedying Gender Inequality". Sexualities 16:137-158).|$|R

25|$|In {{very simple}} terms, suppose <b>that</b> <b>capital</b> {{currently}} consists of 10 trucks and 5 lasers. Trucks are produced and sold for $50,000 each, while each laser goes for $30,000. Thus, {{the value of}} our capital equals the sum of (price)*(quantity) = 10*$50,000 + 5*$30,000 = $650,000 = K.|$|E
25|$|It {{is further}} assumed <b>that</b> <b>capital</b> can shift easily into either technology, {{so that the}} {{industrial}} mix can change without adjustment costs between {{the two types of}} production.

25|$|Like capital, labor {{movements}} {{are not permitted}} in the Heckscher–Ohlin world, since this would drive an equalization of relative abundances of the two production factors, {{just as in the}} case of capital immobility.

25|$|Bonds {{and stocks}} are both securities, {{but the major}} {{difference}} between the two is <b>that</b> (<b>capital)</b> stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e., they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company (i.e., they are lenders). Being a creditor, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors in the event of bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|He {{extended}} {{the idea of}} capital to categories such as social capital, cultural capital, financial capital, and symbolic capital. For Bourdieu each individual occupies a position in a multidimensional social space; {{he or she is}} not defined only by social class membership, but by every single kind of capital he or she can articulate through social relations. <b>That</b> <b>capital</b> includes the value of social networks, which Bourdieu showed could be used to produce or reproduce inequality.|$|E
