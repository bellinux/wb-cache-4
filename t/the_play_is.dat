5|$|Fielding's seventh play, Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap, was a five-act comedic {{play that}} first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. The play enjoyed some success {{until it was}} renamed The Coffee-House Politician and was altered to {{possibly}} update the play as it focused on mocking current news events. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge that stands in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails albeit in a comedic fashion. Fielding's focus in <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> first {{published}} in serial form in La Societe Nouvelle, a Brussels periodical. Since Maeterlinck desired <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>be</b> published in book form, his mother tightened her budget and gave him 250 francs. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> printed in December, 1889.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{generally}} received well critically, and Bankhead's acting <b>was</b> praised. However, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> commercially unsuccessful.|$|R
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} rumors, Verne and d'Ennery came to difficulties over {{the treatment of}} science in the play, with d'Ennery wanting to condemn scientific research and Verne advocating a more science-friendly and hopeful approach. Verne reportedly cut some especially negative lines out of the script, and protested when d'Ennery had them reinserted for the production. Journey Through the Impossible would be their last collaboration. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> also Verne's only contribution to the féerie genre.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the usual}} method of BBC {{television}} drama production at the time, the play was produced in a multi-camera electronic studio on video cameras, although it was recorded as a 35mm film telerecording rather than on videotape. This 35mm master was released for junking in 1968, and no copy of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> known to exist.|$|E
5|$|Fielding {{started work}} on his fourth play, The Temple Beau, in April 1729, but did not finish {{until the end of}} the year. Rejected by his first theatre, the play had to be {{performed}} at another one, where it had 13 shows its first year and few revivals thereafter. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> about Wilding, a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure, and his attempts to marry a woman for her money. Fielding focuses on hypocrisy and gender equality in marriage with characters' interaction with Wilding.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> staged at <b>the</b> Birmingham Repertory Theatre.In 2016, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{staged in}} Germany at the Neuss RLT Theatre.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{edited by}} Kenneth Palmer for the Malone Society in 1954. A more recent edition of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in 2005.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> revived off-Broadway by the Vineyard Theater in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} in a London revival in 2012 at Riverside Studios.|$|R
5|$|Fielding's sixteenth play, The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd, {{replaced}} The Covent Garden Tragedy as {{the companion}} play to The Old Debauchees. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui. It first ran on 23 June 1732 {{and was later}} revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute {{to avoid having to}} marry a man she does not like while her doctor is really a man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.|$|E
5|$|Firm {{evidence}} for specific early performances of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> scant. What is known {{is that the}} crew of the ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, British playwright Tom Stoppard {{wrote the}} play Every Good Boy Deserves Favour that criticized the Soviet {{practice}} of treating political dissidence {{as a form}} of mental illness. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> dedicated to Viktor Fainberg and Vladimir Bukovsky, two Soviet dissidents expelled to the West.|$|E
50|$|Already in {{the first}} years of the Soviet power’s existence, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{translated}} into Uzbek language. In 1923, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> staged in Uzbek language.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} titled Love and Mercy. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> first {{presented at}} a staged reading at the Ojai Playwrights Conference, California, in August 2010.|$|R

5|$|In July 2013, it was {{confirmed}} that Grint {{will be making}} his stage debut in Jez Butterworth's second run of his black comedy, Mojo, playing the role as a minor hood called Sweets who pops amphetamines like Smarties and does a sort of double act, full of comic menace. Grint will be starring alongside actors Brendan Coyle, Ben Whishaw and Daniel Mays. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> based on real-life events and ran from 26 October 2013 until 8 February 2014 at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London. He won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best London Newcomer for his role in this play.|$|E
5|$|In the Puppet Theater minigame, {{the player}} is tasked with {{finishing}} the script {{of an ongoing}} play so that it makes sense. If the player chooses a word {{that does not make}} sense {{in the context of the}} play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> given an epilogue and an audience applauds.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{composed}} for Padua's literary academy, the Accademia degli Infiammati, and {{was printed}} at Firenze on 1546. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> heavily modeled on Senecan tragedy.|$|R
50|$|A {{contemporary}} reimagining of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{staged in}} 2017 by the Royal Shakespeare Company. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> directed by Justin Audibert and specially adapted by Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> adapted in France as Panique au Plazza, {{starring}} Christian Clavier and Gérard Lartigau.In 1997 <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{made into}} a successful Hungarian movie A Miniszter Félrelép.|$|R
5|$|Like many of Verne's novels, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> deeply {{imbued with}} themes of initiation, echoing the {{traditional}} mythic pattern {{of a young}} hero coming of age and reaching maturity through a dangerous and transformative journey. In Journey Through the Impossible, the young Georges, initially trapped by obsessions {{similar to those that}} drove his father mad, resolves his inner torments during a harrowing series of experiences in which Ox and Volsius compete as substitute father-figures. Both father-figures are highly symbolic: Ox is a sinister tempter representing knowledge and science, balancing the Guardian Angel Volsius.|$|E
5|$|Manning's next play, Kenny's Coming Home (1991), was {{performed}} at the Q Theatre, Penrith and was subsequently recorded for radio on ABC Radio National. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> centred on a Rugby league footballer, Kenny, who gets {{caught up in a}} preselection battle between two of his family members. Kenny's Coming Home included songs by Shane McNamara.|$|E
5|$|Much of the play's Protestant tones {{derive from}} its setting in Denmark—both {{then and now}} a {{predominantly}} Protestant country, though {{it is unclear whether}} the fictional Denmark of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> intended to portray this implicit fact. Dialog refers explicitly to Wittenberg, where Hamlet, Horatio, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attend university, implying where Martin Luther in 1517 first proposed his 95 theses and thereby initiated the Protestant Reformation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} in October 1938 at the Cambridge Arts Theatre, in a production by the Group Theatre (London). The incidental music for <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> composed by Benjamin Britten.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{presented}} at Riverside Church in Manhattan.

It won the New York Critics Circle Award and an Obie Award for <b>the</b> [...] "best <b>play</b> of <b>the</b> year". <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> also a success in Europe, and catapulted Piñero to literary fame.

5|$|The Demi-Virgin is a three-act play {{written by}} Avery Hopwood. Producer Albert H. Woods staged it on Broadway, {{where it was}} a hit during the 1921–22 season. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> a bedroom farce about former couple Gloria Graham and Wally Deane, both movie actors, whose {{marriage}} was so brief that the press speculated about whether Gloria was still a virgin. She attempts to seduce Wally when {{they are forced to}} reunite for a movie, but after playing along he surprises her by revealing that their divorce is not valid.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>is</b> in the mid-1950s, and {{takes place on}} Cannery Row in Monterey, California. In the Steinbeck book which forms {{the basis for the}} musical, the Bear Flag is a bordello and Suzy a prostitute. This is alluded to in the musical, but never {{expressed}} outright.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> first {{published}} in 1606, in a quarto printed by Thomas Creede for the bookseller William Holmes. This was the drama's sole edition before the 19th century. The title page identifies Chapman as the author, and states that <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> performed by <b>the</b> Queen's Revels Children at the Blackfriars Theatre. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> almost certainly written and debuted onstage in 1605.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{performed}} {{again on}} 20 May 1668, following on another probable performance the previous day. The Mulberry-Garden was still performed on 29 June 1668. While <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> not a smash hit, {{it had the}} average reception of so many other comedies at the time. The new edition of The Mulberry-Garden (1675) suggests that <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> revived for <b>the</b> theatre season of 1674/75.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> {{so popular}} and {{influential}} that it contributed to Mussato’s {{success in the}} revival of classicized writings and his receiving the poet laureate honor from the bishop and municipality of Padua. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>play’s</b> importance <b>was</b> underscored when a law was passed stating that <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>was</b> to be read every Christmas {{as a means of}} reinforcing Paduan patriotism.|$|R
