5|$|According to {{the most}} recent (July 2015) {{revision}} of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the world population is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100. Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E
5|$|The mall {{also added}} new burdens to city services, with {{building}} inspectors {{having to work}} overtime to inspect each store area as it was completed. While mall security was issued citation books so they could issue parking tickets directly, the city police still had to work double shifts to cover the traffic during the mall's opening weekend. Overall, the mall increased traffic on the Earl Rudder Freeway, and city traffic engineers noted it would cause more traffic backup. Traffic signals {{were added to the}} mall's main entrance, while long-term plans were made to both expand the freeway and add additional interchanges along Harvey. Traffic studies were implemented to study the traffic after the mall's opening <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> additional plans to mitigate issues. There were concerns that the mall would be the final blow to the downtown area of neighboring city Bryan, Texas, which was already suffering reduced business after the opening of smaller Manor East Mall and the Townshire shopping center, both within Bryan. Bryan city officials noted an immediate decrease in revenue due to Sears moving from Bryan to College Station, taking $50–100,000 of sales taxes with it. However, as a whole the city was hopeful that the mall would have benefits to the city in the form of increased city growth as a whole. The city planners felt it would only be a passing fad for local rural and lower-income families, who would still return to downtown Bryan due to its proximity.|$|E

25|$|There {{are more}} than 153,000 {{hospital}} beds, 121,000 physicians and 37,000 dentists (ratios comparable <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> nations). The relatively high access to medical care has historically resulted in mortality patterns and trends similar <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> nations': from 1953 to 2005, deaths from cardiovascular disease increased from 20% to 23% of the total, those from tumors from 14% to 20%, respiratory problems from 7% to 14%, digestive maladies (non-infectious) from 7% to 11%, strokes a steady 7%, injuries, 6%, and infectious diseases, 4%.

50|$|Mitsusaki-kengyo, junior {{fellow of}} Kikuoka-kengyo, was active then. He {{was also a}} pupil of Yaezaki-kengyo.

25|$|The Saudi water sector, {{like the}} entire country, has {{undergone}} tremendous changes {{over the past}} decades from a system based {{on the use of}} local renewable water resources for small-scale irrigation and limited domestic uses to a system largely based on the use of desalinated water and fossil groundwater for large-scale irrigation and domestic, commercial and industrial uses at a level comparable <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> countries. The Saline Water Conversion Corporation, created in 1965, has been an important player in this process of change.|$|E

25|$|Some theorists, such as Martin Khor of the Third World Network, {{point out}} that many {{developing}} nations have gone from being food independent to being net food importing economies since the 1970s and 1980s International Monetary Fund (and later the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Agriculture) free market economics directives to debtor nations. In opening developing countries <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> world food imports subsidised by Western governments, developing nations can become more dependent upon food imports if local agriculture does not improve.|$|E

25|$|Slavs on the {{territory}} of Poland were organized into tribal units, of which the larger ones were later known as the Polish tribes; the names of many tribes are found on the list compiled by the anonymous Bavarian Geographer in the 9th century.

This latest tribal undertaking resulted in the formation of a lasting political structure in the 10th century that became the state of Poland, one of the West Slavic nations.|$|E

25|$|China's {{estimated}} employed {{labor force}} in 2005 totaled 791.4million persons, about 60% {{of the total}} population. During 2003, 49% {{of the labor force}} worked in agriculture, forestry, and fishing; 22% in mining, manufacturing, energy, and construction industries; and 29% in the services sector and other categories. In 2004 some 25million persons were employed by 743,000 private enterprises. Urban wages rose rapidly from 2004 to 2007, at a rate of 13 to 19% per year with average wages near $200/month in 2007. By 2016 the average monthly wage for workers engaged in manufacturing goods for export was $424. This wage, combined with other costs of doing business in China, had, more or less, equalized any Chinese cost advantage with respect <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> economies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the domain}} of food and agriculture, IPS {{facilitates}} agricultural extension to farmers, {{in order to make}} possible their participation in global markets. Using a participatory programme of education and technical skills training for farmers, IPS supports the rural economies of developing countries by facilitating exports <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> regions. For the initial costs of such production until harvest revenues are generated, microloans are provided to farmers by non-profit agencies of the AKDN. In addition to microfinance and education, the agency works to improve the health and sanitation conditions of its beneficiaries, and considers employee welfare to be of paramount concern, providing equitable opportunity between genders and making child-care provisions for its employees.|$|E
25|$|From 1986 to 2009, Borlaug was the President of the SAA. That year, a {{joint venture}} between The Carter Center and SAA was {{launched}} called Sasakawa-Global 2000 (SG 2000). The program focuses on food, population and agricultural policy. Since then, more than 8 million small-scale farmers in 15 African countries have been trained in SAA farming techniques, which have helped them to double or triple grain production. Those elements that allowed Borlaug's projects to succeed in India and Pakistan, such as well-organized economies and transportation and irrigation systems, are severely lacking throughout Africa, posing additional obstacles to increasing yields. Because of this, Borlaug's initial projects were restricted <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> regions of the continent.|$|E

25|$|However, {{in regions}} where certain classes of workers are {{restricted}} {{to this type of}} work or there are contributing regional conditions - for example, high unemployment, adjacent to regions with high poverty, or the recipient of driven labor migration - there will be workers willing to accept lower than equilibrium wages and then these jobs are not well paid. Large scale international labor migration, from developing <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> countries since the late 19th century and early 20th century has provided a pool of migrants willing to undertake employment for lower wages than native residents. Higher wages in developed countries are a strong 'pull' factor in international migration, and thus while a migrant worker is willing to accept a comparatively low-wage for a 3D job in a developed country it may mean a significant increase in wages compared to their originating country.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{is being}} asked by the European Union (EU) and the {{developing}} countries, led by Brazil and India, to make a more generous offer for reducing trade-distorting domestic support for agriculture. The United States is insisting that the EU and the developing countries agree to make more substantial reductions in tariffs and {{to limit the number}} of import-sensitive and special products that would be exempt from cuts. Import-sensitive products are of most concern <b>to</b> <b>developed</b> countries like the European Union, while developing countries are concerned with special products – those exempt from both tariff cuts and subsidy reductions because of development, food security, or livelihood considerations. Brazil has emphasized reductions in trade-distorting domestic subsidies, especially by the United States (some of which it successfully challenged in the WTO U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute), while India has insisted on a large number of special products that would not be exposed to wider market opening.|$|E
