[...] Neither does it attempt to approximate {{the sounds of}} the original, reducing the iconic two note [...] "wakka wakka" [...] dot eating and bonus gobbling sounds to a single tone clank sound and single beep respectively, replacing the game start tune with a <b>touch-tone</b> phone sounding four-note motif, and dispensing entirely with both the slot machine jackpot type sound signifying earning an extra life and the omnipresent siren sound during gameplay.|$|E

5000|$|The CPU then determines (from Fred's {{directory}} entry) that Fred {{has a new}} message. The CPU then presents Fred {{his options}} (e.g., [...] "You have a new message. To listen to your new message, press 1; to record a message, press 2" [...] etc.) The options are presented by the CPU directing the Disk Controller to play prompts, and the CPU listens for <b>Touch-tones</b> from Fred. This interaction of playing prompts and responding with <b>Touch-tones</b> enables Fred {{to interact with the}} voicemail system easily.|$|R

5000|$|Playback {{controls}} (like rewind, pause, fast forward, changing volume, etc.) are all input via <b>Touch-tones,</b> are [...] "read" [...] by the CPU, and {{the appropriate}} actions are taken based on the stored program in the system. For example, if Fred wants to pause message playback, he might press 2. Since the CPU is constantly listening for <b>Touch-tones</b> from Fred, his command causes the CPU to direct the Disk Controller to stop playing the message. A variety of playback controls and options are available on most sophisticated voice-mail systems so that users can control message playback, store messages in archives, send messages to groups, change their preferences, etc.|$|R
50|$|For {{three months}} in the early 1960s, Findlay had the {{distinction}} of being the only community in the world where <b>touch-tone</b> telephone service was available. <b>Touch-tone</b> service was first introduced there on November 1, 1960.|$|E

50|$|As {{telephone}} companies continued to levy surcharges for <b>touch-tone</b> service long after any technical justification ceased to exist, a push-button telephone with pulse dialing capability represented {{a means for}} a user to obtain the convenience of push-button dialing without incurring the <b>touch-tone</b> surcharge.|$|E
25|$|Voice prompts {{were created}} by a hired voice {{specialist}} to give a melodic presentation for the DVX. To avoid false triggering of <b>touch-tones</b> by the prompts (due to input/output cross talk), notch filters were created to remove the touch tone frequencies from the prompts.|$|R
50|$|Simple {{voicemail}} systems {{function as}} a remote answering machine using <b>touch-tones</b> as the user interface. More complicated systems may use other input devices such as voice or a computer interface. Simpler voice-mail systems may play the audio message through the phone, while more advanced systems may have alternative delivery methods, including email or text message delivery, message transfer and forwarding options, and multiple mailboxes.|$|R
5000|$|Since the CPU [...] "knows" [...] it is Fred (from the {{signaling}} on the Data Link D), {{it looks}} up Fred's {{information on the}} System Disk, specifically his password. The CPU then directs Disk Controller to play a log-on prompt to the user: [...] "Please enter your password." [...] Once the password is entered (via <b>Touch-tones),</b> the CPU compares it to the correct one and, if entered correctly, allows Fred to continue.|$|R

50|$|Session {{redirection}} means {{moving a}} call in progress from a cell phone to a desk phone or vice versa, {{in much the same}} way as a call can transfer from one extension to another. For example, one is in a car on the way to work, listening to a conference call on a cell phone. One walks into the office, sits down, and redirects the call (session) to a desk phone. Depending on the implementation, control of the process might be from a cell phone, a desk phone or a PC, using <b>touch-tones</b> or something more user-friendly.|$|R
40|$|The Phone Slave is a personal, {{integrated}} telecommunications management system, combining dwerse message {{functions in}} a single user interface on a small general purpose computer. This paper {{will focus on the}} audio components of that interface (a related publication emphasizes the graphical interface [4]). The Phone Slave is an intelligent answering machine, conversing with callers to format messages and relaying personal greetings to identified partles. Its owner can access these voice messages as well as electronic mail via speech recognition or <b>Touch-Tones</b> over the phone network. Access to both lncoming and outgoing messages, an on-line directory, and autodial features are also provided by a touch-sensitive color monitor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – In {{this project}} we {{developed}} a series of computer laboratories using Mathwork’s Matlab software to help students relate to math concepts through a “hands-on ” multimedia approach. Initially, the Matlab laboratories exposed students to computer programming and debugging, plotting graphs, and solving equations. The labs then extended to exploring mathematical concepts through audio and visual applications. For example one lab related a rotation matrix learned in trigonometry to animating an object on the computer. Another explored parameters of a sine wave and how they related to music and telephone <b>touch-tones.</b> The challenge of designing the labs was to facilitate critical thinking and exploration while minimizing the drudgery of debugging. In this paper, we will present three of the labs and discuss how {{they relate to the}} trigonometry/pre-calculus curriculum, the response of the high school students, and the lessons learned by the graduate student instructor...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 82) This graduate project demonstrates {{and explains}} {{the design and}} implementation of a digitally controlled interface between the telephone lines and a Z- 80 based microcomputer, substituting an intelligent terminal for the telephone instrument. The functions performed by the terminal are control of a telephone answering service, automatic dialing of telephone numbers, and execution of commands entered through the telephone lines {{in the form of}} <b>touch-tones.</b> Interfacing with the telephone lines is done via a transformer and optocoupler to provide electrical isolation. Digitally controlled circuitry allows the microcomputer to perform the different functions under software control. The hardware design is explained at the block diagram level and the software at a flowchart level. Some basics on telephone automatic switching systems and {{a brief description of the}} microcomputer utilized are given to supply the reader with the background required to understand the implemented system...|$|R
