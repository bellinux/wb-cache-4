25|$|Thorium hydroxide, Th(OH)4, can be {{prepared}} by adding a hydroxide of ammonium or an alkali metal to a thorium salt solution, where it appears as a gelatinous precipitate that will dissolve in dilute acids, among other substances. It can also {{be prepared}} by electrolysis of thorium nitrates. It is stable from 260–450°C; at 470°C and above it continuously decomposes to become <b>thoria.</b> It easily absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form the hydrated carbonate ThOCO3·xH2O and, under high-pressure conditions in a carbon dioxide atmosphere, Th(CO3)2·0.5H2O or Th(OH)2CO3·2H2O. Several mixed oxides are known, such as BaThO3, which has the perovskite structure.|$|E
25|$|Three binary thorium borides are known: ThB6, ThB4, and ThB12. The last is isotypic with UB12. While {{reports of}} ThB66 and ThB76 exist, they {{may simply be}} thorium-stabilised boron allotropes. ThB6 and ThB12 may be {{produced}} by heating thorium with boron. The three known binary thorium carbides are ThC2, Th2C3, and ThC: all are produced by reacting thorium or <b>thoria</b> with carbon. ThC and ThC2 are refractory solids and have melting points over 2600°C. Thorium borides, carbides, silicides, and nitrates are refractory materials, as are those of uranium and plutonium, and have thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels.|$|E
25|$|Thorium {{tetrachloride}} (ThCl4, white, m.p.770°C) {{is produced}} by heating <b>thoria</b> in an organochloride compound such as carbon tetrachloride. The usual method of purification is crystallisation from an aqueous solution and then heating the product above 100°C to dehydrate it. Further purification {{can be achieved by}} subliming it. Its melting and boiling points are respectively 770°C and 921°C. It undergoes a phase transition at 405°C, with a low-temperature α phase and high-temperature β phase. Nevertheless, the β phase usually persists below the transition temperature. Both phases crystallise in the tetragonal crystal system and the structural differences are small. Below −203°C, a low-temperature form exists with a complex structure.|$|E
25|$|Thorium {{reacts with}} {{hydrogen}} {{to form the}} thorium hydrides ThH2 and Th4H15, the latter of which is superconducting below the transition temperature of 7.5–8K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. Thorium is the only element that forms a hydride higher than MH3. Finely divided thorium metal reacts very readily with hydrogen at standard conditions, but large pieces {{may need to be}} heated to 300–400°C for a reaction to take place. Around 850°C, the reaction forming first ThH2 and then Th4H15 occurs without breaking up the structure of the thorium metal. Thorium hydrides react readily with oxygen or steam to form <b>thoria,</b> and at 250–350°C quickly react with hydrogen halides, sulfides, phosphides, and nitrides to form the corresponding thorium binary compounds.|$|E
25|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent {{bromides}} and iodides: the tetrahalides are all hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Additionally, many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride (ThF4, white, m.p.1068°C) is most easily produced by reacting various thorium salts, <b>thoria,</b> or thorium hydroxide with hydrogen fluoride: methods that involve {{steps in the}} aqueous phase are more difficult because they result in hydroxide and oxide fluorides {{that have to be}} reduced with hydrogen fluoride or fluorine gas. It has a monoclinic crystal structure and is isotypic with zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. It is a white, hygroscopic powder: at temperatures above 500°C, it reacts with atmospheric moisture to produce the oxyfluoride ThOF2.|$|E
25|$|The heavier chalcogens sulfur, selenium, and {{tellurium}} {{are known}} to form thorium chalcogenides, {{many of which have}} more complex structure than the oxides. Apart from several binary compounds, the oxychalcogenides ThOS (yellow), ThOSe, and ThOTe are also known. The five binary thorium sulfides – ThS (lustrous metallic), Th2S3 (brown metallic), Th7S12 (black), ThS2 (purple-brown), and Th2S5 (orange-brown) – may be produced by reacting hydrogen sulfide with thorium, its halides, or <b>thoria</b> (the last if carbon is present): they all hydrolyse in acidic solutions. The six selenides are analogous to the sulfides, with the addition of ThSe3. The five tellurides are also similar to the sulfides and selenides (although Th2Te5 is unknown), but have slightly different crystal structures: for example, ThS has the sodium chloride structure, but ThTe has the caesium chloride structure, since the Th4+ and Te2− ions are similar in size while the S2− ions are much smaller.|$|E

50|$|Thorium dioxide {{is used as}} a {{stabilizer}} in tungsten electrodes in TIG welding, electron tubes, {{and aircraft}} engines.

It is the most popular oxide additive because of its low cost, but is being phased out in favor of non-radioactive elements such as cerium, lanthanum and zirconium.|$|E

This can be achieved by blending thorium with uranium or plutonium, or using it in its pure form in conjunction with separate fuel rods containing uranium or plutonium.
