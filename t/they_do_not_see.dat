5|$|The vessels {{have four}} decks, upon {{which there are}} cabins and saloons for merchants. Several of these 'mysria' contain {{cupboards}} and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines. It often happens that a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, and <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in {{some parts of the}} ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when he lands, the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances {{on each side of the}} gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E
5|$|While neo-Keynesians {{integrated}} Keynes's {{ideas with}} neoclassical theory, post-Keynesians went in other directions. Post-Keynesians opposed the neoclassical synthesis and shared a fundamentalist interpretation of Keynes {{that sought to}} develop economic theories without classical elements. The core of post-Keynesian belief is the rejection of three axioms that are central to classical and mainstream Keynesian views: the neutrality of money, gross substitution, and the ergodic axiom. Post-Keynesians not only reject the neutrality {{of money in the}} short-run, they also see money as an important factor in the long-run, a view other Keynesians dropped in the 1970s. Gross substitution implies that goods are interchangeable. Relative price changes cause people to shift their consumption in proportion to the change. The ergodic axiom asserts that the future of the economy can be predicted based on the past and present market conditions. Without the ergodic assumption, agents are unable to form rational expectations, undermining new classical theory. In a non-ergodic economy, predictions are very hard to make and decision-making is hampered by uncertainty. Partly because of uncertainty, post-Keynesians take a different stance on sticky prices and wages than new Keynesians. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> nominal rigidities as an explanation for the failure of markets to clear. They instead think sticky prices and long-term contracts anchor expectations and alleviate uncertainty that hinders efficient markets. Post Keynesian economic policies emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the economy including safety nets and price stability. Hyman Minsky applied post-Keynesian notions of uncertainty and instability to a theory of financial crisis where investors increasingly take on debt until their returns can no longer pay the interest on leveraged assets, resulting in a financial crisis. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought mainstream attention to Minsky's work.|$|E
25|$|Like other Christian churches, Pentecostals {{believe that}} certain rituals or ceremonies were instituted as a pattern and command by Jesus in the New Testament. Pentecostals {{commonly}} call these ceremonies ordinances. Many Christians call these sacraments, but this term is not generally used by Pentecostals and certain other Protestants as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> ordinances as imparting grace. Instead the term sacerdotal ordinance {{is used to}} denote the distinctive belief that grace is received directly from God by the congregant with the officiant serving only to facilitate rather than acting as a conduit or vicar.|$|E

25|$|Green {{sea turtles}} {{tend to have}} good vision, well adapted to a life at sea. The turtles can see many colors, but are most {{sensitive}} to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> many colors in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are nearsighted because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater. Sea turtles have no external ear and only one ear bone, called the columella. With one ear bone, the turtles can only hear low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects {{to the roof of}} the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobson’s organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose.|$|E
500|$|The play {{repeatedly}} mocks Victorian {{traditions and}} social customs, {{marriage and the}} pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over-riding societal value, originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century. The play's very title, with its mocking paradox (serious people are so because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> trivial comedies), introduces the theme, it continues in the drawing room discussion, [...] "Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them," [...] says Algernon in Act 1; allusions are quick and from multiple angles.|$|E

500|$|The planet Earth is {{referred}} to as facing the social and environmental problems expected in contemporary society. The generation that boarded the ship intended their descendants to understand and value a terrestrial existence, but over time the words and images associated with being on a planet begin to lose meaning to those on the ship, who become adapted to a shipboard existence, and struggle to understand the motivations of the zeroth generation. Aboard the Discovery, the major religions of Earth are depicted as having gradually lost meaning, but have been replaced by the religious cult of Bliss, with members known as angels. The adherents of the cult believe that their purpose in life is to overcome their connections to a terrestrial existence. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> their belief as a religion, and believe that the world outside the ship is an illusion. Only the voyage itself, and not the origin or destination, matters. In contrast to much of Le Guin's science fiction, which explores interactions between humans and extraterrestrial beings, the characters in [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] deal with being literally [...] "extra-terrestrial", or disconnected from terrestrial life.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{are divided}} {{on the role of}} fate in the play. No {{consensus}} exists on whether the characters are truly fated to die together or whether the events take place by a series of unlucky chances. Arguments in favour of fate often refer to the description of the lovers as [...] "star-cross'd". [...] This phrase seems to hint that the stars have predetermined the lovers' future. John W. Draper points out the parallels between the Elizabethan belief in the four humours and the main characters of the play (for example, Tybalt as a choleric). Interpreting the text in the light of humours reduces the amount of plot attributed to chance by modern audiences. Still, other scholars see the play as a series of unlucky chances—many {{to such a degree that}} <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> it as a tragedy at all, but an emotional melodrama. Ruth Nevo believes the high degree to which chance is stressed in the narrative makes Romeo and Juliet a [...] "lesser tragedy" [...] of happenstance, not of character. For example, Romeo's challenging Tybalt is not impulsive; it is, after Mercutio's death, the expected action to take. In this scene, Nevo reads Romeo as being aware of the dangers of flouting social norms, identity, and commitments. He makes the choice to kill, not because of a tragic flaw, but because of circumstance.|$|E

"The Emperor's New Clothes" [...] (...) {{is a short}} tale {{written by}} Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, about two weavers who promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that they say is {{invisible}} {{to those who are}} unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent. When the emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes, no one dares to say that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> any suit of clothes on him for fear that they will be seen as [...] "unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent".

2500|$|In {{discussing}} womanist theory, {{one must}} acknowledge the racism that was perceived by {{black women in}} the feminist movement. This perception fuels two different conceptions of Womanism’s relationship with feminism. Some Womanists believe {{that the experience of}} Black women will not be validated by Feminists to be equal to the experience of White women because of the problematic way in which some feminists treated blackness throughout history. As such, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> Womanism as an extension of Feminism, but rather as a theoretical framework which exists independent of Feminist theory. This is a move from the thought of Black Feminists who have carved their own space in Feminism through academia and activism.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people choose}} not to wear any underpants, a {{practice}} {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "going commando", for comfort, to enable their outer garments (particularly those which are form-fitting) to look more flattering, to avoid creating a panty line, because they find it sexually exciting, or because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> any need for them. Certain types of clothes, such as cycling shorts and kilts, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underpants. This also applies for most clothes worn as nightwear and as swimwear. Some analysts have encouraged people with a higher than average libido to change their underwear more frequently than average due hygiene-related issues of by-products such as cowper's fluid and vaginal lubrication.|$|E

2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of altars exist in various Protestant denominations. Some Churches, such as the Lutheran, have altars very similar to Anglican or Catholic ones keeping with their more sacramental {{understanding}} of the Lord's Supper. Calvinist churches from Reformed, Baptist, Congregational, and Non-denominational backgrounds instead have a Communion Table adorned with a linen cloth, {{as well as an}} open Bible and a pair of candlesticks; it is not referred to as an [...] "altar" [...] because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> Holy Communion as sacrificial in any way. Such a table may be temporary, being moved into place only when there is a Communion Service. Some nondenominational churches have no altar or communion table, even if they retain the practice of the [...] "altar call" [...] that originated in the Methodist Church.|$|E
2500|$|According to Jan Edling, {{a former}} trade-unionist, {{the actual number}} of {{unemployed}} is far higher, and those figures are being suppressed by both the government and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation. In Edling's report he added that a further 3% of Swedes were occupied in state-organised job schemes, not in the private sector. He also claimed a further 700,000 Swedes are either on long-term sick leave or in early retirement. Edling asks how many of these people are in fact unemployed. According to his report, the [...] "actual unemployment" [...] rate hovers near 20%. Some critics disagree with this concept of [...] "actual" [...] unemployment, also termed [...] "broad unemployment", since <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> e.g. students who rather want a job, people on sick leave and military conscripts as [...] "unemployed".|$|E
2500|$|In Canada and abroad, the {{linguistic}} policy of Quebec {{is too often}} negatively perceived. The business community and the media in particular know it very little.
