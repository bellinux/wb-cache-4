"'Imagine {{that you}} are on a street with houses marked 1 through [...] There is a house in between (...) such that {{the sum of the}} house numbers to the left of it equals the sum of the house numbers to its right. If [...] is between 50 and 500, what are [...] and ?' This is a bivariate problem with {{multiple}} solutions. Ramanujan thought about it and gave the answer with a twist: He gave a continued fraction. The unusual part was that it was the solution to the whole class of problems. [...] Mahalanobis was astounded and asked how he did it. 'It is simple. <b>The</b> <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> heard the problem, I knew that the answer was a continued fraction. Which continued fraction, I asked myself. Then the answer came to my mind', Ramanujan replied." ...|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don’t have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I’ve never had it easy. I’m not like all you ... all those people who had it easy." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{restored}} the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, {{his home in}} Henley-on-Thames, where several of his music videos were filmed including [...] "Crackerbox Palace"; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of All Things Must Pass. He employed ten workers to maintain the [...] garden. Harrison commented on gardening {{as a form of}} escapism: [...] "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'" [...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: [...] "George is not disowning the Beatles... but {{it was a long time}} ago and actually a short part of his life." ...|$|E

500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'" [...] He graduated in 1987, {{at the age of}} 22.|$|E
500|$|Strickland {{was born}} in Blackshear, Georgia to Susan Strickland, a nurse, and Dee Strickland, a high school {{football}} coach, principal and superintendent. KaDee's birthname is Katherine Dee; her parents combined the K in Katherine with her father's name to make KaDee. She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, as she put it, [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it". During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader). She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: [...] " [...] <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like I fit my skin, I knew what I was here to do", Strickland said.|$|E
2500|$|Performing in Westerns was {{a return}} {{to what he had}} done earlier in his career, and McCrea enjoyed the genre. [...] In a 1978 interview, he said: I liked doing comedies, but as I got older I was better suited to do Westerns. Because I think it becomes un{{attractive}} for an older fellow trying to look young, falling in love with attractive girls in those kinds of situations...Anyway, I always felt so much more comfortable in the Western. <b>The</b> <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> got a horse and a hat and a pair of boots on, I felt easier. I didn't feel like I was an actor anymore. I felt like I was the guy out there doing it.|$|E
6000|$|... "My, that's a relief!" [...] sighed Andy. [...] "Somehow, at <b>the</b> last <b>minute,</b> <b>I</b> {{was afraid}} I had fallen down completely. There {{were a few}} {{examples}} in algebra that were regular stickers for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did," [...] replied Hank. [...] "One <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> {{was outside}} of Oz--and <b>the</b> next <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> was inside! That {{was enough to}} give me a nervous shock, as you may guess; but to find myself able to talk, as Betsy does, is a marvel that {{staggers}} me." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{album is}} DeBarge's first studio release in 16 years, {{following}} {{a period of}} drug addiction and legal problems. After his release from prison in 2009, he was introduced by his manager, Pete Farmer, to music executives Ron Fair and Jimmy Iovine at Geffen and Interscope Records. DeBarge sang a cappella in his audition for the label. He later said of the meeting and audition, [...] "we put a plan together and <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> stepped into the studio I was so nervous, but I felt so much power just coming through me soon as I hit the microphone it was like, it was still there". He subsequently signed a recording deal with the label and began working on Second Chance.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was as a}} {{rewrite man}} for the Daily News in 1947 that Smith had what he later called [...] "perhaps my finest hour as a newspaperman": his stories on the infamous Elizabeth Short murder case. The police beat {{reporter}} phoned in the bulletin to Smith, who recounted the moment this way in his book Jack Smith's L.A.: [...] "Within <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> had written {{what may have been}} the first sentence ever written on the Black Dahlia case. I can't remember it word for word, but my lead went pretty much like this: 'The nude body of a young woman, neatly cut in two at the waist, was found early today on a vacant lot near Crenshaw and Exposition Boulevards.'" [...] His editor added one adjective, making Short [...] "a beautiful young woman ... Our city editor, of course, no more knew what the unfortunate young woman had looked like than I did ... But the lesson was clear. On the Daily News, at least, all young women whose nude bodies were found in two pieces on vacant lots were beautiful. I never forgot it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The single [...] "Cannonball" [...] {{was written}} by Sia Furler. Originally, this song wasn't meant for Michele; it was {{introduced}} to her a month after her boyfriend's death and she had an instant connection with its lyrics because they encapsulated her feelings in that moment. Michele has stated, [...] "I just felt that [...] "Cannonball" [...] was the perfect first song for people to hear from this record. It just really explains where I am right now and it's been such an inspirational song for me. <b>The</b> <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> heard the song, I had a physical reaction to it. For me, it's been my strength. I listen to it every day. I know it was brought into my life for a reason. It's really been so helpful for me and I hope it's the same for other people as it's been for me." [...] Because of this, Furler gave the song to her. Furler also wrote the song [...] "Battlefield" [...] especially for Michele, and co-wrote [...] "If You Say So" [...] with her. [...] "If You Say So" [...] was confirmed to be dedicated to Cory Monteith, Michele's Glee co-star and late boyfriend, who died in July 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Riccardo Freda was {{not proud}} of the film and was unhappy with the cast. He later {{said that he had}} {{initially}} wanted [...] "Roger Moore in the lead, but at <b>the</b> last <b>minute</b> <b>I</b> got Luigi Pistilli." ...|$|R
