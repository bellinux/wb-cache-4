5|$|The 1891 {{constitution}} added {{a provision}} that the governor must specify the reason for any specially-called legislative session, and that no other business could be considered during the session. There is, however, no constitutional requirement that the legislature conduct any business during the called session. In 2007, Republican governor Ernie Fletcher called the Assembly into session to consider {{a long list of}} items. The Democratically-controlled House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough that they could not wait until the regular session convened; they claimed that Fletcher was calling the session only to boost his sagging poll numbers before the upcoming election in which he faced a challenge from Democrat Steve Beshear. The House convened on the day appointed and adjourned an hour later without <b>transacting</b> any business.|$|E

25|$|While the {{caliphate}} {{continued its}} rapid expansion, Umar laid {{the foundations of}} a political structure that could hold it together. He created the Diwan, a bureau for <b>transacting</b> government affairs. The military was brought directly under state control and into its pay. Crucially, in conquered lands, Umar did not require that non-Muslim populations convert to Islam, nor did he try to centralize government. Instead, he allowed subject populations to retain their religion, language and customs, and he left their government relatively untouched, imposing only a governor (amir) and a financial officer called an amil. These new posts were integral to the efficient network of taxation that financed the empire.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset of non-listed firms that {{identifies}} the banks the firms <b>transact</b> with, {{we examine the}} effects of the largest-ever bank merger in Japan, that between Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (BTM) and UFJ Bank (UFJ) in 2005. We focus on how the merger affected firms through their firm-bank relationships. Specifically, we examine whether there are any differences in how the availability of loans evolved over time for firms that prior to the merger <b>transacted</b> with both of the merged banks, with one of the merged banks, or with none of them. We find the following: (1) Firms that had <b>transacted</b> with both BTM and UFJ saw their borrowing costs increase by 40 bp relative to those that had <b>transacted</b> with neither of them. (2) Firms that <b>transacted</b> with one of the two banks saw their borrowing costs increase by a smaller but still significant margin of 20 bp relative to those that had <b>transacted</b> with neither of them. And (3) we do not find {{a significant difference in the}} extent that borrowing costs increased between firms that <b>transacted</b> with the acquiring bank (BTM) and those that <b>transacted</b> with the acquired bank (UFJ). These results suggest that the bank merger increased firm's borrowing costs partly through the exogenous decrease in the number of firm-bank relationships and partly through changes in the organizational structure of the merged bank, including a consolidation of the branch network. グローバルCOEプログラム = Global COE Progra...|$|R

25|$|Each bill {{goes through}} several stages in each house {{including}} consideration {{by a committee}} and advice from the Government Accountability Office. Most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month. Almost all standing committee meetings for <b>transacting</b> business must {{be open to the}} public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting. A committee might call for public hearings on important bills. Each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill. Then, a bill may go to what's called a mark-up session where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions. Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is tabled then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called clean bill with a new number. Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.|$|E

500|$|The early Empire was monetized to a near-universal extent, in {{the sense}} of using money as a way to express prices and debts. The sestertius (plural sestertii, English [...] "sesterces", symbolized as HS) was the basic unit of {{reckoning}} value into the 4th century, though the silver denarius, worth four sesterces, was used also for accounting beginning in the Severan dynasty. The smallest coin commonly circulated was the bronze as (plural asses), one-fourth sestertius. Bullion and ingots seem not to have counted as pecunia, [...] "money," [...] and were used only on the frontiers for <b>transacting</b> business or buying property. Romans in the 1st and 2nd centuries counted coins, rather than weighing them—an indication that the coin was valued on its face, not for its metal content. This tendency towards fiat money led eventually to the debasement of Roman coinage, with consequences in the later Empire. The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and market integration. The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the money supply for trading or saving.|$|E
