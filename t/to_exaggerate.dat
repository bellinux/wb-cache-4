5|$|Another {{criticism}} is that outcomes {{are presented in}} terms of relative risk reduction <b>to</b> <b>exaggerate</b> the apparent benefits of the treatment. For example, he writes, if four people out of 1,000 will {{have a heart attack}} within the year, but on statins only two will, that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction. But if expressed as absolute risk reduction, it is a reduction of just 0.2 percent.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the Second Coming of Christ. He believed that five of the seven predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would be fulfilled by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency <b>to</b> <b>exaggerate</b> and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} NZEF in September 1919, Logan {{returned}} to his duties with the New Zealand Staff Corps {{but after a few}} months he was posted to the retired list. He chose to retire to England, settling on an estate he purchased in Devon. Beginning to develop a tendency <b>to</b> <b>exaggerate</b> his contributions to the war effort, he wrote a foreword to a history of the Samoa Expeditionary Force, which was published in 1924. In 1928, Logan moved to Scotland, taking up a family estate in Lanarkshire upon the death of his cousin. He died in Seaton, in the county of Devon, on 4 February 1935, but was buried in the family crypt in Lanarkshire.|$|E

This is better known as 'making {{a big deal out of}} nothing.' 'Whereas probability overestimation refers <b>to</b> <b>exaggerating</b> the [...] "likelihood" [...] of an event, catastrophizing refers <b>to</b> <b>exaggerating</b> the [...] "importance" [...] of the event'. Closely related 'is overgeneralizing, where one takes a single negative event and see it as a never-ending pattern of defeat'.|$|R

5|$|In England, ruined medieval castles became fashionable {{again in}} the middle of the 18th century. They were {{considered}} an interesting counterpoint to Palladian classical architecture, and gave a degree of medieval allure to their owners. Some keeps were modified <b>to</b> <b>exaggerate</b> this effect: Hawarden, for example, was remodelled to appear taller but also more decayed, the better to produce a good silhouette. The interest continued and, in the late 18th and 19th century, it became fashionable to build intact, replica castles in England, resulting in what A. Rowan has called the Norman style of new castle building, characterised by the inclusion of large keeps; the final replica keep to be built in this way was at Penrhyn between 1820 and 1840.|$|E
5|$|Stroheim {{was known}} <b>to</b> <b>exaggerate</b> events {{from his life}} and create myths about himself, such as his fictitious aristocratic origins and {{military}} record in Austria. He claimed that shortly after having moved to the US in the early 1910s, {{he had found a}} copy of McTeague in a motel in New York and had read it in one sitting. He also said that wanting to adapt the book inspired him to make a career in filmmaking. Georges Sadoul later stated that Stroheim had first read the novel in 1914, while living in poverty in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|When Linda was {{predicted}} to turn towards the northeast, it was forecast to move ashore in southern California as a weak tropical storm, {{which would have}} made Linda the first to do so since a tropical storm in 1939. The Oxnard, California National Weather Service office issued public information and special weather statements that discussed the possible impact of Linda on southern California. The advisories mentioned forecasting uncertainty, and advised the media not <b>to</b> <b>exaggerate</b> the storm. The office noted a threat for significant rainfall—possibly causing flash flooding—as well as high surf. To prepare for possible flooding, workers cleaned storm drains and prepared sandbags for coastal properties.|$|E

5|$|In 1476 {{the castle}} passed to John Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, who {{probably}} began {{the sequence of}} improvements to the castle during the Tudor period. Under the Howards the castle was extensively modernised; fashionable brick was used to improve parts of the castle; ornamental chimneys were added; the battlements were reduced in size <b>to</b> <b>exaggerate</b> the apparent height of the walls, and the Howard coat of arms {{was added to the}} gatehouse. The Great Chamber was probably built across the Inner Court at this time, linking the Great Hall with the chapel and chambers {{on the east side of}} the castle, and by 1524 there were at least 29 different rooms in the castle. The drawbridge outside the gatehouse was replaced with the current permanent bridge between 1524–47; by this time a half-moon defensive structure had been built in stone to defend it. A pleasure garden had been built in the Lower Court by the 16th century, with several ornamental ponds and terraced walkways – the garden would probably have also had fruit trees, herb gardens and fountains. Another pleasure garden was built in the Bailey, and a second bridge built across the moat to allow access to it directly from the Inner Court. The Prison Tower was redesigned to become a viewing gallery for the new formal gardens below.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} multidimensional nature of group {{identity}} and how different dimensions are uniquely related to ingroup and outgroup evaluations, intergroup bias, and perceived intergroup conflict. A three-dimensional model of group identity—consisting of a cognitive, evaluative, and affective-ties component—was supported across ascribed, achieved, and face-to-face groups. As predicted, {{of the three}} dimensions, affective ties to the ingroup was the best overall predictor of intergroup bias. In support of social identity theory, {{the impact of the}} evaluative and cognitive dimensions on group attitudes was significantly moderated by perceptions of conflict. Additionally, as predicted, group identification led <b>to</b> <b>exaggerated</b> positive evaluations of the ingroup, while perceived conflict led <b>to</b> <b>exaggerated</b> negative evaluations of the outgroup. Theoretical implications and future research avenues are discussed...|$|R

25|$|On 12 May, {{three days}} before the invasion, David Ben-Gurion was told by his chief {{military}} advisers (who over-estimated the size of the Arab armies and the numbers and efficiency of the troops who would be committed– much as the Arab generals tended <b>to</b> <b>exaggerate</b> Jewish fighters' strength) that Israel's chances of winning a war against the Arab states were only about even.|$|E

This notion was also widespread amongst Kurdish tribal leaders, many of whom disagreed with Qazi's leadership.|$|E
