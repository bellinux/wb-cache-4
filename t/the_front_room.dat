In 1955, Phillips set up a recording studio called Phillips' Sound Recording Services.|$|E

The first floor bedroom would have been used for John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs room would was used {{for the rest of the}} children.

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{building}} is not well documented, {{although the majority of}} the present stone house was constructed in the 15th century on the site of a 12th-century wooden building. The current front wall was added in the 16th century. It {{has been used as a}} merchant's house and possibly a shop and school. It was thought that it was the venue for court proceedings, hence the title Tribunal, however there is no evidence this ever occurred. One of the ground floor rooms still has the window and ceiling panels from the Elizabethan era. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> upstairs has an arched braced, wooden, truss roof.|$|E

Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E

He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due {{to a decline in}} demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E

5|$|The 1828 {{construction}} {{features a}} central hall with three {{rooms on the}} east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail {{is believed to have been}} used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> as a public reception room and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the rooms from each other.|$|E
5|$|Cullompton Manor House is a grade II* listed {{building}} with sections built in 1603 (dated panel and initials TT for Thomas Trock {{on the top}} corner of {{the front of the}} house) and 1718 (on a lead cistern head of a drainpipe, are the letters (L) S/WT (R) and the date 1718). It was originally a private residence and now forms part of the Manor House Hotel. It has a jettied half timbered front with four gables and stone end walls with upper windows on carved brackets. It was probably built in the sixteenth century but was refurbished in 1603 for Thomas Trock, a clothier. The original structure consisted only of the front part, in which there were three rooms and a passage on the ground floor, three rooms opening into each other on the floor above, and above again. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>room</b> on the left was the former hall with large oak panels of the Queen Anne period, and a moulded and beamed ceiling. Part of an earlier newel stair which descended to the hall or kitchen survives above a back staircase. The house was remodelled in 1718 for William Sellock. At the front of the building is a hooded shell porch of the early 18th century supported on pilasters and the back of house is also early 18th century of red and blue brick, with windows with thick glazing bars beneath a hipped slate roof with coved eaves. It was given the name of The Manor House in 1850 by J. S. Upcott who owned the property at that time. During World War II it was requisitioned by the army and used to billet officers. The adjacent house, Veryards, was originally a separate residence but was bought by the owners of the Manor House Hotel and incorporated into the hotel in the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|The {{first floor}} of the main block is a four-room plan of two larger rooms on the east side, with corner {{fireplaces}} sharing a single chimney, and two smaller west rooms. Each pair of rooms is of equal width, but <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rooms</b> are slightly deeper. A later, second north-south partition, no longer in place, once created a center-hall plan. Today all rooms connect with adjacent rooms. The original staircase, in the southeast corner of <b>the</b> larger <b>front</b> <b>room,</b> enclosed with one set of winders and at least one stop outside the enclosure, was removed in the late 1960s.|$|R
