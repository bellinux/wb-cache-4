5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavity,</b> allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E
5|$|The artery is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima artery is of surgical importance; {{due to its}} relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding in surgery of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of the artery is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because the artery is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin {{from one of the}} bigger vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss. The artery, if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} a lizard in the German specimen's <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavity</b> show that Compsognathus preyed on small vertebrates. Marsh, who {{examined}} the specimen in 1881, thought that this small skeleton in the Compsognathus belly was an embryo, but in 1903, Franz Nopcsa concluded {{that it was a}} lizard. Ostrom identified the remains as belonging to a lizard of the genus Bavarisaurus, which he concluded was a fast and agile runner owing to its long tail and limb proportions. This in turn led to the conclusion that its predators, Compsognathus, must have had sharp vision and the ability to rapidly accelerate and outrun the lizard. The Bavarisaurus is in a single piece, indicating that the Compsognathus must have swallowed its prey whole. The French specimen's gastric contents consist of unidentified lizards or sphenodontids.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of double-lumen endo-bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during thoracic surgery, as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main {{adaptations of}} the {{pinniped}} circulatory system for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins {{to increase their}} capacity. Retia mirabilia form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavity</b> and the body periphery. These tissue masses, which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled veins, act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen stores for use during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have high amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored in their blood and muscles. This allows them to stay submerged {{for long periods of}} time while still having enough oxygen. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that make up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs. To keep their blood pressure stable, phocids have an elastic aorta that dissipates some energy of each heartbeat.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavity</b> is {{the space}} inside the chest that {{contains}} the lungs, heart, and numerous major blood vessels. On {{each side of the}} cavity, a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung (visceral pleura) and also lines the inside of the chest wall (parietal pleura). Normally, the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid. The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space. Despite the low pressure in the pleural space, air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air-containing passage, and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space. Therefore, a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter, through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself, or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas.|$|E

5|$|Some mammals {{have a large}} larynx {{and thus}} a {{low-pitched}} voice, namely the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) where the larynx can take up {{the entirety of the}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavity</b> while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen. Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the low-pitched roars of big cats. The production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) and baleen whales. Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produced ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea. Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds, they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to increase the volume of sound.|$|E
5|$|The trachea and bronchi {{form the}} tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is {{situated}} between {{the lower end}} of the larynx and the center of the chest, where it splits into the two bronchi at a ridge called the carina. The trachea is stabilized and kept open by rings made of cartilage that surround the front and sides of the structure; these rings are not closed and do not surround the back, which is made of membrane. The bronchi split into smaller branches and then to bronchioles that supply air to the alveoli, the tiny air-filled sacs in the lungs responsible for absorbing oxygen. An arbitrary division can be made between the intrathoracic and cervical trachea at the thoracic inlet, an opening at the top of the <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavity.</b> Anatomical structures that surround and protect the tracheobronchial tree include the lungs, the esophagus, large blood vessels, the rib cage, the thoracic spine, and the sternum. Children have softer tracheas and a more elastic tracheobronchial trees than adults; this elasticity, which helps protect the structures from injury when they are compressed, may contribute to the lower incidence of TBI in children.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{spite of}} using heparin-coated extracorporeal circuits, {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) is still {{associated with an}} extensive thrombin generation, which is only partially suppressed {{by the use of}} high dosages of heparin. Recent studies have focused on the origins of this thrombotic stimulus and the possible role of retransfused suctioned blood from the <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavities</b> on the activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. The present study was designed to find during CPB an association between retransfusion of suctioned blood from the pericardium and pleural space, containing activated factor VIIa and systemic thrombin generation. Methods Blood samples taken from 12 consenting patients who had elective cardiac surgery were assayed for plasma factor VIIa, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2), and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) concentrations. Blood aspirated from the pericardium and pleural space was collected separately, assayed for F 1 + 2, TAT, and factor VIIa and retransfused to the patient after the aorta occlusion. Results After systemic heparinization and during CPB thrombin generation was minimal, as indicated by the lower than base line plasma levels of F 1 + 2, and TAT after correction for hemodilution. In contrast, blood aspirated from the <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavities</b> had significantly higher levels of factor VIIa, F 1 + 2, and TAT compared to the simultaneous samples from the blood circulation (P 1 + 2, and TAT rose significantly from 1. 6 to 2. 9 nmol/L (P = 0. 002) and from 5. 1 to 37. 5 μg/L (P = 0. 01), respectively. The increase in both F 1 + 2, and TAT levels correlated significantly with the amount of retransfused suctioned blood (r = 0. 68, P = 0. 021 and r = 0. 90, P = 0. 001, respectively). However, the circulating factor VIIa levels did not correlate with TAT and F 1 + 2 levels. Conclusions These data suggest that blood aspirated from the <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavities</b> during CPB is highly thrombogenic. Retransfusion of this blood may, therefore, promote further systemic thrombin generation during CPB. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{the main}} muscle of respiration and functions in breathing.

40|$|Abstract. At necropsy, a 7 -year-old Holstein cow, {{clinically}} diagnosed via rectal palpation {{as having}} ma-lignant abdominal neoplasia {{was found to}} have many metastatic tumors of various sizes in the abdominal and <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavities</b> and in the liver, lung, kidney, adrenal, uterus, and lymph nodes. These tumors were examined by histologic and immunohistochemical methods using anti-human myoglobin, anti-bovine myoglobin, and anti-desmin sera. Tumors were diagnosed as undifferentiated alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas. The tumors in the abdominal and <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavities</b> differed histologically from the metastases in organs. The former tumors consisted of only undifferentiated cells, most of which did not stain positively for desmin or myoglobin. The metastatic tumors contained a few rhabdomyoblastie cells that stained positively for desmin and myoglobin. Tumor tissues from the cow were transplanted and propagated through six passages in athymic nude mice. After one passage, the transplanted tumor histologi cally resembled those from the abdominal serosa and consisted of cells with scanty cytoplasm with an alveolar arrangement. Cells from this tumor stained positively for desmin and negatively for myoglobin. After two passages through nude mice, tumor cells were of two distinct histologic types: those cells with scanty cytoplasm and elongated cells with plentiful eosinophilic cytoplasm. Both of these cells stained positively for both desmin and myoglobin. After six passages, cross striations were detected in neoplastic cells by electron microscopy.

25|$|Cavity {{expansion}} {{happens in}} two extremes, along with intermediary forms. When the lower ribs are stabilized {{and the central}} tendon of the diaphragm is mobile, a contraction brings the insertion (central tendon) towards the origins and pushes the lower cavity towards the pelvis, allowing the <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavity</b> to expand downward. This is often called belly breathing. When the central tendon is stabilized and the lower ribs are mobile, a contraction lifts the origins (ribs) up towards the insertion (central tendon) which {{works in conjunction with}} other muscles to allow the ribs to slide and the <b>thoracic</b> <b>cavity</b> to expand laterally and upwards.|$|E

This produces a sensation of pain that may extend to the patient's shoulders. For an appendectomy, the right shoulder can be particularly painful.
