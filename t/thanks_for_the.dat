5|$|Standing {{over his}} vanquished opponent, Carrouges {{remained}} on the field as the crowd cheered him and pages rushed to bind his wound. He then kneeled before the King, who presented him with a prize of a thousand francs {{in addition to a}} royal income of 200 francs a year. Only then did he greet his wife, in an emotional scene before the thousands of spectators. Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges then, with the crowd following in a great procession, rode from the abbey to the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, to give <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> victory.|$|E
5|$|The party {{reached the}} capital of Liaodong on July 2, left four days later on July 6, and on July 12 Choe's party finally crossed the Yalu River and entered Joseon Korea. While the Grand Canal had its post stations, canal locks, ramps, moles, and paved towpaths, the land route from Beijing to the Yalu River was less {{elaborate}} but still featured the necessary distance markers and walled stations. Within a month of Choe's return to Korea, the Joseon court under King Seongjong (r. 1469–1494) sent an embassy to the Ming court of China {{in a gesture of}} <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ming court's cordial treatment of Choe and his crew and providing safe travel for them.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} {{the battle of the}} Glorious First of June the {{previous}} year, rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail, the only officer commended being Bridport's own flag captain William Domett, whose ship had only joined the action in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the Parliament of Great Britain, which voted <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Gardner of Queen. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral John Colpoys of London, whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's. Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, William James noting that Douglas and Queen Charlotte were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, was ashore at the court-martial of Captain Anthony Molloy and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet.|$|E

5|$|On 7 August, a {{fleet of}} Persian rafts {{ferrying}} troops across the Bosphorus were surrounded and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the Golden Horn, while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus' galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from August 6 to the 7th also failed. With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to seriously threaten Constantinople again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over. In <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lifting of the siege and the supposed divine protection of the Virgin Mary, the celebrated Akathist Hymn was written by an unknown author, possibly Patriarch Sergius or George of Pisidia.|$|E

25|$|In {{an entry}} of the Shoku Nihongi, dated April 14, 741, {{it was noted}} that gifts of land, servants, horses and Buddhist sutras were made to the Hachiman shrine and for the {{construction}} of a pagoda.

While not directly related to the rebellion, Shōmu's edict of 741, in which he decreed that provincial temples be established, is another indication for the desolate state of the country following a number of calamities.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{a loaf of}} leavened {{bread is}} used as an emblem of Christ's body – though many {{assemblies}} use unleavened bread or matzos. After giving <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loaf, it is broken and circulated to the quiet, seated congregation. Congregants will break off small pieces, or take small pieces of broken unleavened bread, as it is passed, and eat them individually (i.e. not waiting for a group invitation to consume it together). At this time, the worshipper usually engages in silent prayerful worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|The first {{recorded}} instance of perpetual adoration formally began in Avignon, France on 11 September 1226. To celebrate and give <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{victory over the}} Albigensians in the later battles of the Albigensian Crusade, King Louis VIII asked that the sacrament be placed {{on display at the}} Chapel of the Holy Cross. The overwhelming number of adorers brought the local bishop, Pierre de Corbie, to suggest that the exposition be continued indefinitely. With the permission of Pope Honorius III, the idea was ratified and the adoration continued there practically uninterrupted until the chaos of the French Revolution halted it from 1792.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these festivals, ceremonies marking rites of passage are also performed within the shrines. Two such ceremonies are {{the birth of a}} child and the Shichi-Go-San. When a child is born they are brought to a shrine so that they can be initiated as a new believer and the kami can bless them and their future life. The Shichi-Go-San (the Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three- or seven-year-old girls. It is a time for these young children to personally offer <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> kami’s protection and to pray for continued health.|$|E
25|$|Although {{antagonism}} {{about the}} expense of Byzantine domination had long persisted within Italy, the political rupture was set in motion in earnest in 726 by the iconoclasm of Emperor Leo III the Isaurian. The exarch was lynched while trying to enforce the iconoclastic edict and Pope Gregory II saw iconoclasm as {{the latest in a}} series of imperial heresies. In 731, his successor, Pope Gregory III organized a synod in Rome (attended by the Archbishop of Ravenna), which declared iconoclasm punishable by excommunication. When the exarch donated six columns of onyx to the shrine of St. Peter in <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pope's assistance in his release from the Lombards, Gregory III defiantly had the material crafted into icons.|$|E
