40|$|Elastic and {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} La 2 NiO 4 +delta have been assessed. Fracture stress and elastic modulus of porous La 2 NiO 4 +delta were evaluated from room temperature (RT) up <b>to</b> 900 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C {{on the basis}} of 4 -point bending tests. Both parameters increase slightly from RT <b>to</b> 700 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. However, at higher temperatures the elastic modulus decreases, whereas the fracture stress increases. In addition, elastic modulus and damping/internal friction of dense specimens were measured by a resonance method. A strong change of elastic modulus and internal friction between RT and 100 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C appears <b>to</b> be related <b>to</b> <b>an</b> orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition. No indications of phase transition can be observed at higher temperatures.

5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains.

5|$|Barcelona had {{virtually}} secured their La Liga title by {{the start of}} 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated {{in the second half of}} the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova's absence due to ill health. After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi. Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13million. He wore the captain's armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff.

5|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire, roads in the region deteriorated. Only the Via Sclavonica is known to have existed in the region by year 1030.

From 18091813, the TriestePula route was rebuilt by the First French Empire, after the French captured the entire region from Venice and the Habsburgs. Upgrades to the regional road network continued after the Austrian Empire acquired Istria at the 18141815 Congress of Vienna. By 1830, the road network in Istria had expanded <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> that would not change for a century and a half.

5|$|In {{central and}} {{northern}} Italy and in Flanders, {{the rise of}} towns that were <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>degree</b> self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities {{on the shores of}} the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean. Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{shoulder}} manipulation and arthroscopic arthrolysis with glenohumeral steroid injections in patients affected by idiopathic adhesive shoulder capsulitis. In this prospective study we randomly assigned patients <b>to</b> enter group <b>A</b> (23 patients, shoulder manipulation and arthroscopic arthrolysis) and group B (21 patients, glenohumeral steroid injections).
