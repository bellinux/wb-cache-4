The sex-driven story ultimately had {{little in common with}} <b>the</b> <b>original</b> film.|$|E

Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use <b>the</b> <b>original</b> character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports <b>the</b> <b>original</b> 320×200 resolution, as well as <b>the</b> <b>original</b> background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as <b>the</b> <b>original,</b> which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E

50|$|On January 11, 2013, it was {{announced}} that a back-door pilot focused on <b>the</b> <b>Originals,</b> starring Joseph Morgan as Klaus and titled <b>The</b> <b>Originals</b> would air sometime in April for a potential series pick-up for the 2013-2014 season. On April 26, 2013, <b>The</b> <b>Originals</b> was confirmed for a full series. This second spin-off attempt will be overseen by Julie Plec, with no involvement by Kevin Williamson. <b>The</b> <b>Originals</b> was officially picked up by The CW on April 26, 2013, for the 2013-14 season. Season one of <b>The</b> <b>Originals</b> was set to premiere on Tuesday, October 15. However, on July 29, 2013, The CW announced that the series premiere would instead air on October 3, 2013, following the fifth-season premiere of The Vampire Diaries in order to attract fans of the series. On October 10, 2013, the CW ordered three additional scripts for the series. On November 11, 2013, the CW decided to order a full season for <b>The</b> <b>Originals.</b>|$|R

This provoked an attack on Van Dam by the other New Breed members, until <b>the</b> <b>Originals</b> made <b>the</b> save. At WrestleMania, the New Breed members lost to <b>the</b> ECW <b>Originals</b> in an eight-man tag team match, but on the following episode of ECW on Sci Fi, they defeated <b>the</b> ECW <b>Originals</b> in an extreme rules rematch.|$|R

5|$|An early {{design was}} for a version with a {{secondary}} hull, but {{it appeared to be}} too similar to the ship seen in <b>The</b> <b>Original</b> Series.

Following that concept, the designers took the styling of the USS Enterprise from <b>The</b> <b>Original</b> Series and updated it, but ultimately it looked too much like a simple update to the same vessel.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> game, {{had returned}} to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> and add as many new features as possible. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that <b>the</b> <b>original</b> game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E

5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> idea was to change <b>the</b> <b>original</b> red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as <b>the</b> <b>original</b> platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in <b>the</b> <b>original</b> looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Pei {{designed}} a new museum for Luxembourg, the Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, {{commonly known as}} the Mudam. Drawing from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> shape of the Fort Thüngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.|$|E

5|$|Before {{developing}} the route west of Aspen, the state turned its attention the other way. In 1927 it rebuilt the old stage road over Independence Pass to Twin Lakes and designated {{it part of}} Highway 82, closing it in winters to avoid the maintenance costs. Most of it followed <b>the</b> <b>original</b> route; however in some places it deviated. The largest section of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> remains three miles (5km) below the pass on the east approach. The foundation of the gatekeeper's house remains, {{as well as some}} of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> toll gate.|$|E
5|$|Bullfrog Productions {{developed}} Dungeon Keeper 2 {{with a team}} {{of around}} fifty people. The team included people involved in <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Dungeon Keeper, including Richard Ridings and programmer Alex Peters. Electronic Arts wanted to capitalize on <b>the</b> <b>original</b> game's success. Producer Nick Goldsworthy believed the key to success was carrying over aspects of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> game and adding new things. A project manager from Mitsubishi assisted the team in management of attaining milestones, and according to Goldsworthy, this taught the team a lot about the practices employed by major companies regarding game development.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle Remastered {{retains its}} {{two-dimensional}} cartoon-style art, redrawn at higher resolution for modern computers. The high resolution character art was updated {{by a team}} led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan. Keim's team used many of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> sketches of characters and assets from the two and emulated their style with improvements for modern graphics systems. Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in high resolution. As with the Grim Fandango remaster, the player can switch back and forth between <b>the</b> <b>original</b> graphics and the high-resolution version. The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu, a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age, but the player can opt to switch back to <b>the</b> <b>original</b> interface. The game's soundtrack has been redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system. There is an option to listen to commentary from <b>the</b> <b>original</b> creators, including Schafer, Grossman, Chan, McConnell, Ahern, and Bajakian. The remaster contains the fully playable version of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> Maniac Mansion, though no enhancements have been made to that game-within-a-game.|$|E
