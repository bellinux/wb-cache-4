5|$|I think I can't {{be happy}} if I'm the only one that's getting {{published}} by Random House when I know there are such magnificent writers – both Latinos and Latinas, both Chicanos and Chicanas – in the U.S. whose books are not published by mainstream presses or whom the mainstream isn't even aware of. And, you know, if my success means that other presses will {{take a second look}} at these writers... and publish them in larger numbers, <b>then</b> <b>our</b> ship will come in.|$|E
5|$|When a party {{calling itself}} Conservative {{can think of}} {{nothing better than to}} outbid the Government's {{election}} promises; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of inflationary results... when in short, the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty-one years... <b>then</b> <b>our</b> political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the improbable chance of quick victory.|$|E

25|$|Dobie {{states that}} two chapels existed, one at Lainshaw {{and one at}} Chapeltoun, however he may have {{confused}} the term 'attached' which can mean that {{it was on the}} land of or had been endowed by the owner or the Lord of the Barony, rather than necessarily being in close proximity to the castle/house of Lainshaw. If Patersons statement implying that only one chapel existed and that it was at Chapelton is correct, and he was brought up locally, <b>then</b> <b>our</b> knowledge {{of the history of the}} Chapel of St. Mary is greatly increased.|$|E
25|$|Since {{classical}} times {{a question}} has remained constant in philosophical debate (which is sometimes {{seen as a}} conflict between movements called Platonism and Aristotelianism) concerning the role of reason in confirming truth. People use logic, deduction, and induction, to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered more certain than sense perceptions on their own. On the other hand, if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions, <b>then,</b> <b>our</b> most logical conclusions can never {{be said to be}} certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.|$|E

500|$|Before filming began, {{several of}} the main cast members were sent to a boot camp in South Africa and went through {{intensive}} and rigorous military training by former SAS and SBS soldiers. Stapleton and Winchester had more training than Birthistle, who {{just wanted to make}} sure she could at least be a believable soldier. The actors were trained in several aspects including running, teamwork, and weapons. Mealing meanwhile, did not go through as much training as the other actors, but did spend mornings training with a commander for the SBS who is also a military adviser on the show. Winchester recalled, [...] "Sully and I would meet every morning at 6am. We would run to a chosen location and on the way we had to memorise street names and directions and <b>then</b> <b>our</b> trainers would say 'that car that you just passed what was the licence plate number?' Our trainers were ex-SAS guys who made us study everything in detail, for example, we learnt step by step how to enter a room in twos, then alone. At the same time, we had to be constantly aware of where our weapon was trained." ...|$|E

We are even scared to talk." [...] Fr. Joseph Valiaparambil, Bishop of Belthangady, also said that Christian community of Belthangady was deeply hurt and shocked at the attacks, saying that [...] "We strongly condemn the act. We are not violent and do not believe in violence. We respect the administration and the law of the country. We respect all religions. We, the Christian minority community, need protection from kinds of anti-social, anti-religious activities". The community leaders in a press conference also appealed internationally, stating [...] "we want to bring to the notice of the world and human right commissions and authorities in Canada to use their diplomatic channels about the total collapse of law and order in Mangalore and other parts of India, and the failure of the state to protect the lives of the clergy and the minority community".|$|E
