5|$|Apeomyoides savagei was {{described}} as a new genus and species by Kent Smith, Richard Cifelli, and Nicholas Czaplewski in 2006. The generic name, Apeomyoides, adds the Greek suffix -ides, indicating similarity, to the name of the related genus Apeomys, while the specific name, savagei, honors Donald E. Savage for his work on fossil mammals and for assistance to Smith. In the same paper, <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> argued in favor of apeomyine affinities for Arikareeomys.|$|E

With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honoured. While the pace of research was easing as the war entered its final phase, <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> were still in great demand, and it fell to Anderson, Cherwell and Sir Edward Appleton, the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for Tube Alloys, to prise {{them away from the}} wartime projects in which they were invariably engaged.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different from those of other tooth-based taxa.|$|E

5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Session {{also had}} a {{negative}} impact on several leading Soviet academic neuroscientists, such as Pyotr Anokhin, Aleksey Speransky, Lina Stern, Ivan Beritashvili, and Leon Orbeli. They were labeled as anti-Pavlovians, anti-materialists and reactionaries and subsequently they were dismissed from their positions. In addition to losing their laboratories some of <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> were subjected to torture in prison. The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged for a period due to this loss of personnel. The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come. Pseudo-science took control.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E

5|$|Apeomyoides is {{a member}} of the Eomyidae, a diverse rodent family that is now extinct. Eomyids first {{appeared}} in the Middle Eocene (~47 million years ago, mya) in North America, where they existed until the end of the Miocene (~5 mya). In Europe, they survived a little longer, until the end of the Pliocene (~2–3 mya). Apeomyoides is further part of a distinctive subgroup of eomyids known as the Apeomyinae. The first apeomyine to be discovered was Apeomys tuerkheimae, named in 1968 based on fossils from the Early Miocene of Germany, and later discoveries have expanded the range of Apeomys and similar taxa. In 1998, Oldřich Fejfar and colleagues reviewed Apeomys and identified a second, related genus Megapeomys, from the Early Miocene of Germany, the Czech Republic, and Japan. <b>These</b> <b>scientists</b> also named a new eomyid subfamily, Apeomyinae, to house Apeomys and Megapeomys. The Japanese Megapeomys was named as a separate species, Megapeomys repenningi, in 2011. Further apeomyines have been identified in North America: Megapeomys bobwilsoni from the Hemingfordian of Nevada, Apeomyoides savagei from the Barstovian of Nevada, Zophoapeomys indicum from the Late Oligocene of South Dakota, and a possible second species of Zophoapeomys from the Late Oligocene of Nebraska. Another North American eomyid, Arikareeomys skinneri, from the Arikareean of Nebraska, has also been reidentified as an apeomyine.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{concentrated}} on characterizing {{the structures of}} the antibody proteins. A major advance in these structural studies was the discovery in the early 1960s by Gerald Edelman and Joseph Gally of the antibody light chain, and their realization that this protein {{is the same as}} the Bence-Jones protein described in 1845 by Henry Bence Jones. Edelman went on to discover that antibodies are composed of disulfide bond-linked heavy and light chains. Around the same time, antibody-binding (Fab) and antibody tail (Fc) regions of IgG were characterized by Rodney Porter. Together, <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> deduced the structure and complete amino acid sequence of IgG, a feat for which they were jointly awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Fv fragment was prepared and characterized by David Givol. While most of these early studies focused on IgM and IgG, other immunoglobulin isotypes were identified in the 1960s: Thomas Tomasi discovered secretory antibody (IgA); David S. Rowe and John L. Fahey discovered IgD; and Kimishige Ishizaka and Teruko Ishizaka discovered IgE and showed it was a class of antibodies involved in allergic reactions. In a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976, Susumu Tonegawa showed that genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scientists}} have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged {{with the basic}} vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from sensors and receptors, both internal and surface, signaling that {{the well-being of the}} creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the thalamic, hippocampal, orbitofrontal, insula, and midbrain sites are the key to consciousness of thirst. <b>These</b> <b>scientists</b> also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuro{{scientists have}} believed. Evidence of this {{lies in the fact that}} studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness. Still, <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive binding is {{associated}} with the different states of human consciousness. Two of the most studied states of consciousness are the wakefulness and REM sleep. There have been multiple studies showing, electrophysiologically, that these two states are quite similar in nature. This has led some neural binding theorists to study the modes of cognitive awareness in each state. Certain observations have even led <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> to hypothesize that since there is little cognition going on during REM sleep, the increased thalamocortical responses show the action of processing in the waking preconscious.|$|E

25|$|Important {{members of}} the {{scientific}} community were spared from Stalin's usual amount of wrath and their punishments were often lessened from what one usually would expect from the regime. In the beginning this was mainly because of ideological reasons to not harm the party by punishing someone who had received a major award or had international accreditation. Scientists were given more chances to explain their behavior or prove their innocents than average citizens because they were seen as valuable. Later, though it would be for more practical reasons as scientists became the leaders in the arms race which played a major part in the Cold War.

25|$|The {{potential}} {{dangers of}} global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. <b>These</b> <b>scientists</b> are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects {{of global warming}} on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly.–This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads {{to a reduction in}} wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} factors motivated people to propose other evolutionary mechanisms as alternatives to natural selection, some of them dating back before Darwin's Origin of Species. Natural selection, {{with its emphasis on}} death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it was immoral, and left little room for teleology or the concept of progress in the development of life. Some of <b>these</b> <b>scientists</b> and philosophers, like St. George Jackson Mivart and Charles Lyell, who came to accept evolution but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections. Others, such as Herbert Spencer, the botanist George Henslow (son of Darwin's mentor John Stevens Henslow also a botanist), and Samuel Butler, felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others, including the American paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt, had an idealist perspective and felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.|$|E
