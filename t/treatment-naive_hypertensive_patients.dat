40|$|OBJECTIVES: Identification {{of factors}} that {{contribute}} to urinary albumin losses in hypertensive nephropathy is crucial for prevention of renal deterioration. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship of low-grade albuminuria with plasma aldosterone levels in <b>treatment-naïve</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> free of additional comorbidities that might affect renal function. METHODS: In 242 newly diagnosed patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension, we obtained duplicate 24 -h urine collections for measurement of urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) and measured plasma aldosterone levels. Patients with diabetes, overt proteinuria (> 300  mg/day), glomerular filtration rate less than 30  ml/min per 1. 73  m, and previous renal diseases were excluded. RESULTS: Increasing UACR was associated with significantly and progressively higher blood pressure (BP), HDL-cholesterol, and plasma aldosterone levels, and with lower glomerular filtration.

40|$|Aldosterone has hypertrophic and profibrotic {{effects on}} the heart. The {{relationship}} between plasma aldosterone levels and left ventricular diastolic function in hypertension, however, is unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine this relationship in <b>treatment-naive</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> free of comorbidities that could affect left ventricular diastolic filling properties. In 115 patients with primary hypertension who were eating a standard diet and 100 matched normotensive controls, we measured plasma aldosterone and active renin levels and performed both conventional echocardiography and tissue-Doppler imaging for assessment of left ventricular diastolic function. Left ventricular hypertrophy was found in 21 % of hypertensive patients, and diastolic dysfunction was detected in 20 % by conventional echocardiography and in 58 % by tissue-Doppler imaging. Patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction at tissue-Doppler imaging were older and more frequently men, had greater body mass index, blood pressure, alcohol intake, left ventricular mass index, relative wall thickness, and lower plasma aldosterone levels than patients with preserved diastolic function. Plasma aldosterone correlated directly with left ventricular mass index in addition to age, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. Plasma aldosterone was also directly related to e' velocity at tissue-Doppler imaging, but this relationship was lost after multivariate adjustment. In conclusion, plasma aldosterone levels are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy but have no independent relationship with left ventricular diastolic properties in hypertensive patient...|$|E

Objective: The aim of our study was to compare the antihypertensive effect of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists barnidipine and amlodipine. Methods: This was a 24 -week, randomized, open-label, pilot study. Consecutive treatment-naive patients with grade I or II essential hypertension (office sitting systolic blood pressure [BP] of 140 – 179 mm Hg and diastolic BP of 90 – 109 mm Hg) were enrolled. The primary end points were the effect of treatment with either barnidipine 10 mg or amlodipine 5 mg once daily on office and ambulatory BP, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and markers of cardiac damage, serum procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide, and plasma amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations. Patients were assessed at enrollment, and 12 and 24 weeks. During each visit, the prevalence of adverse events (AEs) was also monitored using spontaneous reporting, patient interview, and physical examination, the relationship to study drug being determined by the investigators. Compliance with treatment was assessed at each study visit by counting returned tablets. Results: Thirty eligible patients (20 men, 10 women; mean [SD] age, 47 [12] years) were included in the study; all patients completed the 24 weeks of study treatment. Twelve weeks after randomization, 6 patients in the amlodipine group had their dose doubled to 10 mg due to inadequate BP control. Mean BP reductions at study end were not significantly different between the barnidipine and amlodipine groups (office BP, − 10. 3 /− 9. 4 vs − 16. 6 /− 9. 1 mm Hg; ambulatory BP, 9. 4 / 6. 4 vs 8. 1 / 5. 1 mm Hg). Reductions in LVMI and markers of cardiac damage were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Significantly more patients in the amlodipine group reported drug-related AEs compared with those in the barnidipine group (9 [60 %] vs 2 [13 %]; P < 0. 05). Conclusion: In this small sample of <b>treatment-naive</b> <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> the antihypertensive effect of barnidipine 10 mg once daily was not significantly different from that of amlodipine 5 to 10 mg once daily...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Endothelial {{dysfunction}} and arterial stiffness are early vascular alterations, {{linked to}} oxidative stress and inflammation, with prognostic significance in essential <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> P 2 X 7 receptors (P 2 X 7 R), responding to extracellular ATP, are encoded by a highly polymorphic gene and modulate inflammatory responses and cell growth, potentially {{playing a role}} in the control of vascular tone. This study evaluated the effects of P 2 X 7 R gene polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) on a detailed vascular hypertensive phenotype. METHODS: We determined by real-time PCR two SNPs of the P 2 X 7 R gene (489 C>T and 1513 A>C) in 134 newly diagnosed, <b>treatment-naive</b> essential <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> and 131 normotensive controls (CTL). Endothelium-dependent response was assessed as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, arterial stiffness as aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) by tonometry. Markers of oxidative stress were also measured. RESULTS: FMD was lower (P  C was a main determinant of AIx (odds ratio 1. 90; P =  0. 03). CONCLUSION: P 2 X 7 R 489 C>T and 1513 A>C SNPs are not associated with altered endothelial function or arterial stiffness in untreated newly diagnosed essential hypertensive patients; a possible role in influencing peripheral wave reflection should be further addressed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} test whether the {{differences}} in activity of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems at rest or during exercise can explain the differing cardiovascular properties and outcomes of lean and obese <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> BACKGROUNDAlthough lean <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> have fewer metabolic abnormalities than obese <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> paradoxically {{they appear to have}} a poorer cardiovascular prognosis. METHODSTo evaluate the heightened risks in lean <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> this study compared metabolic, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular characteristics at rest and during a standardized treadmill protocol in obese (body mass index [BMI] = 32. 5 ± 0. 3 kg/m 2, n = 55) and lean (BMI = 24. 3 ± 0. 2 kg/m 2, n = 66) <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> Normotensive obese (n = 21) and lean (n = 55) volunteers served as control subjects. RESULTSCompared with the lean normotensive subjects, the lean and obese <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> had greater left ventricular mass index (LVMI) values, but on multivariate analysis, LVMI correlated with plasma renin activity (p < 0. 001) and plasma norepinephrine (PNE) (p < 0. 01) in the lean but not the obese <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> Arterial compliance (stroke volume/pulse pressure ratio) was reduced in the lean <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> in whom it correlated (p = 0. 033) with PNE. The PNE rose less (22 %) in the obese than in the lean (55 %) <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> in response to standing (p < 0. 05). Likewise, during treadmill exercise, there were lesser increases in renin (65 % vs. 145 %, p < 0. 01) and epinephrine (200 % vs. 500 %, p < 0. 05) in the obese <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> These changes were also less in obese patients than in lean control subjects, indicating attenuated neurohormonal responses to stress in obesity. CONCLUSIONSCompared with obese <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> cardiovascular properties in lean <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> are more dependent on catecholamines and the renin system. The different neuroendocrine responses to dynamic stimuli in lean and obese patients also might help to explain the disparity in their cardiovascular outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and method}} In order to {{evaluate}} whether arterial hypertension (AH) affects skin microcirculation, 46 newly diagnosed, never-treated, <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> and 20 healthy normotensive controls underwent a forearm skin postocclusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH) test, using laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Their resting skin blood flow oscillations (SBFOs) were also investigated using wavelet spectral analyses of skin LDF tracings within six frequency subintervals in the 0. 005 - 2 Hz spectral range. To evaluate whether antihypertensive treatment affects skin microcirculation, the same measurements were repeated in 22 of the recruited <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> after 8 +/- 2 weeks of antihypertensive treatment. Results Significantly reduced PORH, together with significantly higher spectral amplitudes within {{the majority of the}} investigated SBFO subintervals, was found in untreated <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> compared with controls. In the 22 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> who completed the follow-up, there was a significant increase in PORH after antihypertensive treatment compared with before (357 +/- 178 vs. 284 +/- 214 %, respectively, P< 0. 05). Following antihypertensive treatment, the same 22 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> did not differ significantly from controls either in PORH or in the majority of the investigated SBFO frequency subintervals. Conclusion This study showed reduced skin vasoreactivity in the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> confirming that antihypertensive treatment negatively affects skin microcirculation. The short period of efficacious antihypertensive treatment resulted in normalization of skin vasoreactivity in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> who completed the follow-up, suggesting that antihypertensive treatment affects positively skin microcirculation in AH. The SBFO increase in untreated <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> and its almost complete normalization in treated <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> suggests that SBFO enhancement in untreated <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> could be an adaptive reversible response to AH...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} study the medication adherence among <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> using hill-bone compliance to high blood pressure therapy scale (HILL-BONE CHBPTS) and to compare medication adherence in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with controlled and uncontrolled blood pressure. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted for a period of one year in the Outpatient department of Medicine in a tertiary care hospital, Navi Mumbai. A total of 129 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> who were on at least six months on antihypertensive medications were enrolled. Blood pressure was measured and details of drug therapy were noted. Medication adherence was assessed using HILL-BONE CHBPTS and respective scores were calculated. Results: HILL-BONE CHBPTS scores were on the higher side signifying poor medication adherence among <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> HILL-BONE CHBPTS score correlated significantly in a positive direction with diastolic blood pressure, duration of treatment and the number of medications, As per JNC 8 recommendations, 58. 9 % (76) <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> were having blood pressure under control, whereas 41. 1 % (53) were having uncontrolled blood pressure.

40|$|Background-—Hypertension {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} risk factors for atrial fibrillation (AF). Recent studies suggest right atrial remodeling in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> may be associated with increased inducibility of AF. This study sought to characterize the electroanatomic features of left and right atria and pulmonary veins (PVs) in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> Methods and Results-—A prospective observational study was conducted on patients who underwent ablation for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or paroxysmal AF. Electrophysiological features of the PVs and atria, including event-related potentials, conduction time, and inducibility and vulnerability of AF, were characterized during cardiac catheterization. Anatomic and hemodynamic features were assessed by using echocardiographic and computer tomography imaging. When 15 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia were compared with 17 normotensive patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> had significantly shortened PV event-related potentials with increased dispersions (P< 0. 001) but slightly prolonged atrial event-related potentials (P=NS) and had prolonged interatrial and intra-atrial conduction times (P< 0. 001). Additionally, the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> had increased vulnerability and inducibility of AF and prolonged duration of induced AF (P< 0. 01). All of these changes were more pronounced in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with paroxysmal AF.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In 18 normotensive control subjects and 18 essential <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> we studied the forearm blood flow (strain-gauge plethysmography) response to intra-arterial acetylcholine, repeated under NO synthase inhibitor N(G) -monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) or the antioxidant ascorbic acid. The protocol was repeated {{at the end of}} exogenous ghrelin intra-arterial infusion. In <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> ghrelin normalized the blunted response to acetylcholine, restored the inhibiting effect of l-NMMA and abrogated the potentiating effect of ascorbic acid on acetylcholine. In controls, ghrelin failed to modify these vascular responses. In <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> ghrelin decreased venous levels of malondialdehyde, lipoperoxide, and interleukin- 6, and concomitantly increased endogenous antioxidant capacity. Small vessels from <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> showed an enhanced intravascular oxidative stress, which was strongly and similarly decreased by incubation with ghrelin, the NAD(P) H oxidase inhibitor gp 91 ds-tat, or both.

Eprosartan partially corrected the enhanced platelet reactivity. There were greater numbers of activated platelet microparticles in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> compared to controls. Again, eprosartan reduced this hyperproduction. Calcium kinetics of platelets were measured with flow cytometry using fluorescent markers. The free calcium concentration and its rise in response to thrombin were greater in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> Eprosartan significantly changed these parameters towards control values and reduced platelet activation. patients. Thus, eprosartan has the potential {{to reduce the risk of}} atherosclerotic events in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hypertension is a {{very common}} {{cardiovascular}} disease. About 20 - 25 % of population in developed countries suffer from this problem. Long-term hypertension involves higher risk of myocardial infarction, celebrovascular accident, renal failure or eye problems. The treatment starts from non-farmacological measures connected with healthy living. The patients should stop smoking, reduce sodium, alcohol and animal fat intake, lose weight, avoid stress and improve physical training. The aim of this work {{is to find out}} if <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> know non-pharmacological measures and if they follow them. Two hypotheses were stated at the beginning: A questionnare as a quantitative research strategy was used in this work. The questionnaire consisted of 25 questions. The results were grafically processed. The questionnaire was distributed to <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> of hospital wards in Písek, cardiological clinic in Písek and general practitioners in Písek and Milevsko. The number of respondents involved in the research was 111. Hypothesis 1 : <b>Hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> do not know non-pharmacological treatment measures. Hypothesis 2 : <b>Hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> do not follow non-pharmacological measures. Analysing the data, <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> know the non-pharmacological measures very well, <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> do not follow them. Hypothesis 1 was refuted and hypothesis 2 was proved. The analysis will be offered to cooperative hospital wards and general practitioners so that it can contribute to better secondary prevention of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is {{a strong}} risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is suggested that both hypertension and DM may synergistically affect left ventricular (LV) structure and function. To assess whether <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with DM have more depressed LV function in terms of long axis and midwall function by use of tissue Doppler echocardiogram than do patients with hypertension only. <b>Hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> (n= 200) and <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with DM (n= 60), {{all of whom had}} normal LV ejection fraction, were recruited for the study. Healthy age- and sex-matched subjects (n= 20) served as the control group. Echocardiography was performed including LV wall thickness, dimension, Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging. Blood pressure (BP) was measured in the supine position before and after echocardiographic examination. The <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with or without DM had higher BP and LV wall thickness, had more decreased afterload measured by meridional end-systolic stress, and had more depressed LV diastolic, long axis, and global function than did the controls. There was no difference in LV function between the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with and without DM. The <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with or without DM had depressed LV function compared with the controls, but {{there was no difference between}} the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with or without DM.

40|$|Abstract: The {{correlation}} between the blood lead (B-Pb) levels and the values of blood pressure in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> was investigated. Moreover, plasma levels of nitric oxide (NO), total antioxidants (TAOX) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected to investigate {{the correlations between the}} measured parameters and B-Pb levels in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> Fifty-five <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> were compared with fifty-three age and sex matched control group. The B-Pb levels were detected by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The plasma levels of NO, TAOX and MDA were measured by colorimetric methods. In the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> B-Pb levels were significantly higher than controls. Concomitantly, the plasma levels of MDA were significantly increased while the plasma levels of NO and TAOX were significantly reduced in the <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> in comparison with controls. There were significant positive correlations between B-Pb and each of MDA, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Conversely, a significant negative correlation was found between B-Pb and NO. Our study indicated that B-Pb level was associated with elevated blood pressure as well as oxidative stress in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> Moreover, the negative {{correlation between}} the B-Pb level and NO level may clarify their implication in cardiovascular disease and hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Patients with {{hypertension}} show {{deficits in}} cognitive function. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the preattentive information processing in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> are poorly understood. We seek {{to investigate whether}} <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> have impairments in preattentive information processing. Methods. We compared visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) between 15 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> and 15 age-matched healthy controls, which was elicited by the change of visual duration randomly presented in both peripheral visual fields. In addition, the global cognitive function for all participants was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results. The vMMN in deviant-standard comparison was observed at occipital-temporal regions. Compared with normal healthy controls, the amplitude of vMMN was significantly decreased in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> (P 0. 05), {{and there was no}} significant correlation between the mean amplitude of vMMN and SBP, DBP, and MMSE in hypertensive individuals, respectively.

40|$|Hypertension is {{a disease}} that silently kills the {{patients}} {{because they do not}} realize that they get hypertension until they check their blood pressure. It is important for <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> to know the factors that lead to the relapse time. To determine the relationship between the relapse time on <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with the influencing factors is using regression analysis, the dependent variable is the failure time so to determine the relationship is using regression Cox proportional hazard. This research uses the medical records of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> in period January to December 2014 in RSUD Kartini Jepara. The results indicate that the factors which affect relapse time of hypertension are kidney disease and stroke. The <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> that also suffer from kidney disease have relapse time sooner than patients who do not suffer from kidney disease.

40|$|Background: Hypertension is a {{major cause}} of {{cardiovascular}} remodeling. In the cardiovascular system, the remodeling of the extracellular matrix is controlled by the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). The aim of this meta-analysis is to elucidate the behavior of plasma MMP and TIMP levels in hypertension and their relationship to cardiovascular remodeling. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to July 2011. Studies were considered eligible if they provided values of plasma MMPs and TIMPs in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> Given the high variability of the plasma biomarker values among studies, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated. Results: Ten studies provided plasma MMP- 9; the SMD between 778 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> and 669 controls was 1. 95 units (P < 0. 05). Thirteen studies provided plasma TIMP- 1; the SMD between 851 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> and 646 normotensive individuals was 1. 92 units (P < 0. 01). Three studies investigated whether plasma TIMP- 1 predicted left ventricular (LV) remodeling; the SMD between 92 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with and 88 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> without LV hypertrophy was 5. 81 units (P < 0. 05). As for diastolic heart failure (HF), five studies provided data for plasma MMP- 2; the SMD between 321 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with and 334 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> without HF was 2. 36 units (P < 0. 01). The heterogeneity among studies was high. Conclusions: These results suggest that MMP- 2, MMP- 9 and TIMP- 1 may have a role as biomarkers of cardiovascular remodeling in hypertension. If these results are confirmed in prospective clinical studies, they could provide new tools to stratify cardiovascular risk in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{increased}} risk for life-threatening arrhythimas and sudden death has been observed in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> associated with either left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or prolonged QT interval. To investigate the influence of autonomic imbalance and LVH on QT interval in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> we compared two different models of LVH: hypertension and endurance physical training. Methods: Forty-seven untreated subjects affected by essential hypertension and 35 endurance runners, with a similar degree of LVH, were enrolled into the study. All subjects underwent 24 -h ambulatory ECG recording and morning blood sampling for catecholamines. Heart rate variability was evaluated by spectral analysis and a computerized algorithm {{was used to measure}} the QT interval; QTc was then computed by the Bazett's formula. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed by echocardiogram. Results: No difference in LVMI was found between <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> and athletes. Athletes showed lower heart rate (64 +/- 1 vs. 75 +/- 1 bpm, p < 0. 001, mean +/- S. E. M.) and shorter QTc (401 +/- 3 vs. 434 +/- 4 ms,p < 0. 001) than <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> throughout the 24 -h period. Athletes showed a higher vagal drive compared to <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> as suggested by bradycardia and higher values of vagal indices, which negatively correlated with QTc. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly lower in athletes than in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> (p < 0. 05) and positively correlated with QTc. Conclusion: Despite similar degrees of LVH, <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> show QTc lengthening, as compared to athletes. Heart rate variability and plasma norepinephrine levels suggest sympathetic predominance in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients,</b> which could contribute to abnormal ventricular repolarization, thus identifying patients with an increased arrhythmic risk.

40|$|Introduction Myocardial {{hypertrophy}} of {{the left}} ventricle may be of physiological or pathological nature. Distinction of {{these two types of}} hypertrophy is sometimes not easy and represents a diagnostic challenge. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess global diastolic and regional systolic and diastolic myocardial function in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy in athletes and <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> Material and methods In 18 male <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> and 14 male athletes global diastolic left ventriclar function and regional systolic and diastolic myocardial function of septum and posterior wall were investigated by pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging. Results Ejection fraction and left ventricle mass index did not differ significantly between two groups. <b>Hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> were found to have diastolic dysfunction while athletes had normal left ventricular diastolic function (the difference between the groups was P< 0. 00001). Index of regional diastolic function of septum as well as of the posterior wall was significantly less in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> than in athletes (P< 0. 00001 for both). In spite of the normal global systolic function the regional systolic function of septum and posterior wall was significantly less in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> than in athletes (P< 0. 02 for both). Conclusion The present results show significantly less global and regional diastolic function of hypertrophied myocardium in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> than in athletes. In the presence of preserved left ventricular systolic function, the quantification of myocardial velocity revealed significantly lower regional systolic function of septum and posterior wall in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> than in athletes...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionEpidemiologic {{data suggest}} that season changes could explain the {{occurrence}} of cardiovascular complications particularly during winter. Autonomic nervous system has been implicated in the increase of this risk. Heart rate varibility (HRV) is a non invasive tool exploring sympathic and parasympathic systems. AimThe study of parameters of HRV during season changes in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> and to compare them to healthy subjects. Methods 85 <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> underwent 24 holter recording during one year; from March 2006 to March 2007. The patients underwent recordings during the four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter. We studied changes in HRV in the temporal domain and the spectral domain during seasonal changes. Seasonal variation of HRV were also studied in 40 healthy controls and compared to those of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> ResultsWe noticed {{a decrease in the}} sympathic tone in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> during warm and hot seasons (spring and summer) and a relative increase in the sympathic tone during cold seasons. There was also a trend toward an increase in the sympathic tone during cold seasons in healthy subjects. There were no significant changes concerning HRV parameters exploring the parasympathic during the whole year in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> and healthy controls. ConclusionThere is a seasonal variation in autonomic nervous system modulation. These variations are more accentuated in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> with an increase in the sympathic tone during cold seasons. These variations could be deleterious on cardiovascular system and could explain the increases in cardiovascular events during winter in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Several {{biomedical}} {{findings have}} established {{the effects of}} hypertension on haemostasis and roles of blood coagulation products in the clinical course of hypertension. Methods. This cross-sectional study aimed at determining effects of hypertension on prothrombin time (PT) and {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> in comparison with normotensive subjects attending a tertiary hospital in Calabar. Forty-two (42) <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> and thirty-nine (39) normotensive control subjects were investigated for PT and APTT using Quick one-stage methods. Results. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) correlated positively with APTT (r= 0. 3072, r= 0. 4988; P< 0. 05) in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients.</b> DBP, SBP, PT, and APTT were significantly higher in <b>hypertensive</b> <b>patients</b> when compared to normotensive subjects (P< 0. 05).
