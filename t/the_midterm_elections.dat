25|$|With Vice President Dick Cheney {{choosing}} not to {{seek the}} nomination and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ruling herself out, {{the race for the}} 2008 presidential nomination was wide open. It officially began in March 2006 when John H. Cox became the first candidate to enter the 2008 race. The Democratic takeover of both houses of Congress and President Bush's unpopularity were strong issues for the GOP field. At the beginning of 2007, the announced Republican field was former Governor of Wisconsin and Cabinet member Tommy Thompson, former Governor of Virginia Jim Gilmore, and Senator of Kansas Sam Brownback. Former senator of Virginia George Allen was considered a top contender until his loss in <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> <b>elections.</b> He announced on December 10, 2006 that he would not seek the 2008 nomination. In early January former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney announced he was forming an exploratory committee. Afterwards several others announced they were running, including U.S.Congressman Ron Paul, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, Rudy Giuliani of New York City, U.S. Senator John McCain, U.S. Congressman Duncan Hunter, and U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo. A poll released in early February had Giuliani leading with 32% and John McCain second with 18%. By early March, Giuliani had become the frontrunner. Alan Keyes and former Senator and actor Fred Thompson entered the race later in September.|$|E
2500|$|After <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> <b>elections,</b> Grant {{signed the}} Civil Rights Act of 1871 (also {{known as the}} Klan Act), and {{the second and third}} Enforcement Acts. Grant used their {{provisions}} vigorously, suspending habeas corpus in South Carolina and sending troops there and into other states. Under his leadership over 5,000 arrests were made. Grant's vigor in disrupting the Klan made him unpopular among many whites, but earned Douglass's praise. An associate of Douglass wrote of Grant that African Americans [...] "will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of his name, fame and great services." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although both major {{political}} parties (and many minor ones) use the traditional American colors of red, white, and blue in their marketing and representations, since election night 2000, blue has become the identifying color for the Democratic Party, while red has become the identifying color for the Republican Party. That night, for the first time, all major broadcast television networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: blue states for Al Gore (Democratic nominee) and red states for George W. Bush (Republican nominee). Since then, the color blue has been widely used by the media to represent the party. This is contrary to common practice outside of the United States where blue is the traditional color of the right and red {{the color of the}} left. For example, in Canada, red represents the Liberals, while blue represents the Conservatives. In the United Kingdom, red denotes the Labour Party and blue symbolizes the Conservative Party. Blue has also been used both by party supporters for promotional efforts—ActBlue, BuyBlue, BlueFund, as examples—and by the party itself in 2006 both for its [...] "Red to Blue Program", created to support Democratic candidates running against Republican incumbents in <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> <b>elections</b> that year, and on its official website.|$|E

2500|$|On September 17, Allen and Webb {{appeared}} on NBC's Meet the Press for a debate. Part of the program's debate series on <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> <b>elections,</b> the debate heavily discussed both the original Gulf War {{and the present}} war in Iraq. Host Tim Russert questioned Webb about his initial support for Allen's 2000 U.S. Senate run, {{as well as what}} led him to later oppose Allen. Russert also questioned Allen about a remark Webb made concerning his interactions with Allen {{at the start of the}} Iraq conflict. Webb asserted that he approached Allen regarding U.S. involvement in the region and cautioned against military action. Webb also claimed that Allen responded to this by saying [...] "You’re asking me to be disloyal to the president." [...] After being questioned on this by Russert, Allen clarified by saying [...] "No, it’s loyalty to this country, and making sure that our country is unified in, in this, in this effort to disarm Saddam Hussein. That was the point." [...] Allen also addressed what he saw as a weakness in Webb, claiming his opponent wanted to withdraw from Iraq. Webb clarified his belief that the U.S. has a commitment to ensure Iraq is stable before withdrawing, but also reasserted that a permanent U.S. presence in Iraq is not an option.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the general}} election, Symington was {{challenged}} by Democratic nominee Eddie Basha, {{who was known}} in {{the state as a}} grocery store magnate as CEO and Chairman of Bashas'. Prior to the general election, Basha had led Symington in opinion polls by 15 to 20 points. However, <b>the</b> <b>midterm</b> <b>elections</b> of 1994 were a landslide for Republicans, which likely benefited Symington as well, despite his vulnerability due to the controversies that had emerged during his first term in office. Symington defeated Basha, winning 52% of the vote to Basha's 44%. Basha had refused to resort to negative campaigning until {{the final days of the}} campaign when it was likely too late, which political analysts pointed to as the reason for his loss. In addition, Symington had highlighted Basha's statement during a debate hosted by the League of Women Voters that the public school system [...] "can be the surrogate family to help children and parents," [...] which led Symington to declare that Basha believed the [...] "state can take the place of the family." [...] After defeating Basha, Symington, in his election night victory speech, pledged to try to further reduce state income taxes during the course of his second term, as well as continue to eliminate regulatory burden on businesses, and also to [...] "get tough on crime." [...] Symington also declared his upset victory a [...] "miracle" [...] and a [...] "revolution," [...] saying the people [...] "want their country back and they want their taxes lowered. Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan started all this and God bless them." ...|$|E
