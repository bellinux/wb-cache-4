It can be a challenging task for useful and meaningful <b>transfer</b> of external <b>know-how</b> to create value, thus the addressed research questions are: What constitutes a successful <b>know-how</b> <b>transfer?</b> How to measure performance of <b>know-how</b> <b>transfer?</b> How <b>transfer</b> of <b>know-how</b> should be done? Qualitative research methods – participatory action research within a specific case and application of existing theories as well as focus groups’ discussions were applied to create the study and obtain triangulation. The paper applied both inductive and deductive reasoning. The research shows that learning outcomes based approach can be used for successful <b>know-how</b> <b>transfer.</b> Performance of <b>know-how</b> <b>transfer</b> is affected by accuracy of the stated aim (learning outcomes), applied teaching, learning and assessment methods and both internal and external environment characteristics of the stakeholders involved in the process.

This article reviews the large body of literature on the nexus between mobility and development of countries in the developing world with a view to developing insights that may be relevant to the development of First Nation communities. While there are clear differences, the two contexts may be similar enough – in terms of socio-economic well-being, service levels, and institutional barriers to socio-economic development – for such analysis to contribute to understanding the effects of migration on the migrants themselves, their households, and their communities and countries of origin. The experience of developing countries suggest that there are positive gains not only in earnings but also in education and health for those who move internally and more so for those able to move internationally, even if there remain some concerns about negative effects on migrants’ families left behind, especially on the children. What seems clear is that migration plays an important role in family survival strategies. Money migrants send home finance the education of children, enable better health care, and improve housing. They shield migrants’ families against all kinds of “shocks”. However, emigration may reduce the human capital stock (brain drain), thus adversely affecting productivity. The loss of health professionals can set back critical medical services in remote communities, and disrupt formal and informal systems for <b>transferring</b> <b>know-how.</b> These “spill-over effects” or externalities on origin communities can be significant, imposing burdens on those left behind.

30|$|Importance of {{readiness}} to adopt {{new ideas and}} change has been emphasized (see e.g. Weiner, 2009; Combe, 2014). It should be considered that the institutional learning {{is much more difficult}} than the individual learning and the ability to learn faster than your competitors may even be the only sustainable competitive advantage (De Geus, 1988). Despite the end of Moore’s law (Waldrop, 2016; Bright, 2016; Technology Quarterly, 2016; Simonite, 2016) the amount and availability of data, information and knowledge nowadays is growing faster than ever (see e.g. Big Data Universe Beginning to Explode, 2012; Schilling, 2013; Big Data, for better or worse 2013; Gunelius, 2014; Turner et al., 2014), thus knowledge management issues matter more than ever before. Considering that, our memory has some limits (Miller, 1956; Cowan, 2010; Woollaston, 2016), the interest in what we are able to do instead of what we know is rising. Furthermore, Spady (1994) argues that having learners do important things with what they know is a major step beyond knowing itself. According to Capturing The Value (2015) organizations which have formal knowledge transfer processes perform better. However, useful and meaningful transfer of the external know-how to create value can be a challenging task because the current practice of <b>know-how</b> <b>transfer</b> often is still rather content oriented and not towards the outcomes.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 84 - 99). The {{past few decades}} in particular have witnessed the tremendous beneficial impact of innovations in laser technology ranging from biomedical to industrial applications in response to enhancing community's quality of life. From the beginning, laser technology, especially ultrafast lasers have provided a very convenient platform for producing need-based laser signals, which are addressed {{to a wide variety}} of scientific and technological problems. However, there is a scarcity of utilization of ultrafast lasers as well-developed tools for various applications, mostly in industry and research laboratories due to their complexity, low reliability and high cost as a result of the dominance of solid-state lasers. Fiber lasers, on the other hand, are inherently inexpensive, compact in size and robust in their operation under harsh conditions. Applications of ultrafast laser material processing have become extremely diverse, yet ultrafast material processing is still extremely complex, costly and quite slow in terms of material removal, which is particularly taxing for biological tissue removal, rendering ultrafast lasers uncompetitive compared to mechanical techniques. This thesis represents a series of work about developing fiber laser systems which address this technological problem. The motivation of this thesis is to develop fiber laser systems for applying the ablation cooled laser material removal idea which has recently proposed by our group [1] for tissue and material processing. Ablation cooling becomes significant above a certain repetition rate, which depends on the thermal diffusivity of the target material. Besides, the speed with which the laser beam can be repositioned over a target is limited. As a remedy, burst-mode operation, also proposed by our group [2] has been implemented, where the laser produces groups of high repetition rate pulses, which are, in turn, repeated with a lower frequency. Consequently, the burst-mode fiber laser system operating at 1 µm was demonstrated with an all-fiber architecture and we scaled it to 100 MHz intra-burst repetition rate and 1 MHz burst repetition rate with the average power of 150 W for high power applications. Additionally, a detailed investigation on the limits of continuously-pumped all-fiber burst mode laser system was reported. Besides all the practical advantages of the ablation cooling idea compared to other laser-material interactions, laser ablation depends on laser operating wavelength because materials have wavelength dependent absorption and scattering values. In terms of underlying laser technology, ultrafast tissue ablation experiments require a laser system operating around 2 µm where laser tissue interaction is much stronger due to the local peak of water absorption for achieving a high ablation efficiency. Therefore, this thesis also focuses on <b>transferring</b> <b>know-how</b> on burst-mode operation to the Tm/Ho doped fiber system, operating around 2 µm, which addresses requirements for an effcient tissue ablation process without any collateral damage. The physics of the laser-material interaction assisted by ablation cooling idea is also valid for tissue ablation, so the repetition rates of several GHz are necessary for fully exploiting this effect. Toward this goal, we developed core technologies, which were constituted by three different stages: (i) starting from a novel mode-locked oscillator with a repetition rate in the GHz range, (ii) followed by the construction of a Tm-doped pump source based on the WDM cascade architecture and (iii) finally the amplification of the Ho-doped fiber with a dual wavelength pumping concept. by Saniye Sinem Yılmaz.

This paper aims to prove that in Romania can host a relatively new, costly efficient and sustainable remediation technique for contaminated mining sites, namely phytoremediation. The applicability of phytoremediation for remediation of contaminated areas was proven by several demonstration projects carried out worldwide. It has a very positive impact on the landscape aesthetics, resulting in a high public acceptability. Moreover, the climate and soil conditions in Romania allow the use of several plant species which can remove contaminants from water and soil. It is therefore concluded that the successful implementation of phytoremediation on contaminated mining sites in Romania can be achieved, but under certain conditions. These conditions include the promotion of this technology by finding appropriate ways to <b>transfer</b> <b>know-how</b> and to build capacity at the level of public institutions and organizations dealing with remediation of the mining areas...|$|R
