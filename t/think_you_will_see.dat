6000|$|... "I don't {{think they}} are {{as bad as they}} seem, Phipson. If the Prussians ever do force a way into Paris, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that these fellows can fight and fight desperately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How sad!" [...] Wingate murmured. [...] "All the same, I do not <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> your nephew {{again until}} you have sold wheat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tell me {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that I <b>will</b> {{attend to}} <b>you.</b> Come about eleven,--not sooner, as I {{shall not be}} dressed. Now good-night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{for such}} a purpose,' {{returned}} Kit. 'To bring back Miss Nell! To see her again! Only think of that! I am so pleased too, to <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> her, Barbara, at last.' ...|$|R
6000|$|We have, then, to mark, on {{the larger}} Diagram, first, [...] "no x are m", and secondly, [...] "no y are m'". I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see,</b> without further explanation, that the two results, separately, are ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{differ from}} you, Major," [...] {{answered}} Lord Evandale; [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that young gentleman {{at the head}} of the insurgents; and, though I shall be heartily sorry for it, I shall not be greatly surprised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} brought the charge without warrant, Captain Dave," [...] Cyril said gravely, [...] "and {{if you will}} bear {{with me for a}} few minutes, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that there is at least {{something}} that wants looking into." ...|$|E
6000|$|I sighed, {{and stood}} musing for an instant. Then--"You are right, Montrésor. Nevertheless, I am still {{grateful}} to you for the warning you gave me in Paris. God pity and help Canaples! Adieu, Montrésor. I do not <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> me again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do not say}} no to that," [...] Paolo laughed, [...] "but {{with two}} armies wanting {{firewood}} and cutting down the copses without even taking trouble to ask leave of their owners, I <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> firewood very scarce in the city before long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's at {{any rate}} English: but say, her {{accepted}} husband--that'll be true and plain: {{if you do that}} I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> manage to <b>see</b> her, and then--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at it carefully," [...] replied Hilda, {{putting the}} sketch into her hands. [...] "If you take pains to {{disentangle}} the design from those pencil-marks {{that seem to}} have been scrawled over it, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> something very curious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> {{that your}} {{confidence}} in the man I have injured was fully warranted, sir,” he said. “If I have made you understand that, it is, at least, a little in reparation. I can’t ask you to forgive, Bernard, but I want to straighten out what I can.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Damned if I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> it out, mis'ess, for if I don't [...] mistake there'll be {{a retreat}} {{of the whole}} army on Brussels soon. [...] We can't stand much longer!--For the love of God, have ye got a [...] cup of water, if nothing stronger? [They hand a cup.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{authority}} {{is in this}} paper." [...] He drew the order from his pocket. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a moment <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that instant acquiescence is best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt he}} would be glad to, count; but as his enemies propose to divide his dominions among them, it is not very clear what terms he could make. But though I grant that, on paper, the odds against him is enormous, I <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> there <b>will</b> be some hard {{fighting}} yet, before Prussia is partitioned." ...|$|R
60|$|No. And if <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>think</b> for yourselves, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> {{that there}} is a deeper meaning in our Lord's name for St. John than merely that he was a loud and violent man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another {{thing is}} that they prefer daylight, as they can then see whether any other vessel is approaching. Were one of our cruisers to hear a cannonade in the night, she would come down and take them unaware. No, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that at daylight, if the coast is clear, they will begin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] {{agreed the}} banker. [...] "The parish, I believe, {{is in good}} running order--I do not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> the {{necessity}} for many--ahem--changes. But we sadly needed an executive head. And, if I may say so, Mr. Hodder, you strike me {{as a man of}} that type, who might have made a success in a business career." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} will be shocked and grieved at the step that your nephew has taken, but when you {{understand}} the circumstances, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that it was unavoidable for one of so generous and self- sacrificing a nature. I may add, that my aunt Lily is much touched, and thoroughly approves, and my uncle Jasper says imprudence is better than selfishness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Cherry," [...] said Clement. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it over <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> {{that we must}} investigate. I {{should be}} {{relieved}} indeed to let it alone, {{but it would not}} be fair towards Lance there and his boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} a guest to dinner," [...] said Goodwin. [...] "One Colonel Falcon, from San Mateo. He is come on {{government}} business. I do not <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> care to <b>see</b> him, so I prescribe for you one of those convenient and indisputable feminine headaches." ...|$|R
60|$|Your {{despatch}} {{of yesterday}} received. I {{really think the}} attitude of the enemy's army in Pennsylvania presents us the best opportunity we have had since the war began. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> not <b>see</b> the foe in New Jersey. I beg you to be assured that no one out of my position can know so well as if he were in it the difficulties and involvements of replacing General McClellan in command, and this aside from any imputations upon him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{and he is}} in {{his place}} now in the rear rank. He was in his uniform when he came, and I found this morning that he is {{thoroughly}} well up in his drill. A smart soldier all over, I should say. I don't know that he will do so well mounted, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> him make many blunders. He is evidently a sharp fellow." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{trust the}} reader will bear with me through these {{alphabetical}} fluctuations. Many people, I know from colloquial experiences, do at about this stage fly into a passion. But if you will exercise self-control, then I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> my point that, according to the method of voting, almost any sort of result may be got out of an election except {{the production of a}} genuinely representative assembly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Lanigan," [...] he said, [...] "that {{will not}} do at all; of course I don't want to be hard on you, and I never was, but my season is commenced, I have my guests, my rules are in full force, and I cannot permit you {{to come here and}} disarrange my arrangements. If for once, Lanigan, you will take the trouble to <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The sun is {{not down}} yet,' {{said the first}} bird; 'we must wait yet awhile till the moon rises and the maiden comes to the spring. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> she <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that young man sitting under the tree?' ...|$|R

"Since you and Mr. Clentanan called, I <b>think</b> if <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> Mr. Zeigenheim City Collector in New City Hall [...] and Henry L. Sutton, 620 Chestnut St[reet] {{who is in}} {{the real}} estate business, Mr. Sutton {{particularly}} can give you a great deal a[pertaining] to Genl. [General] Grant's life here. " [...] first line.

5000|$|In 2015 Islamic State {{included}} Black in {{a list of}} its enemies, {{calling him}} [...] "The American Crusader." [...] It quoted the following statement by Black: [...] "One thing is clear, if Damascus falls, the dreaded black and white flag of ISIS will fly over Damascus. ... Within {{a period of months}} after the fall of Damascus, Jordan will fall and Lebanon <b>will</b> fall. ... I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> automatically <b>see</b> a beginning of a historic push of Islam towards Europe and I think, ultimately, Europe will be conquered." ...|$|R
6000|$|While the man {{was away}} Mark took the lantern and {{examined}} the bottom closely. [...] "We shan't want the ax," [...] he said, as he pointed out to Chester a piece of string that was apparently jammed {{in the form of}} a loop between the bottom and side. [...] "Just get in and clear those few handfuls of corn out. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that it will pull up then." ...|$|E
6000|$|I soon chose a fine melon out {{of those}} which remained, but could find no knife to cut it with. [...] "Look in the cornice over my head," [...] said he, [...] "and I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> one." [...] It was so high above me, that I had some {{difficulty}} in reaching it, and catching my foot in the covering of the bed, I slipped, and fell right upon the young man, the knife going straight into his heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon all {{the shots}} told," [...] Dave said; [...] "we could hardly miss that clump. Now I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> {{any more of}} them; they know we are here and they know we are ready for them, and it aint in Indian nature to throw away their lives {{charging}} up a place like this. They had reckoned the five first would go down anyhow. Then they will guess that we have got pistols, and the redskins hate six-shooters like poison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Knows it!" [...] Kendricks replied scornfully. [...] "There {{is nothing}} {{goes on in}} Paris {{that he does not}} know. He peers into every nook and corner of the city. He knows the {{feelings}} of the aristocrats, of the bourgeoisie, of the official classes. Not only that, he knows their feelings towards England, towards the Triple Alliance, towards Russia. He never seems to ask questions, he never forgets an answer. He is a wonderful man, in short; but I do not <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> him here to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some reason, you understand, I mean some sense, may {{creep into}} thinking; some glimpse of truth. I mean some {{effective}} truth, {{for which there}} is no room in politics or journalism. I happen to have said what I thought. And you are angry! If you do me the kindness to <b>think</b> a little <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that I spoke like a patriot." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{comparisons}} with Ocean's Eleven, the director {{said he never}} went into production consciously thinking about the hit Hollywood film. Though similar to it, he thinks The Thieves is actually closer to his previous films The Big Swindle and Tazza: The High Rollers, with the action featured [...] "invested with more emotion." [...] Kim Yoon-seok added that contrary to the characters' compatible and harmonious collaboration in Ocean's Eleven, [...] "In The Thieves, we {{are all over the}} place, all with our own faults. But I <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> through the friendships and love in the film, our unique emotional developments will show through." ...|$|R
