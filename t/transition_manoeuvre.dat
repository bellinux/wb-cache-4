40|$|The {{development}} of a fuzzy logic controller on a new configuration of ducted-fan VTOL UAV is presented for automating the <b>transition</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> The design {{goal is to have}} a smooth push-over transition flight from low speed vertical flight to high speed horizontal flight in the presence of wind disturbance and without the need of using complicated control strategies. A target attitude for the transition is selected and then compared with the current vehicle attitude. This gives the attitude errors that are used to generate command signals to the vehicle controller. Simulation results demonstrate that the UAV was able to perform a smooth <b>transition</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> and has a good overall performance...|$|E
40|$|Tiltwing {{aircraft}} {{represents a}} possible future evolution of conventional tiltrotors. Indeed, by {{making use of}} smaller rotors, a tiltwing is able to hover in helicopter mode, to achieve very high forward speed in cruise flight in aeroplane mode and to allow for horizontal taking off and landing. The partial tilting wing concept, introduced in 2000 in the ERICA tiltrotor design, made the tiltwing solution even more attractive. Although this promising configuration was widely studied, many aspects require further analysis. In the present work, the initial stage of the <b>transition</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> that allows a tiltwing aircraft employing the partial tilting wing solution to convert from helicopter to aeroplane mode is investigated. An extensive wind tunnel test campaign {{carried out in the}} Politecnico di Milano Large Wind Tunnel is described and the effects due to the aerodynamic interaction between wing and rotor are discussed. Aircraft performance are also discussed to assess the effectiveness of this aircraft design...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{work done}} in optimizing the <b>transition</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> between vertical and horizontal flight for a tail-sitter unmanned air vehicle. This work {{is part of an}} ongoing research program involving the construction and test of a concept demonstrator tail-sitter UAV, the “T-Wing, ” that is being undertaken by the University of Sydney in collaboration with Sonacom Pty Ltd. The use of an unmanned air-vehicle (UAV) with a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability that can still enjoy efficient horizontal flight promises significant operational advantages over other vehicles. However, the transition between these phases of flight is one problem {{that needs to be addressed}} to make the vehicle effective. This paper looks at using numerical optimization techniques coupled with a 6 -DOF non-linear model of the vehicle to obtain the best possible transition maneuvers in terms of minimizing such things as the time to complete the transition and any excess height gain during the maneuver as well as avoiding unpredictable regions of the flight envelope...|$|R
40|$|This review {{surveys the}} problem of surface {{contamination}} for cars, which poses a growing engineering challenge to vehicle manufacturers, operators and users. Both drivers’ vision and vehicle visibility need to be maintained under {{a wide range of}} environmental conditions. This requires managing the flow of surface water on wind screens and side glazing. The rate of deposition of solid contaminants on glazing, lights, license plates and external mirrors also needs to be minimised. Maintaining vehicle aesthetics and limiting the transfer of contaminants to the hands and clothes of users from soiled surfaces are also significant issues. Recently, keeping camera lenses clean has emerged as a key concern, as these systems <b>transition</b> from occasional <b>manoeuvring</b> aids to sensors for safety systems. The deposition of water and solid contaminants onto car surfaces is strongly influenced by unsteady vehicle aerodynamic effects. Airborne water droplets falling as rain or lifted as spray by tyres interact with wakes, vortices and shear flows and accumulate on vehicle surfaces as a consequence. The same aerodynamic effects also control the movement of surface water droplets, rivulets and films; hence, particular attention is paid to surface water management over the front side-glass and the deposition of contaminants on the rear surfaces. The test methods used in the automotive industry are reviewed, as are numerical simulation techniques...|$|R
40|$|Pluripotency {{inducing}} transcription factors (TFs) Oct 4,Sox 2 and Nanog {{under the}} influence of epigenetic modifications (especially,DNA methylation and histone H 3 modifications) and signaling pathways work stringently to guard stem cell pluripotency and smoothly <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>transition</b> between differential gene expression states during both normal and pathological conditions. The present work is undertaken to investigate the influence of epigenetic regulators and signaling pathways on pluripotency inducing TFs during tumorigenesis. The expression profile of Oct 4,Sox 2 and Nanog in breast and prostate cancer along with epigenetic regulatory enzymes(DNA methyltransferases(DNMTs),histone methyltransferases(HMTs) and histone deacetylases(HDACs) predominantly active in controlling the expression of these TFs are studied. Furthermore,hedgehog(HH) signaling pathway mediated regulation of Oct 4,Sox 2 and Nanog is also examined. Oct 4,Sox 2 and Nanog are over-expressed both at transcript(mRNA) and protein level in a stage-specific manner in both cancers. The over-expression of Oct 4,Sox 2 and Nanog is associated with enhanced tumorigenic potential as is evident from reduction in cell proliferation,decrease in cell migration and invasive potential,cell cycle arrest at G 1 phase and increase in apoptotic population upon silencing of these factors via si-RNA. Upon investigating the epigenetic regulatory mechanism controlling their over-expression,it was found that active histone modifications H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 9 AcS 10 p in promoters of Oct 4 and Sox 2 predominantly up-regulate expression of these genes in both cancers whereas promoter DNA methylation is not effective. Alongside these marks,it is also seen that HH-Sox 2 axis is active in prostate cancer and mediates androgen independent prostate cancer. As researchers and oncologists are struggling to find a successful treatment approach for metastatically aggressive malignancies,unravelling the epigenetic machinery and allied signaling pathways controlling transcriptional network of a cancer cell will be one step forward in this endeavour...|$|R
40|$|A new {{integrated}} {{navigation system}} designed for small size Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is presented. The proposed system {{is based on a}} number of low-cost avionics sensors, including Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Vision Based Sensors (VBS). The use of an Aircraft Dynamics Models (ADMs) to provide additional information to compensate for the shortcomings of Vision Based Navigation (VBN) and MEMS-IMU sensors in high-dynamics attitude determination tasks is also considered. Additionally, the research concentrates on the potential of carrier-phase GNSS for Attitude Determination (GAD) using interferometric techniques. The main objective is to design a compact, light and relatively inexpensive system capable of providing the required navigation performance (position and attitude data) in all phases of flight of small UAVs, with a special focus on precision approach and landing, where VBN techniques can be fully exploited in a multi-sensor data fusion architecture. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is developed to integrate the information provided by the different sensors and to provide estimates of position, velocity and attitude of the UAV platform in real-time. Three different {{integrated navigation system}} architectures are implemented. The first architecture uses VBN at 20 Hz and GNSS at 1 Hz to augment the MEMS-IMU running at 100 Hz. The second mode also includes the ADM (computations performed at 100 Hz) to provide augmentation of the attitude channel. The third fusion architecture uses GNSS based attitude values. The simulations are carried out on the AEROSONDE UAV performing high-dynamics manoeuvres repre-sentative of the UAV operational flight envelope. Simulation of the VBN-IMU-GNSS (VIG) integrated navigation system shows that the system can attain position, velocity and attitude accuracies complying with Category Two (CAT II) precision approach requirements. Simulation of the VBN-IMU-GNSS-ADM (VIGA) system also shows promising results, since the achieved attitude accuracy is higher using the ADM-VBN-IMU than using VBN-IMU only. However, due to rapid divergence of the ADM virtual sensor, {{there is a need for}} frequent re-initialisation of the ADM data module, which is strongly dependent on the UAV flight dynamics and the specific <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>transitions</b> performed. In the simulation of the third integrated navigation system, the VIG system is augmented by employing the GAD, forming the VIG-GAD (VIGGA) system architecture. The performances achieved with the VIG, VIGA and VIGGA integrated Navigation and Guidance System (NGS) are presented and are in line with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) precision approach requirements...|$|R
