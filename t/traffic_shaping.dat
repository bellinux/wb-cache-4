This allows implementation of wireless-specific features such as larger frame sizes and optimized error recovery procedures. Windows Vista uses various techniques like Receive Window Auto-scaling, Explicit Congestion Notification, TCP Chimney offload and Compound TCP to improve networking performance. Quality of Service (QoS) policies can be used to prioritize network traffic, with <b>traffic</b> <b>shaping</b> available to all applications, even those that do not explicitly use QoS APIs. Windows Vista includes in-built support for peer-to-peer networks and SMB 2.0. For improved network security, Windows Vista supports for 256-bit and 384-bit Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithms, as well as for 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is included in the network stack itself, while integrating IPsec with Windows Firewall.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009 and 2010, Virgin Media Broadband {{came first}} in an Ofcom {{broadband}} speed {{test in the}} UK. Ofcom tested typical speeds of broadband services provided by most ISPs in the UK, including BSkyB, BT, Tiscali, AOL, TalkTalk, Plusnet, O2 and Orange. Since most broadband connections in the UK are provided by ADSL, {{and the quality of}} individual phone lines varies according to distance from exchange, most landline broadband services are marketed as being the maximum speed that the individual's phone line will support, [...] "up to 8mb". As a result, actual speeds obtained vary greatly, but are always constrained by the individual phone line – the quality of which is out of the control of the broadband provider. Cable broadband has no such speed variability caused by connection quality as the network is fully owned and controlled by the cable company providing the broadband – any slowdowns are wholly as a result of <b>traffic</b> <b>shaping,</b> or local capacity being over-sold or over-subscribed. For this reason, the results showed that Virgin Media's broadband speed was closer to (although still not 100% of) the [...] "up to" [...] figures it advertised, compared to the other providers tested. While landline broadband providers offered rates of [...] "up to" [...] 24 Mbit/s, the launch of a Virgin's 50 Mbit/s service on 15 December 2008 was advertised as [...] "the UK's Fastest Broadband." ...|$|E

While most censorship circumvention systems are still focused on es-caping a given censored region to access Internet content outside of its control, we address a different but equally pressing problem: secure and secret chat within a cen-sored region. We present Rook as a censorship and surveillence re-sistant platform for communicaton using online games as its cover application. The use of online games represents a novel form of cover application that provides several features {{that make them}} uniquely well-suited for this pur-pose. Rook transmits data secretly by embedding it in the network traffic of an online game. To defeat current at-tacks based on deep-packet inspection and <b>traffic</b> <b>shape</b> analysis, Rook does not generate any additional packets, {{does not change the}} length of existing packets, and en-sures packets that are altered are still valid game packets.

40|$|Urban traffic {{management}} requires congestion detection. <b>Traffic</b> <b>shape</b> {{changes over time}} and location {{in which it is}} observed. Moreover it depends on roads, lines and crossroads arrangement. In addition, each congestion event has its own peculiarities (e. g. duration, extension, flow). Therefore, to give correct responses any detection model needs some kind of parametric adjustment. In this paper, we present an adaptive biologically-inspired technique for swarm aggregation of on-vehicle GPS devices positions, able to detect traffic congestion. The aggregation principle of the position samples is based on a digital mark, released at each sample in a digital space mapping the physical one, and evaporated over time. Consequently, marks aggregation occurs and stays spontaneously while many stationary vehicles are crowded into a road. In order to identify actually relevant traffic events, marks aggregation has to be correctly configured. This is achieved by tuning the mark’s structural parameters. Considering that each urban area has a specific traffic flow and density, determining a proper set of parameters is not trivial. Here, we approach the issue using different differential evolution variants, showing their impact on performance...|$|R

40|$|Research in {{the field}} of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is driven by the severe {{constraints}} and the challenges raised by the environments these networks operate in: computational power, memory and energy are scarce and limited resources, and the unreliable nature of the low power wireless channel causes difficulties in all layers of the communication stack. WSNs often operate in dynamic envi-ronments, where topologies, link qualities and traffic volumes are susceptible to frequent changes at network run-time. In contrast to this, WSN nodes are usu-ally statically configured for their intended deployment scenario at compile time, which often leads to suboptimal parameter settings in case the discovered network conditions deviate significantly from the expectations.

In the proposed system, a resource reservation algorithm such as RSVP, IntServ, or DiffServ is used to reserve resources (i. e., bandwidth and buffer space) in each router in an IP multicast tree. Each router uses an Input-Queued, Output-Queued, or Crosspoint-Queued switch architecture with unity speedup. A recently proposed Recursive Fair Stochastic Matrix Decomposition algorithm used to compute near-perfect transmission schedules for each IP router. The IPTV <b>traffic</b> is <b>shaped</b> at the sources using Application-Specific Token Bucker Traffic Shapers, to limit the burstiness of incoming network traffic.

All IPTV traffic flows are regenerated at the destinations with essentially zero delay jitter and essentially-perfect QoS.
