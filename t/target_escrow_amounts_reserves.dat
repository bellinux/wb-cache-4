40|$|We use a human-subjects {{experiment}} {{to test the}} effects of a simple mechanism designed to increase cooperation and efficiency in the trust game. In the equilibrium of the standard trust game, the investor does not invest, foreseeing that the allocator would have kept all of the returns from investment. Our mechanism adds a preplay escrow stage, in which the allocator places an amount (possibly zero) into escrow, to be forfeited if he keeps the proceeds of investment for himself. In the experiment, we vary the amounts that can be put into escrow. Our baseline treatment has no escrow. In a second treatment, only low escrow choices are possible, so the equilibrium is unaffected. In our third treatment, there is an <b>escrow</b> <b>amount</b> high enough that, in equilibrium, investment and sharing of the proceeds will occur. Two additional treatments mirror our second and third, except that in these, the <b>escrow</b> <b>amount</b> is randomly chosen and imposed on the allocator. We find that the high <b>escrow</b> <b>amount,</b> when chosen, does lead to the predicted efficient result. Contrary to the equilibrium prediction, we also find substantial investment in both the baseline and “low-escrow” treatments, leading to markedly higher efficiency than predicted (albeit well below that when the high amount is chosen). Over time, however, cooperation and efficiency after low or zero <b>escrow</b> <b>amounts</b> decline. We find only weak evidence for “crowding-out”, which predicts that given a low or zero <b>amount</b> placed into <b>escrow</b> in non-baseline treatments, investment and efficiency would actually be lower than in the baseline. We also find that initially, investment is more likely after allocators place the maximum possible <b>amount</b> into <b>escrow</b> – as if this action by allocators is being (mistakenly) read by investors as a signal that allocators plan to share. All of these results are seen when escrow choices are imposed as well as when they are voluntary. experiment, trust game, incentives, signal, crowding out...|$|R

40|$|Once {{electronic}} content {{has been}} released {{it is very difficult}} to prevent copies of the content from being widely distributed. Such distribution can cause economic harm to the content’s copyright owner and others. Our protocol, SPIES, allows one party to sell a secret to second party and provides an economic incentive for two parties to limit sharing of a secret between themselves. We do not use watermarking or traditional DRM mechanisms. We focus on content which is to be shared between two parties only, which is valuable, and which only needs to be protected for a limited amount of time. Examples include passwords to a subscription service, pre-release of media for review, or content shared but bound by a non-disclosure agreement. With SPIES, any possesor of the content can receive a portion of the funds placed in escrow by the two legitimate possesors. We analyze this system and show that the best strategy of the content provider and content consumer to maximize their utility is to use SPIES and not share the content further. We deal successfully with a “dummy registration ” attack in which multiple false identities are used in an attempt to get a higher payment. We also discuss how to determine the correct <b>escrow</b> <b>amount...</b>|$|R
