25|$|Later in {{the third}} quarter, Duhe intercepted another pass from Todd, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the Jets 41-yard line, but his team couldn't move the ball and had to punt. Two minutes into the fourth quarter, Duhe {{recorded}} his third interception of the day, and this time took it 35 yards for a touchdown. The Dolphins 14–0 lead {{turned out to be}} more than enough, as New York never mounted a serious scoring threat for the rest of the game.|$|E

Fortunately, Vine was now nearer the Washington Street entrance, where Cain and his fellow police officers were slowly reinstating some kind of rough order. He was able to gain the lobby and helped clear the crush around the stairs. He left the theatre, carrying {{a woman who had}} been trampled underneath and “who seemed as dead as a door nail”. Fire Marshall Keady felt that Vine had been the last person to leave the family circle alive. When he had jumped, there were still many people frantically struggling to leave.|$|E

25|$|The Raiders {{scored on}} their first drive {{of the second half}} with Stabler's 41-yard {{completion}} to Cliff Branch setting up his 8-yard touchdown pass to Casper. To make matters worse for the Colts, Blackwood was injured on the drive and had to miss the rest of the game. But Baltimore still took the lead right back as Marshall Johnson returned the ensuing kickoff 87 yards to the end zone. On Oakland's next possession, they lost their fourth turnover of the day when Laird picked off another Stabler pass, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the Raiders 40. But the Raiders defense rose to the occasion, forcing a punt that was blocked by Ted Hendricks and recovered by linebacker Jeff Barnes, who returned it to the Colts 16-yard line. Two plays later, Casper caught a 10-yard touchdown pass to make the score 21–17.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half, Seattle {{finally got a}} scoring {{opportunity}} when Hawkins fumbled {{the ball on the}} first play from scrimmage and the Seahawks recovered. However, all they got from this was Krieg's third interception, this one to linebacker Matt Millen on the first play after the fumble. At this point, Krieg was benched and replaced by backup Jim Zorn. Meanwhile, LA drove to the Seahawks 9-yard line. Defensive back Gregg Johnson intercepted a pass from Plunkett in the end zone to keep his team in the game, but even {{this turned out to be}} insufficient. Just two plays later, Davis recorded his second interception of the day, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the Seattle 46. On the next play, Allen took off for a 43-yard burst, and then caught a 3-yard touchdown pass to make the score 27–0.|$|E
25|$|Raiders {{receiver}} Raghib Ismail {{returned the}} ensuing kickoff 33 yards to his 43-yard line, sparking an 8-play, 57-yard drive {{that ended with}} a 1-yard touchdown run by Napoleon McCallum. Then on the first play after the kickoff, safety Eddie Anderson forced a fumble from Pete Metzelaars, and cornerback Terry McDaniel recovered {{the ball on the}} Bills 40-yard line, setting up McCallum's second 1-yard touchdown run (<b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> a fourth down) to increase their lead to 17–6. But Buffalo, who had gained just 44 total yards at this point, struck right back with a 4-play, 76-yard touchdown drive. After three consecutive Kelly completions, a 37-yard pass interference penalty on defensive back Torin Dorn moved the ball to the Raiders 8-yard line, and Thurman Thomas ran it into the end zone from there, cutting the score to 17–13 with 50 seconds left in the half.|$|E

25|$|Oakland stormed {{back with}} 21 {{unanswered}} points. First, Plunkett's 48-yard completion to receiver Cliff Branch on third down and 20 {{set off a}} 7-play, 76-yard drive that ended with his 5-yard touchdown run. Then the Raiders defense forced a punt, and Ira Matthews returned Rick Partridge's 41-yard kick 14 yards to the Chargers 49-yard line. Four plays later, Plunkett's 21-yard touchdown pass to King made the score 21–7 with 1:35 {{left in the first}} quarter. San Diego took the ball back and drove to the Raiders 21-yard line, featuring a 28-yard completion from tight end Kellen Winslow to John Jefferson on a trick play, but safety Burgess Owens ended the drive with an interception. Following a punt, San Diego running back Mike Thomas lost a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Ted Hendricks on the Chargers 29-yard line, and the Raiders capitalized with Plunkett's 23-yard completion to Branch leading to another touchdown, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> a 3-yard run by Mark van Eeghen, to build a 28–7 lead. Following Hank Bauer's 27-yard kickoff return to the 36-yard line, San Diego drove 64 yards in 13 plays, including a 24-yard reception by Thomas, to score on Fouts' 8-yard touchdown completion to Joiner, cutting their deficit to 28–14 with 1:05 left in the half.|$|E
25|$|A {{week after}} facing the undefeated Cowboys, the Patriots squared off against the winless Dolphins. The Patriots took the opening drive {{of the game}} 80yards and capped {{it off with a}} 30-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Brady to Stallworth. After Dolphins quarterback Cleo Lemon fumbled to give the Patriots the ball on the Dolphins' 28-yard line, the Patriots took a 14–0 lead with a 2-yard touchdown reception by Kyle Brady. The Dolphins cut the lead in half with a 4-yard Lemon touchdown run to end a 79-yard drive early in the second quarter, but Willie Andrews returned the ensuing kickoff 74yards to give the Patriots another 14-point lead. Following a Dolphins punt, a 36-yard Welker reception set up a 35-yard Moss touchdown catch. After another Dolphins punt, Brady connected with Moss on a 50-yard touchdown strike, giving the Patriots a 35–7 lead. An exchange of punts left the Dolphins with the ball at their own 1-yard line, but a 49-yard punt by Brandon Fields and a holding penalty on Kelley Washington gave the Patriots the ball at their own 29-yard line. Still, Brady led the Patriots on another scoring drive, ending <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> a 14-yard Welker catch to give the Patriots a 42–7 lead going into halftime. The 42 points scored in the half were a franchise record.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{her career}} Cotton moved about {{frequently}} {{and had no}} permanent or even long-term studio. She sometimes worked in hotel rooms and occasionally stayed in a private home as the guest {{of one of her}} sitters. During the winter of 1902-1903 she painted Mrs. Henry Flagler at her home in Palm Beach. In August 1903 she stayed with one of her sitters, Mrs. William B. Leeds, as her guest in Bar Harbor on the Leeds's yacht and by December of that year she had a studio in New York that was likened to a drawing room complete with luxurious old tapestries. A year later she was painting in a studio within an apartment hotel, the Schuyler, on West 45th Street. In 1906 she occupied rooms in a London townhouse owned by her friend, Lady Savile. The following summer, when she began work on her portrait of King Edward, she had a studio in Marienbad and while completing that portrait during the winter months she was occupying a studio on Tite Street in Chelsea that had formerly been used by James McNeill Whistler. In 1913 her she had another London studio, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> Devonshire Street, and two years later, in the midst of World War I, she was working in Paris. Returning to the United States in 1916, she painted portraits in private houses and had no studio. During the 1920s she worked mainly in Paris studios and thereafter, until the end of her life, mainly in New York.|$|E

500|$|Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph {{felt it was}} [...] "a great opening track" [...] for Beyoncé and lauded its [...] "anthemic" [...] chorus. Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press {{deemed the}} song [...] "a supreme way" [...] to open the album. musicOMH's Philip Matusavage wrote that [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] {{manifested}} Beyoncé as a [...] "definitive personal statement rather than just another Beyoncé album". The Guardian reviewer Michael Cragg listed the track as an [...] "immediate" [...] single choice on the album. Julia Leconte of Now opined that the song was [...] "classic Beyoncé feminism" [...] and quipped, [...] "and if you're a sucker for girl-power hits like 'Irreplaceable', you'll have <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> repeat, too". While Claire Lobenfield of Complex stated, [...] "What sounds like a classic Beyoncé female empowerment ballad cuts even deeper." [...] Tim Finney of the same publication deemed the song a [...] "heavy-handed future concert staple". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood felt that with [...] "Pretty Hurts," [...] Beyoncé created [...] "razzle-dazzle pop out of small-scale sentiments that might've seemed on paper like fodder for hushed ballads". [...] Drowned in Sound writer Robert Leedham stated the track was [...] "impeccably sung".|$|E
2500|$|Author John Kruth writes that, {{with its}} vitriolic tone and an [...] "edge" [...] that was {{unfamiliar}} in the Beatles' work, [...] "Think for Yourself" [...] was [...] "somewhat startling" [...] to many listeners.

Maybe we'll lose it later on …" [...] While recognising Rubber Soul as another example of the Beatles [...] "setting trends in this world of pop", KRLA Beat admired the [...] "wonderful sound effect" [...] created by McCartney's fuzz bass and concluded: [...] "a good, strong, driving beat will keep <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> top." ...|$|E

They're either slightly emotional or mentally defective. Quirky, self-aggrandizing, scheming." [...] Pitt said the cast did little ad-libbing because the script was so tightly written and wove so many overlapping stories together. Veteran actor Richard Jenkins said the Coen brothers asked him if he could lose weight for his role as the gym manager, to which Jenkins jokingly replied, [...] "I'm a 60-year-old man, not Brad Pitt.

[...] The major controversy among Chinese officials is that they believe the purpose of the THAAD system, [...] "which detects and intercepts incoming missiles at high altitudes, is actually to track missiles launched from China" [...] not from North Korea. Chinese nuclear experts report that China is focused on the positioning of another THAAD radar system, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the Korean peninsula, for gleaning details about China's nuclear weapons delivery systems, such as THAAD's ability to distinguish which missiles might be carrying decoy warheads.

2500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Frames were either written or co-written by DeWyze. He wrote around twenty songs and then {{selected}} thirteen to include on the album.

[...] "Like I Do" [...] {{was inspired by a}} friend of DeWyze's, who went through a similar situation. [...] "Who Would've Known" [...] was written for DeWyze's wife, Jonna Walsh, whom he married in July 2012. The song was played as she walked down the aisle at their wedding, and DeWyze also performed it himself during the reception.
