50|$|There are slide gates {{that can}} be {{designed}} for special layout, such as cantilever slide gate, <b>telescopic</b> <b>slide</b> gate, on-slope slide gate with recuperation gear, curved slide gate (aka corner gate).|$|E
50|$|Tuning slides came {{in during}} the very late 18th century. Early trombonists {{adjusted}} pitch with the slide, and by adding variously shaped and sized crooks. Modern reproductions often have a bell bow tuning slide or <b>telescopic</b> <b>slide</b> between the slide and bell sections. Crooks are still used, as are variously sized bell bow sections for larger changes.|$|E
50|$|A sackbut {{is a type}} of {{trombone}} {{from the}} Renaissance and Baroque eras, characterised by a <b>telescopic</b> <b>slide</b> that is used to vary the length of the tube to change pitch. Unlike the earlier slide trumpet from which it evolved, the sackbut possesses a double slide, with two parallel sliding tubes, which allows for playing scales in a lower range.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{describes the}} design of industrial entrance gate. It is a <b>telescopic</b> <b>sliding</b> door with passage width of 6000 mm. The aim of this thesis is to create the concept, design and calculation of functional dimensions, selection of drive and then to set power and performance ratios in the drive for operational use...|$|R
50|$|The wide (53 inches) rear seating {{was given}} extra knee-room by {{recesses}} in {{the backs of}} the front seats. Luxury rear standard fittings included folding tables. Draught free ventilation came from swivelling quarter-lights. There were independent bucket seats in front with a settee type available if requested. Both seating and pedals were adjustable. The driver's steering column was <b>telescopic.</b> A flush-fitting <b>sliding</b> roof was provided. The Lucas mellotone wind-horns adjusted for town or country. The luxurious upholstery was unpleated.|$|R
5000|$|The same 10-round {{detachable}} magazine {{fits the}} MAS-44, MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 rifles. The earlier MAS-40 (1940) rifle had a 5-round magazine within the receiver, {{as on the}} bolt action MAS-36 rifle. Lastly, the MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 are equipped with a rail {{on the left side}} of the receiver. It allows for the immediate installation of a [...] "Modele 1953" [...] APX L806 (SOM) <b>telescopic</b> sight by <b>sliding</b> it into place and then locking it in with a small pressure lever. The MAS-49 and MAS49/56 are capable of consistently hitting individual man-size targets up to 400 meters with the adjustable peep sight and up to 800 meters with the APX 806L telescopic sight. The bore is counter sunk at the muzzle to protect the rifling and preserve accuracy. The barrel is freely floating.|$|R
50|$|This type of {{crossing}} has lights and alarms that operate when closing, and full-width barriers that shut the entire road off to traffic. 125 mph is the {{maximum line speed}} on these lines (including 140 mph over crossings on the line between Peterborough and Grantham). The crossing is controlled by an adjacent signalbox, {{or in the case}} of an MCBR (Manually Controlled Barriers Remotely monitored), a signalbox no less than 1‚ÅÑ2 mi in clear sight of the crossing. Two examples of this type {{of crossing}} are at Saxmundham, Suffolk and Driffield, East Riding of Yorkshire). There are some exceptions, in that some crossings may not have skirts hanging down from the barriers (e.g. Newhaven, East Sussex), {{or in the case of}} the crossings at Deganwy, Conwy, Wales, and Britannia slipway near Kingswear, Devon, the crossing may have three barriers. Another special exception recently brought into use is at Redcar, North Yorkshire, where the electric gates were replaced with <b>sliding</b> <b>telescopic</b> gates, to overcome problems caused by wind.|$|R
