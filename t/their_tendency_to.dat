5|$|After {{building}} two demonstrators in {{what would}} become its signature semi-streamlined, fluted stainless-steel style, the Budd Company built four production rubber-tired rail cars for American railroads: one for the Reading Company, two for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Silver Slipper for the Texas and Pacific Railway. All were plagued by problems, chief among them <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> derail. By 1935, the Silver Slipper had been scrapped, and the Pennsylvania's two cars, the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin collaborations, met the same fate in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds {{are common}} {{components}} of the avifauna of {{some parts of the}} Neotropics and are thought to be important in some ecological processes. They are preyed upon by birds of prey, and <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> join flocks is thought to provide protection against such predation. The greater round-eared bat preys on some antbird species, such as the white-bibbed antbird and the scaled antbird; the latter is the bat's preferred prey. Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly snakes but also nocturnal mammals. Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.|$|E

5|$|Sphecius grandis wasps {{frequently}} {{interact with}} humans because of <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> make their nests in backyards, gardens and sidewalks. Pest control is mostly unneeded as they nest {{in areas with}} little to no vegetation, usually ignore people, and females are not aggressive, tending to save their venom for their cicada prey, but will sting if they are grabbed or stepped on. Despite their large size, being the largest wasp to inhabit California, their sting has been reported as being between merely numbing and sharp to moderate. Males, while smaller, are naturally more aggressive and less tolerant of disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} {{the flow of blood}} to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E
25|$|PWR {{reactors}} {{are very}} stable due to <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> produce less power as temperatures increase; {{this makes the}} reactor easier to operate from a stability standpoint.|$|E
40|$|Conflicts over {{resources}} {{can be resolved}} in many ways, from fighting to sharing. We introduce here a very simple mechanism for implicitly taking turns, the 2 -turntaking rule. Agents adjust <b>their</b> <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> fight over a resource based on previous encounter outcomes. Agents possessing this mechanism are shown {{to be effective in}} competition with agents lacking the mechanism, indicating that there is some benefit to fairness, particularly when it comes at such a low computational cost...|$|R
50|$|The orca {{is known}} as the killer whale (although they are {{dolphins}} not whales) because {{of the way in which}} it hunts in large groups. The hunting style has often been compared to that of wolves. Another reason is <b>their</b> <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> eat other whales and large prey animals such as seals and sea lions. Orcas are scattered among the Continental Shelf from southeast Alaska through the Aleutian Islands. They can also be seen in the waters of Prince William Sound.|$|R

25|$|The two {{aldehydes}} {{of greatest}} importance in industry, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, have complicated behavior because of <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> oligomerize or polymerize.

25|$|This {{species is}} widely {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the world’s most invasive insects, partly due to <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> overwinter indoors and the unpleasant odor and stain left by their bodily fluid when frightened or squashed, as well as <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> bite humans. In Europe it is currently increasing to the detriment of indigenous species, its voracious appetite enabling it to outcompete and even eat other ladybirds. The harlequin ladybird is also highly resistant to diseases that affect other ladybird species, and carries a microsporidian parasite to which it is immune, but that can infect and kill other species. Native ladybird species have experienced often dramatic declines in abundance in areas invaded by H. axyridis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{kinetic model}} is {{presented}} for {{the comparison of}} potential proteolytic processing activities of wild-type and mutant human immunodeficiency virus proteases in the presence and absence of protease inhibitors. The protease processing of gag substrate in the immature virions is assessed by the kinetic parameters, kcat, Km and Ki. The relationship of the estimated potential processing activities to {{the viability of the}} HIV mutants and <b>their</b> <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> resist inhibitors also are discussed. A fully developed model has the potential to simulate the results of inhibitor resistance either in vivo or in cell culture...|$|R
25|$|Careful {{fertilization}} {{technologies are}} important because excess nutrients can be as detrimental. Fertilizer burn can occur when too much fertilizer is applied, resulting in damage or even death of the plant.

25|$|Anaplastic astrocytoma is {{classified}} as grade III and are malignant tumors. They grow more rapidly than lower grade tumors and tend to invade nearby healthy tissue. Anaplastic astrocytomas recur more frequently than lower grade tumors because <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> spread into surrounding tissue makes them difficult to completely remove surgically.|$|E

25|$|Carboxylic acids tend to {{have higher}} boiling points than water, {{not only because of}} their {{increased}} surface area, but also because of <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> form stabilised dimers. Carboxylic acids tend to evaporate or boil as these dimers. For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporised, both of which increase the enthalpy of vaporization requirements significantly.|$|E
25|$|Lead, and to {{some degree}} tin, as used in solder {{contains}} small but significant amounts of radioisotope impurities. Radioisotopes undergoing alpha decay are a concern due to <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> cause soft errors. Polonium-210 is especially problematic; lead-210 beta decays to bismuth-210 which then beta decays to polonium-210, an intense emitter of alpha particles. Uranium-238 and thorium-232 are other significant contaminants of alloys of lead.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{elephant seal}} is distinguished from the northern elephant seal (which does not overlap in range with this species) by its greater body mass and a shorter proboscis. The southern males also appear taller when fighting, due to <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> bend their backs more strongly than the northern species. This seal shows extreme sexual dimorphism in size, seemingly the largest of any mammal by mass, with the males typically five to six times heavier than the females.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} age-related {{differences in}} social comparison orientation and personal relative deprivation (PRD). In Study 1, participants (N= 1290) reported <b>their</b> <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> engage in social comparisons and PRD. Older adults reported {{lower levels of}} social comparison tendency and PRD, and social comparison tendency mediated the relation between age and PRD. The findings reported in Study 1 were replicated in Study 2 using a sample of participants {{between the ages of}} 18 to 30 (n= 180) and 60 + years old (n= 176). Our findings provide evidence that older adults report lower levels of social comparison tendency that, in turn, relate to lower levels of PRD...|$|R
25|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} in the UK in 2010 the FT was receptive to the Liberal Democrats' positions on civil liberties and political reform, and praised the then Labour leader Gordon Brown for his response to the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, but on balance it backed the Conservatives while questioning <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> Euroscepticism. At the subsequent general election in 2015, the FT called for {{the continuation of the}} Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that had governed for the previous five years.|$|E
25|$|Urticating hairs do {{not appear}} at birth but form with each {{consecutive}} molt, widening from molt to molt and outwardly presenting themselves around areas of more dark hairs on the upper back part of the abdomen of juveniles. In elder ages their coloration shifts to match the main tone of abdomen. Despite this shift, urticating hairs nonetheless retain unique characteristics that render them visually distinct from abdominal hairs, such as <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> cover only a portion instead of {{the entirety of the}} opisthosoma.|$|E
25|$|Vicarious shame: {{refers to}} the {{experience}} of shame on behalf of another person. Individuals vary in <b>their</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> experience vicarious shame, which is related to neuroticism and to the tendency to experience personal shame. Extremely shame-prone people might even experience vicarious shame even to an increased degree, in other words: shame on behalf of another person who is already feeling shame on behalf of a third party (or possibly on behalf of the individual proper). The Dutch term for this feeling is 'plaatsvervangende schaamte', the German term is 'die Fremdscham' and in the Spanish language it is referred to as 'vergüenza ajena'.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Co-management is {{considered}} an alternative approach to fisheries management, however, not all co-managed fisheries have been successful. Most studies discussing the success and failure of co-management have emphasized economic and social attributes of success and failure, such as fishery rights and institutional arrangements. The effect on co-management of biological characteristics, such as {{the growth rate of}} the fish stock and the stock size, has gained little attention. This study investigates the influence of intrinsic growth rate (r) and relative stock size (B') on fishers' decision to cooperate with catch quotas. The concept of mixed strategies from game theory is incorporated with basic economic concepts and a biomass dynamics model to capture important aspects in a fishery cooperative. The discounting concept is applied to capture the fishers' <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> cooperate (δ[subscript i]). Profits from fishing are specified for each fisher within a 2 by 2 matrix with two players and two strategies (cooperative and non-cooperative). When both players have dominant strategies, where one player's best strategy coincides with the other player's best strategy, the game has a pure strategy equilibrium. Alternatively, the equilibrium outcome of the game is determined using mixed strategies. The results indicate that the biological parameters, r and B', influence fishers' cooperation. However, social parameters (δ[subscript i]) and economic parameters (profit/cost ratio when the stock is at the carrying capacity) must also be considered. Furthermore, this study finds that the fishers are more likely to play the cooperative strategy over very wide ranges of r and B' when <b>their</b> <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> cooperate are high. In contrast, the fishers are more likely to play mixed strategy when <b>their</b> <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> cooperate are low. Having a large discrepancy between the fishers' <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> cooperate has less influence on the outcomes of the game than having high values for the fishers' <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> cooperate. The profit/cost ratio generally accentuates the most frequent outcomes of the game. For instance, if the outcomes are mostly mixed strategies, a higher ratio expands the mixed strategy outcomes over wider ranges of r and B'...|$|R
