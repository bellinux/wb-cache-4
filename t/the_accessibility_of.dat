The game has received positive comments from reviewers, amassed a player base of over 500,000, surpassed three million downloads, and been played in many professional tournaments.|$|E

A sequel, Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star, was released on 29 December 2011, with an English version being released on Christmas Day the following year. In addition to the main games in the series, Hatoful Boyfriend has made transitions into other media: a monthly webcomic was serialized in the anthology Manga Life WIN+, several supplementary materials and official dōjin works have been released, and four drama CDs based on the series have been made. An episodic web series began in 2014.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, other {{proteins}} {{have evolved}} to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> the DNA template to the polymerase.|$|E

The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms.

5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain non-governmental organization such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> HIV testing.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception {{of the rule of}} law include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability of judicial review, and <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry.|$|E
5|$|Two {{important}} legal {{decisions in}} the 1930s helped increase <b>the</b> <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued {{each other in the}} Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.Rose, Melody, Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.Tone, p. 178: Tone calls the ruling a coup d'etat for Sanger. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of medical school curricula.. Retrieved 15 October 2011. However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: There {{is a great}} health {{services}} disparity between {{urban and rural areas}} in China. The percentage of people who are unable to access {{health services}} due to long travel times increases. This paper takes Donghai County as the study unit to analyse areas with physician shortages and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services. We analyse how the unequal health services resources distribution and the New Cooperative Medical Scheme affect <b>the</b> potential spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services in Donghai County. We also give some advice on how to alleviate <b>the</b> unequal spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services in areas that are more remote and isolated. Methods: The shortest traffic times of from hospitals to villages are calculated with an O-D matrix of GIS extension model. This paper applies an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E 2 SFCA) method to study <b>the</b> spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services and to determine areas with physician shortages in Donghai County. The sensitivity of the E 2 SFCA for assessing variation in <b>the</b> spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services is checked using different impedance coefficient values(a). Geostatistical Analyst model and spatial analyst method is used to analyse the spatial pattern and the edge effect <b>of</b> potential spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services. Results: The results show that 69 % of villages have access to lower potential spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services than the average for Donghai County, and 79 % of the village scores are lower than the average for Jiangsu Province. <b>The</b> potential spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services diminishes greatly from the centre of the county to outlying areas. Using a smaller impedance coefficient leads to greater disparity among the villages. <b>The</b> spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services is greater along highway in the county. Conclusions: Most of villages are in underserved health services areas. An unequal distribution of health service resources and the reimbursement policies of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme have led to an edge effect regarding spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services in Donghai County, whereby people living {{on the edge of the}} county have less access to health services. Comprehensive measures should be considered to alleviate <b>the</b> unequal spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> health services in areas that are more remote and isolated...|$|R
