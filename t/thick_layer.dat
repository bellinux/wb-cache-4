5|$|All whales have a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of blubber. In {{species that}} {{live near the}} poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard}} time getting through a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} was eaten in the Scottish Islands from the Neolithic until the eighteenth century, and its <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fat {{beneath the skin}} {{was used as a}} cure for sciatica.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans {{includes}} whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully {{adapted to}} aquatic {{life with a}} spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.|$|E

5|$|Elements of the cold, harsh {{environment}} of the Alps are apparent: distant mountains capped in snow rise up behind Napoleon and his troupe, while a steep cliff face appears on his left, and the path underfoot has a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of ice.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
60|$|They wandered {{round the}} deserted house. Everywhere the same tale. <b>Thick</b> <b>layers</b> of dust {{apparently}} undisturbed.|$|R
50|$|When it {{is needed}} to produce a <b>thicker</b> <b>layer,</b> the {{photoresist}} with higher viscosity will be preferred.|$|R
50|$|Konjovic's mature {{style of}} {{painting}} is characterised by <b>thick</b> <b>layers</b> of paint. He resorted to pastels {{in the years}} after World War II, when there was a shortage of oil paints. Later on, he returned to oils, layering them on the surface in <b>thicker</b> <b>layers</b> than ever; this presents quite a challenge when cleaning some of the paintings. The Byzantine phase of his last years is characterised by thinner layers of paint, with patches of unpainted surface.|$|R
5|$|The {{geological}} {{study of}} Antarctica {{has been greatly}} hindered by {{nearly all of the}} continent being permanently covered with a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of ice. However, new techniques such as remote sensing, ground-penetrating radar and satellite imagery have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.|$|E
5|$|Ida's surface appears heavily cratered {{and mostly}} gray, {{although}} minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, other features are evident, such as grooves, ridges, and protrusions. Ida {{is covered by}} a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of regolith, loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, debris fragments are called ejecta blocks, several {{of which have been}} observed on the surface.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fog rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thick</b> <b>layers</b> of shale {{beneath the}} Syracuse area were formed {{over a period}} of 300 to 500 million years ago. On the East Coast of North America, two landmasses {{collided}} and formed a large mountain range. A large shallow depression to the west formed an inland sea. Precipitation and runoff over millions of years gradually eroded the mountain range and sediment, in the form of mud, consolidated into <b>thick</b> <b>layers</b> of what later hardened into shale.|$|R
30|$|Homogenous compact crusts. <b>Thicker</b> <b>layers</b> (up to 150  μm) of {{accumulated}} deposits well {{adhered to}} the marble hiding any surface traces and details.|$|R

5|$|The {{spore print}} is white. Spores are {{elliptic}} (or narrowly so), and measure 8–12 by 4.8–6.2µm. There are clamp connections {{present in the}} hyphae. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 23–30 by 8–10µm. The hymenium lacks cystidia. The cap flesh comprises homogenous, interwoven hyphae that are 3–5µm in diameter, while the cap cuticle is a 200–300-micrometer <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of interwoven, gelatinous hyphae up to 4µm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical, and produce a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of mucus, forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell {{is affected by the}} amino acid glycine which is present in the nutrient medium peptone.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E
40|$|Relaxation of {{strained}} silicon on 20 % linear graded virtual substrates was quantified using high resolution x-ray diffraction and a defect etching technique. The thickness of {{strained silicon}} was varied between 10 and 180 nm. Relaxation {{was observed in}} layers below the critical thickness but increased to only 2 % relaxation in the <b>thickest</b> <b>layers</b> even with annealings up to 950 °C. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed stacking faults present in <b>layers</b> <b>thicker</b> than 25 nm, and nucleated 90 ° Shockley partial dislocations forming microtwins in the <b>thickest</b> <b>layer.</b> These features are implicated in the impediment of the relaxation process...|$|R
50|$|The SEI layer would {{normally}} form a layer impenetratable for electrolyte, which prevents further growth. However, {{due to the}} swelling of the silicon, the SEI layer cracks and become porous.Thus, it can grow to into <b>thicker</b> <b>layers.</b> A <b>thick</b> SEI <b>layer</b> results in a higher cell resistance, which decreases the cell efficiency.|$|R
30|$|This {{structure}} was only observed for <b>thick</b> gallium <b>layers</b> at only high temperatures. A {{possible explanation for}} this is that <b>thick</b> <b>layers</b> form large Ga particles (400 nm in diameter in average for 100 -nm <b>thick</b> Ga <b>layer)</b> sitting {{at the top of the}} wires which stay in a molten form at high temperatures. Therefore, the molten form of Ga slides down, covering the surface of the wire creating smaller catalyst sites for growth of thinner nano-wires from the original nano-wire surface.|$|R
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Kohala's native Hawaiian {{rain forest}} has a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of ferns and mosses {{carpeting}} the floor, which act as sponges, absorbing water from rain and passing {{much of it}} through to the groundwater in aquifers below; when feral animals like pigs trample the covering, the forest loses its ability to hold in water effectively, and instead of recharging the aquifer, it results in a severe loss of topsoil, much of which ends up being dumped by streams into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{structures}} at Zaculeu {{were grouped}} around small plazas and were generally built from masonry, {{coated with a}} <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of plaster. Fragments bear floral and geometric designs, indicating the structures were originally brightly painted. Stones were undressed and cemented in adobe mortar. No evidence of corbel vaulting has been found and {{very little in the}} way of stone sculpture. The architecture completely lacks stone sculpture. Burials from the Early Classic yielded a rich array of finds, but Late Classic burials were accompanied by a lesser variety of grave offerings.|$|E
50|$|Mode water {{formation}} {{areas are}} generally characterized by wintertime mixed layers that are relatively thick {{compared with other}} mixed layers in the same geographical region. North Atlantic, Southern eastern Indian Oceans and Ocean in the Pacific have the <b>thickest</b> mixed <b>layers,</b> so these <b>thick</b> <b>layers</b> {{are associated with the}} North Atlantic’s subpolar mode water and the Southern Ocean’s subantarctic mode water. Relatively <b>thick</b> mixed <b>layers</b> are also found in the subtropical mode water areas near the separated western boundary currents.|$|R
50|$|Already {{during those}} early campaigns <b>thick</b> <b>layers</b> of {{hazelnut}} shells {{were discovered in}} all dwelling sites. These were positioned around central hearths {{that were used in}} hazelnut roasting.|$|R
50|$|The report {{recommended}} that Trilcor work with its supplier of laminating layer {{to resolve the}} problem, and indicated that a <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> of material would likely perform better.|$|R
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to {{hundreds of miles from}} the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is {{effective}} against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains a <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter {{being among the}} most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.|$|E
5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream {{and covered with a}} <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fondant icing. The recipe today remains identical to the one employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E
50|$|Pre-salt oil is of good quality, {{although}} it is found in reserves that are in deep-sea areas and under <b>thick</b> <b>layers</b> of salt, requiring large-scale investment to extract it.|$|R
