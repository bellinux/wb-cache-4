5|$|After the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{ruled in}} his favour, {{the book was}} made {{available}} in the UK. However following the publication, the British Government obtained a High Court order to confiscate all proceeds from <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>on</b> {{the grounds that the}} government owned the copyright to anything written by Tomlinson. In September 2008, MI6 ended all legal objection to the publication of The Big Breach, released the proceeds from the publication to Tomlinson, and admitted that the organisation's previous legal actions against him were disproportionate. However, it still refused to reinstate him or compensate him for the loss of his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson can now travel freely to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1988 {{publication}} of Roddy Doyle's novel The Commitments (1987) in the United Kingdom, producers Lynda Myles and Roger Randall-Cutler acquired the film rights, and asked Doyle {{to write a}} film adaptation. Doyle, an inexperienced screenwriter, spent one year drafting the script, accompanied by Myles and Randall-Cutler. Although a script was completed, Myles felt it needed improvement, and passed <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> to Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, hoping that they would suggest a more experienced writer. However, upon reading the novel, Clement and La Frenais agreed to help write the script themselves.|$|E

5|$|In the {{two years}} {{following}} the release of Horse in 1941, Kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, {{about a year after}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his Musashi Miyamoto-inspired judo novel, Sanshiro Sugata, the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa. He bought <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> its publication day, devoured it in one sitting, and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawa's initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> Lappland was {{published}} in 1908, with eleven watercolors by Bauer. They were painted in Stockholm, almost 18 months after his visit, using the photos and sketches he had collected during his journey. Many of the photos resulted in other drawings and paintings. Most of these were romanticized versions of the photos, but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance of the goahtis, and {{the richness of the}} Sami garments and crafts. Details from the Sami culture, such as the bent knives, shoes, spears, pots and belts, became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer's trolls. Bauer's eye for detail and his numerous notes also made the material an ethnographic documentation of the era.|$|E
5|$|The record-breaking {{publication}} of Half-Blood Prince {{was accompanied by}} controversy. In May 2005, bookmakers in the UK suspended bets on which main character would die in the book amid fears of insider knowledge. A number of high value bets were made {{on the death of}} Albus Dumbledore, many coming from the town of Bungay where, it was believed, the books were being printed at the time. Betting was later reopened. Additionally, in response to Greenpeace's campaign on using forest friendly paper for big-name authors, Bloomsbury published <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> 30% recycled paper.|$|E

5|$|The second {{version of}} this cantata for a {{performance}} in Leipzig adds two recorders, which double viola I and II an octave higher. John Eliot Gardiner compares the effect to a four-foot stop on a pipe organ. The cantata begins in G minor in the Weimar version, in A minor in the Leipzig version. In the following table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe for the Leipzig version. The time signatures are taken from <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4).

5|$|Three Han {{mathematical}} treatises still exist.

Han-era mathematical achievements include {{solving problems}} with right-angle triangles, square roots, cube roots, and matrix methods, finding more accurate approximations for pi, providing mathematical {{proof of the}} Pythagorean theorem, use of the decimal fraction, Gaussian elimination to solve linear equations, and continued fractions to find the roots of equations.|$|E
5|$|Walter Kirn wrote Up in the Air, <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> {{which the}} film is based, during a snowbound winter on a ranch in rural Montana, while {{thinking}} about airports, airplanes and first-class passengers he had met who would strongly resemble Ryan Bingham.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>on</b> the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E
5|$|Handbooks, guides, manuals, and treatises {{for various}} {{subjects}} {{were written in}} the Han. The Western Han Book of Fan Shengzhi (Fan Shengzhi shu 氾勝之書) written during Emperor Cheng's reign {{is one of two}} manuals on agricultural techniques and processes that have survived from the Han. The other is the Eastern Han Monthly Instructions for the Four Classes of People (Simin yueling 四民月令) written by Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 CE). Mathematical treatises included <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>on</b> Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu) The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing), and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu). There were also works on astronomy, such as the Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images (Tianwen qixiang zazhan 天文氣象雜占) from the 2nd-century-BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts and Zhang Heng's (78139 CE) Spiritual Constitution of the Universe (Lingxian 靈憲) published in 120 CE.|$|E
