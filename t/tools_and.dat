40|$|Automation is {{important}} for increasing productivity in <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> die making industry since it enables companies to run their machines without any operator and to increase machine runtimes in night shifts and on weekends. In this paper a holistic concept for the automation of the core technologies (milling <b>and</b> EDM) in <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> die making industry is developed. At first differences between automation in small and large-scale productions are investigated. Prerequisites for automation in <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> die making are analysed. From this analysis core elements for the automation can be derived: machining, setting up, data provision and material provision. These elements are specified in detail to develop possible scenarios for automation in <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> die making industry...|$|R

30|$|The {{reason that}} the {{adhesion}} of <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> chip {{is that there are}} strong affinity between the <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> chip materials. However, the tool’s coating can increase the wear-resistant performance <b>and</b> <b>tool</b> life. Only when the coating is worn, the adhesion can occur. Therefore, the coating wear should be investigated first when studying the adhesion condition.|$|R

30|$|Adhesive wear is a {{phenomenon}} which occurs when two materials rub together with sufficient force to cause the removal of material from the less wear-resistant surface [27]. The precondition of adhesive wear is {{the interaction between the}} <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> chip materials. The affinity between the <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> workpiece materials has a great effect on adhesion, and the affinity is proportional to the intersolubility of the <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> chip materials. Through the energy spectrum analysis, the elements of the workpiece and chip materials are found in the tool’s material. Thus, it is considered that the replacement reaction occurs between the <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> workpiece elements, thus the substituted solid solution is formed. From materials science knowledge, the atomic size, electronegativity and the location of element periodic table will affect the formation the substituted solid solution.|$|R
