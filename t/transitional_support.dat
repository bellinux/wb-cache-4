40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{contributing}} factors to collegiate foster youth’s college attendance and retention while in college. A qualitative {{study was conducted}} consisting of eight face to face interviews were conducted. Participants were student recipients of California State University, San Bernardino’s Educational Opportunity - Renaissance Scholars Program. Areas studied: pre-college admission, <b>transitional</b> <b>support</b> systems, and retention support while in college. Results identified support from high school teachers and school counselors played significant roles in the participant’s future college attendance, family support {{was not a significant}} influence, and social work support was not reported by any participants. All participants received supportive services from the Renaissance Scholars program after college admission, however, a majority were not aware of the program’s existence prior. Once in college, many of those who received pre-college support from school counselors and teachers stated an ongoing positive social relationship while traversing college. Psycho-socially, the “life changing event” of attending college, created enduring relational-bonds for students. Conversely, participants without positive support equated to the lack of support (being told that they would not succeed) as their driving force to attend college. The results highlight the significance divide between the positive ongoing resources provided by social services, and the foster youth’s perception of social services interactions towards their benefit. These results illuminate the importance of providing ongoing pre-college, <b>transitional</b> <b>support</b> systems, and retention support resources, to current and former collegiate foster youth.

Based on two research models (technology acceptance and personal computer utilization) recently published in IS literature, an integrated model which consists of six variables and incorporates key elements of both models was developed to examine determinants of CASE acceptance. The findings indicate that ease of use has the largest influence on CASE acceptance, followed by long-term consequences. Both <b>transitional</b> <b>support</b> and near-term usefulness {{do not have a}} significant direct effect on the acceptance but exhibit their indirect influence through ease of use and/or long-term consequences.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 19 - 24) Transitioning from high-school {{into college}} and/or the workforce {{can be extremely}} challenging for individuals on the autism spectrum {{as well as their}} families and teachers. Although some young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) do achieve independence after high school, many continue to depend on their families for support. Understanding the unique problems associated with ASD including socialization, communication, independent daily living skills, academic functions, and self-advocacy is critical when determining a <b>transitional</b> <b>support</b> plan. According to the California Department of Developmental Services (2003), the number of individuals diagnosed with ASD is increasing every year. Many of these students will attend postsecondary educational settings or enter the work force. The purpose of this graduate project is to develop a resource guide for transitioning students with ASD from high school to beyond.
