5|$|The {{battle in}} the nebula was a {{difficult}} sequence to accomplish {{without the aid of}} computer-generated models. <b>The</b> <b>swirling</b> nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water. All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department. Using matte work, the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot. The destruction of the Reliants engine nacelle was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.|$|E

40|$|Oxygen is {{the most}} common {{impurity}} present in silicon wafers. High temperature device fabrication processes lead to oxygen precipitate nucleation and growth. These precipitates, with their internal gettering ability of metal impurities, are thought to be the reason behind <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> defect.  We characterize <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> defect observed in both Czochralski (Cz) and non-contact crucible (NOC) silicon wafers using temperature- and injection-dependent photoluminescence imaging (TIDPLI). We generate swirl defects by subjecting the wafers to phosphorus diffusion gettering at 860 °C followed by thermal oxidation at 1000 °C. We use TIDPLI to compute the spatially resolved SRH lifetime strictly due to <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> defect. This allows the fitting of two independent defects and the calculation of their parameters 7 ̆f 1  and 7 ̆f 2. We compare the resulting defect parameters in both Cz and NOC silicon wafers to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> pattern in both types of wafers originates from the same defect. Our results for the Cz wafers differ from defect parameters reported previously in the literature for Cz wafers with intentionally grown oxide precipitates. This might be an indication of a different oxide precipitate morphology in <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> patterns. Also, we successfully apply a rapid thermal annealing treatment, often called tabula rasa, to annihilate <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> defect at a temperature of 1080 °C.  We explain the results by the dissolution of the oxide precipitates responsible for <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> defect, restoring a homogeneous lifetime across the wafer free of swirl defects...|$|R

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} {{aspects of the}} liquid fuel placement in a swirl cup were investigated experimentally at elevated pressure. The operating parameter whose effect was investigated was air pressure. Air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) and relative pressure drop were held constant during variations of air pressure.

Measurement techniques included Mie-scattering laser light sheets for spray visualization, PDA for a detailed spay analysis and LDA for investigation of the air flow field {{in the absence of}} the spray. <b>The</b> test <b>swirl</b> cup geometry consisted of axial segments, so that cross-sectional planes in the interior of <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> cup were accessible for light sheet imaging and LDA measurements. PDA measurements were conducted downstream of <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> cup exit plane. Operating conditions realized for PDA measurements were 6, 12 and 18 bar at 700 K. Light sheet imaging and LDA measurements were performed at scaled operating conditions.

25|$|The second semi-final saw France face England.

The flow out of the valves forms a jet which collides with the cylinder wall before flowing down along the wall.

25|$|Measurements {{showed that}} the vortex whistle was created by a {{rotating}} asymmetric vortex which created a rotating force vector in {{the plane of the}} exit and a rotating dipole sound field. The phenomenon of swirl instability has been shown to occur in other situations. One was the flow separation on the upper side of delta-shaped airfoils of high speed aircraft (Concorde), The angle of attack of the leading edge resulted in a swirl flow that became unstable. Another is the flow within cyclone separators; <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> flow there occurs in an annular region between two tubes. The flow reverses at the closed end of the outer tube and exits through the inner tube. Under certain conditions, the flow in the reversal region becomes unstable, resulting in a period rotating force on the outer tube.|$|E
25|$|The {{driving force}} in {{littoral}} cave development is wave action. Erosion is ongoing anywhere that waves batter rocky coasts, but where sea cliffs contain zones of weakness, rock is removed at a greater rate along these zones. As the sea reaches into the fissures thus formed, they begin to widen and deepen due to the tremendous force exerted within a confined space, not only by direct action of the surf and any rock particles that it bears, but also by compression of air within. Blowholes (partially submerged caves that eject large sprays of sea water as waves retreat and allow rapid re-expansion of air compressed within) attest to this process. Adding to the hydraulic power of the waves is the abrasive force of suspended sand and rock. Most sea-cave walls are irregular and chunky, reflecting an erosional process where the rock is fractured piece by piece. However, some caves have portions where the walls are rounded and smoothed, typically floored with cobbles, and result from <b>the</b> <b>swirling</b> motion of these cobbles in the surf zone.|$|E

First, it was performed to <b>the</b> effects of <b>swirl</b> brake on <b>the</b> static flow characteristics of labyrinth seal with swirl ratio and pressure distribution based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). And then a comparison between leakage predicted by the CFD model and measurement was presented to verify {{the accuracy of the}} simulation.

The CFD numerical results show that <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> brake effectively reduces <b>the</b> seal <b>swirl</b> ratio (∼ 60 - 75 % less), circumferential pressure difference (∼ 25 - 85 % less) so that the seal destabilizing forces decrease.

Steadying himself and his mount, he used one arm to lift the Union soldier by the shirt collar and then wielded him as a human shield before casting his body aside after he had found his way to safety. Forrest is acknowledged to have been the last man wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. Forrest galloped back to his incredulous troopers.

Grove’s partner, Edward North Buxton, suggested {{remaining on the}} summit {{for a couple of}} hours to see if the weather would improve, but the rest of the party rejected his proposal, recognising there was neither sufficient daylight left for them to descend the impossibly exposed and unknown east ridge, nor to down-climb the sheer route they had just ascended. They chose instead to attempt a descent down the unknown southern side of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. They found it trying work to descending the steep ice bank from the summit in the furious storm, but managed eventually to find their way down through one stone-raked couloir to another on the mountain’s south-east face. As twilight fell they reached the head of the Glacier de Bionnassay Italian which formed the northern arm of the huge Glacier du Miage. Here, at a height well above that of the Col de Miage (3,300 m) upon which they could look down, they found refuge amongst rocks beside the steep glacier. They tried to rest there, having had nothing to drink all day except a little brandy and some tasteless wine that they had brought with them; glacial meltwater flowing beneath the rocks on which they sat were totally inaccessible to them. They were also wet through from the storm which by now had passed over, revealing a clear, starry sky. The trickles of water ceased as the temperature dropped below freezing and the night slowly became calm until the silence was shattered by the roar of rockfall over their heads. Abandoning their bivouac site, they took refuge amongst steeply sloping rocks which offered protection from stonefall, but no comfort whatsoever. After a miserable night’s rest, dawn eventually arrived and the ice-rimed party again began to descend the glacier, led by their guide, Cachat. Eight hours later they arrived at the village of St Gervais and sought appropriate refreshment in a well-to-do hotel, much to the disapprobation of the other guests who regarded their appearance and clothing with horror.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{influence}} of <b>the</b> inlet <b>swirl</b> velocity profile shape on <b>the</b> decay of <b>swirl</b> in steady-state, incompressible, laminar pipe flows is investigated {{by means of}} computational fluid dynamics. The investigation is carried out for a Reynolds number of 2000, which marks the upper limit of the laminar flow behavior for unidirectional pipe flow. Computations are performed for two different mean swirl numbers, namely, for 0. 2 and 0. 5. As the integral parameter for describing <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> intensity, <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> number is used, in contrast to other work relying on the circulation, instead. It is observed that decay of <b>swirl</b> number along <b>the</b> pipe length occurs at different rates for different shapes of <b>the</b> inlet <b>swirl</b> velocity profile, although the inlet value of <b>the</b> <b>swirl</b> number is kept constant when changing profile shapes. Although this result is obtained for the laminar flow, which is {{not as important as}} the turbulent one for engineering applications, it implies the possibility of a similar dependency for turbulent flows, and, thus, calls for the further investigations of the phenomena for turbulent flow...|$|R
