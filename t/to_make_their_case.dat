On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>case</b> to Minnesotans. The government shutdown ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the shutdown, albeit with certain conditions.|$|E

60|$|These are {{sometimes}} so apparent that they command the charity of others; {{but there are}} also many families reduced to decay whose conditions are not so public, and yet their necessities as great.

The Credentials Committee refused to seat them, even though the Joint Board represented about 85 {{percent of the total}} IFWU membership. AFL President Green—tired of the constant conflict in New York City, believing Shachtman and the leadership of the IFWU were incompetent, and convinced that fighting the Joint Board was a waste of money—persuaded Shachtman to at least let Gold and the other Joint Board delegates speak before the convention <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>case.</b> Gold delivered an impassioned speech in which he denounced the attacks on the political views of the Joint Board's leadership, argued that the union should be spending its money building solidarity and fighting employers, and pushed for strong internal democratic procedures in the IFWU. But despite his pleas, the convention refused to seat the delegates, and then revoked the charters of the locals which comprised the Joint Board.|$|E
25|$|On 5 May, Marshal Pietro Badoglio led Italian {{troops into}} Addis Ababa, and Mussolini {{declared}} Ethiopia an Italian province.

From Gibraltar, the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner. By doing this, the government of the United Kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception.|$|E
40|$|How {{should a}} dispute be settle between two {{opposing}} parties? The adversarial procedure invites the parties <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>cases</b> <b>to</b> an impartial arbitrator, while the inquisitorial procedure requires the arbitrator to adjudicate {{on the basis}} of his own investigations. Even if it is assumed that the arbitrator is, on average, as well informed as the two opposing parties, the adversarial procedure is shown to be strictly superior. This superiority stems from the ability within the adversarial procedure to allocate the burden of proof in an effective manner, and thereby extract the maximal informational content from apparently inconclusive contests. ...|$|R
40|$|Should arbitrators {{adjudicate}} on {{the basis}} of their own investigations, or invite the interested parties <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>cases</b> and decide {{on the basis}} of the information so gathered? I call the former the inquisitorial procedure in arbitration and the latter the adversarial procedure. I conduct a welfare comparison of the two procedures by constructing a game-theoretic model of decision making by an arbitrator in the face of self-interested reporting strategies by the interested parties. Even if it is assumed that the arbitrator is, on average, as well informed as the two opposing parties, the adversarial procedure is strictly superior. The source of this superiority lies in a non-convexity in the adversarial procedure. There are increasing marginal returns to improvements in the information of an interested party. There are no analogous increasing returns to the arbitrator’s information under the inquisitorial procedure. advocates; Asymmetric Information; inquisitor; legal procedure; persuasion games; value of information...|$|R

500|$|Annulment {{is not a}} divorce; it is {{a ruling}} by the Church that the {{marriage}} was never valid. The marriage is deemed invalid if it lacks one of five integral elements: it should be [...] "complete", [...] "lifelong", [...] "mutual", a [...] "free gift" [...] and of [...] "man and woman". According to Pope John Paul II's Address to the Roman Rota on 22 January 1996, couples {{do not have a}} right to an annulment, but do have a right <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>case</b> for nullity or validity before [...] "the competent Church authority and to request a decision in the matter." [...] According to the Catholic Diocese of Arlington: ...signs that might indicate reasons to investigate for an annulment are: marriage that excluded {{at the time of the}} wedding the right to children, or to a permanent marriage, or to an exclusive commitment. In addition, there are youthful marriages; marriages of very short duration; marriages marked by serious emotional, physical, or substance abuse; deviant sexual practices; profound and consistent irresponsibility and lack of commitment; conditional consent to a marriage; fraud or deceit to elicit spousal consent; serious mental illness; or a previous bond of marriage.

50|$|Corax {{originated}} some of {{the basic}} principles and laid the groundwork for the Greek scholars to follow- particularly Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. They took these properties and applied them to other rhetorical uses, particularly in government. However, Corax developed these methods specifically for the law court, not the assembly. Under the Deinomenids, the land and property of many common citizens had been seized; these people flooded the courts in an attempt to recover their property. Corax devised an art of rhetoric to permit ordinary men <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>cases</b> in the courts. His chief contribution was in helping structure judicial speeches into various parts: proem, narration, statement of arguments, refutation of opposing arguments, and summary. This structure is the basis for all later rhetorical theory. His pupil Tisias is said to have developed legal rhetoric further, and may have been the teacher of Isocrates. As in the case of Socrates, all we know of the work of Corax is from references made by later writers, such as Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero. He never wrote any of his teachings himself; they were all recorded and published by his pupil, Tisias.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the tragic case of San Dwe, a young Karen man from Burma who was employed as one of London Zoo’s elephant drivers. In 1928 his roommate, the famous and celebrated mahout Said Ali, was murdered in his bed, bludgeoned {{to death with a}} sledgehammer. San Dwe claimed that Ali had been attacked by a group of white men. However, this explanation of events proved inconsistent and was swiftly dismissed by the police. In the days that followed, San Dwe {{was arrested and charged with}} Said Ali’s murder. Yet, despite being the prime suspect for this brutal crime, in the archival records San Dwe is depicted as a sympathetic character. This was because his case garnered public sympathy, particularly from loyalist Karen nationalists, London Baptists, and retired colonial officials. All three of these groups campaigned on his behalf. Their petitions and letters to the Home Office in his defense deployed normative imperial understandings of race, gender, and sexuality <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>cases.</b> Historicizing the sympathy that underpinned this support demonstrates how emotion, imperialism, and justice were entangled in interwar Britain.

What are the reasons which have been advanced against the issue of a Constitution to the Orange River Colony? Various reasons have been put forward. We have been told, first, that the Colony is not ripe for self-government. When you have very small communities of white men in distant and immense territories, and when those communities are emerging from a wild into a more settled condition, then it is very necessary and very desirable that the growth of self-governing institutions should be gradual. But that is not the situation in the Orange River Colony. The Orange Free State was the model small republic of the world. The honourable traditions of the Free State are not challenged by any who take the trouble to study its history, either in the distant past, or in the years immediately preceding the South African war. The right hon. gentleman the Member for West Birmingham himself, speaking in this House on December 7, 1900, used language which, I think, should go far to dissipate the idle fears which we hear expressed in various quarters upon the grant of self-government to the Orange River Colony: ...|$|E
