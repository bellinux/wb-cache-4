40|$|The {{effect of}} tension of <b>teatcup</b> liners on teat end {{condition}} {{and quantity of}} keratin in the teat canal was investigated. Liner tension was increased by using longer <b>teatcup</b> shells. The first experiment used six Holstein cows in early lactation Left quarters were milked with liners under medium or normal tension by using Conewango liners in 142 mm shells. Right quarters were milked with liners under high tension by mounting the liners in <b>teatcup</b> shells 149 mm in length. By day 16 test end condition and sensitivity to manipulation were worsened by thrice daily milking when liners were under a higher tension. Two subsequent experiments each used 12 different Holstein cows. These cows were in mid lactation and were milked tn ice daily for 10 or 30 d. Left quarters were milked with liners under high tension Right quarters were milked with liners under low tension by using <b>teatcup</b> shells 126 mm in length. The quantity of keratin removed during milking was not influenced by liner tension. however, the quantity of keratin {{at the end of}} the experiments was increased 10 - 20 % in teats that were milked using liners under a higher tension.

50|$|Milking {{machines}} {{are used to}} harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes inefficient or labour-intensive. One early model was patented in 1907. The milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder. It {{is made up of}} a claw, four <b>teatcups,</b> (Shells and rubber liners) long milk tube, long pulsation tube, and a pulsator. The claw is an assembly that connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the <b>teatcups</b> to the long pulse tube and long milk tube. (Cluster assembly) Claws are commonly made of stainless steel or plastic or both. <b>Teatcups</b> are composed of a rigid outer shell (stainless steel or plastic) that holds a soft inner liner or inflation. Transparent sections in the shell may allow viewing of liner collapse and milk flow. The annular space between the shell and liner is called the pulse chamber.|$|R
50|$|The four {{streams of}} milk from the <b>teatcups</b> are usually {{combined}} in the claw and {{transported to the}} milkline, or the collection bucket (usually sized to the output of one cow) in a single milk hose. Milk is then transported (manually in buckets) or {{with a combination of}} airflow and mechanical pump to a central storage vat or bulk tank. Milk is refrigerated on the farm in most countries either by passing through a heat-exchanger or in the bulk tank, or both.|$|R

Avaliou-se tambÃm o perfil de suscetibilidade a antimicrobianos, de Staphylococcus sp coagulase negativo isolados de amostras de leite do tanque de refrigeraÃÃo. Para avaliar a eficiÃncia do prÃ-dipping, foram escolhidos 12 animais e distribuÃdos aleatoriamente em 3 grupos. Cada grupo recebeu um tratamento quanto higienizaÃÃo dos tetos antes da ordenha: nenhuma higienizaÃÃo, higienizaÃÃo com Ãgua e secagem com papel toalha descartÃvel e prÃ-dipping com iodo e secagem com papel toalha descartÃvel. Para avaliar a eficiÃncia de higienizaÃÃo das teteiras da ordenhadeira mecÃnica, foram coletadas amostras das teteiras antes da ordenha, apÃs utilizaÃÃo em um animal, apÃs utilizaÃÃo em dois animais e apÃs utilizaÃÃo em trÃs animais. Foi realizada pesquisa participativa com um grupo de estudantes oriundos da Agricultura Familiar, durante a qual, realizou-se um mini curso intitulado Boas PrÃticas na Ordenhaâ, com aulas teÃricas e prÃticas. Durante as aulas prÃticas, os estudantes coletaram {{material}} de pontos diversos da sala de ordenha. Foi aplicado um questionÃrio referente a pontos crÃticos na ordenha para avaliar a percepÃÃo dos estudantes antes e depois do mini curso. Dados de uma questÃo foram analisados estatisticamente quanto Ã frequÃncia de escolha das respostas. Houve diferenÃa significativa de percepÃÃo antes e depois em relaÃÃo a sete respostas. No experimento que testou a eficiÃncia do prÃ-dipping houve diferenÃa significativa quanto ao nÃmero de tetos com Staphylococcus sp. e tambÃm Bacilos Gram Positivos entre os tratamentos sem higienizaÃÃo ou higienizaÃÃo com Ãgua e prÃ-dipping. Quanto Ã contagem bacteriana do leite dos quartos mamÃrios, houve diferenÃa significativa entre os tratamentos sem higienizaÃÃo e prÃ-dipping, sendo que o tratamento no qual foi utilizada apenas Ãgua manteve-se semelhante estatisticamente aos demais. No experimento que testou a eficiÃncia de higienizaÃÃo das teteiras, houve diferenÃa significativa entre as mÃdias obtidas antes da ordenha, apÃs ordenha de duas e de trÃs vacas, sendo que a mÃdia obtida apÃs ordenha de uma vaca apresentou diferenÃa significativa apenas em relaÃÃo a trÃs vacas.

To evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} pre-dipping, 12 animals were chosen and randomly divided into 3 groups. Each group received a treatment regarding the sanitation of the teats before the milking: no sanitation, sanitation using water followed by disposable paper towel drying and pre-dipping using iodine followed by disposable paper towel drying. To evaluate the sanitation efficiency of the mechanical milking machineâs <b>teatcups,</b> were collected samples from them before the milking, after use on an animal, after use on two animals and after use on three animals. A participatory survey was held with a group of students from Family Farming, during which was also held a mini course named âGood Practices on Milkingâ, with theoretical and practical classes. During the practical classes, the students collected material from diverse spots of the milking room. It was applied a questionnaire referent to critical points on milking to evaluate the perception of the students before and after the mini course. Data from one question was statistically analyzed as to the frequency of choice of the answers. There were different perceptions, before and after, on all seven answers. On the experiment that tested the efficiency of the predipping there was significant difference as to the number of teats with Staphylococcus sp. and also positive Gram bacilli between treatments with no sanitation or with water sanitation and predipping. As to the milk bacterian count of the mammary quarters, there was significant difference between the treatments without sanitation and pre-dipping, although the treatment with only water kept statistically similar to the others. On the experiment that tested the sanitation efficiency of the mechanical milking <b>teatcups,</b> there was significant difference between the averages obtained before the milking, after milking of two and three cows, although the average obtained after the milking of one cow showed significant difference only if compared to the periods with three cows. As to the bacterian susceptibility to antimicrobials, it showed resistance to five, from the eight that were tested, in at least one sample, being them: amoxilicin+clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, G penicillin and vancomycin, with the highest frequency being showed by the gentamici...|$|R

40|$|According to English tradition, a "storm in a tea cup " {{means that}} a {{particular}} issue has been blown out of all proportion. This quaint English interpretation {{can be applied to}} the <b>teatcup</b> and cluster because milking machine effects on mastitis usually are smaller and less important than the effects of milking management, herd management and cow or teat characteristics. Nevertheless, the inside of a <b>teatcup</b> can be a wet and windy place with rapid pressure changes and occasional storm damage. Our main purpose is to explain the dynamics of teatcup/teat interactions and their likely contribution to new infection rates in commercial herds. In 1987, five main milking-related mechanisms of mastitis infection were proposed by an International Dairy Federation (IDF) Group of Experts lead by Jerry O'Shea (IDF 215, 1987). These mechanisms, summarized in Table 1, provide a convenient starting point.

40|$|Psychrotrophics {{microorganisms}} {{are able}} to multiply under refrigeration temperatures. They can produce heat-resistant extracellular enzymes that cause organoleptic and structural changes in milk and dairy products. With the objective of determining the frequency of microorganisms in the dairy process, four farms were evaluated in Londrina city – Brazil and different points were assessed. Mesophilic (48 hs at 35 oC), psychrotrophic (25 hs at 21 oC) and proteolytic (72 hs at 22 oC) microorganisms were researched, and the proteolytic predominant microflora were determined by using the Gram stain technique. The main psychrotrophic contamination points were the residual water on milk cans, on bulk tank and bad cleaned teats, and milk cans and teats {{were the most important}} sources of proteolytics. Gram negative bacilli represented 69 % of the microorganisms in the refrigerated milk that means 45 % of the total proteolytics microorganisms in the dairy process. Gram negative bacilli is most frequent on bad cleaned teats, <b>teatcups,</b> residual water in milk cans and bulk tank. The psychrotroph count in the refrigerated milk was more than the mesophilic count, showing that that psychrotrophics are the best indicatator for refrigerated milk contamination. The psycrotrophics count at all points assessed were greater than the ideal limit (10 % of the mesophilic count). Thus as refrigeration at 4 oC is not sufficient to control the multiplication of the psycrotrophics group, good practices should be associated to avoid or control milk contamination by psycrotrophics. Os psicrotróficos são microrganismos que têm capacidade de multiplicação em temperaturas de refrigeração. Produzem enzimas termorresistentes como proteases e lipases que promovem alterações organolépticas no leite e comprometem a produção de derivados. Com o objetivo de determinar a freqüência desses microrganismos a produção do leite, foram estudadas 04 propriedades da região de Londrina, PR, analisando diversos pontos do processo. Determinou-se a contagem de microrganismos aeróbios mesófilos (48 hs a 35 ºC), psicrotróficos (25 hs a 21 ºC), psicrotróficos proteolíticos (72 hs a 22 ºC) e as características morfotintoriais da microbiota psicrotrófica proteolítica predominante. Os principais pontos de contaminação por psicrotróficos foram a água residual de latões, tanques de expansão e tetos higienizados inadequadamente, sendo que os psicrotróficos proteolíticos predominam nos latões e tetos. Bacilos Gram negativos representaram 45 % da microbiota proteolítica de todo o processo de produção, no leite refrigerado corresponderam a 69 % dos psicrotróficos proteolíticos encontrados e ainda predominaram nos tetos higienizados, teteiras, água residual de latões e tanques de expansão. As contagens de psicrotróficos superaram as de mesófilos em leite refrigerado, mostrando que a pesquisa de psicrotróficos é ideal para avaliar a real carga microbiana do leite refrigerado. Como a refrigeração a 4 oC não inibe o crescimento deste grupo de microrganismos, deve-se evitar sua incorporação ao leite durante a produção, havendo necessidade da adoção de boas práticas de manejo em todo o processo produtivo...|$|R

Compressive load measurements were conducted on five different liners to assess {{the response of the}} device with the individual materials. Device response to changes in liner tension, wall thickness and penetration depth was favorable. The gel-like material performed statistically similar to teat tissue in the liner tests. Material compression tests indicated that for input strains under 37 %, the gel deformed statistically similar to that of a teat. The gel material seemed to simulate teat tissue better than gum rubber and is a recommended alternative to teat tissue as a sensor covering material on the teat sensor device developed in this study...|$|E

40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{examined}} the relation between a wide range of factors and quarter milk somatic cell count (qSCC), including physical characteristics of the teat and changes in teat tissue due to milking, the effect of short-term, milking-induced changes in teat dimensions on somatic cell count has not yet been investigated. To identify teat dimensions and milking-induced changes in teat dimensions associated with qSCC, we conducted a longitudinal study (n(herds) = 6, n(cows) = 72, n(measurements) = 12). Parity, stage of lactation, teat barrel diameter, and changes in teat barrel diameter during milking were identified as factors associated with qSCC. Teats with wider barrels had higher qSCC. Negative changes in the diameter of the teat barrel during milking (i. e., thinner teats postmilking compared with premilking) were associated with lower qSCC, whereas positive changes (i. e., thicker teats postmilking compared with premilking) were associated with higher qSCC. Selection toward more optimal teat characteristics may therefore result in improved milk quality and udder health. However, a threshold might exist for the maximum reduction in teat barrel diameter below which udder health is negatively influenced. If so, changes in teat barrel diameter might serve as an indicator for suboptimal milking and incorrect choice of <b>teatcup</b> liner or milking machine settings and thus help improve management of the herd...|$|E
40|$|In {{automatic}} milking units single independent teatcups or shell/liner combinations are required. The milking {{characteristics of}} three designs of single-teatcup milking units {{were compared with}} a conventional milking unit in a pipeline milking system. The combined weight of each single-teatcup shell and liner used in the single-teatcup units was 0. 18 kg, 0. 38 kg or 0. 56 kg. The conventional milking cluster had a claw volume of 150 mL and a weight of 3. 16 kg. The single sets of teatcups were applied manually and removed automatically when milk flow from the four teatcups reached 0. 2 kg/min. The experiment involved a latin square design with four groups of Friesian cows (10 cows/group), four 2 -day periods and four treatments. At a flow rate of 4 L/min during simulated milking the mean vacuum level at the teat-end (artificial teat) during the “bphase” of pulsation was 43. 8 kPa with the conventional milking unit and 33 kPa for the three single-teatcup units. The corresponding mean and minimum teat-end vacuum in the “d-phase” were 38. 46 kPa and 29. 54 kPa, respectively, for the conventional system and 24. 95 kPa and 17. 59 kPa, respectively, for the single-teatcup configuration.

40|$|The fully {{automated}} milking system VMS has different functions which complements the actual milking of cows. This master thesis presents {{a method to}} improve the calculation of milk yield in dairy cows for the VMS. This report also investigates if {{it is possible to}} improve the algorithm for finding cows with mastitis (udder inflammation). The correctness of the prediction of milk yield is important for a couple of actions in the VMS. For example, valuable time can be saved if teatcups are attached first to high yielding teats. Only cows with an attained minimum level of predicted yield should be allowed to enter the VMS and get milked. Milking has traditionally been an event to monitor the condition of the cows. Therefore methods that determine the condition are demanded for any automatic milking systems. Mastitis is a costly illness and a working test for ill cows should be implemented in the VMS in order to know which cows that are ill. The goal of this thesis work is to develop two new algorithms for the VMS. First, an improved algorithm for the prediction of secretion rate is presented. The improved algorithm uses a Kalman-filter to update the secretion-rate. The improved method has a lower total prediction in most cases. The Kalman-filter was tested and developed for five farms and was verified on one farm. Second, this report investigates if a cusum test can be used to detect ill cows. The method turns out to be slightly better than the current algorithm. A test for cows which are milked on three or two teats is evaluated. In this test the number of milkings with high conductivity and low secretion rate are weighted together. This algorithm is slightly better than the current algorithm used for detection of ill cows.

40|$|Teat {{morphology}} is {{an important}} parameter in choosing the most appropriate <b>teatcup</b> liner for a herd since the interaction between teat and liner can strongly affect the milking characteristics and udder health. Nevertheless, information on teat morphology is very scarce and rarely sufficient for liner selection. Gathering information on large scale with current techniques is time consuming, subjective and not always accurate. However, the ability to measure teat parameters in an easy way and on large scale has many applications. This study presents a new vision based measuring technique for teat shape parameters. A camera is used to obtain a 2 D image of the teat and image processing analyses to determine teat length and diameters. In addition, shape parameters of teat and teat end can be defined. The resolution in length and diameters is better than 0. 5 mm. The error {{on the length of}} the teats that make an angle in the longitudinal plane of maximum 25 ° towards the camera, is no more than 5 %. To validate the repeatability of the measuring method, the teats of one Holstein cow were measured 5 times by 8 different members of a test panel of which 5 people were experienced in working with cows. Reproducibility was tested by measuring the teats of 7 Holstein cows by the same test panel. The teats of each cow were measured once in a defined order. The sequence in which the members measured the teats was randomized. No {{significant differences were found between}} the 5 successive measurements of one person on 3 teats. Significant differences in left-front teat measurements (p= 0. 002) were due to the lack of cow experience (p= 0. 022). Teat length measurements did not significantly differ between members of the test panel as long as teats could be easily reached. However, no significant differences were found for all teats between operators familiar with cows. In conclusion, a new accurate, repeatable and reproducible method was developed to measure teat parameters in all kinds of milking parlours. To obtain repeatable and reproducible results, some training in working in close interaction with cows is advised...|$|E
40|$|As only little {{detailed}} microbiological {{data about}} only few farms with automatic milking systems were {{available at the}} time of the study, a complete compilation of farms using AMV (Automatische Melkverfahren, Automatic milking procedures), the assessment of the working surroundings and the implementation of microbiological and chemical-physical investigations were planned and carried out. In the course of the 18 -months-project it was confirmed that an AMV is always very demanding on the farmer concerning his farm’s management. The big advantage of these systems is the flexibility of the working hours. The results of the milk study and the swabs samples reveal strong differences in part between farms with a system of the same manufacturer indicating the importance of the factor management among other factors. But only if the total concept of milking technique and -hygiene, the animal‘s house construction and -hygiene, animal’s health and feeding are harmonized, the striven saving of working hours can be reached. The microbiological results of the examination often show a worse status of hygiene concerning AMV than concerning conventional systems. The scope of the study comprised 108 samples from 99 farms with a total of 110 milking systems. The investigation comprised 15 parameters. Only in two cases (pseudomonads and yeasts) the values of the automatic systems are lower than those of conventional systems (including one exception: sulphitereducing anaerobes). For all other microbiological criteria in the milk of automatic systems higher values can be found. Examinated parameters are total viable count, lactic acid bacteria, lactobacilli, coagulase positive staphylococci, enterococci, enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, E. coli and molds. Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes could be detected each once. In both cases, an automated system was affected. When viewing the physical-chemical examination results (cell count, fat, protein, lactose, freezing point, dry matter) the benefits are related to conventional milking systems. Thus, these systems show higher fat, protein and lactose - values and lower cell numbers than the automatic systems. Both a detectable freezing point depression and the lower dry matter content of milk from automated systems compared to conventional processing leads to the conclusion that the water content in the milk from farms applying automatic milking systems is higher. Overall, the automated systems are able to meet the relevant requirements of milk regulation at present time and would also meet the values defined in Reg. (EG) 853 / 2004. In addition, a large range of data arises when comparing different brands of milking systems. However, even {{at the time of the}} investigation it was possible to get milk of the best quality with all brands of the tested automatic milking systems. Meanwhile the AMVs have been established in daily farm work and are on a high technical level. The evaluation of the 381 swab samples, in which the same spectrum of germs was investigated as in the milk tank samples, exhibits different trends. Regarding the study of the liner heads a trended very homogeneous picture is received. Except for the parameter yeast and Bacillus cereus, all values of automatic systems were lower than the ones of conventional milking systems. Shafts of the <b>teatcup</b> liner show, based on the total bacterial count, a similar trend. The same applies for staphylococci and Bacillus cereus. With respect to the other criteria, the majority of the results of the automatic milking exceed those of the conventional systems (lactic acid bacteria, pseudomonads, enterococci, coliforms, E. coli, molds and sulphite-reducing anaerobes). In the conventional systems, the strongest bacterial load was detected on the rinsing heads. Regarding the environment-associated coliforms indicating dirt (especially the faecal germ E. coli), the trend is reversed. In this aspect, significantly higher values could be detected in the automated systems. The results of the investigations of the special udder/teat cleaning systems indicate a lack of clean condition. The requirement for a successful management of these systems is hygiene and cleanliness on the farm, because an automatic milking system is not able to bring the cleaning intensity into line with the individual grade of the udder’s dirtiness and it is not able to control the success of cleaning. That’s why a low output bacterial count is desirable. Stable and animal hygiene are important starting points to reduce the bacterial load on the slabs and teats. A drying of teats after cleaning would have a positive impact on hygiene. Importance should be attached to cleaning and disinfection of the milk carrying components as hygienic vulnerabilities exist in both the automatic and conventional systems. The weak point of all systems - the timely identification and following separation of nonmarketable milk before it reaches the bulk tank - will be continued to work on. On the basis of their computer programmes, automatic milking procedures are capable of comparing current milking with relevant previous ones, so information about differences can be obtained. However, these systems lack precision so often incorrect positive or negative results are created. The first lead to economical losses, the last are decreasing milk quality. The automatic milking procedures must be able to recognize mastitis perfectly and eliminate non-marketable milk before reaching the bulk tank. The usage and development of biosensor technology promises improvements. The problem with the depressed freezing point requires future measures to reduce the residual water content in the milk-carrying equipment...|$|E
