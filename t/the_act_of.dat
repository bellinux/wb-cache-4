The penultimate chapter analyses the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Andrew and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> John and <b>the</b> book concludes with a close study of the important Armenian translation. As has become customary, the volume is rounded off by a bibliography and an index.

5000|$|In one of MacDonald's first books, Christianizing Homer: The Odyssey, Plato, and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Andrew, he posited {{the theory}} that <b>the</b> non-canonical <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Andrew was a Christian retelling of Homer's Iliad. [...] In it he argued that one could detect trends that showed {{parallels}} between the Homeric epic and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Andrew. He argued that <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Andrew is better understood {{in light of the}} Odyssey. That the order <b>of</b> events in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> follows those found in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Andrew, that certain events in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> are better understood when understood in context of the Homeric epics, and that the Homeric texts commonly were available during the first century AD. In subsequent works, MacDonald expanded his hypothesis to include <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apostles and the Gospel of Mark as being Christian variations of the Homeric epics.|$|R
5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E
5|$|After Anne's accession, {{the problem}} of the {{succession}} re-emerged.

The Parliament of England retaliated with the Alien Act 1705, threatening to devastate the Scottish economy by restricting trade.

5000|$|In his seminal work Christianizing Homer: The Odyssey, Plato, and <b>The</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Andrew, MacDonald {{argues that}} the second-century [...] {{apocryphal}} work, <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Andrew, was a Christian version of Homer's Iliad.

5|$|However, Ober Ost, the German {{military}} administration, {{rejected the}} changes.

50|$|Several texts concern {{themselves}} with the subsequent lives of the apostles, usually with highly supernatural events.

5|$|In many human {{cultures}}, <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> premastication {{and direct}} mouth-to-mouth feeding is {{linked with the}} showing of affection, known as kiss feeding.

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the laws governing succession to the shared throne requires the unanimous consent of all the realms.

The rules of succession may only be changed by an Act of Parliament; {{it is not possible}} for an individual to renounce his or her right of succession. <b>The</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714), a granddaughter of James I.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Shmona and Gurya and the Martyrdom of Habib are {{claimed to}} be {{authored}} by a Theophilus who also claims to have witness their martyrdoms. <b>The</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Shmona and Gurya and the Martyrdom of Habib text are often compared with <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Sharbel and <b>the</b> Martyrdom of Barsamya by biblical scholars {{in order to determine}} the reliability and existence of the martyrs. <b>The</b> historicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Sharbel and Martyrdom of Barsamya are universally accepted as fictitious by biblical scholars as similar concepts of literary can be found between the two texts and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Shmona and Gurya and the Martyrdom of Habib, and the names Sharbel and Barsamya were not found on a fourth century AD martyrdom calendar as Shmona, Gurya, and Habib are.|$|R

5|$|A {{coronation}} is <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> placement or bestowal of a crown upon a monarch's head. The term generally also refers {{not only}} to the physical crowning but to the whole ceremony wherein <b>the</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> crowning occurs, along with the presentation of other items of regalia, marking the formal investiture of a monarch with regal power. Aside from the crowning, a coronation ceremony may comprise many other rituals such as the taking of special vows by the monarch, the investing and presentation of regalia to the monarch, and acts of homage by the new ruler's subjects and the performance of other ritual deeds of special significance to the particular nation. Western-style coronations have often included anointing the monarch with holy oil, or chrism as it is often called; the anointing ritual's religious significance follows examples found in the Bible. The monarch's consort may also be crowned, either simultaneously with the monarch or as a separate event.|$|E

50|$|Unique to the Teaching of Addai, {{the first}} Christian {{converts}} names are also mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Sharbel and <b>the</b> Martyrdom of Barsamya. Inscriptions of these names {{can be found}} in once pagan regions of Edessa dating back to the fourth and third century AD and are rarely mentioned in Syriac sources from the fifth century AD and after. Scholar Harold Attridge points out that literary concepts from the Martyrdom <b>of</b> Barsamya and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Sharbel are very similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Shmona and Gurya and the Martyrdom of Habbib. With such similarities, he deduced that <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Sharbel, Martyrdom of Barsamya, and Teaching of Addai texts were written by the same group of pagan authors inspired to integrate their pagan ideology into the Christian community through the use of these texts. Scholars date the Martyrdom <b>of</b> Barsamya, <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Sharbel, and <b>the</b> Teaching of Addai to have been written in the early fifth century AD. More certainly, scholars agree that the Martyrdom <b>of</b> Barsamya and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Sharbel are fictitious.|$|R
