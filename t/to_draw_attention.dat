Once again sportswriters were quick <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to Smith's outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate. After the Cardinals took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial Game 6 call by umpire Don Denkinger overshadowed {{the remainder of the}} Series (which the Royals won in seven games).|$|E

In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo {{to prevent them from}} killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E

The relay was intended <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to a range of human rights issues in China in connection with the Olympics, especially those related to Falun Gong and Tibet, and received support from hundreds of elected officials, past Olympic medallists, human rights groups and other concerned organizations.|$|E

5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to her beauty.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Birmingham {{was one of}} the most racially divided cities in the United States, both as {{enforced}} by law and culturally. Black citizens faced legal and economic disparities, and violent retribution when they attempted <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to their problems. Martin Luther King Jr. called it the most segregated city in the country. Protests in Birmingham began with a boycott led by Shuttlesworth meant to pressure business leaders to open employment to people of all races, and end segregation in public facilities, restaurants, schools, and stores. When local business and governmental leaders resisted the boycott, SCLC agreed to assist. Organizer Wyatt Tee Walker joined Birmingham activist Shuttlesworth and began what they called Project C, a series of sit-ins and marches intended to provoke mass arrests.|$|E

Major General Abraham Adan's 162nd Armored Division was tasked with crossing the canal and achieving an encirclement with its 300 tanks. The division included Colonel Natke Nir's 217th Armored Brigade, Colonel Gabi Amir's 460th Armored Brigade and Aryeh Keren's 500th Armored Brigade. A paratrooper brigade would be transferred to Adan's division {{during the course of}} the battle.

Art historian Sarah Burnage believes Etty's choice of Venus and her Satellites may have been <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to similarities with Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball and possibly to link the Williams-Wynn sisters' beauty with the legendary Venus.|$|E
