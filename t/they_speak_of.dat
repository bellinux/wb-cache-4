5|$|When King Powhatan is {{presented}} with the captured Smith, he decides, {{at the urging of}} the tribe’s priest Grimosco, to execute him. Pocahontas, having been moved by Smith’s nobility, says she will not allow Smith to be killed unless she herself dies with him. This persuades Powhatan to free Smith. Soon, Percy and Rolfe encounter Smith and his Indian allies {{on the way back to}} the settlement, and Rolfe is immediately struck by Pocahontas, whose manner suggests the attraction is mutual. <b>They</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> love, but Rolfe must soon depart with Smith. Pocahontas confesses her love for Rolfe to Miami, who receives the news with anger, jealousy and rage. Pocahontas convinces her father to dissolve her arranged engagement with Miami, which will mean war between their two tribes.|$|E

500|$|The {{major sources}} for {{the lives of women}} in {{classical}} Athens are literary, political and legal, and artistic. [...] As women play a prominent role in much Athenian literature, it initially seems as though {{there is a great deal}} of evidence for the lives and experiences of Athenian women. However, the surviving literary evidence is written solely by men: ancient historians have no direct access to the beliefs and experiences of Classical Athenian women. [...] It is because of this that John J. Winkler writes in The Constraints of Desire that [...] "most of our surviving documents simply cannot be taken at face value when <b>they</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> women".|$|E
500|$|Whorf's {{study of}} Hopi {{time has been}} the most widely {{discussed}} and criticized example of linguistic relativity. In his analysis he argues that there is a relation between how the Hopi people conceptualize time, how <b>they</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> temporal relations, and the grammar of the Hopi language. Whorf's most elaborate argument for the existence of linguistic relativity was based on what he saw as a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi. He argued that the Hopi language, in contrast to English and other SAE languages, does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct countable instances, like [...] "three days" [...] or [...] "five years", but rather as a single process. Because of this difference, the language lacks nouns that refer to units of time. He proposed that the Hopi view of time was fundamental in all aspects of their culture and furthermore explained certain patterns of behavior. In his 1939 memorial essay to Sapir he wrote that “... the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time', or to past, present, or future...” ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian of Education was {{the first}} {{periodical}} to take the reviewing of children's books seriously. Trimmer's over four hundred reviews constituted a set of distinct and identifiable criteria regarding what was valuable in this new genre. As a high-church Anglican, she was intent on protecting Christianity from secularism as well as evangelicalism, particularly as the latter manifested itself in Methodism. Her reviews also reveal {{her to be a}} staunch monarchist and opponent of the French Revolution. As Grenby puts it, [...] "her initial questions of any children's books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy". Religion was Trimmer's first priority and her emphasis on the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy illustrated her fundamentalism. She wrote to a friend: [...] "I will only say, that the more I reflect on the subject, the more I am convinced that it is not right to supersede the figurative style in which <b>they</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> God and divine things, my opinion is, that whoever attempts to teach the truths of divine revelation, should follow the method of the inspired writers as nearly as possible" [...] For Trimmer, the truth of the Bible was not only in its content, but also in its style, and some of her harshest reviews were written against texts that altered both the style and the substance of the Bible.|$|E

[...] He further added that it showcased her [...] "lack of restraint" [...] emotive vocal range and [...] "spitting out lyrics with the gritty passion of a Lucha Villa", calling it [...] "all sass and fire." [...] The singer said in a July 1993 interview that the song [...] " [...] for all the ladies". The lyrics to [...] "Como la Flor" [...] are [...] "simple, plaintive melody and aching". <b>They</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> a woman who witnessed her former lover with another woman and must move on; she wishes them the best, and compares her relationship with her ex-lover to a flower that has withered and died. [...] "Como la Flor" [...] is a [...] "catchy" [...] pop cumbia that depicts a [...] "lovelorn" [...] woman in a [...] "pleading vocal delivery" [...] to a [...] "lost-love". Author Deborah Paredez said that the song signaled Selena's [...] "self-assertion" [...] and found that fans associated the song with [...] "a multivalent emotional register and communal sensibility". Paredez found the recording to contain [...] "emotive chorus to ebullient choreography", and stated that it [...] "captures and conveys" [...] what Roland Barthes called [...] "the grain of Selena's voice". She further added that Selena's [...] "teardrop vocal chords" [...] are present in [...] "Como la Flor", adding that the recording contains a [...] "residue of materiality". Paredez said that, with its melodic shifts, [...] "Como la Flor" [...] successfully [...] "evokes Selena's presence in the elegy marking her absence".|$|E

2500|$|... 'Holy Communion' (or simply 'Communion') {{are used}} by some groups {{originating}} in the Protestant Reformation to mean the entire Eucharistic rite. Others, such as the Catholic Church, do not use this term for the rite, but instead mean by it the act of partaking of the consecrated elements: <b>they</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> receiving Holy Communion even outside of the rite, and of participating in the rite without receiving Holy Communion. The term [...] "Communion" [...] is derived from Latin communio ("sharing in common"), which translates Greek κοινωνία (koinōnía) in : The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?

2500|$|The classic Anselmian {{formulation}} of the satisfaction view should be distinguished from penal substitution. Both are forms of satisfaction theory in that <b>they</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> how Christ's death was satisfactory, but penal substitution and Anselmian satisfaction offer different understandings of how Christ's death was satisfactory. Anselm speaks of human sin as defrauding God of the honour he is due. Christ's death, the ultimate act of obedience, brings God great honour. As it was {{beyond the call of}} duty for Christ, it is more honour than he was obliged to give. Christ's surplus can therefore repay our deficit. Hence Christ's death is substitutionary; he pays the honour to the Father instead of us paying. Penal substitution differs in that it sees Christ's death not as repaying God for lost honour but rather paying the penalty of death that had always been the moral consequence for sin (e.g., [...] ). The key difference here is that for Anselm, satisfaction is an alternative to punishment, [...] "The honor taken away must be repaid, or punishment must follow." [...] By Christ satisfying our debt of honor to God, we avoid punishment. In Calvinist Penal Substitution, it is the punishment which satisfies the demands of justice.|$|E

2500|$|Naturalized from Latin into English (a loanword), caries in its English form {{originated}} as a mass noun {{that means}} [...] "rottenness", that is, [...] "decay". When used in that sense, it takes singular verb inflections (just {{like the word}} decay does). Thus caries was not traditionally a plural word synonymous with holes or cavities; that is, {{it was not the}} plural form of any singular form cary meaning hole or cavity. Nonetheless, the idea that it is such a plural is a reanalysis that naturally occurs to most English speakers, and the reanalyzed sense is common enough to be entered in various dictionaries and to exist in respectable usage. It still shows a hint of its reanalyzed origins in that it remains idiomatically limited to a plurale tantum sense—that is, like scissors or glasses, one speaks of plural caries obligately in the plural—not of one scissor, glass, or cary. (This is why one can look for a singular count-noun form of dental cary in any of a dozen major medical and general dictionaries and not find it listed.) Many still use it in the traditional sense (mass, singular), which is why <b>they</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> carious lesions rather than just caries when they intend the plural count sense.|$|E
2500|$|Pupa. Suspended by {{the tail}} and a band that encircles it much nearer the head than is usual with Papilio pupae. In form stout, flattened, dilated in the middle, with head and thorax thrown back. Head {{somewhat}} angular and tuberculated; two of the abdominal segments each with a prominent dorsal pair of pointed tubercles. Colour usually light brown, with a strongly contrasting saddle of old gold. (After Davidson & Aitken) - Mr T. A. Sealy (Proc. Ent Soc. 1875 p.9) states- [...] "The pupa possesses the power of making a curious noise like pha-pha!, and makes it very loudly when touched; the noise is accompanied (perhaps produced) by a short contraction of the abdominal segments. I thought {{at first it was}} merely produced by the rubbing of one ring of the pupa-case against the next, but the sound did not resemble a mere frictional sound, it was more like the sound of a rush of air through small holes. I tried to produce it with a dead chrysalis but failed: the pupa sometimes contracted on being touched without making the noise, and appeared unable to make the noise until some time was given to allow it to recover its vigour." [...] Messrs. Davidson and Aitken have also noticed this power in the pupa, but <b>they</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> it [...] "as a husky squeaking noise, produced apparently by friction of the abdominal rings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of Chamberlain's anti-Catholicism, Catholic {{newspapers}} all published very hostile {{reviews of}} The Foundations, though Catholic reviewers rarely faulted Die Grundlagen [...] for its anti-Semitism. Protestant völkisch newspapers [...] gave The Foundations very good reviews while more orthodox Protestant newspapers were disturbed by Chamberlain's {{call for a}} racialized Christianity. One Protestant reviewer, Professor Baentsch of Jena wrote that Chamberlain had systematically distorted the Book of Job, the Psalms, the Prophets, and other books of the Old Testament, leading him to conclude {{that it was no}} surprise that Chamberlain found so little common ground between Christianity and Judaism given the way he had misrepresented the entire Old Testament. One German Jewish reviewer, the Berlin banker Heinrich Meyer-Cohn wrote that The Foundations was [...] "bad, unclear, and illogical in its train of thought and unpleasing in style, full of false modesty and genuine superciliousness, full of real ignorance and false affectation of learning." [...] German Jewish groups like the Centralverein deutscher Staatsburge jüdischen Glaubens and the Verein zur Abwehr Antisemitismus repeatedly issued statements in the early 20th century that the popularity of The Foundations was a major source of concern for them, noting that Die Grundlagen [...] had caused a major increase in anti-Semitism with many German Jews now finding themselves the objects of harassment and sometimes violence. The German Jewish journalist Moritz Goldstein wrote in 1912 that he had become a Zionist because he believed there was no future for Jews in Germany, {{and one of the reasons}} for that belief was: [...] "Chamberlain believes what he says and for that very reason his distortions shock me. And thousands more believe as he does for the book goes one edition after another and I would still like to know if many Germanic types, whose self-image is pleasantly indulged by this theory, are able to remain critical enough to question its countless injustices and errors?". Goldstein added that the case of Chamberlain showed his views as typical of those of [...] "the best spirits, clever, truth-loving men who, however, as soon <b>they</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> Jews, fall into a blind, almost rabid hatred".|$|E
