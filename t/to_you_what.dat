The French Collective against Islamophobia reported [...] "an explosion" [...] {{in the number}} of physical attacks on women wearing the niqab. Kenza Drider, a protester against the law, said: [...] "I'm insulted about three to four times a day. Most say, 'Go home'; some say, 'We'll kill you.' One said: 'We'll do <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> we did to the Jews.'... I feel that I now know what Jewish women went through before the Nazi roundups in France. When they went out in the street they were identified, singled out, they were vilified. Now that's happening to us." [...] After the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015, there were reports of attacks on mosques and Muslim citizens throughout the country.|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} in 1 Kings 21 describes {{a case of}} false testimony. King Ahab of Israel tried to convince Naboth the Jezreelite to sell him the vineyard Naboth owned adjacent to the king’s palace. Ahab wanted the land {{to use as a}} vegetable garden, but Naboth refused to sell or trade the property to Ahab saying, “The [...] forbid that I should give up <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I have inherited from my fathers!” Ahab’s wife Jezebel then conspired to obtain the vineyard by writing letters in Ahab’s name to the elders and nobles in Naboth’s town instructing them to have two scoundrels bear false witness claiming that Naboth has cursed both God and the king. After Naboth was subsequently stoned to death, Ahab seized possession of Naboth’s vineyard. The text describes the [...] as very angry with Ahab, and the prophet Elijah pronounces judgment on both Ahab and Jezebel.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to another}} tradition, the devil {{appeared}} to Cain and instructed {{him how to}} exact revenge on Abel. [...] "Hit Abel's head with a stone and kill him", whispered the devil to Cain. After the murder, the devil hurried to Eve shouting: [...] "Eve! Cain has murdered Abel!". Eve {{did not know what}} murder was or how death felt like. She asked, bewildered and horrified, [...] "Woe <b>to</b> <b>you!</b> <b>What</b> is murder?". [...] "He [...] does not eat. He does not drink. He does not move [...] ", answered the Devil. Eve burst out into tears and started to wail madly. She ran to Adam and tried to tell him what happened. However, she could not speak because she could not stop wailing. Since then, women wail brokenheartedly when a loved one dies. A different tradition narrates that while Cain was quarreling with Abel, the devil killed an animal with a stone in Cain's sight to show him how to murder Abel.|$|E

2500|$|Some time later, Bree and Rex visit Andrew at the camp. Andrew asks to see {{his father}} alone; Bree thinks this is because he blames her for sending him to the camp and storms into the meeting room to tell him she did the right thing. There, Rex reveals that Andrew {{wanted to see him}} alone because he fears he is gay. Bree is horrified, and despite Rex's misgivings, insists Andrew come home with them immediately, saying [...] "Our son just told us that he might be gay. There are two hundred other boys in this camp. Now, I could explain <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> might happen if we left him here, but I'm a lady and I don't use that kind of language." [...] Rex reminds her that he is still her son and Bree tries to comfort Andrew by telling him [...] "I would love you even if you were a murderer".|$|E

2500|$|After {{the defeat}} at Manila Bay, Contraalmirante Patricio Montojo y Pasarón was {{recalled}} to Madrid {{to be held}} as a scapegoat for the loss by the court-martial despite the circumstances {{that led to the}} defeat. He left Manila in October and arrived in November 1898. By decree of the court-martial, he was imprisoned in March 1899, but was later released. Among the testimony was Admiral George Dewey, to whom Montojo had sent a letter asking for assistance, and the American officer replied that [...] "Although without accurate knowledge as to the condition of your ships, I have no hesitation in saying <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I have already had the honor to report to my government, that your defense at Cavite was gallant in the extreme. The fighting of your flagship, which was singled out for attack, was especially worthy of a place in the traditions of valor of your nation." [...] Montojo was later absolved of the charges but was still discharged from the Spanish Navy. In June 2017, a screenplay was written based on Montojo's court-martial and Admiral Dewey assisting him in March 1899.|$|E
