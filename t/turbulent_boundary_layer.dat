5|$|These approximations {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{practical}} flow problems of scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any instantaneous laminar or <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer,</b> but is used mainly in laminar flow studies since the mean flow is also the instantaneous flow because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution {{often referred to as the}} Blasius boundary layer.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the laminar {{boundary}} layer equations, the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. {{the inner and outer}} scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions of the flow, it is necessary to asymptotically match the solutions from both regions of the flow. Such analysis will yield either the so-called log-law or power-law.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} air intakes replaced conventional intake rampswhose {{function is}} to divert <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> airflow away from the inlet and prevent it entering the enginewith a diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) design. The DSI uses a combination of forward-swept inlet cowls and a three-dimensional compression surface to divert the boundary layer airflow at high sub-sonic and supersonic speeds. According to Lockheed Martin, the DSI design prevents most of the boundary layer air from entering the engine at speeds up to two times the speed of sound, reduces weight by removing the need for complex mechanical intake mechanisms, and is stealthier than a conventional intake. In 1999, developmental work on the DSI {{with the aim of}} improving aircraft performance commenced. The JF-17 design was finalised in 2001. Multiple models underwent wind tunnel tests; {{it was found that the}} DSI reduced weight, cost, and complexity while improving performance.|$|E

5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with model aircraft, it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E
25|$|Vortilons {{consist of}} one or more flat plates {{attached}} to the underside of the wing near its leading edge, aligned with the flight direction. When the speed is reduced and the aircraft approaches stall, the local flow at the leading edge is diverted outwards; this spanwise component of velocity around the vortilon creates a vortex streamed around the top surface, which energises the boundary layer. A more <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer,</b> in turn, delays the local flow separation.|$|E
25|$|Laminar-flow {{control is}} a {{technology}} that offers the potential for significant improvement in drag coefficient which would provide improvements in aircraft fuel usage, range or endurance that far exceed any known single aeronautical technology. In principle, if 80 percent of wing is laminar, then overall drag could be reduced by 25 percent. The frictional force between {{the air and the}} aircraft surface, known as viscous drag, is much larger in a <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> than in a laminar one. The principal type of active laminar-flow control is removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations (boundary layer suction).|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} which {{solves the}} governing <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> equations within Keller's box method {{was developed for}} calculating unsteady laminar flows with flow reversal. This method is extended to <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> with flow reversal. Test cases are used to investigate the proposition that unsteady <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> also remain free of singularities. Turbulent flow calculations are performed. The governing equations for both models are solved. As in laminar flows, the unsteady <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> are free from singularities, {{but there is a}} clear indication of rapid thickening of the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> with increasing flow reversal.

40|$|One of the {{interesting}} aspects of transitional and <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> {{is the development of}} counter-rotating streamwise vortices near the wall. The most regular pattern is found in a <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> on a concave wall where the generation mechanism is known to be the Goertler instability. The origin of these vortices in other translational and <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> is presently unknown. Since the counter-rotating vortices are located in a region of strong shear, low-speed fluid is pumped away from the wall which coalesces into regions of low momentum lying between the vortices. As this pumping action continues, localized inflectional velocity profiles become apparent in the transitional and <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers.</b> The oscillations which develop upon these profiles scale with the local thickness and velocity difference {{in the same manner as}} the two-dimensional steady free shear layer stability problems. The oscillations grow to large amplitude and break down into new turbulence in both the transitional and <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} observation from Stokes' {{solution for}} the oscillating Stokes flow is that vorticity oscillations are confined to a thin boundary layer and damp exponentially when {{moving away from the}} wall. This observation is also valid for the case of a <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer.</b> Outside the Stokes boundary layer – which is often the bulk of the fluid volume – the vorticity oscillations may be neglected. To good approximation, the flow velocity oscillations are irrotational outside the boundary layer, and potential flow theory {{can be applied to the}} oscillatory part of the motion. This significantly simplifies the solution of these flow problems, and is often applied in the irrotational flow regions of sound waves and water waves.|$|E

25|$|In reverse {{swing the}} seam is angled {{in the same}} way as in {{conventional}} swing (10–20 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam is pointing to. The <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> separating later is similar to the effect produced by dimples in a golf ball. In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back – this enables the golf ball to travel farther.|$|E

25|$|Swing is {{produced}} {{due to a}} net force acting on the ball from one side; that is, the side with the more <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer.</b> For conventional swing bowling, the raised seam and the direction it points governs the direction of swing. Due to the angled seam of the ball, air flowing over the seam produces turbulence on the side that the seam is angled toward. This causes the boundary layer to separate {{from the surface of}} the ball later (farther toward the rear of the ball) than the other side where it separates earlier (farther forward on the surface). As explained by Bernoulli's principle, there is a net pressure differential due to the greater pressure on the side with the more intact boundary layer. The resulting net force acts so as to move or swing the ball in the direction of the angled seam. Conventional swing bowling is delivered with the seam angled such that the smooth or polished side of the ball faces forward to move the ball in the direction of the seam i.e. toward the rough side.|$|E

40|$|A {{simplified}} Reynolds stress {{model has}} been developed for the prediction of unsteady <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers.</b> By assuming that the net transport of Reynolds stresses is locally proportional to the net transport of the turbulent kinetic energy, the time dependent full Reynolds stress model is reduced {{to a set of}} ordinary differential equations. These equations contain only time derivatives and can be readily integrated in a time dependent <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> or Navier-Stokes code. The turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate needed for the model are obtained by solving the k-epsilon equations. This simplified Reynolds stress turbulence model (SRSM) does not use the eddy viscosity assumption, which may not be valid for unsteady turbulent flows. The anisotropy of both the steady and the unsteady turbulent normal stresses can be captured by the SRSM model. Through proper damping of the shear stresses, the present model can be used in the near wall region of <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers.</b> This {{model has been}} validated against data for steady and unsteady <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers,</b> including periodic <b>turbulent</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> subjected to a mean adverse pressure gradient.
