The Zawia refinery is supplied with associated units for utility needs like power, steam production via boilers, desalination units, air compressors and a <b>tankfarm</b> for storing crude oil, intermediate and finished products. Two atmospheric distillation plants can process almost all Libyan crude oil and produce naphtha, kerosene light and heavy gas oil and fuel oil. The Crude Distillation unit has a desalter, which removes/decrease salt content to acceptable levels both topping units have stabilizers to remove lighter gases which is diverted to the fuel gas system.|$|E
5000|$|The Yelling (formerly Maryandi) were a {{punk rock}} band from Los Angeles, California, {{formed in the}} spring of 2008 by former Revis members Nathaniel Cox and Robert Davis. Cox and Davis formed the band because they wanted to pursue a new musical {{direction}} than they had with Revis, and Davis has said that they went [...] "back to their roots" [...] with the Yelling's establishment. Their musical style has been described as [...] "a polyembryonal gametophyte mutation of Jack White, David Bowie, Angus Young, Cedric Bixler and Ozzy," [...] and as [...] "a spell-bound vortex of piercing rhythms and serrated amp swells." [...] Many other sources have also stated that their music sounds much like that of the '70s, with one reviewer comparing their sound to [...] "Led Zeppelin crashing a Who recording session being produced by Iron Butterfly." [...] They released a self-titled EP on October 7, 2008, which contained five songs. The last song on the EP, [...] "Blood on the Steps", was featured on Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack, and on a compilation album issued by <b>Tankfarm</b> Records entitled [...] "Future Sounds 32", released a day after their eponymous EP. Billboard wrote that with regard to this song, its [...] "...the thick, fuzzy chords; warbly bass slides; and get-this-party-started intent" [...] "put the bombastic stoner jam in White Stripes territory." [...] Muzikreviews wrote that on their EP, the Yelling [...] "...take their messy, machine-gun sound and blow it up inside listenersâ€™ ears, content to mash an old-school rockabilly format with a fresher razoresque distortion," [...] and compared the EP's sound to that of the early Smashing Pumpkins. The reviewer, Kevin Leidel, awarded the EP a rating of four and a half (out of five) stars. It was widely reported that they were planning on releasing a full length album, entitled [...] "Long Time My Love" [...] (also the second track on their eponymous EP), either in April or in the fall of 2009, but while a single, [...] "21st Century Freak," [...] was released, the album never was as the band broke up shortly before its scheduled release date.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} identifies and evaluates {{alternatives that}} will provide DOE-RL sufficient information from which a decision can be negotiated regarding the Project Hanford Management Contractor team`s use of tanks 241 -AP- 106 and - 108 versus the private contractors need to upgrade them for their purposes. The desired alternatives to be evaluated and the measures for comparison were selected in a separate meeting with the customer (RL). These are defined in the sections that follow. The following summarizes {{the results of this}} study. More detailed explanations of the results can be found later in Section 6. 0 of the document. Relinquishing the use of tanks early increases the programmatic risk when compared to the baseline via the following areas: (1) Tank Space [...] The amount of usable tank space decreases. This also impacts the amount of spare and contingency space available. (2) Waste Transfer Complexity [...] The complexity of <b>tankfarm</b> transfers increases. As double-shell tank (DST) space becomes limited, the number and interdependency of waste transfers increases. (3) Float [...] Float time for low-activity waste (LAW) feed staging operations decreases. (4) Waste Segregation [...] The segregation of tank wastes may be violated...|$|E

Department of Energy (DOE) Plan to Address Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) Vessel Mixing Issues; Implementation Plan (IP) for Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Recommendation 2010 - 2. The attached report identifies key inputs, assumptions, safety margin uncertainties, and nuclear safety parameters {{required to be}} included in the Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) for waste delivered from the Hanford tank farms to the WTP. The information in this report also provides input to the IP deliverables for Commitments 5. 5. 3. 1, Initial gap analysis between WTP WAC and <b>tankfarm</b> sampling and transfer capability, and 5. 7. 3. 1, Establish the plan and schedule to systematically evaluate the hazards ofknow technical issue, M 3 vessel assessment summary report, LOAMbenchmark data, and LSITresults. Deliverables for Commitments 5. 5. 3. 1 and 5. 7. 3. 1 will be provided to the DNFSB later this year per the IP. The WAC for the WTP will continue to evolve based on assessments focused on WTP vessel mixing, transfer, and sampling system performance and be informed by Tank Farm feed staging, sampling, and transfer capabilities. The resulting information will be evaluated consistent with section 5. 7. 2, Resolution Approach, ofthe IP. We will keep the DNFSB informed ofprogress and identified issues as work progresses via Quarterly reports and subsequent IP deliverables. Hon. Peter S. Winoku...|$|E
40|$|The {{model used}} in this report focuses on the {{analysis}} of ship waiting statistics and stock fluctuations under different arrival processes. However, the basic outline is the same: central to both models are a jetty and accompanying <b>tankfarm</b> facilities belonging to a new chemical plant in the Port of Rotterdam. Both the supply of raw materials and the export of finished products occur through ships loading and unloading at the jetty. Since disruptions in the plants production process are very expensive, buffer stock is needed to allow for variations in ship arrivals and overseas exports through large ships. Ports provide jetty facilities for ships to load and unload their cargo. Since ship delays are costly, terminal operators attempt to minimize their number and duration. Here, simulation {{has proved to be}} a very suitable tool. However, in port simulation models, the impact of the arrival process of ships on the model outcomes tends to be underestimated. This article considers three arrival processes: stock-controlled, equidistant per ship type, and Poisson. We assess how their deployment in a port simulation model, based on data from a real case study, affects the efficiency of the loading and unloading process. Poisson, which is the chosen arrival process in many client-oriented simulations, actually performs worst in terms of both ship delays and required storage capacity. Stock-controlled arrivals perform best with regard to ship delays and required storage capacity. In the case study two types of arrival processes were considered. The first type are the so-called stock-controlled arrivals, i. e., ship arrivals are scheduled in such a way, that a base stock level is maintained in the tanks. Given a base stock level of a raw material or [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{accelerated}} transport of {sup 99 }Tc, {sup 137 }Cs, and {sup 235 }U within the vadose zone beneath the 200 -West Area of the Hanford tank-farm {{area has been}} recognized, the mechanisms responsible for the vertical migration of the radionuclides is unclear. Does horizontal stratification enhance the lateral movement of contaminants, which in turn enhances vertical preferential flow due to perched water dynamics? Do physical heterogeneities, such as stratification and pore regime connectivity, influence the retardation and degree of geochemical nonequilibrium during contaminant transport? Recent modeling efforts of the problem have failed to yield answers to this question since they are inadequately parameterized {{due to the lack}} of sufficient quality data. Fundamental experimental research is needed that will improve the conceptual understanding and predictive capability of radionuclide migration in the Hanford <b>tankfarm</b> environment. Since geochemical reactions are directly linked to the system hydrodynamics, coupled geochemical and hydrological processes must be investigated in order to resolve the key mechanisms contributing to vadose zone and groundwater contamination at Hanford. Our research group has performed extensive investigations on time-dependent contaminant interactions with subsurface media using dynamic flow techniques which more closely simulate conditions in-situ. Of particular relevance to this proposal is the work of Barnett et al. (2000) who showed that U(VI) transport through Hanford sediments was highly retarded and extremely sensitive to changes in pH and total carbonate. What remains elusive are the geochemical mechanisms for uranium retention-necessary information for accurately simulating transport-and are thus the focus of this study. The experimental and numerical results from this research will provide knowledge and information in previously unexplored areas of vadose zone fate and transport to support EM's performance/risk assessment and decision-making process for Tank Farm restoration. By unraveling fundamental contaminant transport mechanisms in complex porous media, we provide an improved conceptual understanding and predictive capability of a variety of vadose issues within the DOE system...|$|E
