Next, we computed new data columns from the source (original) data. For example, we computed the issue fix time from the issue closing date and issue discovery date or we performed some attributes’ value transformations to obtain machine readable data for model generation. Some attributes contain detailed information that reduces {{the performance of the}} regression algorithms. We addressed this issue by developing a good level of data aggregation for the prediction algorithm. For example, the original dataset included 511 vulnerability types. We grouped the vulnerabilities types in vulnerability categories, which helps to derive better prediction models. Also, we aggregated the “component” variable to obtain “Gr_component” to include in our regression.|$|R

Its main aim {{is to reduce the}} number of keystrokes that are needed to <b>type</b> a <b>text.</b> In this paper, we address the influence of <b>text</b> <b>type</b> and domain differences on text prediction quality. By training and testing our text prediction algorithm on four different <b>text</b> <b>types</b> (Wikipedia, Twitter, transcriptions of conversational speech and FAQ) with equal corpus sizes, we found that there is a clear effect of <b>text</b> <b>type</b> on <b>text</b> prediction quality: training and testing on the same <b>text</b> <b>type</b> gave percentages of saved keystrokes between 27 and 34 %; training on a different <b>text</b> <b>type</b> caused the scores to drop to percentages between 16 and 28 %. In our case study, we compared a number of training corpora for a specific data set for which training data is sparse: questions about neurological issues. We found that both <b>text</b> <b>type</b> and topic domain play a role in text prediction quality. The best performing training corpus was a set of medical pages from Wikipedia. The second-best result was obtained by leaveone-out experiments on the test questions, even though this training corpus was much smaller (2, 672 words) than the other corpora (1. 5 Million words). ...|$|R

It consists of a configuration of functional elements whose mutual relations are calibrated {{in such a way}} as to allow its use to describe the structure of not only a specific <b>text</b> <b>type</b> but also a range of other related <b>text</b> <b>types.</b> Each member of that range of <b>text</b> <b>types</b> will have some structural properties in common with other members: no individual <b>text</b> <b>type</b> will have the same structural shape as any other, and none will be entirely different. The entire range of such <b>text</b> <b>types</b> will constitute a single register family. The variations across <b>text</b> <b>types</b> are clearly not accidental. They are based on the text-context relations: underlying these similarities and differences in the structural shapes of the members of a register family there will be specifiable similarities and differences in the selection of features from the dimension of field and/or tenor and/or mode of discourse. The actual structural shape of a text is not the achievement of that particular text: despite its uniqueness, it is recognised by its regularities which arise from the speaker’s meaning-wording as a response to the context of situation: the text is realising in a specific type of CC. The study of register is a study of the regularities between the features of CC and their realisation as text.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} the role of cohesion in the organisation and processing of three <b>text</b> <b>types</b> in English and Arabic. In other words, it attempts to {{shed some light on}} the descriptive and explanatory power of cohesion in different text typologies. To this effect, three <b>text</b> <b>types,</b> namely, literary fictional narrative, newspaper editorial and science were analysed to ascertain the intra- and inter-sentential trends in textual cohesion characteristic of each <b>text</b> <b>type</b> in each language. In addition, two small scale experiments which aimed at exploring the facilitatory effect of one cohesive device (i. e. lexical repetition) on the comprehension of three English <b>text</b> <b>types</b> by Arab learners were carried out. The first experiment examined this effect in an English science text; the second covered three English <b>text</b> <b>types,</b> i. e. fictional narrative, culturally-oriented and science. Some interesting and significant results have emerged from the textual analysis and the pilot studies. Most importantly, each <b>text</b> <b>type</b> tends to utilize the cohesive trends that are compatible with its readership, reader knowledge, reading style and pedagogical purpose. Whereas fictional narratives largely cohere through pronominal co-reference, editorials and science texts derive much cohesion from lexical repetition. As for cross-language differences English opts for economy in the use of cohesive devices, while Arabic largely coheres through the redundant effect created by the high frequency of most of those devices. Thus, cohesion is proved to be a variable rather than a homogeneous phenomenon which is dictated by <b>text</b> <b>type</b> among other factors. The results of the experiments suggest that lexical repetition does facilitate the comprehension of English texts by Arab learners. Fictional narratives are found to be easier to process and understand than expository texts. Consequently, cohesion can assist in the processing of text as it can in its creation...|$|R

40|$|How can we {{tell from}} a memory report whether a memory is episodic or not? Vividness is {{required}} by many definitions, whereas detailedness, memory specificity, and narrative <b>text</b> <b>type</b> are competing definitions of episodicity used in research. We explored their correlations with vividness in personally significant autobiographical memories to provide evidence to support their relative claim to define episodic memories. In addition, we explored differences between different memory <b>types</b> and <b>text</b> <b>types</b> {{as well as between}} memories with different valences. We asked a lifespan sample (N = 168) of 8 -, 12 -, 16 -, 20 -, 40 -, and 65 -year-olds of both genders (N = 27, 29, 27, 27, 28, 30) to provide brief oral life narratives. These were segmented into thematic memory units. Detailedness of person, place, and time did not correlate with each other or either vividness, memory specificity, or narrative <b>text</b> <b>type.</b> Narrative <b>text</b> <b>type,</b> in contrast, correlated both with vividness and memory specificity, suggesting narrative <b>text</b> <b>type</b> as a good criterion of episodicity. Emotionality {{turned out to be an}} even better predictor of vividness. Also, differences between narrative, chronicle, and argument <b>text</b> <b>types</b> and between specific versus more extended and atemporal memory were explored as well as differences between positive, negative, ambivalent, neutral, contamination, and redemption memory reports. It is concluded that temporal sequentiality is a central characteristic of episodic autobiographical memories. Furthermore, it is suggested that the textual quality of memory reports should be taken more seriously, and that evaluation and interpretation are inherent aspects of personally significant memories...|$|R
