A single example was fitted to a Beaufighter and tested through October, and numerous modifications and follow-on examples were trialled over the next year.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{following}} their repeated failures before Constantinople, {{and the continued}} resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began <b>to</b> <b>project</b> <b>the</b> fall of Constantinople to the distant future. Thus the city's fall came {{to be regarded as}} one of the signs of the arrival of the end times in Islamic eschatology. The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls of Constantinople being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and the Apocalypse of Daniel, written either at about the time of the siege or a century later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the street}} outside the theatre a street {{carnival}} took place. Living up to the moniker for the theater's marquee, “the Magic Sign of a Wonderful Time,” spotlights scanned the night sky, banks of Klieg lights illuminated the streets outside the theater, and flares were shot from the roofs of nearby buildings. Additionally, dance bands were placed at the closed intersections to provide entertainment and, using giant screens <b>to</b> <b>project</b> <b>the</b> words, a sing-along was orchestrated on Fifth Avenue {{in front of the}} theatre. An estimated crowd of between 50,000 and 100,000 people participated in the events.|$|E

5|$|His {{observations}} on the part played by organisms {{in the formation of}} the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies. To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb <b>to</b> <b>project</b> <b>the</b> slope of the land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5,000ft (1,500m), as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610ft (1,405m) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements, but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000ft (1,000m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level.|$|E

We discuss how we used project metrics data collected by the development team to identify threats <b>to</b> <b>project</b> outcomes. Identifying and addressing threats <b>to</b> <b>projects</b> early in <b>the</b> development process should significantly reduce <b>the</b> chances of <b>project</b> failure. We have analysed <b>project</b> data <b>to</b> pinpoint <b>the</b> sources of threats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> <b>The</b> data we have used is embedded in <b>the</b> <b>project’s</b> fortnightly progress reports produced by <b>the</b> <b>project</b> team. <b>The</b> progress reports {{are part of the}} software measurement program this company operates. The company has highly mature development processes which were assessed at CMM level 5 in 2004. Our analysis shows that standard project progress data can generate rich insights into the project; insights that go beyond those anticipated when the metrics were originally specified. Our results reveal a pattern of threats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> that <b>the</b> <b>project</b> team can focus on mitigating. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> team is already aware of some threats, for example that communication with the customer is a significant threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> But there are other threats the team is not aware of, for example that people issues within the software team are not a significant threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> ...|$|R

Byzantine use of incendiary mixtures was also used in pressurized nozzles or siphōns <b>to</b> <b>project</b> <b>the</b> liquid onto the enemy.|$|E
25|$|The {{ellipsoidal}} reflector spotlight (ERS), {{also known as}} profile (after its ability <b>to</b> <b>project</b> <b>the</b> silhouette or profile of anything put in the gate) (UK) and Découpe (French), is the most abundant instrument type currently in theatrical use. The flexibility of the ERS allows it to fulfill the bulk of lighting roles in the theater. They are sometimes known as a profile spotlight (in Europe) or by their brand names, especially the Source Four (a popular lantern from ETC) and 2 the Leko (short for Lekolite, from Strand lighting).|$|E

25|$|Cartographers use a {{projection}} <b>to</b> <b>project</b> <b>the</b> curved {{surface of the}} earth onto a flat surface. This generates a grid that is used as a base for national topographic mapping. The projection introduces a distortion so that grid north differs from true north; magnetic north is a natural feature that differs from both. As an example: at 52° 35' N 1° 10' E (approx 7km west of Norwich, England) true north is 2° 33' west of grid north, and magnetic north is about 7° west of grid north. Magnetic north varies continually and in this example (1986) was reducing by about ½° in four years. Orienteering maps are printed using magnetic north and this requires an adjustment to be made to the base map.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of modern Iran it used the history of {{conflict}} between Iran and Russia as a circumstance to find Bahá'ís blameworthy. During the 19th century Russia had been expanding south and east into Central Asia toward India where Britain held power at the time. A rivalry started between Britain and Russia over territorial and political control in Central Asia followed. The middle zone of land was where both Russia and Britain worked to gain influence. Struggles in the region lead to Persian antagonism to both foreign powers. Muslim clerics and other anti-Bahá'í groups connected the Bahá'í Faith, and its predecessor the Bábí movement, to the external governments of Britain and Russia <b>to</b> <b>project</b> <b>the</b> mistrust of these two latter groups onto the Bahá'ís.|$|E
25|$|Actuarial science, of {{the kind}} used <b>to</b> <b>project</b> <b>the</b> future {{solvency}} of social security, is by nature subject to uncertainty. The SSA actually makes three predictions: optimistic, midline, and pessimistic (until the late 1980s it made 4 projections). The Social Security crisis that was developing prior to the 1983 reforms resulted from midline projections {{that turned out to}} be too optimistic. It has been argued that the overly pessimistic projections of the mid to late 1990s were partly the result of the low economic growth (according to actuary David Langer) assumptions that resulted in pushing back the projected exhaustion date (from 2028 to 2042) with each successive Trustee's report. During the heavy-boom years of the 1990s, the midline projections were too pessimistic. Obviously, projecting out 75 years is a significant challenge and, as such, the actual situation might be much better or much worse than predicted.|$|E
