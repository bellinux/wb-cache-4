40|$|During the 2005 North Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, {{an objective}} tropical cyclone vortex identification and tracking technique was applied <b>to</b> analyzed and <b>forecast</b> fields of three global operational numerical models- the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System (GFS), the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS), and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office model (UKMET). For {{the purpose of}} evaluating each model's performance with respect <b>to</b> <b>forecasting</b> tropical cyclone formation, 14 relevant parameters are cataloged for every tropical vortex. In this study, nine of the fourteen parameters are subjected to a linear discriminant analysis applied <b>to</b> all <b>forecast</b> vortices that exceed vorticity and warm core thresholds.

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak winds, Tropical Storm Chantal became disorganized {{while the}} center became ill-defined and situated to the west-southwest {{of the main}} area of convection; {{this was due to}} unfavorable upper-level winds, although computer models continued <b>to</b> <b>forecast</b> a more favorable upper-level environment. By early on August20, Hurricane Hunters reported several low-level circulations embedded within a large low pressure area. Later that day, wind shear decreased when the storm moved into the Gulf of Honduras. Chantal became much better organized, again reaching peak winds of 70miles per hour (110km/h) before making landfall early on August21 near the border of Mexico and Belize. Initially, the storm was forecast to cross the Yucatán Peninsula and Bay of Campeche and make a second landfall in the state of Veracruz. Chantal slowly weakened over land while moving slowly across northern Belize. Convection decreased markedly late on August21, and early the next day Chantal weakened to tropical depression status. The upper- and middle-level circulations turned to the northeast while the low-level circulation turned to the west-southwest further inland. Weakening continued, and late on August22 Chantal dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used <b>to</b> <b>forecast</b> weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gracie {{was a major}} {{hurricane}} {{that formed}} in September 1959, the strongest during the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season and the most intense to strike the United States since Hurricane Hazel in 1954.

Gracie was a storm that was very difficult <b>to</b> <b>forecast,</b> with its movement unpredictable. After five days of erratic motion, Gracie became a major hurricane which struck South Carolina, and weakened as it moved up the Appalachians, bringing much needed rain to a drought-plagued region. Much of the destruction related with Gracie was centered on Beaufort, South Carolina. Gracie became an extratropical cyclone on September 30 while moving through the Eastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult <b>to</b> <b>forecast.</b> Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E

5|$|Since Johnston's death, {{his field}} of {{volcanic}} eruption prediction has advanced significantly, and volcanologists are {{now able to}} predict eruptions based on a number of precursors that become apparent between days and months in advance. Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic waves that indicate particular magmatic activity. In particular, volcanologists have used deep, long-period earthquakes that indicate that magma is rising through the crust. They can also use carbon dioxide emission as a proxy for magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other USGS scientists at the ColdwaterI and II outposts, have advanced in scale and precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist of InSAR (interferometry), surveys of networks of GPS monuments, microgravity surveys in which scientists measure the change in gravitational potential or acceleration because of the intruding magma and resulting deformation, strain meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination of approaches has greatly improved scientists' abilities <b>to</b> <b>forecast</b> volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The methods {{through which}} {{tropical}} cyclones are forecast have {{changed with the}} passage of time. The first known forecasts in the Western Hemisphere were made by Lt. Col. William Reed of the Corps of Royal Engineers at Barbados in 1847. Reed mostly utilized barometric pressure measurements as the basis of his forecasts. Benito Vines introduced a forecast and warning system based on cloud cover changes in Havana during the 1870s. Before the early 1900s, though, most forecasts were done by direct observations at weather stations, which were then relayed <b>to</b> <b>forecast</b> centers via telegraph. It wasn’t until the advent of radio {{in the early twentieth century}} that observations from ships at sea were available to forecasters. The 1930s saw the usage of radiosondes in tropical cyclone forecasting. The next decade saw the advent of aircraft-based reconnaissance by the military, starting with the first dedicated flight into a hurricane in 1943, and the establishment of the Hurricane Hunters in 1944. In the 1950s, coastal weather radars began to be used in the United States, and research reconnaissance flights by the precursor of the Hurricane Research Division began in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Later on June18, {{forecast}} models {{indicated that}} the system might rapidly degenerate prior to landfall. However, the NHC continued <b>to</b> <b>forecast</b> that the depression would attain tropical storm-status before landfall. Shortly after, the depression became increasingly disorganized as convection separated {{from the center of}} circulation due to increasing wind shear. Stable air ahead of the system inhibited the possibility of rapid development as warm waters supported intensification. By the morning of June19, the center of circulation was situated along the southern edge of deep convection, indicating that the depression was beginning to degenerate. Despite this, the NHC continued to anticipate intensification prior to landfall. Embedded within an easterly flow ahead of a mid-level trough, the storm turned towards the north-northeast and accelerated slightly. At 11:00am PDT (1800UTC), the depression reached its peak intensity with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1003mbar (hPa; 29.62inHg). Operationally, the depression was considered to be slightly stronger, having a minimum pressure of 1001mbar (hPa; 29.56inHg). Later that day, the depression began to degenerate into an open trough as it was situated underneath cirrus clouds instead of cumulonimbus clouds. Visible satellite imagery showed that the depression became increasingly ill-defined and the NHC estimated that the depression degenerated into a trough of low pressure near the Islas Marías during the afternoon of June19. The remnants of the depression were monitored by the United States Naval Research Laboratory for several more hours until the system moved inland over Sinaloa.|$|E
