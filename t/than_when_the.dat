5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference {{in the time it takes}} light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.|$|E

5|$|After the executions, Hancock was {{assigned}} {{command of the}} newly organized Middle Military Department, headquartered in Baltimore. In 1866, on Grant's recommendation, Hancock was promoted to major general and was transferred, later that year, to command of the military Department of the Missouri, which included the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico. Hancock reported to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and took up his new posting. Soon after arriving, he {{was assigned}} by General Sherman to lead an expedition {{to negotiate with the}} Cheyenne and Sioux, with whom relations had worsened since the Sand Creek massacre. The negotiations got off to a bad start, and after Hancock ordered the burning of an abandoned Cheyenne village in central Kansas, relations became worse <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> expedition had started. There was little loss of life on either side, but the mission could not be called a success.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake, since drained and fertilised silage fields are less {{suitable}} for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms, and the loss of many birds – up to 14,000 a year – in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E

5|$|When Davis {{and other}} youngsters signed new deals in 2011, McCarthy had said they stood less chance of first-team {{football}} in the Premier League <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> team were {{playing in the}} Championship. A year later and back in the Championship, Davis was in the team {{at the beginning of}} the season, but lost form and returned to the reserves. By November, he was again challenging for a first-team place, and manager Ståle Solbakken turned down the chance to re-sign Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong, still regaining fitness after serious injury, preferring to let the home-grown product prove himself. Davis featured regularly, but more often from the bench than in the starting eleven.|$|E

25|$|More recently, modern {{portfolio}} {{theory has}} been used to model the self-concept in social psychology.

This prediction has been confirmed in studies involving human subjects.|$|E

25|$|Wormholes connect {{two points}} in spacetime, {{which means that}} they would in {{principle}} allow travel in time, as well as in space. In 1988, Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever worked out explicitly how to convert a wormhole traversing space into one traversing time by accelerating one of its two mouths. However, according to general relativity, it would not be possible to use a wormhole to travel back to a time earlier <b>than</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> wormhole was first converted into a time 'machine'.|$|E
