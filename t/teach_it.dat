Initially suspicious of the young crocodile but ultimately won over by its innocence, King Rufus and the Gobbos decide to raise it as one of their own and <b>teach</b> <b>it</b> in the ways of the Gobbo. The crocodile, named Croc, grows, eventually becoming much larger than the Gobbos.|$|E
5|$|Logan Moore is {{a troubled}} 14-year-old boy {{living with his}} mother Marianne and {{stepfather}} Robert in Newburg, Oregon. Logan does not get along well with Robert or his mother, and holds a grudge against his biological father for leaving when he was young. After an incident at a barbecue, Robert decides to purchase a Labrador Retriever in order to teach Logan responsibility. Eager to rebel against his stepfather, Logan convinces his mother to adopt a dog from an animal shelter. He plans to choose an ugly dog and <b>teach</b> <b>it</b> destructive behavior. At the shelter, Logan encounters a young female mutt who immediately takes a liking to him. Logan adopts the dog and names her Jack after Robert's former dog.|$|E
5|$|No formal {{educational}} {{method was}} applied to the production, and no attempt was made to follow the official UK National Curriculum for primary school history. The show's creators were acutely aware of educational possibilities, but—in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise—saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further curiosity about the academic subject rather than attempting to <b>teach</b> <b>it</b> seriously. The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter Dan Snow. Writing in The Independent, Gerard Gilbert notes that Horrible Histories is part of an extensive British black-comedy tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming. In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was a progression towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and educational content, as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.|$|E

To earn money for tuition, Williams worked as a stock girl at the I. Magnin department store, where she also modeled clothing for customers and appeared in newspaper advertisements.|$|E
25|$|Though Braille {{is thought}} to be the main way blind people read and write, in Britain (for example) out of the {{reported}} 2 million blind and low vision population, it is estimated that only around 15–20 thousand people use braille.

25|$|But a {{continuing}} emphasis to the well-rounded graduate {{can be seen}} in the University's approach to education degrees. As a solely graduate-level program, this is based on the principle that people need to learn primary subject matter well before they can learn how to <b>teach</b> <b>it</b> to others. Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five-year program earning both a bachelor's degree in a specialized field and a master's degree in Education. This latter degree, along with the Business College's M.B.A., are among the most popular graduate programs in the University.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Navalar was born, Protestants from England and America had {{established}} nine mission {{stations in the}} Jaffna peninsula. Tamils in Jaffna faced a concentrated effort to convert them as opposed to Tamil in Southern India. The first known Saiva opposition to these efforts emerged in 1828 when the teachers of the American Ceylon Mission (AMC) at Vaddukoddai wanted to learn and teach the Shaiva scripture Skanda Purana in their school. This move angered local Shaivas as they interpreted it as a move by the missionaries to understand and then ridicule a religious material. Although the missionaries were able to translate and study the material, {{they were unable to}} <b>teach</b> <b>it,</b> as locals boycotted the classes.|$|E

500|$|Dawkins sees {{education}} and consciousness-raising {{as the primary}} tools in opposing what he considers to be religious dogma and indoctrination. These tools include the fight against certain stereotypes, and he has adopted the term bright {{as a way of}} associating positive public connotations with those who possess a naturalistic worldview. He has given support {{to the idea of a}} free thinking school, which would not [...] "indoctrinate children" [...] but would instead teach children to ask for evidence, be skeptical, critical and open-minded. Such a school, says Dawkins, should [...] "teach comparative religion, and <b>teach</b> <b>it</b> properly without any bias towards particular religions, and including historically important but dead religions, such as those of ancient Greece and the Norse gods, if only because these, like the Abrahamic scriptures, are important for understanding English literature and European history. Inspired by the consciousness-raising successes of feminists in arousing widespread embarrassment at the routine use of [...] "he" [...] instead of [...] "she", Dawkins similarly suggests that phrases such as [...] "Catholic child" [...] and [...] "Muslim child" [...] should be considered as socially absurd as, for instance, [...] "Marxist child", as he believes that children should not be classified based on their parents' ideological or religious beliefs.|$|E
