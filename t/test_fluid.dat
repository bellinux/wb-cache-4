50|$|Another {{application}} of similitude is {{to replace the}} operating fluid with a different <b>test</b> <b>fluid.</b> Wind tunnels, for example, have trouble with air liquefying in certain conditions so helium is sometimes used.

5000|$|Classical Brookfield viscometers {{employ the}} {{principle}} of rotational viscometry - the torque required to turn an object, such as a spindle, in a fluid indicates the viscosity of the fluid. Torque is applied through a calibrated spring to a disk or bob spindle immersed in <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> and the spring deflection measures the viscous drag of the fluid against the spindle. [...] The amount of viscous drag {{is proportional to the}} amount of torque required to rotate the spindle, and thus to the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid. [...] In the case of non-Newtonian fluids, Brookfield viscosities measured under the same conditions (model, spindle, speed, temperature, time of test, container, and any other sample preparation procedures that may affect the behavior of the fluid) can be compared. When developing a new test method, trial and error is often necessary {{in order to determine the}} proper spindle and speeds. Successful test methods will deliver a % torque reading between 10 and 100. The rheological behavior of the <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> can be observed using the same spindle at different speeds, but because the geometry of the fluid around a rotating bob or disk spindle in a large container does not allow a single shear rate to be assigned, proper rheometry is not feasible using this setup.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of extensional rheometers has proceeded {{more slowly than}} shear rheometers, due to the challenges associated with generating a homogeneous extensional flow.

Secondly, the strain history of all the material elements must be controlled and known. Thirdly, the strain rates and strain levels must be high enough to stretch the polymeric chains beyond their normal radius of gyration, requiring instrumentation with a large range of deformation rates and a large travel distance.|$|E

40|$|In {{material}} bonding, {{the surface}} {{energy of the}} adherend can be an excellent predictor of adhesive bond strength. In this research, {{the use of the}} sessile drop test as a pre-bond inspection tool for bonded composite repairs was investigated. A portable goniometer suitable for a maintenance workshop in the aviation industry was designed and built. Dimethyl sulfoxide and water were used as <b>testing</b> <b>fluids,</b> dispensed in 3 μl quantities. Contact angles were measured using the spherical approximation for a range of surfaces which included samples that had been peel-plied, hand sanded, grit blasted and contaminated with silicone release agent. The surface energies of the samples were then evaluated using the Owens-Wendt and Girifalco-Good-Fowkes-Young (GGFY) methods. Although the GGFY method successfully distinguished contamination, difficulties arose when evaluating surface roughness. Peel-ply surfaces also had varying contact angles due to irregular droplet shapes. The Owens-Wendt method was also found to be inaccurate with only two <b>test</b> <b>fluids</b> although this is regarded as industry standard, It is for these reasons that traditional surface energy methods were considered impractical for a workshop environment. An alternate measurement parameter considered was the droplet diameter where the same <b>testing</b> <b>fluids</b> were imaged from the top instead. This measurement successfully differentiated contamination and also allowed the abrasion process to be determined. In addition, the degree of abrasion could be determined between grit blasted and untreated peel-ply surfaces. This test was found to be more accurate than the traditional surface energy techniques and has the potential to form part of a pre-bond surface certification process for bonded composite repairs...|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve zero boil-off (ZBO) with cryogenic propellant storage using an active thermal control system. Tests conducted at the NASA Lewis Research Center's Supplemental Multilayer Insulation Research Facility (SMIRF) over the summer of 1998 demonstrated that a hybrid thermal control system could eliminate boiloff of cryogenic propellants. The hardware consisted of a pressurized 50-ft³ (ca. 1416 litres) tank insulated with 34 layers of multi-layer insulation (MLI), a condenser, and a Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocooler that has a cooling capacity of 15 to 17.5 watt (W). Liquid hydrogen was the <b>test</b> <b>fluid.</b> The test tank was installed into a vacuum chamber, simulating space vacuum.In 2001, a cooperative effort by NASA's Ames Research Center, Glenn Research Center, and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was implemented to develop zero-boiloff concepts for in-space cryogenic storage. Main program element was a large-scale, zero-boiloff demonstration using the MSFC multipurpose hydrogen test bed (MHTB) - 18.10 m3 LH2 tank (about 1300 kg of H2).

40|$|In liquid {{composite}} moulding (LCM) techniques, {{the liquid}} resin has to flow {{a long distance}} to impregnate the dry fibres.

40|$|We trained rats in {{a context}} {{discrimination}} paradigm by pairing a sucrose solution with lithium chloride in one context (conditioning context) and simple exposure to the same fluid in a second (neutral) context to establish a context-dependent aversion to the conditioned fluid. We then investigated whether transfer of the context dependency to a <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> (a sodium chloride solution) was affected by two post-discrimination training treatments, an extended context discrimination training, and non-reinforced exposure to the conditioning context (context extinction). We found that the context-dependent flavor aversion that had been specific to sucrose transferred to the <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> after the extensive training (Experiment 1). Context extinction eliminated the transfer effect that had been observed immediately after the context discrimination training (Experiment 2). In addition, an aversion acquired by sucrose through a simple conditioning of sucrose-LiCl pairings did not generalize to the <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> (Experiment 3).

40|$|A {{critical}} {{component in the}} assessment of long-term risk from geologic sequestration of CO 2 is the ability to predict mineralogical and geochemical changes within storage reservoirs due to rock-brine-CO 2 reactions. Impurities and/or other constituents selected for co-sequestration can affect both the chemical and physical (e. g. density, viscosity, interfacial tension) behavior of CO 2 in the deep subsurface. These impurities and concentrations are a function of both the industrial source(s) of the CO 2, as well as the carbon capture technology used to extract the CO 2 and produce a concentrated stream for geologic sequestration. This report summarizes the relative concentrations of CO 2 and other constituents in exhaust gases from major non-energy related industrial sources of CO 2. Assuming that carbon-capture technology would remove most of the incondensable gases N 2, O 2, and Ar, leaving SO 2 and NOx as the main impurities, we selected four <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> compositions for use in geochemical experiments.

40|$|SUMMARY: Streptomycin may be {{estimated}} in body fluids {{by allowing the}} fluid to diffuse through nutrient agar seeded with a culture of Staphylococcus wureus contained in small-diameter (3 111111. internal) glass tubes. The zone of inhibition produced is affected neither by the anaerobic conditions within the agar nor by {{the volume of the}} <b>test</b> <b>fluid.</b> Acidity of the <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> invalidates the results, since the depth of the zone of inhibition is decreased. Increase {{in the size of the}} inoculum of the test organism also decreases the depth of the zone of inhibition. Small errors arisc from variations in timing during the setting-up of the test. The zones produced in the presence of different human sera differ slightly and to a degree similar to that found in the presence of various urines. The available mathematical expressions suggest that the square of the depth of the zone of inhibition is linearly related to the log of the concentration of an anti-biotic in the <b>test</b> <b>fluid.</b> Experimentally this relationship does not hold for low concentrations of streptomycin, probably due to the assumption of boundary con-ditions which cannot be defined with certainty; but i t is a better approximation tha...|$|E
