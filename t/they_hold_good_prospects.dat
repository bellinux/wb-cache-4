Compared with other imaging techniques, Magnetic Resonance Imaging is relatively new. Consequently, the technical possibilities are far from exhausted and clinical experience is far from complete. Nevertheless, in many respects MRI is equivalent or even superior to conventional roentgenography or CT scanning. Also, so far, no adverse effects of MRI have been demonstrated. In osteosarcoma {{as well as in}} metastasized non-seminomatous testicular tumor, changes in the tumor in the course of chemotherapy could be observed with MRI. Further research, both clinical and technical, will be needed to find correlations between these changes and the morbid-anatomical lesions.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} join a plane {{composite}} cable to the main structure of a composite footbridge designed within (Caron, 2009), {{it was decided to}} investigate structural adhesive bonding. This technique is indeed particularly adapted to composite materials. However structural adhesive bonding induces stress concentrations {{at the edges of the}} adhesive joint, which have been studied by a large number of researchers in order to reduce these phenomena and increase the capacity and service life of the bonded joint (Kinloch, 1987). These studies are all concerned with optimizing shear stress transfer in adhesively bonded joints. This paper investigates the role of hydrostatic pressure on the ultimate capacities of common civil engineering adhesives. The conclusions led us to study a new joint geometry, the " curved " bonded joint that naturally creates compressive stresses on the edge of the bonded joint. Several experimental investigations are presented within this paper to illustrate the optimization. These are quasi-static tests that compare classical shear lap joints to curved joints. Additional testing is currently in progress, but the curved bonded joint seems to <b>hold</b> <b>good</b> <b>prospects</b> and a patent has been filed...|$|R
40|$|Porous N-doped carbons <b>hold</b> <b>good</b> <b>prospects</b> for {{application}} in supercapacitor {{due to their}} low-cost, large surface area, good surface wettability, high electrical conductivity as well as extra pseudocapacitance. However, most synthetic methods required the tedious and multiple-step process {{with the assistance of}} hard/soft templates or the massive use of chemical reagents, and exogenous nitrogen sources, which made them difficult to realize industrial production and application. Here, we described a novel hierarchical porous N-doped carbons fabricated by a facile and sustainable approach via hydrothermal treatment and subsequent carbonization process by using renewable bamboo shoots as the starting material without any templates, additional chemical activation and nitrogen source. The obtained bamboo shoot-derived carbons possessed a large BET surface area (up to 972 m(2) g(- 1)), hierarchically interconnected porous framework, rich and uniform nitrogen incorporation (3. 0 at%). Benefiting from these unique features, the novel carbon-based electrode materials displayed a high capacitance of 412 F g(- 1) in KOH electrolyte and long cycling life stability. Thus, an advanced electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor was successfully assembled by a simple and scalable synthesis route with abundant renewable resources freely available in nature...|$|R

40|$|Background: Plantar ulcers {{commonly}} {{occur in}} leprosy patients, which usually recur and cause morbidity in such cases. Aims: The {{aim of the}} study is to find out the bacteriological profile of these ulcers and to find out the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates so that appropriate drugs may be chosen for treatment and for prevention of recurrence. Materials and Methods: Fifty-six samples from recurrent plantar ulcers of paucibacillary leprosy patients (attending the outpatient department of Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine) were studied for the purpose. Proper sample collection, gram staining, inoculation on culture media, and final identification by biochemical methods were undertaken. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done for appropriate choice of drugs. Results: Mixed growth of bacteria was seen in 20 (36 &#x 0025;) cases while single organism was isolated from the rest. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant single isolate followed by E. coil, Proteus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. Chloramphenicol and gentamycin are the two drugs that have shown efficacy to the extent of 75 to 100 &#x 0025; and 25 to 100 &#x 0025; respectively in vitro studies. Conclusion: Bacteriological study of plantar ulcers of leprosy patients has revealed Staphylococcus aureus as the main pathogen.

40|$|Structural {{adhesive}} bonding is coming into increasing use in civil engineering either for strengthening operations involving the {{adhesive bonding}} of external reinforcements or to replace traditional assembly techniques in new structures. However adhesive bonding induces stress concentrations {{at the edges}} of the joint, which have been studied by a large number of researchers in order to reduce these phenomena and increase the capacity and service life of the assembly. These studies are all, therefore, concerned with optimizing shear stress transfer in adhesively bonded joints. This paper investigates the role of the hydrostatic pressure on the ultimate capacities of common civil engineering adhesives. This led us to investigate a new joint geometry, the curved bonded joint that naturally creates compressive stresses on the edge of the joint. Initially, classical modelling is conducted to determine how the geometry affects the stresses in the joint. Then, fracture mechanics is used to investigate crack propagation. After this theoretical modelling, several experimental investigations are presented. These are quasi-static tests which compare classical shear lap joints to curved joints. The experimental results are then exploited using the modelling described before. Additional testing is currently in progress, but the curved bonded joint seems to <b>hold</b> <b>good</b> <b>prospects</b> and a patent has been filed...|$|R

40|$|Water and {{environmental}} resources which {{provide opportunities for}} households are threatened by human activities that leads to pollution. The research objectives were to understand the contribution water makes to the livelihoods of urban and peri-urban households; the factors influencing perceptions, attitudes and behaviour in relation to surface water {{and environmental}} quality, and measures for promoting community participation in water and environmental management. Ten communities were selected in Accra and its surrounding communities to reflect different levels of infrastructure provision for the study. Four focus group discussions were held in each community, with a mixed group, men, women, and young adults. Issues which emerged were investigated further in a structured household questionnaire survey involving 443 respondents. Key informant interviews were held with the most important government and non government regulatory, research and service provision departments and organizations in water, sanitation, and the environment sectors. Water samples {{from some of the}} selected communities were analyzed in the laboratory to compare with respondents’ perceptions. Among the households surveyed, 59. 14 % were engaged in a water dependent occupation which contributed over 80 % of household income in some cases. The study also found that perceptions of water and environment are influenced by the existing social and cultural setting. There were common concepts which helped groups to interpret and make meaning from their environment. The prospects for successful water and environmental interventions can be enhanced through an understanding of this local knowledge and perceptions. There was no clear relationship between attitudes and environmental behaviour or between attitudes and socioeconomic status. Actual behaviour was influenced by ability to pay for services, their availability and the influence of shared community norms. Although citizen participation in water and environmental management decision making is very limited at present, community collective action <b>holds</b> <b>good</b> <b>prospects</b> for future interventions in water and environmental management...|$|R

40|$|Data sets in {{astronomy}} are growing to enormous sizes. Modern astronomical surveys provide not only image data but also catalogues {{of millions of}} objects (stars, galaxies), each object with hundreds of associated parameters. Exploration of this very high-dimensional data space poses a huge challenge. Subspace clustering is one among several approaches which have been proposed for this purpose in recent years. However, many clustering algorithms require the user to set {{a large number of}} parameters without any guidelines. Some methods also do not provide a concise summary of the datasets, or, if they do, they lack additional important information such as the number of clusters present or the significance of the clusters. In this paper, we propose a method for ranking subspaces for clustering which overcomes many of the above limitations. First we carry out a transformation from parametric space to discrete image space where the data are represented by a grid-based density field. Then we apply so-called connected morphological operators on this density field of astronomical objects that provides visual support for the analysis of the important subspaces. Clusters in subspaces correspond to high-intensity regions in the density image. The importance of a cluster is measured by a new quality criterion based on the dynamics of local maxima of the density. Connected operators are able to extract such regions with an indication of the number of clusters present. The subspaces are visualized during computation of the quality measure, so that the user can interact with the system to improve the results. In the result stage, we use three visualization toolkits linked within a graphical user interface so that the user can perform an in-depth exploration of the ranked subspaces. Evaluation based on synthetic as well as real astronomical datasets demonstrates the power of the new method. We recover various known astronomical relations directly from the data with little or no a priori assumptions. Hence, our method <b>holds</b> <b>good</b> <b>prospects</b> for discovering new relations as well. ...|$|R

Drawing on the French approach of societal analysis, this paper investigates how country-specific school-to-work transition systems stratify the risk of non-standard employment in early career differently in Japan and Switzerland. Our results reveal that in Japan young entrants who completed university education are least at risk of becoming employed in non-standard work. On the contrary, it is the highly educated university graduates who mainly enter the labour market via non-standard employment in Switzerland, where vocational education promotes smooth transitions into standard employment relationships.

40|$|A {{sustainable}} smallholder dairying system {{being developed}} in Kenya <b>holds</b> out <b>good</b> <b>prospects</b> for milk production {{on the edges}} of large towns and cities. Using intensive methods for growing fodder, farmers should be able to produce enough forage from one hectare of land to keep five crossbred cows for a whole year. In 1989 the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) and the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) joined forces to Improve the existing National Dairy Development Project (NDDP). This had been started several years earlier to encourage milk production in the coastal area of Kenya, where there was a big demand for fresh milk. Studies in 1989 and 1990 showed that the best breed for the small holders was a Sahiwal x Ayrshire cross. It does not seem to matter whether the cross is one third or two-thirds Ayrshire. This is a great advantage, as less pure breeding stock is needed to maintain the supply of milking cows. Farmers keep the cows in stalls and cut and carry fodder grown on the farm. The NDDP encouraged farmers to grow napier grass and then buy in protein supplements like copra cake to balance the grass. ILCA, though, have looked for ways to produce all the feed on the farm. They have now introduced a forage legume, Clitoria ternatea, that can be grown with napier grass. Both are grown in 'alleys' between hedgerows of Leucaena leucocephala. Such a system can yield up to 26 tonnes of dry matter per hectare, about a fifth of that being Clitoria. This quantity is enough to feed five cows for a year. Further studies have shown the advantage of cutting napier grass when it is young. Cows fed napier grass cut at a metre high yielded 8. 5 kg of milk per day. lf the grass was cut at a more mature stage, 1. 5 metres high, yields dropped to 6. 8 kg/ day Cut at the younger stage, napier grass yields were reduced by only one tonne of dry matter per hectare. ILCA are now looking at ways to bring extra energy into the system. Some farmers are already using the leaves and tubers of cassava to supplement the feed. ILCA now want to see how cassava can best be utilized.
