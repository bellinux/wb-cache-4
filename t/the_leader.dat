40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the influence of the transformational leadership on the performance through empowerment, trust, and satisfaction with leaders. Its data were collected through questionnaire with 201 respondents and analyzed by using the path analysis method. Transformational leadership is found to significantly influence empowerment and trust on <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> as indicated by the significance value of < 0. 05. Empowerment significantly influences satisfaction whereas trust on <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> does not significantly influence satisfaction. The result of this research shows that directly, transformational leadership more effectively gives direct effect on the performance than through empowerment, trust, and satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>leaders.</b> Empowerment and trust on <b>the</b> <b>leaders,</b> either completely or partially, influence satisfaction significantly. Based on the research result, it is suggested that <b>the</b> company <b>leaders</b> should increase transformational leadership, empowerment, trust on <b>the</b> <b>leaders,</b> performance, and satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> in <b>the</b> company. 1.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{minority}} <b>leader</b> of Parliament is {{a member}} of Parliament who is elected by members of the minority parties in Parliament to act as their <b>leader.</b> <b>The</b> Minority <b>leader</b> of Parliament is always from the largest minority party in Parliament and is the main opposition to the majority or ruling party. <b>The</b> minority <b>leader</b> keeps member of the minority parties in order, usually to oppoose a bill supported by members of the majority or ruling party. The President of Sierra Leone, the Speaker of Parliament, <b>the</b> Majority <b>leader</b> of Parliament closely work with <b>the</b> Minority <b>leader</b> of Parliament to rally enough support from the opposition parties to pass a bill. <b>The</b> Minority <b>leader</b> is often very critical of the president and the ruling party. <b>The</b> minority <b>leader</b> is about as influential in Parliament as <b>the</b> majority <b>leader.</b> <b>The</b> current Minority <b>leader</b> of Parliament is the Honourable Bernadette Lahai from the main opposition Sierra Leone People's Party.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{a leader}} based {{containment}} control strategy for multiple unicycle agents is introduced. Similar {{results for the}} single integrator case examined in [7] are derived based on the theory of Partial Difference Equations on graphs established in [1]. <b>The</b> <b>leaders</b> converge to a desired formation based on a control law that is independent of the followers’ states. Once <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> have reached <b>the</b> desired formation, the followers converge to the convex hull of <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> final positions. When <b>the</b> desired <b>leader</b> formation is infeasible, then (as was shown in [5]) <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> converge to a configuration where they share the same velocities and orientations. We show in this paper that in such a situation, the followers converge to the same velocities and orientations as <b>the</b> <b>leaders,</b> with <b>the</b> same control law that {{was used for the}} followers in the initial containment control problem. The theoretical results are verified through computer simulations. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a single-item, independent private value auction environment with two bidders: a leader, who knows his valuation, and a follower, who privately chooses {{how much to}} learn about his valuation. We show that, under some conditions, an ex-post efficient revenue-maximizing auction—which solicits bids sequentially—partially discloses <b>the</b> <b>leader's</b> bid to <b>the</b> follower, to influence his learning. The disclosure rule that emerges is novel; it may reveal to the follower only a pair of bids to which <b>the</b> <b>leader's</b> actual bid belongs. The identified disclosure rule, relative to the first-best, induces the follower to learn less when <b>the</b> <b>leader's</b> valuation is low and more when <b>the</b> <b>leader's</b> valuation is high...|$|R
