25|$|Several {{types of}} balun are {{commonly}} used to feed a dipole antenna: current baluns and coax baluns. Baluns can be made using ferrite <b>toroid</b> cores or even from the coax feedline itself. The choice of the <b>toroid</b> core is crucial. A rule of thumb is: the more power, the bigger the core.|$|E
25|$|While {{generating}} discharges, {{electrical energy}} from the secondary and <b>toroid</b> is transferred to the surrounding air as electrical charge, heat, light, and sound. The process is similar to charging or discharging a capacitor, except that a Tesla coil uses AC instead of DC. The current that arises from shifting charges within a capacitor is called a displacement current. Tesla coil discharges are formed {{as a result of}} displacement currents as pulses of electrical charge are rapidly transferred between the high-voltage <b>toroid</b> and nearby regions within the air (called space charge regions). Although the space charge regions around the <b>toroid</b> are invisible, they play a profound role in the appearance and location of Tesla coil discharges.|$|E

The images of the <b>toroids</b> show peculiar feature in the rear side of the black holes. Concerning the line profiles, the red wing extends to the very small frequency region because the location of the inner edge is rather near the event horizon of the black hole and consequently the velocity of the inner edge of <b>toroids</b> can be faster than that of the Kepler disks.

50|$|In 1970 he {{published}} a book, Adventures among the <b>toroids.</b> A study of orientable polyhedra with regular faces, {{in which he}} discussed what are now called Stewart <b>toroids.</b> The book was handwritten in calligraphy with many formulas and illustrations. Like the Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, and Johnson solids, the Stewart polyhedra have regular polygons as faces.

50|$|Electron Power Systems, Inc. of Acton, Massachusetts, United States, {{claims to}} have {{developed}} a technology for maintaining small stable plasma <b>toroids</b> called electron spiral <b>toroids</b> (ESTs) which remain stable in Earth's atmosphere {{without the use of}} any special magnetic fields. They claim to have created these <b>toroids</b> in the laboratory, and to have developed a mathematical model for them that is similar to some explanations for ball lightning. An EST may be a special case of a spheromak.|$|R
25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the <b>toroid</b> capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the <b>toroid</b> begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.|$|E

To encourage oxidation, or rust, sprinklers were initially directed toward the four German-made slabs of steel {{that make up the}} work (see External links). Working with spheroid and <b>toroid</b> sections for the first time, Betwixt the Torus and the Sphere (2001) and Union of the Torus and the Sphere (2001) introduced entirely new shapes into Serra's sculptural vocabulary. Wake (2003) was installed at the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, with its five pairs of locked <b>toroid</b> forms measuring 14 feet high, 48 feet long and six feet wide apiece. Each of these five closed volumes is composed of two toruses, with the profile of a solid, vertically flattened S.|$|E
25|$|Research into using fusion for the {{production}} of electricity, has been pursued for over 60 years. Successful accomplishment of controlled fusion has been stymied by scientific and technological difficulties; nonetheless, important progress has been made. At present, controlled fusion reactions have been unable to produce break-even (self-sustaining) controlled fusion. The two most advanced approaches are magnetic confinement (<b>toroid</b> designs) and inertial confinement (laser designs).|$|E

40|$|DNA-DNA {{electrostatic}} attraction is considered as {{the driving force}} {{for the formation of}} DNA <b>toroids</b> in the presence of DNA condensing cations. This attraction comes from the DNA helical charge distribution and favours hexagonal toroidal cross-sections. The latter is in agreement with recent cryo,electron microscopy studies on DNA condensed with cobalt hexammine. We treat the DNA-DNA interactions within the modem theory of electrostatic interaction between helical macromolecules. The size and thickness of the <b>toroids</b> is calculated within a simple model; other models of stability of DNA <b>toroids</b> are-discussed and compared...|$|R

25|$|A {{toroidal}} {{ion trap}} can be visualized as a linear quadrupole curved around and connected {{at the ends}} or as {{a cross section of}} a 3D ion trap rotated on edge to form the <b>toroid,</b> donut shaped trap. The trap can store large volumes of ions by distributing them throughout the ring-like trap structure. This toroidal shaped trap is a configuration that allows the increased miniaturization of an ion trap mass analyzer. Additionally all ions are stored in the same trapping field and ejected together simplifying detection that can be complicated with array configurations due to variations in detector alignment and machining of the arrays.|$|E

In the scene, Hawking tells Homer [...] "Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing... I may have to steal it." [...] In his book What's science ever done for us?: what The Simpsons can teach us about physics, robots, life and the universe, Paul Halpern wrote that in mathematics, a [...] "donut-shape", the three-dimensional generalization of a ring, is referred to as a torus. The generalization of a torus, any closed curve spun in a circle around an axis, is called a <b>toroid.</b> According to Halpern, Hawking's line references {{the fact that there are}} [...] "genuine" [...] scientific theories that the universe is toroidal.|$|E
50|$|The {{configuration}} {{was produced}} by combining two individual <b>toroids</b> produced by two conical θ pinch guns, located {{at either end of}} a length of Pyrex pipe with a constant magnetic guide field. The toroidal currents in the <b>toroids</b> were in opposite directions, so that they repelled each other.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} optimized printed circuit board (PCB) air-core <b>toroids</b> for high-frequency dc–dc converters with strict requirements {{in terms of volume}} and noise. The effect of several design parameters on the overall inductor volume, on dc and ac winding resistance, and on the radiated noise will be investigated. PCB <b>toroids</b> are compared to standard air-core solenoids and other state-of-the-art air-core <b>toroids</b> both theoretically and experimentally: at first, using ANSOFT Maxwell and ANSOFT Q 3 D simulation tools, and subsequently, with laboratory measurements (irradiated noise, efficiency, and frequency response) on several prototypes. These very flexible and rather easy to manufacture inductors appear very attractive for compact highfrequency dc–dc converters where high efficiency, low volume, and low noise are of primary concern...|$|R
2500|$|As the {{secondary}} coil's energy (and output voltage) continue to increase, larger pulses of displacement current further ionize and heat {{the air at}} the point of initial breakdown. This forms a very electrically conductive [...] "root" [...] of hotter plasma, called a leader, that projects outward from the <b>toroid.</b> The plasma within the leader is considerably hotter than a corona discharge, and is considerably more conductive. In fact, its properties are similar to an electric arc. The leader tapers and branches into thousands of thinner, cooler, hair-like discharges (called streamers). The streamers look like a bluish 'haze' at the ends of the more luminous leaders. The streamers transfer charge between the leaders and <b>toroid</b> to nearby space charge regions. The displacement currents from countless streamers all feed into the leader, helping to keep it hot and electrically conductive.|$|E
2500|$|Seward {{proposes that}} ball {{lightning}} is a spinning plasma <b>toroid</b> or ring. [...] He built a lab that produces lightning level arcs, and by modifying the conditions he produced bright, small balls that mimic ball lightning and persist in atmosphere after the arc ends. [...] Using a high speed camera {{he was able}} to show that the bright balls were spinning plasma toroids.|$|E
2500|$|The primary coil's {{resonant}} frequency is tuned {{to that of}} the secondary, by using low-power oscillations, then increasing the power (and retuning if necessary) until the system operates properly at maximum power. While tuning, a small projection (called a [...] "breakout bump") is often added to the top terminal in order to stimulate corona and spark discharges (sometimes called streamers) into the surrounding air. Tuning can then be adjusted so as to achieve the longest streamers at a given power level, corresponding to a frequency match between the primary and secondary coil. Capacitive 'loading' by the streamers tends to lower the {{resonant frequency}} of a Tesla coil operating under full power. A toroidal topload is often preferred to other shapes, such as a sphere. A <b>toroid</b> with a major diameter that is much larger than the secondary diameter provides improved shaping of the electrical field at the topload. This provides better protection of the secondary winding (from damaging streamer strikes) than a sphere of similar diameter. And, a <b>toroid</b> permits fairly independent control of topload capacitance versus spark breakout voltage. A toroid's capacitance is mainly a function of its major diameter, while the spark breakout voltage is mainly a function of its minor diameter.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor's {{study of}} the {{relaxation}} into the reversed state led to his development of a broader theoretical {{understanding of the role}} of magnetic helicity and minimum energy states, greatly advancing the understanding of plasma dynamics. The minimum-energy state, known as the [...] "Taylor state", is particularly important in the understanding of new fusion approaches in the compact <b>toroid</b> class.

50|$|A special {{category}} of toroidal polyhedra are constructed exclusively by regular polygon faces, without crossings, {{and with a}} further restriction that adjacent faces may not lie in the same plane as each other. These are called Stewart <b>toroids,</b> named after Bonnie Stewart, who studied them intensively.

2500|$|A dipole is {{omnidirectional}} {{perpendicular to}} the wire axis; it radiates equal power in all azimuthal directions {{perpendicular to the}} axis of its elements, with the radiation falling to zero on the axis (off {{the ends of the}} antenna). [...] In a half wave dipole the radiation is maximum perpendicular to the antenna, declining monotonically as [...] to zero on the axis. [...] Its radiation pattern in three dimensions is a <b>toroid</b> (doughnut) -shaped lobe symmetric about the axis of the dipole. [...] When mounted vertically this results in maximum radiation in horizontal directions, with relatively little power radiated up into the sky or down toward the Earth, making the vertical dipole a good antenna for terrestrial communication when the direction to the receiver is unknown or changing. [...] When mounted horizontally, the radiation pattern will have two opposing lobes at right angles (90°) to the antenna, and nulls off the ends.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oscillating}} {{magnetic field}} of the primary winding induces an oscillating current in the secondary winding (L2), by Faraday's law of induction. Over a number of cycles, the energy in the primary circuit is transferred to the secondary. The total energy in the tuned circuits {{is limited to the}} energy originally stored in the capacitor C1, so as the oscillating voltage in the secondary increases in amplitude ("ring up") the oscillations in the primary decrease to zero ("ring down"). Although the ends of the secondary coil are open, it also acts as a tuned circuit due to the capacitance (C2), the sum of the parasitic capacitance between the turns of the coil plus the capacitance of the <b>toroid</b> electrode E. Current flows rapidly back and forth through the secondary coil between its ends. Because of the small capacitance, the oscillating voltage across the secondary coil which appears on the output terminal is much larger than the primary voltage.|$|E
