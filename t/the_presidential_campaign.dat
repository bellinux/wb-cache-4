Nunn reconciled with his son, and when Steve ran for governor in 2003, Louie supported him.

5|$|Taft upset some {{progressives}} {{by choosing}} Hitchcock as Chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), placing him {{in charge of}} <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign.</b> Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business. Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs, Virginia, where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy. After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a golf ball, Roosevelt warned him against candid shots.|$|E

5|$|Blaine {{spent the}} summer of 1892 at his Bar Harbor cottage, and did not involve himself in <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> other than to make a single speech in New York in October. Harrison was {{defeated}} soundly in his rematch against former president Cleveland and when Blaine returned to Washington {{at the close of}} 1892, he and Harrison were friendlier than they had been in years. Blaine’s health declined rapidly in the winter of 1892–1893, and he died in his Washington home on January 27, 1893. After a funeral at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington. He was later re-interred in Blaine Memorial Park, Augusta, Maine, in 1920.|$|E
5|$|He {{soon became}} {{known for his}} {{nationalist}} views. He co-founded the Kilusang Makabansa (National Progress Movement), an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of nationalism and social justice in the 1950s.

5|$|In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, {{including}} Senator Fred Dubois, in bolting the Republican Party {{to support}} <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> of Democrat William Jennings Bryan — free silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican {{in opposition to}} the campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split between himself and a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had little chance of winning, and concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Dubois — until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.|$|E

5|$|Seymour's {{operatives}} sought Johnson's support, but he long {{remained silent}} on <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign.</b> It {{was not until}} October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, {{in part because of}} their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.|$|E
5|$|Clements had {{supported}} Bert T. Combs for governor against Chandler in 1955, {{and did so}} again against Harry Lee Waterfield in 1959. Combs defeated Waterfield and rewarded Clements by appointing him state highway commissioner. In 1961, Clements and Combs split over a proposed deal to lease dump trucks from a Louisville car dealer. State newspapers charged that the deal was payback to the dealer, a Combs supporter. When Combs canceled the deal Clements {{took it as a}} public rebuke and soon after resigned to work on <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> of his friend, Lyndon Johnson. Following his split with Combs, Clements allied himself with the Chandler faction, opposing Combs' lieutenant governor, Wilson Wyatt in his bid to unseat Senator Thruston Morton. Clements' influence declined rapidly after the split with Combs, and by the 1963 gubernatorial race, he was unable to deliver his home county for Chandler in the primary against Edward T. Breathitt. Clements died in his hometown of Morganfield, Kentucky on March 12, 1985.|$|E

Combs. When Combs won the governorship in 1959, he appointed Breathitt as personnel commissioner, where he wrote legislation establishing the first merit system for state employees.

5|$|Gravel did {{not compete}} in the initial 2008 vote, the Iowa caucuses, but was still {{subjected}} to a false report from MSNBC that he had {{pulled out of the}} race afterward. Gravel did focus his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. There he received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in <b>the</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. By late March, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries.|$|E
