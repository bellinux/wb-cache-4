5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to oxygen (diradical) {{converts}} this carbene to {{the corresponding}} benzophenone and the diphenylmethane compound is formed {{when it is}} <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> 1,4-cyclohexadiene. As with the other carbenes this species contains large bulky substituents, namely bromine and the trifluoromethyl groups, that shield the carbene and prevent or slow down the process of dimerisation to a 1,1,2,2-tetra(phenyl)alkene.|$|E
5|$|Parma made {{no effort}} to {{restrain}} his soldiers. On their rampage through the city, Italian and Spanish soldiers slaughtered the rest of the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Once their blood-lust was satiated, they began to plunder. Civilians who had taken refuge in the churches were initially ignored, but when the fire started, they were forced into the streets and <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> the rampaging soldiers. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes smoldering, or in flames, trying to escape the conflagration, only to be <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> the enraged Spanish; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they were cornered by the enraged Italians. Parma wrote to King Philip that over 4000lay dead in the ditches (moats). English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only eight buildings remained standing.|$|E

5|$|Alex's outer rainbands {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} across Virginia, peaking at over 7inches (178mm) {{in the center}} of the state. The rainfall caused localized flooding, but there was no reported damage in the state. In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, rip currents produced by the storm injured three people. A few young children had to be rescued when they were <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> a jetty. In New Jersey, the strong surf and rip currents hospitalized at least five swimmers.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of Oberon, the furthest of the large moons. All the irregular moons are probably captured objects that were <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E

5|$|At Fontainebleau, Catherine {{arranged}} entertainments {{that lasted}} for several days, including fancy-dress jousting and chivalrous events in allegorical settings.

The fighting climaxed with the tower losing its magical properties and bursting into flames. In another spectacle, singing sirens swam past the king, and Neptune floated by in a chariot drawn by seahorses.|$|E
5|$|Born to an upper-class family, David {{rebelled against}} social {{norms of the}} day. In the 1930s she studied art in Paris, became an actress, and ran off with a married man with whom she sailed in a small boat to Italy, where their boat was confiscated. They reached Greece, where they were nearly <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> the German {{invasion}} in 1941, but escaped to Egypt, where they parted. She then worked for the British government, running a library in Cairo. While there she married, but the marriage was not long-lived.|$|E
5|$|Like many of Verne's novels, {{the play}} is deeply imbued with themes of initiation, echoing the {{traditional}} mythic pattern of a young hero coming of age and reaching maturity through a dangerous and transformative journey. In Journey Through the Impossible, the young Georges, initially <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> obsessions {{similar to those that}} drove his father mad, resolves his inner torments during a harrowing series of experiences in which Ox and Volsius compete as substitute father-figures. Both father-figures are highly symbolic: Ox is a sinister tempter representing knowledge and science, balancing the Guardian Angel Volsius.|$|E

5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired in mud pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil liquefaction from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages {{can be attributed to}} the tendency of smaller animals to become trapped in the mud (other animals that were <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also hint at the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of November 1846, the settlers had reached the Sierra Nevada where they became <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee (now Donner) Lake, high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran extremely low and, in mid-December, some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the settlers, but the first relief party did not arrive {{until the middle of}} February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train had become trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived to reach California, many of them having eaten the dead for survival.|$|E
5|$|During the cease-fire, {{the abbey}} offers shelter to {{refugees}} fleeing the regions affected by fallout, {{which results in}} a battle of wills over euthanasia between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp. The war resumes, and a nuclear explosion occurs near the abbey. Abbot Zerchi tries to flee to safety, bringing with him the abbey's ciborium containing consecrated hosts, {{but it is too}} late. He is <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> the falling walls of the abbey, and finds himself lying under tons of rock and bones as the abbey's ancient crypts disgorge their contents. Among them is a skull with an arrow's shaft protruding from its forehead (presumably that of Brother Francis Gerard from the first section of the book).|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Dixon {{succeeded in}} {{bringing}} his ship alongside the Spanish frigate {{and opened a}} heavy fire, to which Gerraro replied with his own broadside. The larger and more powerful British ship was able to rapidly inflict severe damage to the Santa Dorotea, and within minutes the mizenmast had fallen and the mainmast and rudder were severely battered. As Santa Dorotea veered off course, O'Neil passed Lion for a third time, at an even greater distance than before, and once again his broadsides failed {{to have an effect}} and again he came under fire from the British vessel. His last attempt to save Santa Dorotea defeated, O'Neil turned away and his ships raised all sail in the direction of Cartagena at 13:10. Gerraro, his isolated ship <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> Lion, which was slowly turning back towards the drifting frigate, raised the Union Flag upside down as a sign of surrender.|$|E
5|$|Except for water, {{the only}} other {{compound}} identified {{on the surface of}} Ariel by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is concentrated mainly on its trailing hemisphere. Ariel shows the strongest spectroscopic evidence for CO2 of any Uranian satellite, and was the first Uranian satellite on which this compound was discovered. The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials {{under the influence of the}} energetic charged particles coming from Uranus's magnetosphere or solar ultraviolet radiation. This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the outgassing of primordial CO2 <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> water ice in Ariel's interior. The escape of CO2 from the interior may be related to past geological activity on this moon.|$|E
