50|$|When the {{solution}} above the <b>transformation</b> <b>point</b> is solid, rather than liquid, an analogous eutectoid transformation can occur. For instance, in the iron-carbon system, the austenite phase can undergo a eutectoid transformation to produce ferrite and cementite, often in lamellar {{structures such as}} pearlite and bainite. This eutectoid point occurs at 727 C and about 0.76% carbon.|$|E
50|$|In physics, a Galilean {{transformation}} {{is used to}} transform between the coordinates of two reference frames which differ only by constant relative motion within the constructs of Newtonian physics. These transformations together with spatial rotations and translations {{in space and time}} form the inhomogeneous Galilean group (assumed throughout below). Without the translations in space and time the group is the homogeneous Galilean group. The Galilean group is the group of motions of Galilean relativity action on the four dimensions of space and time, forming the Galilean geometry. This is the passive <b>transformation</b> <b>point</b> of view. The equations below, although apparently obvious, are valid only at speeds much less than the speed of light. In special relativity the Galilean transformations are replaced by Poincaré transformations; conversely, the group contraction in the classical limit c → ∞ of Poincaré transformations yields Galilean transformations.|$|E

Continuous cooling {{transformation}} (CCT) {{curves of}} deformed austenite (A) of Nb-Ti microalloying {{high strength steel}} were measured using Gleeble- 3800 thermo-mechanical simulator, and corresponding transformation and structure were analyzed, {{and the effects of}} cooling rate on the tested steel’s mechanical property were studied.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of steering between two correlated Unruh-Dewitt detectors {{when one of them}} locally interacts with external scalar field via different quantifiers. We find that the quantum steering, either measured by the entropic steering inequality or the Cavalcanti-Jones-Wiseman-Reid inequality, is fragile under the influence of Unruh thermal noise. The quantum steering is found always asymmetric and the asymmetry is extremely sensitive to the initial state parameter. In addition, the steering-type quantum correlations experience "sudden death" for some accelerations, which are quite different from the behaviors of other quantum correlations in the same system. It is worth noting that the domination value of the tight quantum steering exists a <b>transformation</b> <b>point</b> with increasing acceleration.

This commentary introduces extensions to the percolation theory that have been developed while studying sea ice, and describes how these extensions can further our understanding of social networks.

40|$|AbstractNowadays thermal forming {{processes}} of steel are {{state of the}} art in industrial applications. Nevertheless, the influences of thermal induced phase-transformation on residual stresses and strength have not been fully observed. Times needed for transformation are affected by the initial austenite grain size, while the prevailing peak temperature influences austenite grain growth. Higher temperatures lead to larger austenite grains, leading to increased times for transformation. In order to get an embraced understanding of such effects numerical simulations of phase-transformations are mandatory. In this paper simulations of thermal forming processes, using S 355 steel, are presented. Different continuous-cooling-transformation-diagrams (cct–diagrams) of specific austenite grain sizes for temperatures between <b>transformation</b> <b>point</b> AC 3 and melting temperature are implemented in the model. It is shown that resulting magnitudes of residual stresses vary between 248 N/mm 2 and 550 N/mm 2.
