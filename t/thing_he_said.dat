500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie {{in his head and}} really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He summed it up by saying [...] "What a dreadful episode. While it's important in the grand scheme of things in what it establishes about Data's background, the episode itself is horrendously bad, from the clumsy script to the embarrassingly inept body-double work." [...] He thought the ending was anticlimactic, and that the characters all acted [...] "as dumb as posts" [...] in the episode. The most positive <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> of the episode was that [...] "Spiner's teeth marks are all over the scenery when he's onscreen as Lore". DeCandido gave [...] "Datalore" [...] a score of four out of ten. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007. While he credited the art direction of the episode, he criticised the story, saying that [...] "it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they're supposed to happen, rather than having them happen organically. The characters are credulous when they should be skeptical, the audience isn't surprised by anything after the second act, and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft." [...] He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child, but felt that it didn't hold up on repeat watchings as an adult, and stated that Spiner's [...] "fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore" [...] wasn't enough to remedy the other faults in the episode. He gave it a D grade.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012 he {{announced}} {{he was at the}} point of his career {{when it was time to}} step away from the kitchen. The important <b>thing,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> is to make sure to give to young chefs the right things, the right mentoring because [...] "if we're not truly working to raise the standards of our profession, then we're not really doing our job".|$|E
60|$|No, La Certe {{had come}} to do none of these <b>things,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> with a conciliatory smile.|$|R
5000|$|In Batman: Arkham Knight, a [...] "Gotham's Most Wanted Mission" [...] {{involves}} Batman rescuing Jack Ryder from Deacon Blackfire's cult. After {{the revelation}} of Batman really being Bruce Wayne, Jack apologized about all the <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to Batman about Bruce Wayne and all the <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to Bruce Wayne about Batman. He also mentions how he [...] "wishes he had super powers", a reference to his Creeper alter ego.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the last}} <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to Ray Sumby, his {{literary}} editor, was [...] "Ray, don't take on too much." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "The FBI interviewed Ragen {{at great}} length. They {{brought back a}} {{multitude}} of tips, leads, and evidence. Tom Clark told me afterward that it led to very high places. J. Edgar Hoover intimated the same <b>thing.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> the people Ragen pointed to had now reformed. I learned later that it pointed to the Hilton hotel chain; Henry Crown, the big Jewish financier in Chicago; and Walter Annenberg, publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they did, and I am proud of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hewet's {{thoughts}} {{had followed}} some such course as this, {{for the first}} <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> as they stood {{on the edge of}} the cliff was-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There!' exclaimed Ethelberta petulantly. 'How I dislike {{a man to}} {{misrepresent}} <b>things!</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> {{there was}} not time for a reply!' ...|$|R
60|$|I thought Rupert would ha' bust, and the <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{to the man}} wot was {{spending}} money like water to rescue 'im was disgraceful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose {{all hands}} have roughed into him pretty bad, {{on account of}} <b>things</b> <b>he's</b> <b>said,</b> an' now <b>he</b> counts on showin' what his countrymen can do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, {{he must be}} awakened," [...] he announced, but in an undertone, as if {{afraid to}} do the <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> must needs be done.|$|E
60|$|Psmith, meanwhile, was not enjoying himself. It was an unheard-of <b>thing,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> depriving {{a man of}} his {{confidential}} secretary {{without so}} much as asking his leave.|$|E
60|$|But moments only, for {{the next}} <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{put her in a}} {{particularly}} odious light. He informed me that she had sworn to hunt Mr. Anon down.|$|E
6000|$|He {{accepted}} the authority she instinctively assumed over him, {{and found his}} dismissal already {{of the order of}} <b>things.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Yes, I'll go at once. But about--" ...|$|R
50|$|Rennyo's disciples also {{recorded}} <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{in a collection}} called the Goichidai Kikigaku ("A Record of Things Heard"), which provides later followers with some insight into his personality and beliefs.|$|R
6000|$|LADY CICELY (springing up again). Did Sir Howard {{tell you}} the <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> about Captain Brassbound's mother? (Renewed sensation.) I told you they quarrelled, Captain Kearney. I said so, didn't I? ...|$|R
6000|$|They danced the dance, and Frank acquitted himself respectably, but relapsed {{into his}} {{objectionable}} ways {{as soon as}} the trial ended; for the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> with a sigh of relief, was,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a fine}} night, the sky {{thick with}} stars, and Mr. Farebrother {{proposed}} that they should make a circuit to the old church by the London road. The next <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was-- ...|$|E
6000|$|We said no {{more about}} Heyst on that occasion, and it so {{happened}} that I did not meet Davidson again for some three months. When we did come together, almost the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me was: ...|$|E
60|$|George Crofts felt {{as though}} he'd burst, and then 'e got his breath, and the <b>things</b> <b>'e</b> <b>said</b> about Uncle Joe was so awful that Mrs. Mitchell told the boys to go away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, your Majesty," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I {{remember}} these streets before the Lord Provost began to rule us. I can't remember how we felt very well. All the great songs and the fighting change one so; and I don't {{think we can}} really estimate all we owe to the Provost; but I can remember his coming into this very shop twenty-two years ago, and I remember the <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> The singular <b>thing</b> is that, as far as I remember, I thought the <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> odd at that time. Now it's the things that I said, as far as I can recall them, that seem to me odd--as odd as a madman's antics." ...|$|R
5000|$|Though stories abound about <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> and did and miracles he performed, {{perhaps the}} {{following}} two vignettes are most telling and best represent {{the character of the}} Holy Tzaddik, Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Halevi of Krakow: ...|$|R
6000|$|The men did {{not like}} Dr. Mitchell, {{and would not have}} him if possible. Yet since he was club doctor and panel doctor, they had to submit. The first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to a sick or injured labourer, invariably, was: ...|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, while I was dressing, {{the steward}} of {{my side of}} the ship came to me as usual to see what I wanted. But the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me was--'Rather a bad job, sir--a {{passenger}} missing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No fear of that. The first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> when {{he could}} speak was 'Tell Rose carefully,' and as I came away he guessed where I was going and tried to kiss {{his hand in the}} old way, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the little}} things, his movement, the funny tones of his voice, that showed up big to Anna. The matter-of-fact <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> were absurd in contrast. The things her father said seemed {{meaningless}} and neutral.|$|R
60|$|Then Bob Pretty lost 'is temper, and the <b>things</b> <b>'e</b> <b>said</b> about Mr. Cutts wasn't fit for Smith to 'ear. He threw 'imself down at last {{full length}} {{on the ground}} and sulked till the day broke.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope and}} trust not!" [...] moaned Christian. [...] "He's a good man, and perhaps will do right <b>things.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> {{you ought to}} have gied Mr. Clym's share to Eustacia, and that's perhaps what he'll do himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{two girls}} {{had taken their}} walk, and were just going in, when, looking round, they saw Philip walking fast and determinedly up the approach, and as they turned back to meet him, the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was, 'Where is Guy?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Woodford," [...] said a {{voice at}} the door, and going to it, Anne found herself clasped in her uncle's arms. With very few words she {{led him to the}} bedside, and the first <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was [...] "God bless you, Peregrine, for what you have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Offence! What are {{you talking}} of? He didn't offend--No, but when I said I could not bring so many upon him, and could not have Owen teased about the <b>thing,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he would bother me no more, that I had Owen, {{and did not want}} him. And then he walked off.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{made more}} fuss than Bill Chambers a'most, 'specially when they dropped 'im off a hurdle {{carrying}} him 'ome, and the <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to Dr. Green for rubbing his 'ands {{as he came}} into the bedroom was disgraceful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't see any likeness," [...] she declared. [...] "He did {{remind me}} a little of him just at first, though," [...] she added, reflectively--"little <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and sort of mannerisms. I've sort of lost sight of them the last few times, though." ...|$|R
60|$|Dane {{was ashamed}} of several <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> and did that day, and his answer among them; but few white men are quite {{accountable}} for their actions when recovering from fever, and there {{was that in the}} surgeon's glance which aroused his indignation.|$|R
