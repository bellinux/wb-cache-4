5|$|In October 1942, Popovac {{issued an}} appeal to Muslim Partisans, urging them to join the Chetniks and turn against the Ustaše. In a report to Mihailović dated 3 November, Popovac wrote:I have to {{emphasize}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> intimate cooperation between the Muslims and Orthodox in the Stolac district from where, through the joint struggle of the Muslims and Orthodox, the Croat inhabitants, who were largely Ustaša-inclined, have been expelled. In that way, from Gabela to Mostar the entire left bank of the Neretva has been cleansed, {{and the number of}} refugees has been estimated at 12,000 people.|$|E

25|$|A {{systematic}} error or bias occurs {{when there is}} a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of {{systematic error}} is if, unknown <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> pulse oximeter you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).|$|E

25|$|<b>To</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E
25|$|In {{answer to}} your {{question}} concerning Lilith, I shall explain <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> essence of the matter. Concerning this point there is a received tradition from the ancient Sages who made use of the Secret Knowledge of the Lesser Palaces, which is the manipulation of demons and a ladder by which one ascends to the prophetic levels. In this tradition, it is made clear that Samael and Lilith were born as one, similar to the form of Adam and Eve who were also born as one, reflecting what is above. This is the account of Lilith which was received by the Sages in the Secret Knowledge of the Palaces. The Matron Lilith is the mate of Samael. Both of them were born at the same hour in the image of Adam and Eve, intertwined in each other. Asmodeus the great king of the demons has as a mate the Lesser (younger) Lilith, daughter of the king whose name is Qafsefoni. The name of his mate is Mehetabel daughter of Matred, and their daughter is Lilith.|$|E

(2) <b>To</b> introduce <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body of knowledge, research findings, and underlying principles that currently exists in the field. (3) <b>To</b> stimulate <b>you</b> <b>to</b> think about <b>the</b> implications of this research for situations we encounter daily.

500|$|Lead singer Bart Millard has {{described}} the story behind [...] "So Long Self" [...] as [...] "...really simple: It’s Not About [...] It never has been and it never will be.

Because Christ said you have to die to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E
500|$|When {{granting}} assent by commission, {{the sovereign}} authorises {{three or more}} (normally five) lords who are Privy Counsellors to declare assent {{in his or her}} name. The Lords Commissioners, as the monarch's representatives are known, wear scarlet parliamentary robes and sit on a bench between the throne and the Woolsack. The Lords Reading Clerk reads the commission aloud; the senior commissioner then states, [...] "My Lords, in obedience to Her Majesty's Commands, and by virtue of the Commission which has been now read, We do declare and notify <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Parliament assembled, that Her Majesty has given Her Royal Assent to the several Acts in the Commission mentioned." ...|$|E

500|$|The last {{case where}} this {{punishment}} is, by some, {{alleged to have}} been meted out in 1734, somewhere in Saxony. [...] Another tradition, however, is evidenced from the Saxonian city Zittau, where the last case {{is alleged to have}} happened in 1749. In at least one case in Zittau 1712, a non-venomous colubrid snake was used. The Zittau ritual was to put the victims in a black sack, and keep it under water for no less than six hours. In the mean time, the choir boys in town had the duty to sing the Psalm composed by Martin Luther, [...] "Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir" [...] (From deep affliction I cry out <b>to</b> <b>you)</b> <b>The</b> punishment of the sack was expressly abolished in Saxony in a rescript dated 17 June 1761 ...|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{identified}} himself as a poet and, in November 1734, applied to Edward Cave {{to work on the}} poetry reviews for The Gentleman's Magazine. In a letter written under the name S. Smith, Johnson said, [...] "As You appear no less sensible than Your Readers of the defects of your Poetical Article, You will not be displeased, if, in order to the improvement of it, I communicate <b>to</b> <b>You</b> <b>the</b> sentiments of a person, who will undertake on reasonable terms sometimes to fill a column". In particular, Johnson suggested removing the magazine's [...] "low Jests" [...] and [...] "awkward Buffoonery" [...] and then replacing them with poems, inscriptions, and [...] "short literary Dissertations in Latin or English" [...] written by himself. Cave did not accept Johnson's proposal to write a column, but he did employ Johnson occasionally to work on minor aspects of the periodical.|$|E
