5|$|Allison was {{replaced}} as manager by Terry Venables, {{who had been}} his assistant the previous season, and he guided Palace to promotion at the first attempt. The Palace youngsters also won the FA Youth Cup with a side including Kenny Sansom, Vince Hilaire and Billy Gilbert. The following season, 1977–78 saw the youth team became {{the first team to}} win the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons since Chelsea in 1960 and 1961. These talented young players had become regulars in the team by the 1978–79 season which saw Palace vying not only for promotion but also the Second Division Championship. The final game of the season was a Friday night match at home to Burnley. In front of the club's record home crowd of 51,801, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> to play for: a Palace win, and the club would be champions; a draw, and Palace would be promoted, but hand the championship to fierce rivals Brighton; a loss and Palace would stay down, with Sunderland clinching the final promotion place. At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed Ian Walsh to head the opener, before a great run by David Swindlehurst was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2–0 win. Palace were crowned champions, and had reached the top flight again.|$|E
500|$|Taylor's {{performance}} in Green Bay's 16–7 {{win over the}} Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game came to define his mental and physical toughness. In frigid conditions at Yankee Stadium, Taylor carried 31 times for 85yards and scored the Packers' only touchdown against what was considered the league's best defense, both statistically and by reputation. Lombardi entrusted Taylor with the ball, as he was confident his fullback {{would be able to}} move the offense and not turn it over. The game was highlighted by the fierce rivalry between Taylor and Giants linebacker Sam Huff. The two clashed on nearly every play and engaged in trash talk throughout the game. Steve Sabol, who filmed the game with his father for NFL Films, described it as such:The lasting image of that game in my mind is the ferocity and anger of Jim Taylor ... his barely restrained rage as he ran with the ball. Taylor just got the shit kicked out of him all day long ... <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> this trash-talking between him and especially Sam Huff ... Tons of profanity when they tackled him. I had never experienced anything like that.|$|E
500|$|For the 30th {{anniversary of}} The Joshua Tree, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, {{on which the}} album was played in its {{entirety}} at each show. It {{was the first time}} the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things have kind of come full circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right back there in a way. I don't think any of our work has ever come full circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2004, General Ricardo Sanchez, head of Multinational Force Iraq (MNF–I), claimed that the US had [...] "made significant progress in Anbar Province." [...] However, CPA funds for the province were inadequate. [...] A brigade commander in Fallujah was allocated only $200,000 a month, when he estimated that it would cost at least $25 million to restart the city's factories, which employed {{tens of thousands of}} workers. By February, insurgent attacks were rapidly increasing. On 12 February, United States Central Command (CENTCOM) commander General John P. Abizaid and Major General Chuck Swannack, the 82nd Airborne's commanding officer, were attacked while driving through Fallujah. On 14 February, in an incident dubbed the [...] "Valentine's Day Massacre", insurgents overran a police station in downtown Fallujah, killing 23 to 25 policemen and freeing 75 prisoners. The next day, the Americans fired Fallujah's police chief for refusing to wear his uniform and arrested the mayor. [...] In March, Keith Mines wrote, [...] "there is not a single properly trained and equipped Iraqi security officer in the entire Al Anbar province." [...] He added that security was entirely dependent on American soldiers, yet those same soldiers inflamed Sunni nationalists. That same month General Swannack gave a briefing on Anbar where he talked about improved security, declared the insurgency <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> but finished, and concluded [...] "the future for Al Anbar in Iraq remains very bright." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Human Nature" [...] was written and {{composed}} for Michael Jackson by Steve Porcaro of Toto. Porcaro recorded a rough demo of the song on a cassette. He had written the song after his first-grade daughter came home crying because a boy pushed her off the slide. He blurted out three reasons for the incident to comfort her: one, the boy liked her, two, people can be strange and three, it's human nature. Fellow Toto band member David Paich gave the demo tape, along {{with two of his}} own songs, to producer Quincy Jones, hoping they would be used by Jackson. Jones did not think Paich's songs were right for Jackson's current work, but enjoyed the rough demo of [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{at the end of the}} cassette. Jones explained, [...] "All of a sudden, at the end, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> this silence, there was: 'why, why, dah dah da-dum dah dah, why, why'. Just a dummy lyric and a very skeletal thing—I get goosebumps talking about it. I said, 'This is where we wanna go, because it's got such a wonderful flavor'". However, Jones was dissatisfied with the original lyrics and so John Bettis, who had written lyrics for hits by the Carpenters and the Pointer Sisters, among others, was asked to add lyrics to the song. He completed the song in two days. The producer asked if the song could be included on Jackson's album, to which Porcaro and Bettis agreed. [...] "Human Nature" [...] was the last song selected for Thriller, ousting [...] "Carousel" [...] from the final track listing.|$|E

Lee has since tried to downplay this kkonminam image, saying that his character Gong-gil in the film felt like a foot chain for him so he wanted to escape from it: [...] "After my performance in The King and the Clown, I found myself at the forefront of this ‘pretty boy’ trend, whether or not that was my intention.

They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times I felt myself {{becoming}} one of those people too. There was some hard times for us both, my ex-husband and I. And I think at the time, it caused us to be torn apart, and we lost respect for each other. And {{it got to the point}} that we didn't know each other..." [...] A low point of her life was in October 1979, when her father, whom she idolized, died near Louisville while Loveless was in North Carolina.|$|E
