25|$|Despite {{being made}} {{primarily}} from the same grape, pinot noir, winemaking styles in the Cote de Nuits is far from monolithic. The individual style of the producer or negociant and the decisions they make at {{each step of the}} winemaking process — beginning with the sorting table as they grapes arrive from the harvest — will affect the resulting quality of the wine immensely. It is this reason, along with the varied and complex ownership of most grand and premier cru vineyards, that most wine experts put more weight on the reputation of the producer and <b>the</b> <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> than on the vineyard name when it comes to evaluating all Burgundy wine-the Cote de Nuits not excluded.|$|E

25|$|Spanish {{wines are}} often labeled {{according}} {{to the amount of}} aging the wine has received. When the label says vino joven ("young wine") or sin crianza, the wines will have undergone very little, if any, wood aging. Depending on the producer, some of these wines will be meant to be consumed very young - often within a year of their release. Others will benefit from some time aging in the bottle. For <b>the</b> <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> (vendimia or cosecha) to appear on the label, a minimum of 85% of the grapes must be from that year's harvest. The three most common aging designations on Spanish wine labels are Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva.|$|E

2500|$|The {{quality of}} <b>the</b> <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> {{and the overall}} {{ripeness}} of the harvested grapes may {{also play a role}} since in cool years when the grapes are often harvested under-ripe, the tannins in the grape are often very [...] "green" [...] and harsh. In these years winemakers might press early (such as at 15 brix), a process that the Australians call [...] "short vatting".

50|$|A pilot episode for {{the series}} {{entitled}} <b>The</b> <b>Vintage</b> <b>Years</b> was filmed {{in the spring of}} 1981, but never aired. The character of Richard Channing was present in the original pilot, played by Michael Swan; this alternate Richard was Angela's biological son fighting for his domineering mother's favor. Abby Dalton's character, Julia, was called Dorcas, Jane Wyman wore a grey wig as Angela, and Chase and Maggie were played by Clu Gulager and Samantha Eggar, respectively. Emma was not seen, but a subplot concerning a mysterious woman crying for her mother while locked away in one of the upstairs rooms was seen. Lamas, Moses, and Rose appeared in the sames roles, and Chao Li-Chi's character was named Lee Fong.|$|R
50|$|The {{show was}} created by Earl Hamner, Jr., who had {{previously}} created The Waltons, which had just finished its final season in 1981. Hamner {{wanted to create a}} family drama involving the wine industry entitled <b>The</b> <b>Vintage</b> <b>Years.</b> An unaired pilot episode was produced, but CBS requested that Hamner make the show more along the lines of Dallas, which was the network's biggest hit at that time. The script was rewritten and several cast members changed for what became Falcon Crest. The series first aired in December 1981, when CBS scheduled Falcon Crest at 10 pm on Friday nights, right after Dallas. The Dallas-Falcon Crest one-two punch proved lucrative for the network and Falcon Crest was a top-20 show in the Nielsen Ratings for several years. Both shows (like The Waltons) were produced for CBS by the same company, Lorimar Productions.|$|R

50|$|So far, Sweden {{has only}} enacted {{a minimum of}} {{national}} legislation and regulations related to viticulture, which includes a list of allowed grape varieties. However, there are no protected designations of origin for Swedish wine, which means that Swedish producers are restricted to marketing table wines, and can not market quality wines. This means several restrictions on labeling practices. For example, <b>the</b> <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> may not be mentioned on the label.|$|E
50|$|In the 1830s and 1840s, {{the snout}} moth came and {{attacked}} the vine leaves. It {{was followed by}} a fungal disease called powdery mildew (Oidium). <b>The</b> <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> 1865 produced wines with very high natural levels of sugar and very early harvests.

50|$|Large {{portions}} of {{shares in the}} estate were bought by the Bordeaux wine merchant Fernand Ginestet (then owner of the adjacent Château Lascombes) in 1925, and the family share was gradually increased to allow his son Pierre Ginestet to take complete ownership in 1949. In 1965, Pierre Ginestet controversially declared a new estate policy that <b>the</b> <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> would only be affixed to great vintages, while selling the wine of lesser years as non-vintage wine, like the customary practice of Champagne.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1981, Wyman's career enjoyed a {{resurgence}} when she was cast as the scheming Californian vintner and matriarch Angela Channing in <b>The</b> <b>Vintage</b> <b>Years,</b> which was retooled as the primetime soap opera Falcon Crest. The series, which ran from December 1981 to May 1990, was created by Earl Hamner, who had created The Waltons a decade earlier. Also starring on the show was an already established character actress, Susan Sullivan, as Angela's niece-in-law, Maggie Gioberti, and the relatively unknown actor Lorenzo Lamas as Angela's irresponsible grandson, Lance Cumson. The on- and off-screen chemistry between Wyman and Lamas helped fuel the series' success. In its first season, Falcon Crest was a ratings hit, behind other 1980s prime-time soap operas, such as Dallas and Knots Landing, but initially ahead of rival Dynasty. Cesar Romero appeared from 1985 to 1987 on Falcon Crest as the romantic interest of Angela Channing.|$|R

50|$|A Colheita Port is {{a single}} vintage wine {{fortified}} and aged in tawny style for at least seven years. Instead of an indication of age (10, 20,...) <b>the</b> actual <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> is mentioned. However, Colheita Ports {{should not be confused}} with Vintage Port (see below): whereas a Vintage port will spend only around 18 months in barrels after harvest and will continue to mature in bottle, a Colheita may have spent 20 or more years in wooden barrels before being bottled and sold. A number of white Colheitas have also been produced.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{at least}} 95% of grapes must {{be from a}} {{particular}} vintage for that year {{to appear on the}} label. Prior to the early 1970s, all grapes had to be from <b>the</b> <b>vintage</b> <b>year.</b> All labels must list the alcohol content based on percentage by volume. For bottles labeled as varietals at least 75% of the grape must be of the variety. In Oregon, the requirement is 90%.

5000|$|Prices {{depend on}} many factors, such as <b>the</b> <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> the RECs were generated, {{location}} of the facility, {{whether there is a}} tight supply/demand situation, whether the REC is used for RPS compliance, even the type of power created. Solar renewable energy certificates or SRECs, for example, tend to be more valuable in the 16 states that have set aside a portion of the RPS specifically for solar energy. This differentiation is intended to promote diversity in the renewable energy mix which in an undifferentiated, competitive REC market, favors the economics and scale achieved by wind farms.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} scope, {{magnitude}} {{and performance of}} zombie funds in the Nordic private equity market. Our sample comprises of a total 266 funds from the 5 different Nordic countries. <b>The</b> <b>vintage</b> <b>years</b> of our sample funds are from 1998 to 2007, in order to grasp the two major economic downturns {{since the turn of}} the millennia. We cross-examine our sample with funds that have a vintage between 2008 until today, in order to identify potential zombie funds. Given this analysis, we find that the zombie funds constitute a substantial proportion of the total Nordic PE market. We are also able to distinguish the performance between ‘normal’ and zombie funds. Due to the absence of adequate interim performance measurements, this thesis applies different exits as an indication of success. We find that zombie funds are less likely to exit their portfolio companies compared to normal funds. This is true across all PE-backed exit types in our analysis. We also find that zombie funds are more likely to occur for smaller funds. nhhma...|$|R
