50|$|Ties {{are exposed}} to water and {{chemical}} attack from cement. They were traditionally made of galvanized steel, the fishtail tie being the most common. On high quality work ties were occasionally made of bronze.

The corrosion may force apart the cement joints and even result {{in the collapse of}} walls if no remedial action is taken. Any cracks appearing in cavity walls dating from the twentieth century need to be investigated before irremediable damage ensues. Horizontal cracking is especially suspect.Failed ties have to be isolated and substitute specialist <b>ties</b> installed by <b>drilling</b> through inner and outer leaves from outside the building.

40|$|The Benguela Current System, {{running off}} {{southwest}} Africa, {{is one of}} the world's largest upwelling regions. The current has strongly influenced sedimentary features on the continental margin. To unravel its development, a seismic stratigraphy, <b>tied</b> to <b>drilling</b> results from ODP Leg 175 Sites 1085 - 1087, was established. Four units, SCB- 1 to SCB- 4, were defined for the Cenozoic sediments. The upper unit, SCB- 1 (< 1. 5 Ma), characterised by continuous high-amplitude reflectors, represents global cooling and glacial-interglacial cycles. Unit SCB- 2 (< 14 Ma), distinguished by low-amplitude reflections, is associated with the onset of the upwelling system and establishment of the modern circulation pattern in the Cape Basin. Slump scarps are concentrated along the middle and upper shelf slope, suggesting they are caused by a combination of mass movements triggered by bottom currents and slope instabilities due to increased deposition associated with the upwelling. A westwards extension and/or movement of upwelling filaments is interpreted from the observed seawards shift of scarp locations with time. Erosion associated with stronger currents probably thinned unit SCB- 2 in the south. The two lower units, SCB- 3 and SCB- 4 (< 56 Ma), probably represent material eroded from the shelf break, and deposited during a major Oligocene/early Miocene regression that is consistent with a significant uplift of southern Africa. The basal reflector SCB-D of unit SCB- 4 is associated with the prominent reflector D or L described in previous publications...|$|R
40|$|The bulge is a 600 -m-thick {{regional}} {{deposit of}} pelagic sediment accumulated around the equator. Its stratigraphy reflects {{a number of}} factors: how accumulation rates have varied over time, how accumulation has been spatially focused around the equator, how much carbonate dissolution and reworking or nondeposition by bottom currents have occurred, and how much the deposits have been translated northward by motion of the Pacific tectonic plate on which they have accumulated. In order to fully explore {{the effects of these}} processes, a spatially continuous stratigraphic database is desirable, as existing cores provide information at only discrete points, and they tend to be sited in locally thicker accumulations. We illustrate the utility of seismic data <b>tied</b> to <b>drill</b> cores by comparing the carbonate dissolution effect in two north-south lines crossing the sediment bulge. Bathymetry over our easterly seismic line deepens relatively little going north, whereas our westerly line deepens by 750 m from 4 ˚N to 7 ˚N. At a common latitude the primary pelagic input to both these lines will have been similar, so the difference of their sediment mass should reflect mostly their relative carbonate loss due to dissolution. We use this fact to calculate the slope of the carbonate dissolution curve and find a remarkably small slope (little relative carbonate dissolution) compared to that expected from previous studies. The techniques here may suggest a possible way forward for studying the equatorial carbonate stratigraphy more generally...|$|R
40|$|Although land {{studies have}} {{identified}} major volcanic centers of historic eruptions within the Central Andes, the tephrachronologic record is {{disturbed by the}} high erosion rates in this arid region. Owing to erosion, studies of volcanic cyclicity based on subaerial deposits offer an incomplete record of the frequency and episodicity of eruptions since the Miocene. However, volcanic material commonly occurs in marine sediment as discrete ash fall layers and/or disseminated ash accumulations. A detailed investigation of cores from three sites offshore Peru drilled during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 201 has been conducted to determine the occurrence of volcanic ash layers and ash accumulations within marine sediments along the Peru shelf. These sites were previously occupied during ODP Leg 112, which suffered from poor and/or disturbed core recovery. Advancements in hydraulic piston coring realized since and employed during Leg 201 resulted in better core recovery and less disturbance of sediment throughout the cored intervals. Because marine sediments potentially undergo less erosion than land deposits and because Leg 201 benefited from improved recovery of less disturbed cores, the tephrachronologic record from Leg 201 yielded a more complete record of explosive activity for north-central Andean volcanism than previous studies. Ash layers were identified through detailed core descriptions supplemented by smear slide analysis. Primary ash layers were confirmed through whole-rock and glass geochemistry and petrographic analyses. These data also provided information concerning volcanic episodes represented by the ash layers through correlation to land studies. In addition, correlative <b>ties</b> between <b>drilling</b> sites are suggested. The improved recovery enabled the detailed examination of cores from the Peru margin needed {{to test the hypothesis}} that volcanic ash layers and accumulations are more abundant in the study region than previously reported...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the data}} {{collected}} {{during the summer of}} the 1998 was <b>tied</b> to the <b>drill</b> core and vibracore records. GPR profiles were collected along all drill site locations where possible. For consistent GPR data collection 100 MHz antennae with a 1000 volt transmitter were used. Where interesting sedimentary structures existed, other antennae frequencies were utilized. The topographically corrected GPR lines imaged the upper 4 - 6 meters and allowed for correlation of GPR profiles with sedimentary packages revealed in the drill/vibra core. The drill cores also confirmed previous GPR interpretations (1996 and 1997) of paleo-scarps where augering and vibracoring could not penetrate. Figure 1 100 MHz GPR profile (W-E) shot in 1997 near Copalis River.

40|$|International audienceThe pelagic {{cover of}} the Owen Ridge in the Arabian Sea {{recorded}} {{the evolution of the}} Indian monsoon since the Middle Miocene. The uplift of the Owen Ridge resulted from tectonic processes along the previously unidentified Miocene India-Arabia plate boundary. Based on seismic reflection data <b>tied</b> with deep-sea <b>drilling</b> to track the Miocene India-Arabia plate boundary, we propose a new timing for the uplift of the Owen Ridge and highlight its impact on the record of climate changes in pelagic sediments. The new dataset reveals a fracture zone east of the Owen Ridge corresponding to the fossil plate boundary, and documents that the main uplift of the Owen Ridge occurred close to ∼ 8. 5 Ma, and is coeval with a major uplift of the east Oman margin. Late Miocene deformation at the India-Arabia plate boundary is also coeval with the onset of intra-plate deformation in the Central Indian Ocean, suggesting a kinematic change of India and surrounding plates in the Late Miocene. The uplift of the Owen Ridge above the lysocline at ∼ 8. 5 Ma accounts for a better preservation of Globigerina bulloides in the pelagic cover, previously misinterpreted {{as the result of a}} monsoon intensification event...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{relationships}} between oceanic circulation in the Arabian Sea and Late Cenozoic climate changes, including variations in monsoon intensity at the million year time-scale, remain poorly investigated. Using multibeam and seismic data, we provide the first {{description of a}} contourite drift in the Arabian Sea, along the south-eastern Oman margin. This contourite drift is referred as the “Sawqirah Contourite Drift System”. Late Miocene reactivation of the south-eastern Oman margin resulted {{in the formation of}} a complex anticline system, which shaped the seafloor topography above which the Sawqirah Drift subsequently developed. The drift resulted from the circulation of bottom currents within the North Intermediate Indian Water. Major seismic unconformities identified within the Sawqirah Drift were <b>tied</b> to Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Program (ODP) drill holes, and allowed defining distinct episodes of drift construction. At least two of these unconformities record reorganizations of the oceanic circulation at ~ 4. 5 – 4. 8 Ma and ~ 2. 4 Ma. The 4. 5 – 4. 8 Ma-old unconformity is coeval with the onset of upwelling of deep and cold waters in the Owen Basin. The 2. 4 Ma-old unconformity records a major episode of Indian monsoon intensification (at the million year time scale) over the Arabian Sea, indicating strong coupling between oceanic and atmospheric circulation processes...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic changes {{rapidly in}} {{response}} to global warming {{and is expected to}} change even faster in the future (IPCC 2001, 2007, 2013). Large areas of the shelves and continental slopes bordering the Arctic Ocean are characterized by permafrost and the presence of gas hydrates. Future global warming and potential hydrate dissociation in the Arctic Ocean challenge the slope stability of these areas. This may lead to slope failures. The first, and so far only reported, largescale slope failure in the Arctic Ocean is the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide (HYM). Following our previous studies, we wanted to investigate this giant slope failure and the deeper structure of the Sophia Basin in detail to elucidate the potential causes of the main and following failure events as well as to test existing hypotheses on the generation of this giant submarine landslide. Our investigations focused on (1) pre-site survey of proposed IODP drill sites, (2) deep tectonic structure and seismicity of the Sophia Basin and (3) future failure potential north of Svalbard. Furthermore, we extended measurements along the Spitsbergen Fracture Zone in the Fram Strait, where a new deep-sea slide was discovered in 2012 during cruise MSM 21 / 4. Also, we <b>tied</b> existing ODP <b>drill</b> holes on top of the southern Yermak Plateau to our new and existing seismic networks. We applied a combination of hydro-acoustic mapping, deep and high-resolution multichannel seismic reflection profiling and a wide-angle seismic survey with broad-band oceanbottom seismometers (BB-OBS).

In addition, we sampled sediments to characterize the young sedimentation record, for dating and for geo-technical analysis...|$|R
40|$|Extension {{during the}} middle Cenozoic (43 – 26 Ma) in {{the north end of}} the West Antarctic rift system (WARS) is well {{constrained}} by seafloor magnetic anomalies formed at the extinct Adare spreading axis. Kinematic solutions for this time interval suggest a southward decrease in relative motion between East and West Antarctica. Here we present multichannel seismic reflection and seafloor mapping data acquired within and near the Adare Basin on a recent geophysical cruise. We have traced the ANTOSTRAT seismic stratigraphic framework from the northwest Ross Sea into the Adare Basin, verified and <b>tied</b> to DSDP <b>drill</b> sites 273 and 274. Our results reveal three distinct periods of tectonic activity. An early localized deformational event took place close to the cessation of seafloor spreading in the Adare Basin (~ 24 Ma). It reactivated a few normal faults and initiated the formation of the Adare Trough. A prominent pulse of rifting in the early Miocene (~ 17 Ma) resulted in normal faulting that initiated tilted blocks. The overall trend of structures was NE–SW, linking the event with the activity outside the basin. It resulted in major uplift of the Adare Trough and marks the last extensional phase of the Adare Basin. Recent volcanic vents (Pliocene to present day) tend to align with the early Miocene structures and the on-land Hallett volcanic province. This latest phase of tectonic activity also involves near-vertical normal faulting (still active in places) with negligible horizontal consequences. The early Miocene extensional event found within the Adare Basin does not require a change in the relative motion between East and West Antarctica. However, the lack of subsequent rifting within the Adare Basin coupled with the formation of the Terror Rift and an on-land and subice extension within the WARS require a pronounced change in the kinematics of the rift. These observations indicate that extension increased southward, therefore suggesting that a major change in relative plate motion took place in the middle Miocene. The late Miocene pole of rotation might have been located north of the Adare Basin, with opposite opening sign compared to the Eocene-Oligocene pole...|$|R
