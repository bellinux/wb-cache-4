How to evaluate is a key step for the management of <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>network</b> construction. According to the characteristic of <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>network,</b> an evaluation system is proposed in this paper. This paper set up a scientific evaluation system for <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>network</b> based on factor analysis and function point analysis. Through the study found that enhanced KPI index is the most important factor for <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>network.</b> The evaluation system have played an important significance for <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>network...</b>|$|R

The Résistance also planned, coordinated, and executed acts of sabotage on the electrical power grid, transport facilities, and <b>telecommunications</b> <b>networks.</b> It was also politically and morally important to France, both during the German occupation and for decades afterward, because it provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative, countering an existential threat to French nationhood.
