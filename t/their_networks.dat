5|$|Before its takeover, the DR {{had carried}} out some joint {{electrification}} experiments with the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the other sub-surface line {{with which the}} DR shared the Inner Circle. A section of track between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington was electrified with a four-rail system and a jointly owned test train operated a shuttle service between February and November 1900. Having proven the practicality of electric traction, the two companies set up a joint committee to select a supplier of equipment for the electrification of <b>their</b> <b>networks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Henry VI {{proved to}} be a weak king and {{vulnerable}} to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontations, such as the Percy–Neville feud. Without the common purpose of the war in France, Henry's cousin Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used <b>their</b> <b>networks</b> to defy the crown. Henry became the focus of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, Jack Cade raised a rebellion to force Henry to address the economic problems or abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the yeoman brothers John and William Merfold.|$|E

The purchase of Transwede was confirmed on 25 June; Braathens SAFE bought 50% of the company's scheduled division, Transwede Airways, with an option to purchase the rest in 1997. The companies planned to integrate <b>their</b> <b>networks,</b> to allow connection between Braathens SAFE's and Transwede flights at Stockholm. Services to Stockholm started on 6 November; after three months, the airline had captured 14% of the Oslo–Stockholm market.

25|$|Britain had {{the first}} European trams, and until 1935 a large and {{comprehensive}} network of systems. For example, {{it was possible to}} go by tram across northwest England, from Liverpool to Ashton-under-Lyne (approx. 43 miles) using connecting systems. Most of the UK systems were municipally owned. These had often been inherited from private sector operators, who had been granted limited-term leases and did not maintain <b>their</b> <b>networks</b> beyond bare necessities as the time for a forced handover approached. When councils acquired these dilapidated systems, it was almost always cheaper to replace them with buses.|$|E
25|$|Such Southern {{hostility to}} the free farmers gave the North an {{opportunity}} for an alliance with Western farmers. After the political realignments of 1857–58—manifested by the emerging strength of the Republican Party and <b>their</b> <b>networks</b> of local support nationwide—almost every issue was entangled with {{the controversy over the}} expansion of slavery in the West. While questions of tariffs, banking policy, public land, and subsidies to railroads did not always unite all elements in the North and the Northwest against the interests of slaveholders in the South under the pre-1854 party system, they were translated in terms of sectional conflict—with the expansion of slavery in the West involved.|$|E
25|$|Telecommunications {{equipment}} providers, {{convinced that}} the future economy would require ubiquitous broadband access, went deeply into debt to improve <b>their</b> <b>networks</b> with high-speed equipment and fiber optic cables.

Large quantities of high-speed fiber links were laid, and the State and local governments gave tax exemptions to technology firms. Office vacancy increased significantly after the bubble burst, although the area still remains a major technology hub.|$|E
