50|$|A prior, a <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple, covenanted {{with the}} Lord of the Manor {{that he and}} his convent would sing for mass each week in the manor chapel. The {{plaintiff}} was the covenantee's successor, a tenant in tail. He sued to enforce the covenant.|$|E
50|$|Substitute of wills: Before the Statute of Wills 1540, a <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple {{could not}} devise the {{interest}} in the land by a will at common law. Upon his death the land devolved upon his eldest son or, if he died without leaving an heir, the land would escheat to his overlord. The use could avoid these difficulties by allowing the tenant to convey his land to a friend, on the understanding that the friend would permit the grantor, and, after the grantor's death, the grantor's designated persons (beneficiaries or cestuis que use) to have the full benefit and enjoyment of the land.|$|E
5000|$|In all {{of these}} ways, the allod {{differed}} from fiefs, which were mere tenures held by feudatories (Lehnsmänner) or their vassals (Vasallen). Overall suzerainty in a fief remained with the feudal lord, who could require of his vassals certain services which varied from vassal to vassal. Also, the ownership of a fief was split so that a lord had dominium directum and his <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> had dominium utile (German nutzbares Eigentum). By contrast, an allodiary had a full freehold interest — or dominium plenum (volles Eigentum) — in his allod. This was also reflected in the contemporaneous synonym for an allod, Erbe und Eigen (loosely [...] "inheritance and ownership"). Borough properties were usually allodial in nature. Likewise, ecclesiastical institutions (e.g. abbeys and cathedrals) owned allodial estates.|$|E
50|$|Casu proviso was a writ of entry, {{given by}} the Statute of Gloucester, in cases where a <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> dowry {{transfers}} property to another <b>in</b> <b>fee,</b> or for term of life, or in tail. The writ lies for him in reversion against the transfer.|$|R
5000|$|First of all, he {{describes}} the characteristics of tenancy <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple. <b>In</b> Littleton's time and until the present day, {{it was the largest}} interest in land known to the law. Next in order comes tenancy <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> tail, the various classes of which are sketched by Littleton with brevity and accuracy; but he is silent as to the important practice, which first received judicial recognition shortly before his death, of [...] "suffering a recovery", whereby, through a series of judicial fictions, a <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> tail was enabled to convert his estate tail into a fee simple, thus acquiring full power of alienation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} Statute Quia Emptores is obvious. By declaring that every freeman might sell his lands {{at his own}} pleasure, it removed the feudal {{restraint}} which prevented the tenant from selling his land without the license of his grantor, who was his feudal lord. Hence {{by virtue of the}} Statute, passed in 1290, subinfeudation was abolished and all persons except the King's <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> capite were left at liberty to alien all or any part of their lands at their own pleasure and discretion. Quia Emptores is by express wording, extended only to the lands held <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple. Included <b>in</b> its applications, however are leases <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> and <b>fee</b> farmlands. Property <b>in</b> the U. S., with few exceptions, is allodial. This is by virtue of state constitutional provisions, organic territorial acts incorporated into legal systems of states subsequently organized, statutes and decisions of the courts. They are subject to escheat only in the event of failure of successors in ownership.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} vigor of the feudal system, a <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> could not {{alienate}} the feud {{without the consent}} of the immediate superior; but this extreme rigor was soon afterward relaxed, and it was avoided by the practice of subinfeudation, which consisted in the tenant enfeoffing another to hold of himself by the fealty and such services as might be reserved by the act of feoffment. Thus, a new tenure was created upon every alienation; and thus there arose a series of lords of the same lands, the first called the [...] "chief lord" [...] holding immediately of the sovereign, the next grade holding of them, and so on, each alienation creating another lord and another tenant. This practice was considered detrimental to the great lords, since it deprived them to a certain extent the fruits of their tenure, such as escheats, marriages, wardships and the like.|$|E
50|$|A {{document}} dated 30 Jan 1747 records six men aged over 16 {{who lived}} in the village of Kilmuir (Kilmuire), in the parish of Kilmuir-Easter, Ross-shire who did not take part in the Jacobite rising of 1745, even though they lived on the Jacobite Lord Cromartie's estate. They were: James Munro, <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> Kilmuire; Andrew Roy, <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> Kilmuire; John Mackenzie, <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> Kilmuire; Walter?Mailevin, <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> Kilmuire; Alexander Munro, Wright in Kilmuire; David Munro, his brother.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tenants</b> <b>in</b> common have {{no right}} of survivorship, meaning that if one <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> common dies, that <b>tenant's</b> {{interest}} <b>in</b> the property {{will be part of}} his or her estate and pass by inheritance to that owner's devisees or heirs, either by will, or by intestate succession. Also, as each <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> common has an interest in the property, they may, {{in the absence of any}} restriction agreed to between all the <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common, sell or otherwise deal with the interest in the property (e.g. mortgage it) during their lifetime, like any other property interest.|$|R
2500|$|The city's {{management}} agreement {{came to an}} end in 2003. [...] City managers {{argued that}} they should be allowed to renew the contract. The city proposed using its own funds to renovate the arena, and {{to begin the process of}} planning for a new, greatly expanded multi-purpose convention center and sports arena. As a gesture of good faith, Great Falls city commissioners said they had spent $6,000 to study the ice rink covering issue and $2,000 on a handicapped-accessibility study, and had agreed to spend $200,000 to purchase the ice rink covering. The purchased was designed to meet the needs of local youth hockey organizations, which in 2002 were the arena's largest <b>tenant</b> (paying $65,000 <b>in</b> <b>fees</b> <b>in</b> 2002 and an anticipated $85,000 <b>in</b> <b>fees</b> <b>in</b> 2003). But it was also designed to expand the facility's use, and reduce the city's subsidy to the fairgrounds. [...] Four Seasons managers noted that the arena had to turn away bands, comedians, and other entertainers because the venue could not be turned around fast enough. Cascade County managers, however, argued that although the county did not have the credit rating or tax revenues of the city, they could obtain grants to make the improvements the city was to pay for. They also said that their lack of management expertise did not matter, as they were considering contracting with SMG World, an arena management firm, to run Four Seasons. In October 2002, SMG said it needed more time to assess the fairgrounds in order to make a firm offer. With Cascade County apparently committed to taking over the fairgrounds and Four Seasons Arena again, the city of Great Falls demanded that the county to pay $1 million to reimburse the city for improvements made there (a figure which included $142,250 renovating the heating, air conditioning, and carpeting at the arena). The county refused, and offered to pay less than 20% of that figure. After extensive negotiations, Cascade County agreed to pay $384,370 over 10 years at 4% interest (a total which included all of the improvements to the arena). On November 12, 2002, Cascade County signed a formal agreement to allow SMG World to take over management of the fairgrounds and arena.|$|R
50|$|George Greswolde died in 1612, and was {{succeeded by}} his brother Humphrey. He died in 1660, and was succeeded in turn by his two sons Humphrey, who died in 1671, and Henry, who died in 1700, leaving four sons. These were: Humphrey who died {{unmarried}} in 1712, Henry who left a daughter Anne, Marshal and John. In 1776, Henry Greswolde Lewis, held a third. The other two thirds were held, in 1784, by William Richard Wilson and Jane Anne Eleanor, his wife, who appear to have given up their share to Henry Greswolde Lewis. He was succeeded in 1829 by his , Edmund Meysey Wigley, who assumed the name Greswolde and died unmarried in 1833. On his death, Henry Wigley, who also assumed the name Greswolde, became tenant for life under the will of Henry Greswolde Lewis, {{and he and his}} son, Edmund Greswolde, who was <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> line, barred the estate in tail and conveyed the estates to the use of Henry Greswolde for life, with remainder to Edmund Greswolde <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple.

50|$|In law, a {{base fee}} is a {{freehold}} {{estate of inheritance}} which is limited or qualified by the existence of certain conditions. In modern property law the commonest example of a base fee is an estate created by a <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> tail, not in possession, who bars the entail without the consent of the protector of the settlement. Any attempt to bar the entail without the consent of the Protector would only be partially successful. Though he bars his own issue (the rights of the future <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> tail), he cannot bar any remainder or reversion, and the estate (i.e. the base fee) thus created is determinable on the failure of his issue in tail. The base fee can be defined as rights that would last {{for as long as the}} fee tail would have lasted, but which will end when the line of descent stipulated <b>in</b> the <b>fee</b> tail ran out.|$|R

40|$|The term 2 ̆ 2 {{partnership}} estates 2 ̆ 2 is used {{to designate}} a certain class of resulting trusts. These particular resulting trusts are classed with joint estates because, as a usual thing, the legal title is held by {{all the members of}} a partnership as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common, and in equity, the partners are considered as joint tenants for the purpose of administering the trust. But the legal title is not necessarily held by all the members as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common; for it may be vested in one of the partners as <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> severalty; in which case there is not only the resulting partnership trust, but an additional subordinate resulting trust to the partners as equitable <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common. The legal title may be in one or in several. As will be shown, the partners bear a two-fold relation to the beneficial interest in the property; for each has a separate and distinct lien on the property for any balance which may be found to be due him on an accounting; and as to this lien, his interest is purely potential: the balance on an accounting having been paid, the partners now own the residue of the beneficial interest as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common...|$|R
