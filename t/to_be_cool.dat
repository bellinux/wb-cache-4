5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof {{said that}} the videos {{originated}} from {{the question of the}} film's status as an Alien prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the Alien films. He also {{said that the}} videos needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.|$|E
5|$|Thrasher and Blastus are {{two teenage}} robots {{who live on}} the planet of Insanus. Their planet is {{inhabited}} by murderous robots who seek to kill one another for no apparent reason. Slightly less horrific than their peers, the duo seek to make it through high school, and navigate their lives with mixed results. Thrasher (Patton Oswalt), a tall and lanky robot, wishes to gain the affections of an attractive female robot named Maimy (Jessie Cantrell). Meanwhile, Blastus (John Gemberling), a small and rotund robot, just wants to be popular. As with Blastus, unlike most robots on Insanus, he is mostly sensitive and non-criminal, much to the disapproval of his mother. In his quest <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool,</b> however, he is incredibly impulsive and overconfident in his abilities. Thrasher, though calm and reserved, often falls prey to Blastus' badly-thought out plans.|$|E

25|$|According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, {{such that}} coolness {{is in the}} eye of the beholder. People {{perceive}} things (e.g., other people, products or brands) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something is perceived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> or hip meant hanging out, {{pursuing}} sexual liaisons, {{displaying the}} appropriate attitude of narcissistic self-absorption, and expressing {{a desire to}} escape the mental straitjacket of all ideological causes. From the late 1940s onward, this popular culture influenced young {{people all over the}} world, to the great dismay of the paternalistic elites who still ruled the official culture. The French intelligentsia were outraged, while the British educated classes displayed a haughty indifference that smacked of an older aristocratic cool.|$|E
25|$|In {{distinction}} to {{the emotional}} energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, the Color Field painters initially appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists {{considered to be the}} essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s Frank Stella in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural Abstract expressionism.|$|E

25|$|All {{the shelters}} are adapted {{to suit the}} local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are {{versatile}} enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperaturs of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A berber tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle – {{and because of the}} climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.|$|E

50|$|Recuperative multi-tube coolers {{work with}} {{indirect}} air cooling. That means, {{that there is}} no direct contact between the product <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cooled</b> and the cooling air. The heat is exchanged indirectly via thermal conduction.Ambient air <b>is</b> used as <b>cooling</b> air, which <b>is</b> drawn between the jacket and the tubes. Product and cooling air pass through the cooler in counterflow. The product <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cooled</b> falls directly into the product feed housing. By the rotary movement and a little slope of the rotor, the product is conveyed through the cooler. The rotation causes a permanent mixing of the product in the tubes and hence a good heat transfer.|$|R

As the rocket ascends, Doofenshmirtz is himself cursing Perry, as usual, but pauses to notice Love Handel singing below. The band finish their song just as Doofenshmirtz's rocket explodes with a heart-shaped flare. The episode ends with Love Handel singing [...] "Music Makes Us Better" [...] and with everyone (including Doofenshmirtz, who has survived the explosion unscathed) dancing.|$|E
500|$|The single [...] "The Wire" [...] was {{released}} on July 29 and the album followed on September 30. The album reached {{number one in the}} UK and has since sold 200,000 copies there. To promote the album, the group performed [...] "The Wire" [...] on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, with Este dedicating the song to the British Prime Minister David Cameron, also a guest on the show. The move was criticised as being ill-judged by Johnny Marr, who stated that “It’s really simple: they made themselves look like idiots. It’s ridiculous. No-one put a gun to their head. The Conservatives tried {{to do the same thing}} with The Smiths, to re-appropriate us in a false way, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> by association.” Haim did not respond.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Kirchherr and her art school friends were {{involved}} in the European existentialist movement whose followers were later nicknamed [...] "Exis" [...] by Lennon. In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool,</b> as we call it now." ...|$|E

500|$|Matthews {{said that}} they did not have any {{particular}} influences in their music. However, she said that her family had always been singing along to BBC Radio 2. She held the ambition to have the band appear on Radio 2, as due to poor levels of radio reception in Wales they had been unable to listen to other stations. She attributed the style of Welsh music as never attempting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> as they wouldn't have been aware of what was in fashion at the time. Catatonia frequently used metaphors in their songwriting, such as [...] "Road Rage" [...] which references emotional anger. The line [...] "If it turns to blue, what are we going to do?" [...] in the single [...] "You've Got A Lot To Answer For" [...] from Way Beyond Blue references a pregnancy test. Other works from International Velvet were compared to poetry by Katharine Viner in The Guardian.|$|E
500|$|Selman commented in {{an audio}} {{commentary}} for [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] that [...] "the {{thing that really}} got the [...] writers excited about the episode was this very specific version of future Bart."

[...] The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully also noted that future Bart is {{the kind of person who}} is [...] "always waiting for some big sort of cash payoff that he feels he's owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that's gonna come sooner or later." [...] Greaney said that everyone in the writing room recognized these traits from people they knew and therefore everyone contributed to the episode by suggesting lines for Bart to say and things for him to do.|$|E

500|$|The {{next morning}} at about 6:00am Virginia, {{accompanied}} by , [...] and , got underway from Sewell's Point to finish off Minnesota {{and the rest of}} the blockaders, but were delayed sailing out into Hampton Roads because of heavy fog until about 8:00am. In Monitor Worden was already at his station in the pilot house while Greene took command of the turret. Samuel Howard, Acting Master of Minnesota, who was familiar with Hampton Roads with its varying depths and shallow areas, had volunteered to be the pilot the night before and thus was accepted, while Quarter Master Peter Williams steered the vessel throughout the battle (Williams was later awarded the Medal of Honor for this act). The speaking tube used to communicate between the pilothouse and the turret had broken early in the action so Keeler and captain's clerk Daniel Toffey had to relay commands from Worden to Greene. As Virginia was approaching she began firing at Minnesota from more than a mile away, a few of her shells hitting the vessel. When the firing was heard in the distance, Greene sent paymaster Keeler to the pilot house for permission to open fire as soon as possible where Worden ordered, [...] "Tell Mr. Green not to fire till I give the word, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>cool</b> and deliberate, to take sure aim and not waste a shot." ...|$|E
