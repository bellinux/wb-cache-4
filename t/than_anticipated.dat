5|$|Heavy {{damage was}} {{reported}} in Jamaica. Upon making landfall in Florida, the hurricane produced a 7ft (2m) storm tide, and in Georgia, hurricane-force winds extended into the southwestern portion of the state, while tropical storm force winds occurred along the coastline. In the state, moderate winds damaged trees and roofs, though the destruction was less <b>than</b> <b>anticipated.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1940, the German {{government}} began to liquidate Jewish businesses. Some {{were transferred to}} German ownership in a process termed Aryanization. Some 6,300 Jewish-owned businesses were liquidated before 1942, and 600 were Aryanized. Around 600 million Belgian francs was raised from the seizures, much less <b>than</b> <b>anticipated.</b>|$|E

5|$|The harbour {{cost more}} <b>than</b> <b>anticipated</b> and high rates were levied to repay loans, {{reducing}} any benefit the new harbour had at drawing companies back from Liverpool. In 1848 {{the city council}} bought the docks company to force down the rates. They employed Isambard Kingdom Brunel to make improvements, including new lock gates, a dredger and sluice gates designed to reduce siltation.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen horses {{entered the}} Derby, {{which could have}} at most twenty participants. Horse owners had to pay a final entry fee of $2,500 to have their horses officially entered. The field was larger <b>than</b> <b>anticipated</b> because of new entries {{following}} Secretariat's loss at the Wood Memorial Stakes in New York.|$|E
5|$|As Buxton's trade {{fell into}} decline {{he tried to}} survive by working as a botanical {{collector}} and delivering newspapers, but eventually {{had to rely on}} a fund set up by Binney for ‘the relief and encouragement of scientific men in humble life’. This situation was compounded when the proceeds from the second edition of his book, published in 1859, were less <b>than</b> <b>anticipated</b> because of competition from Grindon's Manchester Flora published in the same year.|$|E
5000|$|Anticipating the {{possibility}} of regret tends to lead consumers to buy a product that is on [...] "sale" [...] now {{instead of waiting for}} a better [...] "sale" [...] later, and to choose a well-known, expensive brand over a lesser-known, less expensive brand. When making risky choices, anticipating regret leads to the opposite effect <b>than</b> <b>anticipating</b> responsibility or blame.|$|R

5|$|California Chrome {{returned}} to Los Alamitos, where Sherman's crew treated the wound for about 10 days. After that, they sent California Chrome to Harris Farms {{where he was}} turned out on pasture. By early July, his foot was fully healed, he had gained weight, and Sherman was pleased enough with his recovery that he brought the colt back to Los Alamitos to resume training on July 17, two weeks earlier <b>than</b> <b>anticipated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load <b>than</b> <b>anticipated</b> and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve {{buoyancy}} and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E
5|$|Following Toronto's first-round exit, McGrady {{became a}} free agent, signing a six-year, $67.5 million {{contract}} with the Orlando Magic. He elected to join the Magic {{in part because he}} disliked his secondary role playing behind Vince Carter, in part so that he could return home to Florida, and in part to play with their other newly acquired free agent, Grant Hill. Hill would go on to play in only 47 games total throughout his tenure with the team, forcing McGrady into a larger leadership and scoring role <b>than</b> <b>anticipated.</b>|$|E
2500|$|McCain {{is against}} {{government}} regulation of network neutrality unless evidence of abuse exists. He {{is quoted as}} saying, [...] "let's see how this thing all turns out, rather <b>than</b> <b>anticipate</b> a problem that so far has not arisen in any significant way." [...] Until such a time, he supports allowing network owners to control what sites consumers view, saying, in May 2007, [...] "When you control the pipe {{you should be able}} to get profit from your investment".|$|R

40|$|Until now, {{wind turbine}} {{controls}} that reduce {{the impacts of}} wind gusts and turbulence were always reactive - responding to the wind rather <b>than</b> <b>anticipating</b> it. But with today's laser-based sensors that measure wind speed ahead of the turbine, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and their industry partners are developing more intelligent controls. The world's first field tests of these controls are currently underway at the National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) at NREL, with plans for future commercialization...|$|R
5|$|However, {{much of the}} {{currently}} information regarding the smoking habits of North Koreans is obtained by studying North Korean defectors who now live in the South {{and may not be}} totally representative of the true picture. One study of defectors found that smoking is even more common <b>than</b> <b>anticipated,</b> but nicotine dependence was not as severe as predicted. Defectors are reported as often being very interested in quitting smoking.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, several oil {{facilities}} were closed or placed on automatic controls. Drilling rigs as far east as the coastal waters off of Mississippi {{were prepared to}} evacuate in the event Edith moved further east <b>than</b> <b>anticipated.</b> Additionally, thousands evacuated coastal areas of Louisiana prior {{to the arrival of}} the hurricane. Several shelters opened in coastal cities, and many people prepared for the hurricane by purchasing emergency supplies. Officials closed schools throughout much of southern Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area, but {{the initial}} {{operations}} in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction to Task One, the seizure of {{the southern part of}} the Solomon Islands, was more violent <b>than</b> <b>anticipated</b> and some months passed before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track campaign, Battle of Milne Bay, Battle of Buna–Gona, the Battle of Wau and the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.|$|E

5|$|Syrian {{government}} forces supported by Russian airstrikes recaptured Palmyra on 27 March 2016 after intense fighting against ISIL fighters. According to initial reports, {{the damage to}} the archaeological site was less extensive <b>than</b> <b>anticipated,</b> with numerous structures still standing. Following the recapture of the city, Russian de-mining teams began clearing mines planted by ISIL prior to their retreat. Following heavy fighting, ISIL reportedly reoccupied the city on 11 December 2016, prompting an offensive by the Syrian Army which retook the city on 2 March 2017.|$|E
5|$|The task {{groups were}} forced to stay within enemy air range longer <b>than</b> <b>anticipated</b> due to Canberra situation. Early morning fighter sweeps were {{launched}} to suppress air power on Luzon and Formosa while the newly formed task group attempted to escort Canberra to safety. Some air groups encountered Japanese planes in the strike zones, but no major air-to-air combat developed. Throughout the afternoon, enemy aircraft flew to {{the perimeter of the}} task groups to relay sighting reports.|$|E
5|$|The true {{impact of}} Operation Mincemeat is unknown, {{although}} {{the island was}} liberated more quickly <b>than</b> <b>anticipated</b> and losses were lower than predicted. The events were depicted in Operation Heartbreak, a 1950 novel by the former cabinet minister Duff Cooper, before one of the agents who planned and carried out Mincemeat, Ewen Montagu, wrote a history in 1953. Montagu's work {{formed the basis for}} a 1956 film.|$|E

5|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{the number of}} men that joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower <b>than</b> <b>anticipated,</b> a large number of such personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|CSU updated their {{forecast}} on June 1 {{to include}} 14 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes to include Tropical Storm Bonnie. It was again updated on July 1 to include 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes, to accommodate for tropical storms Colin and Danielle. On July 5, TSR released their fourth forecast for the season, slightly lowering the predicted numbers to 16 tropical storms, 8 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. On August 5, TSR released their final forecast for the season, lowering {{the numbers to}} 15 named storms and 7 hurricanes due to the influence that La Niña being less <b>than</b> <b>anticipated</b> previously. NOAA updated their forecast on August11, increasing the their predictions to 12–17 named storms, 5–8 hurricanes, and 2–4 major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{predictions}} for heavy rainfall {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean, the hurricane's movement was more northerly than expected, resulting in less precipitation along the Central American coast <b>than</b> <b>anticipated.</b> In its early developmental stages, Hattie struck San Andrés Island, located offshore eastern Nicaragua, with maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and gusts of 104mph (167km/h). As the hurricane neared the island, the airport was closed due to tropical-storm-force winds. Rough seas and winds damaged private property and two hotels. Many palm tree plantations were devastated. The schooner Admirar, anchored {{in one of the}} island's bays, capsized during the storm. Overall, Hattie resulted in one death, fifteen injuries, and $300,000 in damage (1961USD) in San Andrés. The hurricane was the fourth on record to strike the island, and of the four was the only to approach from the south.|$|E

Rather <b>than</b> <b>anticipate</b> the Japanese by attacking across the Chindwin, or trying to defend the line of the river itself, Slim intended to exploit the known Japanese logistical weaknesses by withdrawing into Imphal to fight a defensive battle where the Japanese would be unable to supply their troops.|$|R
