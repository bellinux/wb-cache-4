60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 9th, inclosing {{the letter}} of HON. John Minor Botts, was duly received. The latter is {{herewith}} returned according to your request. It contains {{one of the many}} assurances I receive from the South, that in no probable event will there be any very formidable effort to break up the Union. The people of the South have too much of good sense and good temper to attempt the ruin of the government rather than see it administered as it was administered by the men who made it. At least so I hope and believe. I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>both</b> for your own letter and a sight of that of Mr. Botts.|$|E

As for John Dormay, 'tis the best thing that could have happened. I have often thought it over, while you have been away, and have said to myself that the best settlement of the business would be that you, Harry, when you obtained proofs, should go down, confront him publicly, and charge him with his treachery, force him to draw, and then run him through the body. Charlie would, of course, have been the proper person, in my absence, so to settle the matter, but he could not well have killed my cousin's husband, and it would have added to the scandal.|$|E

I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>both,</b> gentlemen, for {{the speed with which}} you have brought me this welcome news, and for the services of which the Duke of Albemarle speaks so warmly. This is the second time, Sir Cyril, that my admirals have had occasion to speak of great and honourable service rendered by you. Lord Oliphant, the Earl, your father, will have reason to be proud when he hears you so highly praised.

6000|$|Perhaps {{there was}} no one present except Mr. Irwine who {{thoroughly}} understood and approved Arthur's graceful mode of proposing his grandfather's health. The farmers thought the young squire knew well enough that they hated the old squire, and Mrs. Poyser said, [...] "he'd better not ha' stirred a kettle o' sour broth." [...] The bucolic mind does not readily apprehend the refinements of good taste. But the toast could not be rejected and when it had been drunk, Arthur said, [...] "I <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> <b>both</b> for my grandfather and myself; and now there is one more thing I wish to tell you, that you may share my pleasure about it, as I hope and believe you will. I think there can be no man here who has not a respect, and some of you, I am sure, have a very high regard, for my friend Adam Bede. It is well known to every one in this neighbourhood that there is no man whose word can be more depended on than his; that whatever he undertakes to do, he does well, and is as careful for the interests of those who employ him as for his own. I'm proud to say that I was very fond of Adam when I was a little boy, and I have never lost my old feeling for him--I think that shows that I know a good fellow when I find him. It has long been my wish that he should have the management of the woods on the estate, which happen to be very valuable, not only because I think so highly of his character, but because he has the knowledge and the skill which fit him for the place. And I am happy to tell you that it is my grandfather's wish too, and it is now settled that Adam shall manage the woods--a change which I am sure will be very much for the advantage of the estate; and I hope you will by and by join me in drinking his health, and in wishing him all the prosperity in life that he deserves. But there is a still older friend of mine than Adam Bede present, and I need not tell you that it is Mr. Irwine. I'm sure you will agree with me that we must drink no other person's health until we have drunk his. I know you have all reason to love him, but no one of his parishioners has so much reason as I. Come, charge your glasses, and let us drink to our excellent rector--three times three!" ...|$|E

Fortunately, this Graduate Management Project gives me the perfect opportunity to thank not only those directly linked to its development, but also those individuals who have played an instrumental part of my life. First and foremost, I would like to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. My life has been one continual blessing. To my wife, Dana: you are my guiding light.

40|$|I {{would like}} to first express my {{appreciation}} and gratitude towards my advisor and dissertation chair, Dr. Harold Delaney. Not only was he readily available for any and all of my questions, but also his dedication {{to the education of}} both undergraduate and graduate students alike is simply remarkable and shines through every interaction I have ever had with him. His expertise and knowledge has been invaluable in my journey through graduate school, and through life. I {{would like to}} thank Dr. Brian Kersh for allowing me the opportunity of working on the study at the New Mexico Veterans Affairs Healthcare System that then led to this dissertation project. I also appreciate the valuable clinical knowledge he imparted to me in working with veterans. His therapeutic style and warmth are certainly goals to aspire to in my clinical career. Acknowledgements would not be complete for me without honoring my family, friends, and faith.
