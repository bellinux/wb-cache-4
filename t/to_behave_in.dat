5|$|Creatures of Impulse is a stage {{play by the}} English dramatist W. S. Gilbert, {{with music}} by the composer-conductor Alberto Randegger, which Gilbert adapted from his own short story. Both the play and the short story concern an {{unwanted}} and ill-tempered old fairy who enchants people <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> a manner opposite to their natures, with farcical results.|$|E
5|$|Edmund was not {{particularly}} popular while he was alive, nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this. His household was also said <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> a way that caused popular resentment, taking provisions as they passed through the countryside while offering little compensation. At the same time, it has been pointed out that Edmund showed {{a great deal of}} loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E

The {{men on the}} other side of the attack pleaded guilty to affray and recklessly causing injury to Robinson, and were sentenced to 300 hours' community service.|$|R

5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels <b>to</b> <b>behave)</b> <b>in</b> imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{complications}} {{arise from}} these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides {{that if he}} must give out money, the sergeant {{is as good as}} any other. The shy Pipette throws herself at Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced to get into a fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert {{wrote the}} Dialogus ecclesiasticae institutionis, {{which was a}} legal code for the clergy, setting forth the proper {{procedures}} for many clerical and ecclesiastical issues including weregild for clerics, entrance to clerical orders, deposition from the clergy, criminal monks, clerics in court, and other matters. It survives as one complete manuscript, with a few excerpts in other manuscripts. Because Ecgbert was the senior archbishop in England {{after the death of}} Nothhelm in 739, {{it is possible that the}} Dialogus was intended not just for the Northumbrian church but for the entire church in England. The Dialogus details a code of conduct for the clergy and how the clergy was <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> society. The exact date it was composed is unclear, but it was probably after 735, based on the mention of the archiepiscopal status of Ecgbert in one title as well as the internal evidence of the work. The historian Simon Coates saw the Dialogus as not especially exalting monks above the laity.|$|E

5|$|Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel)—Rachel's {{biological}} mother, {{the adoptive}} mother of Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Puck's daughter Beth, {{and the former}} coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline—is headhunted to coach a second glee club at McKinley High financed by Sugar Motta's (Vanessa Lengies) wealthy and doting father. Shelby reaches out to Rachel, Puck and Quinn. She lets Puck see Beth, but rejects Quinn's desire to do likewise due to Quinn's bad-girl attitude, appearance and behavior. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), {{who is running for}} Congress, convinces Quinn to feature in an anti-arts video for her campaign. In it, Quinn confronts Will and blames him for her transformation into a bad girl, but Will reprimands her, reminds her of how the glee club and its members have always supported her in the past and tells her to grow up. After seeing a picture of a happy Beth and Puck, Quinn breaks down. She resumes her normal appearance, and Will and the New Directions welcome her back into the club. Puck tells Quinn he is proud of her, but Quinn reveals she is only pretending <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> order to take Beth back from Shelby, and intends to pursue full custody.|$|E
5|$|Variety and realism were focuses for the tracks: they {{featured}} visuals such as forests, Neon Cities, and Canyons, {{complete with}} obstacles. The team travelled {{to photograph the}} textures. The tracks were constructed in Softimage 3D and converted to PlayStation format mesh data using a custom tool. In response to a common criticism of the original Destruction Derby, the tracks were designed to be larger and less narrow. The team were inspired by Daytonas revolving windmills, and large jumps were implemented to add drama to the tracks. The most realistic aspect of the race tracks was the pit stop, although Edmondson stated that he limited players to one stop because the team {{did not want to}} detract from the action and because a penalty system would have added a lot of extra work. Cars nearing destruction were designed <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> a realistic and unpredicatable fashion through effects such as losing the bonnet (hood) and catching on fire.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{objective}} of obedience trials, however, {{is to recognize}} dogs that have been trained <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> the home, in public places, and {{in the presence of}} other dogs, in a manner that will reflect credit on the sport of obedience at all times and under all conditions.|$|E

25|$|As far as {{behavior}} is concerned, randomness is important if an animal is <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> {{a way that}} is unpredictable to others. For instance, insects in flight tend to move about with random changes in direction, making it difficult for pursuing predators to predict their trajectories.|$|E
25|$|Such {{coevolution}} {{does not}} imply that the ants and the tree choose <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> an altruistic manner. Rather, across a population small genetic changes in both ant and tree benefited each. The benefit gave a slightly higher chance of the characteristic being passed on to the next generation. Over time, successive mutations created the relationship we observe today.|$|E
25|$|Social psychologists {{therefore}} {{deal with}} the factors that lead us <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> a given way {{in the presence of}} others, and look at the conditions under which certain behavior/actions and feelings occur. Social psychology is concerned with the way these feelings, thoughts, beliefs, intentions and goals are constructed and how such psychological factors, in turn, influence our interactions with others.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} parts of pubertal development involve distinctive physiological changes in individuals' height, weight, body composition, and circulatory and respiratory systems. These changes are largely influenced by hormonal activity. Hormones play an organizational role, priming the body <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> a certain way once puberty begins, and an active role, referring to changes in hormones during adolescence that trigger behavioral and physical changes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{families}} {{believe that}} all personal or familial issues should be kept within the home. The Hispanic culture values modesty for all individuals including males and children in addition to females who historically, are expected <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> a modest fashion. Family members that suffer from mental illnesses are reluctant to inform their family members of this information in fear that their family members will criticize them.|$|E

25|$|Areas of {{the brain}} {{responsible}} for planning and motor learning are sharpened. A related effect, caused by even low levels of alcohol, is the tendency for people to become more animated in speech and movement. This is due to increased metabolism in areas {{of the brain}} associated with movement, such as the nigrostriatal pathway. This causes reward systems in the brain to become more active, which may induce certain individuals <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> an uncharacteristically loud and cheerful manner.|$|E
25|$|Control {{engineering}} {{focuses on the}} modeling of a diverse range of dynamic systems and the design of controllers that will cause these systems <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> the desired manner. To implement such controllers, electrical engineers may use electronic circuits, digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and programmable logic controls (PLCs). Control engineering has {{a wide range of}} applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airliners to the cruise control present in many modern automobiles. It also {{plays an important role in}} industrial automation.|$|E
25|$|A {{drive or}} desire can be {{described}} as a deficiency or need that activates behavior that is aimed at a goal or an incentive. These drives are thought to originate within the individual and may not require external stimuli to encourage the behavior. Basic drives could be sparked by deficiencies such as hunger, which motivates a person to seek food whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person <b>to</b> <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> a manner pleasing to others.|$|E
40|$|To be able {{to build}} systems by {{composing}} a variety of components dynamically, adding and removing as required, is desirable. Unfortunately systems with evolving architectures are prone <b>to</b> <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> a surprising manner. In this paper we show how it is possible to generate a snapshot of the structure of a running application, and how this can be combined with behavioural specifications for components to check compatability and adherence to system properties. By modelling both the structure and the behaviour, before altering an existing system, we show how dynamic compositional systems may be put together in a predictable manner...|$|R
50|$|An {{aggregate}} {{pattern is}} an important statistical concept in many fields that rely on statistics to predict the behavior of large groups, based on the tendencies of subgroups <b>to</b> consistently <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> a certain way.
