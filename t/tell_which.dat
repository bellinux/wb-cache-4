5|$|Most of the city's monumental {{projects}} were {{built on the}} wadi's northern bank. Among them is the Temple of Bel, on a <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> {{was the site of}} an earlier temple (known as the Hellenistic temple). However, excavation supports the theory that the tell was originally located on the southern bank, and the wadi was diverted south of the tell to incorporate the temple into Palmyra's late first and early second century urban organization on the north bank.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 31 March 1800 was a naval {{engagement}} of the French Revolutionary Wars fought between a Royal Navy squadron and a French Navy ship {{of the line}} off Malta in the Mediterranean Sea. By March 1800 Valletta, the Maltese capital, had been under siege for eighteen months and food supplies were severely depleted, a problem exacerbated by the interception and defeat of a French replenishment convoy in mid-February. In an effort to simultaneously obtain help from France and {{reduce the number of}} personnel maintained in the city, the naval commander on the island, Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, ordered his subordinate Contre-amiral Denis Decrès to put to sea with the large ship of the line Guillaume <b>Tell,</b> <b>which</b> had arrived in the port shortly before the siege began in September 1798. Over 900 men were carried aboard the ship, which was to sail for Toulon under cover of darkness on 30 March.|$|E
5|$|Toriyama was {{commissioned}} {{to illustrate the}} characters and monsters for the first Dragon Quest video game (1986) in order to separate it from other role-playing games of the time. He has since worked on every title in the series. For each game Yuji Horii first sends rough sketches of the characters with their background information to Toriyama, who then re-draws them. Lastly, Horii approves the finished work. Toriyama explained in 1995 that for video games, because the sprites are so small, {{as long as they}} have a distinguishing feature so people can <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> character it is, he can make complex designs without concern of having to reproduce it like he usually would in manga. Besides the character and monster designs, Toriyama also does the games' packaging art and, for , the boats and ships. The series' Slime character, which has become a sort of mascot for the franchise, is considered to be one of the most recognizable figures in gaming.|$|E

25|$|Lucero was {{designed}} so its transmission would be triggered {{more rapidly than}} the radar's magnetron. This allowed it to send its signal and begin receiving the reply during {{the time when the}} main radar pulse was in-flight. This meant that the line segments began at a point indicating closer range than the aircraft sending the response, and ended after it. The radar operator could thus <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> aircraft was sending the IFF responses by looking for blips roughly centred along the line segments.|$|E
25|$|The {{result is}} a display similar to CH, showing the range to targets within view, but {{with each of the}} targets {{producing}} two closely spaced blips. By comparing the length of the blips, the operator can <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> antenna is more directly pointed at the target. By rotating the antennas towards the stronger signal, the longer blip, the target will be centered and the two blips will become equal length. Even with the relatively long wavelengths used, accuracies on the order of ½ a degree could be attained with these lobe switching systems.|$|E

25|$|Archeologists {{from the}} University of Arkansas have {{determined}} {{the first people}} to occupy the area were Bluff Dwellers or Rock Shelter Indians.

They also note that for each period of time there was a vast improvement in their relics. During this time several families lived together because the caves or shelters under bluffs were larger. These shelters were always near to a clear spring of bubbling water.|$|E
25|$|At 2.30 pm, {{the police}} {{set fire to}} the {{building}} {{to try to make the}} rest of the Kelly Gang leave the building. Father Gibney ignored the police and went into the burning building. He found Dan Kelly and Steve Hart dead in a back room of the hotel. He said their bodies were lying side by side, their heads resting on blankets. Byrne's body was dragged out of the hotel, but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were only able to <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart by their size. They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and photographed. Three Glenrowan people held hostage inside the hotel died during the siege.|$|E
25|$|Blue jays {{can make}} a large variety of sounds, and {{individuals}} may vary perceptibly in their calling style. Like other corvids, they may learn to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> it is. Their voice is typical of most jays in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost gull-like scream. There is also a high-pitched jayer-jayer call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee's song because of the slow starting chick-ah-dee-ee. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to mob potential predators such as hawks and drive {{them away from the}} jays' nests.|$|E

25|$|Her {{outer garment}} {{was a bright}} colored plaid worsted cloak {{reaching}} to within about six inches of the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit {{at the side of}} the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag — I couldn't <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> — was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{upon the}} format of the match, these two {{strategies}} will be given different weights. In an unlimited, timed or declaration match, the main aim of the bowling attack will be to take wickets, so attacking bowling and fielding strategies will be used. In a limited overs match, this aim will also be supplemented by the secondary need to prevent the batting side from scoring quickly, so more defensive strategies will be used. In general, the shorter the number of overs per side, the more priority will be given to this secondary target of maintaining a low run-rate. It is also highly probable that the need for attacking or defensive strategies can switch frequently as a cricket match progresses. It is the sign of a good cricket captain to be able to <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> strategy is most appropriate in any set of circumstances and the best way of implementing it.|$|E
25|$|There is no precise {{measurement}} {{of the costs of}} regulation balanced against the harms associated with money laundering, and given the evaluation problems involved in assessing such an issue, {{it is unlikely that the}} effectiveness of terror finance and money laundering laws could be determined with any degree of accuracy. The Economist estimated the annual costs of anti-money laundering efforts in Europe and North America at US$5 billion in 2003, an increase from US$700 million in 2000. Government-linked economists have noted the significant negative effects of money laundering on economic development, including undermining domestic capital formation, depressing growth, and diverting capital away from development. Because of the intrinsic uncertainties of the amount of money laundered, changes in the amount of money laundered, and the cost of anti-money laundering systems, it is almost impossible to <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> anti-money laundering systems work and which are more or less cost effective.|$|E

25|$|The {{artifacts}} {{discovered at}} La Venta have been crucial to starting to understand Olmec religion and ideology. For example, hematite and iron-ore mirror fragments {{have been discovered}} in abundance at La Venta. Mirrors were an incredibly important part of Olmec society, used in both rituals and daily life. Celts, or “pseudo-axes,” are extremely common in both burials and offerings. It is unclear whether these artifacts were actually used in any practical way or if their meaning is ritual or symbolic. Most are smooth, but quite a few are decorated with what has been interpreted as representing religious symbolism. Such celts and other jade artifacts were offered to deities during ceremonies at La Venta and the belief in supernatural beings is evidenced in Olmec artifacts. However, {{it is difficult to}} <b>tell</b> <b>which</b> important figures remaining on the stone monuments and artifacts are gods and which are human leaders. In fact, there might have been little difference between the divine and the Olmec king, in their ideology.|$|E

The Prince bristles, and informs Don Ciccio that from now on, because Angelica and Tancredi are to be married, the Serdàras must be spoken about with appropriate respect. Ciccio, who has believed that Tancredi was attempting to seduce Angelica in order to embarrass her father, is horrified. He bursts out that for Tancredi and Angelica to marry will cause {{the end of the}} good qualities of the Salina and Falconieri families.
