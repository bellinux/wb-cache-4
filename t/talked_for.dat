25|$|Shasta Hall, {{many people}} say, is haunted. Students have <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> years about a ghost in the building's theatre who {{disrupts}} play openings.

Its design put off many people, and President Robert Johns apparently arranged for its construction without the approval of the CSU Board of Trustees. Sequoia Hall was originally constructed to have an attractive white cement finish, but the funding ran short. Today the building stands with plain concrete.|$|E

According to Shiban, part of the inspiration for the episode was that the series production staff had [...] "actually <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> some time about doing a Jekyll/Hyde story but never quite found a way to do it" [...] until the idea to use DNA came into play. Another inspiration for the episode was the 1949 film The Third Man, which featured a climactic chase through a sewage system.|$|E
500|$|While Pink Floyd {{were working}} on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio, during which Thorgerson {{recalled}} that he [...] "sat round and <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> a bit, but he wasn't really there."

He told Einstein that he had discovered a [...] "specific biologically effective energy which behaves in many respects differently to all that is known about electromagnetic energy." [...] He said it could be used against disease, and as a weapon [...] "in the fight against the Fascist pestilence". (Einstein had signed a letter to President Roosevelt in August 1939 to warn of the danger of Nazi Germany building an atom bomb, and had urged the United States to establish its own research project.) Einstein agreed that if an object's temperature could be raised without an apparent heating source, as Reich was suggesting, it would be [...] "a bomb." ...|$|E
500|$|Bicycling was {{the latest}} craze in the United States in 1896, and among those who came to salute McKinley was a brigade of bicyclists, who pulled images of McKinley and Hobart behind their vehicles, and {{performed}} tricks as they went to see their presidential candidate. The people of Canton joined in enthusiastically, and restaurants and souvenir venders expanded their operations. [...] A popular source of keepsakes was the wood of McKinley's front porch or fence, whittled as supporters listened, and the blades of his lawn, when not trampled underfoot, made later appearances in scrapbooks. In between delegations, McKinley entertained visitors; future Secretary of State John Hay, a major backer, came to Canton reluctantly, not relishing the crowds, but wrote [...] "he {{met me at the}} [...] station, gave me meat & took me upstairs and <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> two hours as calmly & serenely as if we were summer boarders in Bethlehem, at a loss for means to kill time. I was more struck than ever with his mask. It is a genuine Italian ecclesiastical face of the XVth Century." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Warner Bros. hired Seth Grahame-Smith, who {{collaborated with}} Burton on Dark Shadows and , {{to write and}} produce a sequel to Beetlejuice. Grahame-Smith signed on with the {{intention}} of doing [...] "a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone's throat." [...] He was also adamant that Keaton would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough. Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, [...] "We <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> a couple of hours and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim. [...] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he'll talk to anybody about it who will listen." [...] The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; [...] "This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel. What's great is that for Beetlejuice , time means nothing in the afterlife, but the world outside is a different story." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the more}} notable events during the {{recording}} of Wish You Were Here occurred on 5 June 1975, the day Gilmour married his first wife, Ginger, {{on the eve of}} Pink Floyd's second US tour that year. [...] The band {{were in the process of}} completing the final mix of [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] when an overweight man with shaven head and eyebrows, and holding a plastic bag, entered the room. [...] Waters, who was working in the studio, initially did not recognise him. [...] Wright was also mystified by the identity of the visitor, presumed he was a friend of Waters' and asked him, but soon realised that it was Syd Barrett. [...] Gilmour initially presumed he was an EMI staff member. Mason also failed to recognise him and was [...] "horrified" [...] when Gilmour identified him. [...] In Mason's personal memoir of Pink Floyd, , he recalled Barrett's conversation as [...] "desultory and not entirely sensible". Storm Thorgerson later reflected on Barrett's presence: [...] "Two or three people cried. [...] He sat round and <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> a bit but he wasn't really there." ...|$|E
