5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts <b>the</b> <b>advancing</b> and receding contact angles. <b>The</b> <b>advancing</b> contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} between the Classic and <b>the</b> <b>Advance</b> is that <b>the</b> <b>Advance</b> cabin floor is higher. Due to this shallower cabin <b>the</b> <b>Advance</b> is completely self-baling. Moreover, except for the rudder, all wood has disappeared from the design. Similar to <b>the</b> Classic <b>the</b> <b>Advance</b> has a kielmidzwaard.|$|R
50|$|Morgan led his regiment, {{with the}} added support of Henry Dearborn's 300-man New Hampshire infantry, as <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> to <b>the</b> main forces. At Freeman's Farm, they ran into <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> of General Simon Fraser's wing of Burgoyne's force.

5|$|Popular myth {{has it that}} a US Army {{airplane}} {{had flown}} over Villalba {{on the day of}} the invasion and dropped a yellow silk foulard marked with a black L (indicating Luciano). Two days later, three American tanks rolled into Villalba after driving thirty miles through enemy territory. Don Calogero climbed aboard and spent the next six days traveling through western Sicily organizing support for <b>the</b> <b>advancing</b> American troops. As General Patton's Third Division moved onward the signs of its dependence on Mafia support were obvious to the local population. The Mafia protected the roads from snipers, arranged enthusiastic welcomes for <b>the</b> <b>advancing</b> troops, and provided guides through the confusing mountain terrain.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Mons {{took place}} {{as part of}} the Battle of the Frontiers, in which <b>the</b> <b>advancing</b> German armies clashed with <b>the</b> <b>advancing</b> Allied armies along the Franco-Belgian and Franco-German borders. The British {{position}} on the French flank meant that it stood {{in the path of the}} German 1st Army. The British reached Mons on 22 August and at the time, the French Fifth Army, located on the right of the British, was heavily engaged with the German 2nd and 3rd armies at the Battle of Charleroi. The British agreed to hold the line of the Condé–Mons–Charleroi Canal for twenty-four hours, to prevent <b>the</b> <b>advancing</b> German 1st Army from threatening the French left flank. The British thus spent the day digging in along the canal.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Advance</b> {{was created}} in 1886 by printer John J. Crawford and {{businessman}} James C. Kennedy as <b>the</b> Richmond County <b>Advance.</b> <b>The</b> name was changed to <b>the</b> Daily <b>Advance</b> before it was changed to its current name. When <b>the</b> <b>Advance</b> began, there were nine competing daily newspapers in Staten Island. The circulation of <b>the</b> <b>Advance</b> surpassed these early competitors.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>ADVANCE</b> {{familiar}} driver test {{provided a}} small sample of drivers familiar with their local road network and patterns of recurring congestion with an opportunity to drive a vehicle equipped with <b>the</b> <b>ADVANCE</b> dynamic route guidance system for a period of two weeks of normal use. On the basis of this test experience, drivers were asked to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>ADVANCE</b> system and to assess the value of features for future in-vehicle route guidance systems. This test involved 80 volunteer households living in <b>the</b> <b>ADVANCE</b> test area in northwest suburban Chicago; 110 drivers from these households used <b>the</b> <b>ADVANCE</b> vehicle and responded to both baseline (pre-test) and post-test surveys. Thirty two of these drivers participated in focus groups. Drivers also maintained written logs describing their rerouting experiences with <b>the</b> <b>ADVANCE</b> system...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Advance</b> is <b>the</b> primary {{direction}} of movement, {{regardless of which}} direction the soldiers are actually facing (similar to a ship's bow.)

5|$|As the French approached, the British lines {{held their}} fire.
