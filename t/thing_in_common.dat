500|$|It gave {{two reasons}} for the populist surge across Europe: The [...] "movements tap into a deep discontent with the {{mainstream}} parties in Europe's political systems. Every funding scandal, every politician found to be corrupt, adds more wind to these parties' sails. The European Union, lacking decisive leadership in times of financial difficulty, is an ideal further focus for this ire;" [...] and that populist appeals rely on having [...] "an enemy to hand. This enemy is anyone coming from the outside – immigrants. Anti-immigrant rhetoric is the only <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> between the politics of these parties. More mainstream politicians such as David Cameron or Angela Merkel then start to adopt this rhetoric. Add to this the hurt inflicted on Europe's populations due to the financial crisis and stagnant growth, and populists have ready material with which to work." [...] It postulated that a solution could lie with a [...] "traditional approach", which the UK-based paper said was most effectively implemented by the group Hope Not Hate, though it only solved {{a part of the}} problem in [...] "exposing the extremes of the populist parties". It added that more mainstream parties {{on both sides of the}} political spectrum need to change as well by ensuring high standards of propriety and ethics and by articulating what it termed [...] "positive and optimistic economic and political solutions" [...] rather than what it said was populist rhetoric.|$|E

2500|$|When two American Catholic priests from {{distinctly}} different backgrounds met in Montreal in 1910, they discovered {{they had one}} <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common.</b> [...] Father James Anthony Walsh, a priest {{from the heart of}} Boston, and Father Thomas Frederick Price, the first native North Carolinian to be ordained into the priesthood, recognized that through their differences, they were touched by the triumph of the human spirit and enriched by encountering the faith experience of others. [...] This was the foundation of their mutual desire to build a seminary for the training of young American men for the foreign Missions.|$|E

In a 1967 rehearsal of Die Walküre with Herbert von Karajan conducting, Nilsson responded to the gloomy lighting of the production by wearing a miner's helmet (complete with Valkyrian wings).

[...] When Georg Solti, in Tristan und Isolde, insisted on tempos too slow for Nilsson's taste, she made the first performance even slower, inducing a conductorial change of heart. After a tiff with Hans Knappertsbusch, Nilsson reported: [...] "He called me by a name that begins with [...] "A" [...] and ends with 'hole'".|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th-century {{revival of}} alchemy, {{the two most}} seminal figures were Mary Anne Atwood and Ethan Allen Hitchcock, who {{independently}} published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy. Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: [...] "No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with Alchemy." [...] Atwood's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including Eliphas Levi, Arthur Edward Waite, and Rudolf Steiner. Hitchcock, in his Remarks Upon Alchymists (1855) attempted {{to make a case}} for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state. In 1845, Baron Carl Reichenbach, published his studies on Odic force, a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard says, [...] "all who {{are expecting}} {{do have one}} <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> that they are expecting {{something}} in the future, because expectancy and the future are inseparable ideas." [...] But many people live in [...] "conflict with the future" [...] Yet, [...] "by the eternal, one can conquer the future, because the eternal is the ground of the future, and therefore through it the future can be fathomed. What, then, is the eternal power in a human being? It is faith. What is the expectancy of faith? Victory-or, as Scripture so earnestly and so movingly teaches us, that all things must serve for good those who love God." [...] Kierkegaard writes about expectancy once more in these discourses. Expectancy {{has to do with}} hope. [...] "The healthy individual lives simultaneously in hope and in recollection, and only thereby does his life gain true and substantive continuity. Thus he has hope and therefore does not wish to go backward in time, as do those who live only in recollection. What, then, does recollection do for him, for it certainly must have some influence? It places a sharp on the note of the moment; the further back it goes, the more often the repetition, the more sharps there are. For example, if in the present year he experiences an erotic moment, this is augmented by his recollection of it in the previous year etc. … Hope hovers over it as a hope of eternity that fills out the moment.|$|E

6000|$|A second {{interesting}} circumstance is {{that this}} medieval age [...] produced two poets, Langland and Chaucer, who were more realistic [...] even than present-day writers in their portrayal of life, and who [...] together gave us such a picture of English society as no other [...] poets have ever equaled. Langland wrote his Piers Plowman in [...] the familiar Anglo-Saxon style for the common people, and pictured [...] their life to the letter; while Chaucer wrote his Canterbury [...] Tales, a poem shaped after Italian and French models, [...] portraying the holiday side of {{the middle and upper}} classes. [...] Langland drew a terrible picture of a degraded land, desperately in [...] need of justice, of education, of reform in church and state; [...] Chaucer showed a gay company of pilgrims riding through a [...] prosperous country which he called his [...] "Merrie England." [...] Perhaps [...] the one <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with these two poets, the early types of [...] Puritan and Cavalier, was their attitude towards democracy. [...] Langland preached the gospel of labor, far more powerfully than [...] Carlyle ever preached it, and exalted honest work as the patent of [...] nobility. Chaucer, writing for the court, mingled his characters in [...] the most democratic kind of fellowship and, though a knight rode at [...] the head of his procession, put into the mouth of the Wife of Bath [...] his definition of a gentleman: ...|$|E
