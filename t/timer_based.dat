40|$|In {{the first}} essay, I test the {{predictions}} of the market timing theory of capital structure on a comprehensive sample of firms that issued debt and equity during the period January 1974 –December 2001. I first categorize firms as likely and unlikely market <b>timers</b> <b>based</b> {{on their ability to}} time the market. As a proxy for firms 2 ̆ 7 ability to time the market, I use the index of financing constraints developed in Kaplan and Zingales (KZ) (1997). Separately, I categorize firms as likely and unlikely market <b>timers</b> <b>based</b> on their opportunities to time the market. I argue that firms will have more opportunities to time the market when their stock market prices do not reflect fundamental information about them. I proxy for the firm 2 ̆ 7 s stock price informativeness with the R-squared statistic obtained from regressing a firm 2 ̆ 7 s stock returns prior to a debt or equity issuance against industry and market returns as in Morck et al. (2000). I classify firms with a low R-squared statistic as having informative stock prices that rarely diverge from fundamentals. Such firms are classified as unlikely market timers. Given these a priori classifications of firms, I test whether firm financing choices differ across likely and unlikely market timers as predicted by market timing theory. I find that the unlikely market timers behave either no differently than the likely market timers or opposite that predicted by the market timing theory. In short, the results do not support the market timing theory. ^ In the second essay, I examine the role of capital market imperfections on the allocation of capital across firms. Market imperfections make external financing costly and discourage investment for financially constrained firms. Changes in the investment opportunity set may reduce the effects of market imperfections on the cost of external capital and stimulate investment for financially constrained firms. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that the sensitivity of investment to stock prices is significantly higher for financially constrained firms. Further, I link the increased sensitivity of investment to stock prices to changes in the cost of external financing. ...|$|R

Recent advances in information technology are now, however, providing cost-effective opportunities to achieve better performance of conventional stormwater infrastructure through a Continuous Monitoring and Adaptive Control (CMAC) approach. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to demonstrate that a CMAC approach can be applied to a conventional rainwater harvesting system in New York City to improve performance by minimizing discharge to the combined sewer during rainfall events, reducing water use for irrigation of local vegetation, and optimizing vegetation health. To achieve this objective, a hydrologic and hydraulic model was developed for a planned and designed rainwater harvesting system to explore multiple potential scenarios prior to the system’s actual construction. Model results indicate that the CMAC rainwater harvesting system is expected to provide significant performance improvements over conventional rainwater harvesting systems. The CMAC system is expected to capture and retain 76. 6 % of roof runoff per year on average, as compared to just 14. 8 % and 41. 3 % for conventional moisture and <b>timer</b> <b>based</b> systems, respectively.
