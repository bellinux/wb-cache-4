The experiment was performed on May 15, 2014 at Faculty of Industrial Technology Vallaya Alongkorn Rajabhat University Pathum Tani Thailand. The samples for testing were three varieties of Thai rice namely RD 31 (from the farm), RD 31 (dried in a solar <b>tunnel</b> <b>dryer),</b> and Prathum Tani 1 (from the market). The test consists of RD 31 dried by a solar tunnel dryer; the moisture content was reduced to about 14 wt. %. Then 3 varieties of rice were milled and sent to the laboratory for analyzing physical and chemical properties, repeated 3 times. The results showed that the average drying temperature was 67. 75 °C. The paddy moisture reduction content was estimated from 49. 96 to 14. 64 MC (% w. b.) within 6 hours. All dimensions of RD 31, dried by using solar <b>tunnel</b> <b>dryer</b> milled rice were closely related to those of the Prathum Tani 1, purchased from the market.

The types of shrimp that use in this research are the white shrimp (Panaeus mergulensis) and small shrimp. White shrimp (Penaeus merguiensis) is shrimp that have color white and have a thin skin, but small shrimp is shrimp with small size. Economic value of small shrimp is low, but if processed into shrimp chips, it will increase that economic value. Shrimp chips furthermore dried, drying method that used is with solar tunnel drying and sun drying method. The sun drying method has many weaknesses, because of that we use solar <b>tunnel</b> <b>dryer</b> to reduce water content of product at the lowest level, so the shelf life will increase, and significantly can reduce the drying time because the inside temperature at solar <b>tunnel</b> <b>dryer</b> higher than outside.

The main focus of every tunnel design should be the improvement {{of the quality of the}} product in terms of colour, texture and aroma. Increasing the evaporation rate without increasing the energy required to do so, should always be done in-line with this main objective. Many studies focus on the mango structure and food dehydration principles that influence the uniform drying product with the assumption that the airflow over the produce is uniform. Few have been conducted on the air movement inside industrial dryers. CFD analysis predicts the airflow without influencing the airflow pattern compared to the measuring equipment inside test dryers. The experimental data were obtained from an empty dryer without a flow diverter. This was compared to dryer with the flow diverter included and compared to a dryer with the trolleys, trays and mango slices included. The test results showed that turbulence created by this configuration, still played a major role in the nonuniform velocity distribution along the drying zone of the tunnel. The inclusion of a flow diverter did however dampen the swirl effect of the main fan. Measuring the velocity distribution was practically difficult with the handheld devices used, which influenced the accuracy of the measurements taken. This justified the CFD analysis in order to better visualise and predict the airflow pattern inside the dryer. The total average speed CFD results of the sections in the drying zone (without mangoes and trolleys) of the dryer without a flow diverter was 11. 2 % higher compared to the test results. It was 14 % higher for the dryer with the flow diverter included. The dryer with the mangoes, trays, trolleys and flow diverter showed a large difference where the total average speed of the CFD analysis was 49 % higher compared to the test results. The main reason for the difference of the CFD analysis compared to the measured results are the factors that influenced the uncertainty of the experimental set up. The CFD analysis showed that the coefficient of variance (CV) of the dryer with the flow diverter (mangoes and trolleys included) was 3 % lower compared to the dryer without one. Various dryer configurations were analysed using the CFD software to investigate what the best combination of flow diverter, vanes and blanking-off plates would be. A dryer configuration where flow diverters (Up-and-downstream of the main fan) above the false ceiling and inside the drying zone was analysed. A 16 % decrease in terms of the CV value was obtained compared to the dryer with just the flow diverter downstream of main fan above the false ceiling. There was however a large region of swirl upstream of the main above the false ceiling resulting in a larger loss of heated air through the outlet fan before it reached the drying zone. The cost of manufacturing a simple vane and flow diverter for an existing dryer is 4 % of the initial building costs (excluding the initial cost of the trolleys). The overall drying uniformity of this dryer is improved according to the CFD analysis by 7 %. A cost analysis (taking into account the 15 year life cycle of a dryer) in terms of the energy requirement to evaporate water from the drying zone, showed that the dryer with the flow diverter was 6 % less expensive to run on a yearly basis. Labour costs will be lower due to man-hours saved in terms of sorting out the wet slices from the dried product. Resources (dryers and trolleys) that would have been used for re-drying the wet produce, could now be implemented to increase the production rate of the plant.

Rio Grande type tomato was used for drying experiments. During the drying period, drying air temperature, relative humudity, air flow rates, solar radiation, and lose of mass were measured continuously in {{different part of the}} dryer. Drying time was examined with mass ratio as exponantial and polynomial correlations. Twelve different mathematical models available in literature were compared using their coefficient of determination of estimate solar drying curves. According to statistical analysis results, the two-term drying model has shown a better fit to the experimental drying data of tomato with a coefficient of determination R 2 of 0. 9967 as compared to other models...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of different drying methods on physical and nutritional properties of shrimp meat {{was investigated in}} this study. Peeled shrimps were dried separately using an air-oven <b>dryer</b> and a <b>tunnel</b> solar <b>dryer.</b> The drying profile of shrimp meat was determined in the two drying systems by monitoring moisture loss over the drying period. Changes in color, proximate composition, and rehydration capacity were assessed. The rate of moisture removal during solar drying was faster than the air-oven drying. The development of red color during drying was comparable among the two methods, but solar-dried shrimps appeared darker (L⁎= 47. 4) than the air-oven-dried (L⁎= 49. 0). Chemical analysis indicated that protein and fat made up nearly 20 % and 2 %[*](wb) of the shrimp meat, respectively. Protein and ash content of shrimp meat dried under the two dryer types were comparable but fat was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in oven-dried meat (2. 1 %), compared to solar-dried meat (1. 5 %). Although rehydration behavior of shrimp from the two drying systems followed a similar pattern, solar-dried shrimp absorbed moisture more rapidly. The results have demonstrated that different approaches to drying may affect the physical and nutritional quality of shrimp meat differently...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to verify the effect of drying conditions on thermal properties and resistant starch content of green banana flour (Musa cavendishii). The green banana flour is a complex-carbohydrates source, mainly of resistant starch, and quantifying its gelatinization is important to understand how it affects food processing and the functional properties of the flour. The green banana flour was obtained by drying unripe peeled bananas (first stage of ripening) in a <b>dryer</b> <b>tunnel</b> at 52 degrees C, 55 degrees C and 58 degrees C and air velocity at 0. 6 m s(- 1), 1. 0 m s(- 1) and 1. 4 m s(- 1). The results obtained from differential scanning calorimetry, (DSC) curves show a single endothermic transition and a flow of maximum heating at peak temperatures from (67. 95 +/- 0. 31) degrees C to (68. 63 +/- 0. 28) degrees C. ANOVA shows that only drying temperature influenced significantly (P < 0. 05) the gelatinization peak temperature (Tp). Gelatinization enthalpy (Delta H) varied from 9. 04 J g(- 1) to 11. 63 J g(- 1) and no significant difference was observed for either temperature or air velocity. The resistant starch content of the flour produced varied from (40. 9 +/- 0. 4) g/ 100 g to (58. 5 +/- 5. 4) g/ 100 g, on dry basis (d. b.), and was influenced by the combination of drying conditions: flour produced at 55 degrees C/ 1. 4 m s(- 1) and 55 degrees C/ 1. 0 m s(- 1) presented higher content of resistant starch.
