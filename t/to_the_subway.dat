5|$|On November 23, 1941, the Q37 bus {{operated}} by Green Bus Lines {{was extended to}} the station to provide a transfer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Located {{underneath}} the subway station terminal {{is a set}} of bus stops on Stillwell Avenue and Mermaid Avenue that make up a bus terminal for four New York City Bus lines. The bus terminal provides easier transfer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> and bus connections. One additional bus line is located near the station complex.|$|E
5|$|Upon opening, the Bloor–Danforth {{line was}} well received: a survey taken {{four months later}} showed that the subway was used by 10,000 riders per hour. As a result, many bus and {{streetcar}} routes were either discontinued or shortened. Various bus and streetcar routes, which connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> stations allowed the line {{to continue to grow}} and become more sustainable. The line carries an average of 519,180 passengers on weekdays during the 2011–2012 operating year.|$|E
50|$|During {{the mid-1960s}} {{additional}} access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> under <b>the</b> crossroads {{as well as}} a second transfer corridor to Biblioteka Imeni Lenina were added. In a second reconstruction (1997-99), the small escalator was removed and replaced with a staircase.|$|R
50|$|The Feed The Children 300 {{was moved}} <b>to</b> precede <b>the</b> <b>Subway</b> Jalapeño 250.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bloor-Yonge <b>subway</b> station, <b>the</b> TTC's major east-west/north-south transfer point. There are also below-grade connections <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holt Renfrew Centre and Cumberland Terrace, which continues westward to 60 Bloor Street West and Manulife Centre. The pedestrian tunnels stretches along Bloor Street West <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bay <b>subway</b> station, making this Toronto's largest underground network after PATH.|$|R
5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings play every few minutes or so. The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been ineffective in curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the {{original}} New York City Subway line in 1904, and throughout the subway's history, various official and planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system. The first major expansion of the subway system was the Dual Contracts, a set of agreements between the City of New York and the IRT and the BRT. The system was expanded into the outer reaches of the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, and it provided for the construction of important lines in Manhattan. This one expansion of the system provided for a majority of today's system.|$|E
5|$|The Whitestone Branch {{would have}} had to be rebuilt if it were leased <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway,</b> with {{railroad}} crossings removed and the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned its attention back to the Main Street subway extension.|$|E
25|$|The north entrance, {{which has}} {{restricted}} opening hours, leads from Grant Road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same <b>subway.</b> <b>The</b> <b>subway</b> is crowded during rush hours, with the ticket barriers {{at the ends}} being pinch points.|$|R
2500|$|December 22, 1910: The Public Service Corporation first announces plans <b>to</b> build <b>the</b> <b>subway,</b> {{initially}} {{including a}} line under Broad Street from Bridge Street to Clinton Avenue ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>To</b> ensure <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> could {{accommodate}} [...] cars, two retired R1 cars (numbered 165 and 192; renumbered XC675 and XC575 respectively) {{were cut}} in half, lengthened to [...] {{and sent to}} various places around <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> and <b>the</b> Staten Island Railway.|$|R
5|$|In {{the last}} two days of 1999, Los Angeles has become a {{dangerous}} war zone. As a group of criminals rob a Chinese restaurant, the event is recorded by a robber wearing a SQUID, an illegal electronic device that records events directly from the wearer's cerebral cortex, and when played back through a MiniDisc-like device, allows a user to experience the recorder's memories and physical sensations. Lenny Nero, a former LAPD officer turned black marketeer of SQUID recordings, agrees to buy the robbery clip from his main supplier, Tick. Elsewhere, a prostitute named Iris, who is a friend of Lenny's ex-girlfriend Faith Justin, is being chased by LAPD officers Burton Steckler and Dwayne Engelman as she flees <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b> Iris manages to escape on a rapid transit after her wig is pulled off by Engleman, revealing a SQUID recorder headset.|$|E
5|$|Most trains {{that serve}} the Bloor–Danforth line are stored at the Greenwood Subway Yard, which opened {{with the first}} segment of the line. Before the yard was built, the land was {{occupied}} by a quarry and a garbage dump. Due to its location next to the Canadian National Railway tracks, {{it was possible for}} trains to be delivered directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b> The CN rail tracks were converted to allow for the storage of more subway trains as the T-1 series trains were shifted from Yonge–University–Spadina line to the Bloor–Danforth line. In addition to providing storage for subway trains, the Greenwood yard is also used to maintain vehicles, which operate on Line 3 Scarborough as the McCowan RT Yard is only equipped for vehicle storage and to perform basic maintenance of vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough is at {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway system. There are three subway stations in Scarborough: Victoria Park, Warden, and Kennedy. Beginning at Kennedy station, Line 3 Scarborough, {{also known as the}} Scarborough RT, runs north and east toward Scarborough City Centre. It runs at grade for two stops until Ellesmere Road where it becomes elevated until it reaches its terminus at McCowan Road. The system is nearing the end of its life and the city is planning an extension of the Line 2 Bloor–Danforth subway line to Scarborough Centre with construction slated to commence in 2018. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> and RT, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) runs an extensive bus network throughout Scarborough. Many of the bus lines run to and from the subway and RT stations.|$|E

50|$|In 1913, as {{a result}} of massive {{expansion}} in the city, the IRT signed the Dual Contracts with Brooklyn Rapid Transit (BRT) in order <b>to</b> expand <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{spur of the}} United States Capitol Subway System was {{constructed}} <b>to</b> connect <b>the</b> Hart Senate Office Building <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway's</b> main track beneath the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The spur opened when the new building did. In 1989, the Senate approved a plan <b>to</b> upgrade <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> beneath <b>the</b> Hart and Dirksen office buildings. The changes included four new cars capable of seating 25 people (up from 18), making platforms and cars wheelchair-accessible, and automating these cars (eliminating the need for car conductors). The changes were expected to produce savings of $122,000 ($ in [...] dollars) a year and cut waiting times to two minutes from four. Transportation Group Inc., of Orlando, Florida, was paid $15.8 million ($ in [...] dollars) and the Architect of the Capitol received $2 million ($ in [...] dollars) to design and manufacture <b>the</b> new <b>subway</b> cars and system. The system was finished in 1994.|$|R
25|$|The footway {{from the}} Munich Olympic Stadium <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> station was renamed as the Lillian-Board-Weg.|$|E

25|$|A Spadina {{extension}} into Vaughan {{had been}} suggested {{as early as}} 1988, when Lorna Jackson campaigned during the Vaughan municipal elections <b>to</b> extend <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proposed Highway 407 corridor.|$|R
25|$|Lifts {{linking the}} {{concourse}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Subway</b> platforms {{were to be}} installed {{as part of this}} project because the necessary land is not owned by SPT. The future provision of lifts has, however, been safeguarded.|$|E
25|$|Queens Quay {{is the one}} {{standalone}} {{underground station}} that does not connect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b> It {{is located in the}} tunnel, shared by the 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina routes, between Queens Quay West and Union subway station.|$|E
25|$|Glasgow's Museum of Transport has an area {{dedicated}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway,</b> with models {{showing the}} operation of the clutch-and-cable system, as well as a full-scale replica of part of a subway station, complete with different rolling stock of the pre-modernisation era.|$|E
5|$|Access {{between the}} {{platforms}} is via a subway with ramps {{at the west}} end of the platforms, although the station is not considered completely accessible as the ramps are steeper than 1 in 12. <b>The</b> <b>subway</b> exits onto Fraser Street, which is <b>the</b> sole entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station. <b>The</b> <b>subway</b> is decorated with murals painted by local schoolchildren, reflecting the history and culture of Bristol.|$|R
30|$|Shield segment can be {{affected}} by subway vibration loading during operations (Shen et al. 2014). In order <b>to</b> simulate <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> vibration loading on soil, the dynamic triaxial test was performed.|$|R
50|$|East of {{the station}} the tracks angle north away from Danforth Avenue and emerge <b>to</b> run on <b>the</b> surface at the Tyra Portal in Dentonia Park, just west of Victoria Park Station. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> west <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> tunnel was mostly {{constructed}} by cut-and-cover along Harris Avenue from Woodbine Station.|$|R
25|$|Montreal Metro {{facilities}} are patrolled daily by 155 STM inspectors and 115 {{agents of the}} Montreal Police Service (SPVM) assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b> They are {{in contact with the}} command centre of the Metro which has 2,000 cameras distributed on the network, coupled with a computerized visual recognition system.|$|E
25|$|The {{owner of}} two Subway franchises located inside Jackson Memorial Hospital {{came up with}} selling foot-long subs for a lower price at his two stores on the {{weekends}} in 2004, to help spur business.
