40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel {{formulation of the}} control problem and a feedback control system for the high velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) thermal spray process, which explicitly accounts for the effect of powder size distribution. Initially, based on model predictions and available experimental data, the control problem is formulatedas one of regulatingappropriateaverages(with respect to the particle volume distribution) of the temperature and velocity of the particles {{at the point of}} impact on substrate (these are the variables that directly influence coating microstructure and porosity, which, in turn, determine coating mechanical and thermal properties) by manipulating the oxygen/fuel ratio and the combustion chamber pressure, respec-tively. Then, a feedback control system is developed and applied to a detailed mathematical model of the process. Closed-loop simulations show that the average particle velocity and temperature at the point of impact on substrate reach the desired values in a short time, which validates the feasibility of real-time implementation of feedback control on HVOF thermal spray systems. It is also shown that the proposed formulation of the control problem (which accounts for the effect of powder size distribution) leads to a solution of the control problem that is superior (with respect to the achievement of the desired control ob-jectives) to a solution that assumes a monodisperse powder size distribution. Finally, the proposed control problem formulation and the feedback control systemare shown to be robust with respect to disturbances in spray distance and particle injection velocity, and variations in powder size distribution.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of WC-VC-Co and WC-Co <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> <b>powders</b> and coatings of equal Co mass fractions {{has led to}} a new quantitative insight into some of the processes occurring during coating deposition and to an explanation of the difference in abrasion resistance between WC-VC-Co and WC-Co coatings. In both materials, during coating deposition the WC grains acquire a less angular morphology and a finer mean size than in the powders and a significant fraction of WC grains is decarburized, with the formation of W 2 C and Co 6 W 6 C. Changes in the morphology of the (W,V) C grains could not be detected on account of their typical irregular shape, but their mean size also decreased. The outer surfaces of the carbides grains, therefore, dissolve in the Co at the high deposition temperatures and no re-precipitation on the un- dissolved grains occurs during cooling because of the very high cooling rate. As a result, a fraction of W, V and C remains in solution in the Co, although it is difficult to measure because the Co composition in the coatings varies from point to point. The higher abrasion resistance of the WC-VC-Co coatings relative to WC-Co coatings of equal Co mass fraction is attributed mainly to the finer WC grain size in the WCVC-Co coatings (even when starting from equal grain size in the powders), the lower Co volume fraction (due to the density of (W,V) C being lower than the density of WC) and the presence of the (W,V) C grains, which, on account of their hardness and fine size, are not only resistant to abrasion but also to fracture...|$|R

This mixture is then heated to very high temperatures and sprayed onto the object being coated where it forms a protective layer. This layer is essentially its own metal matrix composite, consisting of hard ceramic Cr3C2 particles embedded in a nickel-chromium matrix. The matrix itself contributes to the corrosion resistance of the coating because both nickel and chromium are corrosion resistant in their metallic form. After over spraying the coating, the coated part must run through a diffusion heat treatment to reach the best results in matter of coupling strength to the basemetal and also in matter of hardness. Another technique utilizes chromium carbide {{in the form of}} overlay plates. These are prefabricated chromium carbide coated steel plates, which are meant to be welded onto existing structures or machinery in order to improve performance.Chromium carbide is used as an additive in cutting tools made out of cemented carbides, in order to improve toughness by preventing the growth of large grains. The primary constituent in most extremely hard cutting tools is tungsten carbide. The tungsten carbide is combined with other carbides such as titanium carbide, niobium carbide, and chromium carbide and sintered together with a cobalt matrix. Cr3C2 prevents large grains from forming in the composite, which results in a fine-grained structure of superior toughness.|$|R
40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>spray</b> {{fabrication}} of rare-earth permanent magnetic coatings (PMCs) presents potential manufacturing routes for micro-magnetic devices. Despite this potential, <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> of PMCs {{is still not}} widely explored due to oxidation concerns. It was established that oxidation leads {{to the loss of}} ferromagnetic phases in these materials and results in deterioration of magnetic performance. Although this review focuses on a specific class of material, i. e., magnetic materials, there is significant technical crossover to all classes of feedstocks that are employed in <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> processing. The oxidation mechanisms and the associated influencing factors are explored in this work to implement effective processing techniques during the deposition process. This paper reviews the various stages and mechanisms of oxidation in <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> processes. The factors that influence the extent of oxidation depend on the type of oxidation that is dominant and rely on the type of <b>spray</b> system, <b>powder</b> injection position, and the particle size of feedstock. Among the aspects that are reviewed include the oxygen-fuel ratio for high velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF), current intensity, gas flow rate, particle size, spray distance, and substrate temperature. Protection strategies to minimize oxidation in <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> processes, such as gas shrouding and shielding, are presented...|$|R

A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model is developed to investigate propane combustion in the process of HVOF <b>thermal</b> <b>spraying.</b> The numerical methods are described for correct representation of various thermal–physical phenomena such as flame propagation, turbulent mixing and flow acceleration.

40|$|The {{combination}} of excellent mechanical, thermal and chemical properties of silicon carbide (SiC) ant titanium carbide (TiC) has made these materials very attractive both for structural ceramics applications and for <b>thermal</b> <b>sprayed</b> coatings. To suppress oxidation {{and to avoid}} the formation of silicides during spraying of SiC-based composites, feedstock <b>spray</b> <b>powders</b> have been developed containing 32 wt. -% of an alumina-yttrium ceramic binder matrix. The spray posers are prepared by spray-drying and sintering (a&s). Also, TiC-based composite <b>spray</b> <b>powders</b> showing the same matrix material and content have been developed and produced. <b>Thermal</b> <b>spray</b> processing of the described powders by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) using an F 6 APS torch and {{high velocity oxygen fuel}} spraying (HVOF) with the Top Gun G acetylene torch is carried out. Both the produced coatings and feedstock powder are characterized by optical microscopy, Xray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) including energy dispersive X-ray analyses (EDXS). The volumetric content of the carbide phase is 73 vol. -%, that corresponds to 67 wt. -% of SiC and 76 wt. -% of TiC within the composite powders. The carbide grain size is 2. 5 microns and 1. 5 microns respectively. The oxide-ceramic matrix phase mainly contains yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Y 3 Al 5 O 12) and a smaller amount of corundum (Al 2 O 3). The powder particles show globular shapes. All components are homogeneously distributed within the powder microstructures. While APS coatings show high porosities in the lower coating areas so far, all produced HVOF coatings show higher densities and continuously developed coatings-substrate interfaces. Further investigations will deal with <b>powder</b> and <b>spray</b> parameter optimization, including profound metallographical examinations. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of thermally sprayed, dense, Si 3 N 4 -based coatings {{can be accomplished}} using composite <b>spray</b> <b>powders</b> with Si 3 N 4 embedded in a complex oxide binder matrix. Powders with excellent processability were developed and produced by agglomeration (spray drying) and sintering.

In the present work, different <b>thermal</b> <b>spray</b> processes such as detonation gun spraying, atm. plasma <b>spraying</b> with axial <b>powder</b> injection, and high-velocity oxyfuel spraying were used. The coatings were characterized using optical and SEM, XRD, and microhardness testing. The wear resistance was tested using a rubber wheel abrasion wear test (ASTM G 65).
