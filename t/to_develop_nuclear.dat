5|$|Tube Alloys was a codename of the clandestine {{research}} and development programme, authorised by the United Kingdom, with participation from Canada, <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons during the Second World War.

Lee, he went to see Groves and Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, who were willing to help, but would not offer any fissionable material. The Navy decided to proceed with the design of a nuclear-powered ship.|$|E

5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.|$|E

In addition, new nuclear power stations could be built, the waste management from which would be the private sector's financial responsibility, although all would be stored in a single facility. Most of the UK's higher-activity radioactive waste is currently held in temporary storage at Sellafield.|$|E
25|$|Iran {{consistently}} {{claimed that}} {{its nuclear program}} is purely for civilian purposes, {{and that it has}} no intention of ever utilizing its peaceful nuclear program <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. During the course of Iran's recent history, specifically during the Iran-Iraq war, Iran has experienced significant outages of its commercial electricity grid. Iran has also continuously claimed that it intends to ultimately export part of the electricity produced by its nuclear reactors to its regional neighbors, as a way of diversifying its mainly oil-based economy to more diversified revenue streams.|$|E

25|$|Iran {{has had a}} {{civilian}} nuclear program since before the 1979 revolution. However, since the revolution, {{there has been some}} worries that Iran could use this program <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. These worries have been raised by the revelation, on August 2002, by Alireza Jafarzadeh, a prominent associate of MKO, of the existence of two secret nuclear sites: a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz (part of which is underground), and a heavy water facility in Arak. There is however no proof at this stage that this program is not purely civilian.|$|E
25|$|The United States was not {{particularly}} {{in favor of a}} nuclear Sweden. The cooperation agreement between Sweden and the United States, that established bilateral safeguards for Swedish nuclear installations, forbade Sweden from using equipment and materials <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. In the meantime, the use of U.S. uranium would mean accepting inspection requirements, which would prevent the uranium in question from being used for weapons production. The more Sweden’s research in nuclear weapons was becoming dependent on U.S. military assistance, the more the United States was willing to steer Sweden away from implementing its plans to create a nuclear weapon.|$|E
25|$|In 1946 Congress {{established}} the civilian Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{to take over}} the development of nuclear weapons from the military, and <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> power. The AEC made use of many private companies in processing uranium and thorium and in other urgent tasks related to the development of bombs. Many of these companies had very lax safety measures and employees were sometimes exposed to radiation levels far above what was allowed then or now. In 1974, the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) of the Army Corps of Engineers was set up to deal with contaminated sites left over from these operations.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} could have potentially {{lead to a}} war between a de facto nuclear weapon state (India—who had already conducted a nuclear test in 1974 codename Smiling Buddha) and a state, although nuclear power, was believed <b>to</b> be <b>developing</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons at that time (Pakistan).|$|R

25|$|Since King Abdullah's {{visit to}} Beijing in January 2006, Saudi-Chinese {{relations}} have focused predominantly {{on energy and}} trade. The king's visit was the first by a Saudi head of state to China since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1990. Bilateral trade with China has more than tripled, and China would soon be Saudi Arabia's largest importer. Saudi Arabia also committed significant investments in China, including the $8 billion Fujian refinery. Based on a WikiLeaks cable, the King told the Chinese that it was willing to effectively trade a guaranteed oil supply in return for Chinese pressure on Iran not <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons.|$|E
25|$|It {{may seem}} {{paradoxical}} that the Air Force changed opinion {{on nuclear weapons}} given {{the expansion of the}} relative importance of the US Air Force following America's adoption of nuclear weapons. At the time, however, the Air Force was facing an expensive acquisition of the Saab 37 Viggen, and feared that a full-scale nuclear weapons program would compete with it for resources. One of the points that Norén wanted to investigate was what conventional forces Sweden could acquire if it decided not <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. It should be noted that it was the plan that the United States suggested Sweden to follow in 1960. However, it remains unclear whether or not this suggestion influenced Sweden’s defense officials.|$|E
25|$|On 18 October 2010 the British {{government}} announced eight locations it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. This {{has resulted in}} public opposition and protests {{at some of the}} sites. In March 2012, two of the big six power companies announced they would be pulling out of developing new nuclear power plants. The decision by RWE npower and E.ON follows uncertainty over nuclear energy following the Fukushima nuclear disaster last year. The companies will not proceed with their Horizon project, which was <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>nuclear</b> reactors at Wylfa in North Wales and at Oldbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire. Their decision follows a similar announcement by Scottish and Southern Electricity last year. Analysts said the decision meant the future of UK nuclear power could now be in doubt.|$|E
