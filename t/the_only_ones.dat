5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary eyes are that the latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the arrangement is the opposite in the former. The principal eyes are also <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> with eye muscles, allowing them to move the retina. Having no muscles, the secondary eyes are immobile.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, only 43,000 Persians {{survived the}} battle. The number who died, of course, {{depends on how}} many there were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by Herodotus' reckoning. Herodotus claims that the Greeks as a whole lost only 159 men. Furthermore, he claims that only Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians died, since they were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> who fought. Plutarch, who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 Greek {{casualties}}, while both Ephorus and Diodorus Siculus tally the Greek casualties to over 10,000.|$|E

At the battle itself, his troops were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> properly positioned; {{the rest of the}} French army was otherwise out of place and unready for battle. He and Saint-Cyr held the center of the French line, beating off two Russian assaults. After the French defeat at Novi, he went with Saint-Cyr to Savona, where he participated in operations around Genoa. Eventually, he rejoined Moreau to campaign in southwestern Germany, culminating in the Battle of Hohenlinden.|$|E

5|$|Australia, {{along with}} New Zealand, were widely {{recognized}} as the strongest teams in the Oceanian zone. They were the only teams to have won the OFC Nations Cup, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> to have qualified for the World Cup: Australia had qualified in 1974 and New Zealand in 1982. American Samoa {{were one of the}} weakest teams in the world, having lost all of their official international matches since they had joined FIFA in 1998. Prior to the match, Australia was ranked 75th in the FIFA World Rankings, while American Samoa was ranked 203rd, the lowest of all FIFA members.|$|E
5|$|Celtic law made {{specific}} provision {{with regard to}} cabbages and leeks, stating {{that they should be}} enclosed by fences for protection against wandering cattle. The two green vegetables were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> mentioned specifically in the laws, though uncultivated plants were still likely to be used in their cooking. The leek went on to be so important to Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E

Exceptions are the Ferrybridge and Newbridge chariots, which are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> found to have been buried intact. The Newbridge burial has been radiocarbon dated to 520–370BC, and the Ferrybridge burial is likely to be of similar date.|$|E

That conclave saw Spain veto Cesare Baronius after the first ballot. Medici, the candidate who was finally elected, was also vetoed by the cardinal representing Spain but this occurred after the election of Leo XI, and the cardinals did not view the veto as valid.|$|E

On a percentage basis, as of 2014, the franchise has won 25.3% of all Stanley Cup championships contested after the Challenge Cup era, making it the second most successful professional sports team of the traditional four major sports of Canada and the United States, behind only the Boston Celtics.|$|E
