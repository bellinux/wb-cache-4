5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do}} with where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|Within {{a week of}} the inauguration, I {{wrote to}} Rice and Hadley asking 'urgently' for a Principals, or Cabinet-level, meeting to review the {{imminent}} Al-Qaeda threat. Rice <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Principals Committee, which {{had been the first}} venue for terrorism policy discussions in the Clinton administration, would not address the issue until it had been 'framed' by the Deputies.|$|E
500|$|Charlotte Knollys <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Munshi bogie {{which had}} frightened all the {{household}} at Windsor {{for many years}} had proved a ridiculous farce, as the poor man had not only given up all his letters but even the photos signed by Queen and had returned to India like a whipped hound. [...] All the Indian servants have gone back so {{now there is no}} Oriental picture & queerness at Court.|$|E

500|$|The move to Los Angeles {{also meant}} a drastic price {{increase}} for the series. Bruce Harwood, who played Lone Gunman John Fitzgerald Byers noted, [...] "At the time, {{the exchange rate}} between Canadian and U.S. dollars was pretty dramatic. Somebody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cost per episode doubled, even tripled, once they moved". In addition, the move further reduced the amount of expensive special effects the series was able to produce. Writer Vince Gilligan explained [...] "everything in Los Angeles is more expensive across the board. [...] It became apparent very quickly {{to me that we}} were no longer going to have things such as nuclear submarines descending through the ice and trains exploding {{in the middle of the}} woods".|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton avoided using {{too many}} digital effects {{because he wanted}} the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a {{realistic}} environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI). Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. [...] "Tim <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots— all they do is work, work, work," [...] Roy commented. [...] "So {{when it comes time to}} dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the 2012–13 season, Bridges signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Bury Town on a free transfer. On joining Bury Town, Bridges said — [...] "I'm good friends with Adam Tann and Craig Parker and they couldn't say enough good things about the club. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> players are really well looked after and the club is full of good honest people". He left Bury Town in December 2013 due to the club's {{financial}} problems, and subsequently joined Brackley Town of the National League North in January 2014. Bridges made his debut for Brackley on 11 January 2014, coming on as an 87th-minute substitute in a 31 victory over Gainsborough Trinity. He made 15 appearances during the second half of the 201314 season whilst at Brackley, scoring two goals [...] both of his goals coming within the space of a week at the end of March 2014, in games against Altrincham and Workington respectively.|$|E

500|$|Ethiopia {{has been}} claimed {{for many years}} as {{the origin of the}} Prester John legend, but most modern experts believe that the legend was simply adapted to fit that nation in the same fashion that it had been {{projected}} upon Ong Khan and Central Asia during the 13th century. Modern scholars find nothing about the Prester or his country in the early material that would make Ethiopia a more suitable identification than any place else, and furthermore, specialists in Ethiopian history have effectively demonstrated that the story was not widely known there until well after European contact. Czech Franciscan Remedius Prutky asked Emperor Iyasu II about this identification in 1751, and Prutky states that the man was [...] "astonished, and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kings of Abyssinia had never been accustomed to call themselves by this name." [...] In a footnote to this passage, Richard Pankhurst states that this is apparently the first recorded statement by an Ethiopian monarch about this tale, and they were likely unaware of the title until Prutky's inquiry.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen {{and we do not}} know why. We were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to the}} First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up I think they would have gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E

500|$|With {{his wife}} {{administering}} the campaign organization, Sunday {{was free to}} do what he did best: compose and deliver colloquial sermons. Typically, Homer Rodeheaver would first warm up the crowd with congregational singing that alternated with numbers from gigantic choirs and music performed by the staff. When Sunday felt the moment right, he would launch into his message. Sunday gyrated, stood on the pulpit, ran from one end of the platform to the other, and dove across the stage, pretending to slide into home plate. Sometimes he even smashed chairs to emphasize his points. His sermon notes had to be printed in large letters so that he could catch a glimpse of them as he raced by the pulpit. In messages attacking sexual sin to groups of men only, Sunday could be graphic for the era. A theological opponent, Universalist minister Frederick William Betts, wrote, [...] "Many of the things said and done bordered upon things prohibited in decent society. The sermon on amusements was preached three times, to mixed audience of men and women, boys and girls. If the sermons to women had been preached to married women, if the sermons to men had been preached to mature men, if the sermon on amusements had been preached to grown folks, there might have been an excuse for them, and perhaps good from them. But an experienced newspaper reporter <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sermon on amusements was 'the rawest thing ever put over in Syracuse.' I can not, must not, quote from this sermon...", [...] "fainted under that awful definition;", [...] "if you do not 'hit the trail' then watch out for the fireworks"... says that Mr. Sunday's sermon on the sex question was raw and disgusting. He also heard the famous sermons on amusements and booze. [...] says that all in all they were the ugliest, nastiest, most disgusting addresses he ever listened to from a religious platform or a preacher of religion. He saw people carried out who had fainted under that awful definition of sensuality and depravity.|$|E
2500|$|... "Police came to {{my house}} on Sunday at 1pm when I was having my siesta and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> escapees had demanded to see me before they gave {{themselves}} up to the police voluntarily. I was reluctant because last time I helped the police I was arrested but I agreed if it meant they would give themselves up, so I went with two officers to Tanoliu.|$|E
2500|$|Leavitt himself {{proved to}} be the source of advice and support to the {{explorer}} Stefansson, who quotes him often in his journals and calls him 'explorer' as well as 'captain'. The Maine-born mariner, Stefansson noted, was intrepid in his nautical work, often sailing to places beyond the reach of others. [...] "Captain Leavitt had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Narwhal was the only ship of the whaling fleet", Stefansson wrote, [...] "that ever went to Norway Island, but I have heard of others that went within [...] of it [...] to Terror Island." ...|$|E

2500|$|In spring 1940, one SS-Standartenfuehrer (SS-colonel) Mueller from Greifswald, {{a bigger}} {{town in the}} {{vicinity}} of Peenemünde, looked me up in my office ... and told me, that Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler had sent him with the order to urge me to join the SS. I told him I was so busy with my rocket work that I had no time to spare for any political activity. He then <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> ... <b>the</b> SS would cost me no time at all. I would be awarded the rank of a [...] "Untersturmfuehrer" [...] (lieutenant) and it were [...] a very definite desire of Himmler that I attend his invitation to join.|$|E
2500|$|Sorge {{supplied}} Soviet intelligence {{with information}} about the Anti-Comintern Pact and the German-Japanese Pact. In 1941, through his Embassy contacts, he learned of Operation Barbarossa, the imminent Axis invasion of the USSR, and even the approximate date. On 30 May 1941, Sorge reported to Moscow: [...] "Berlin informed Ott that German attack will commence {{in the latter part}} of June. Ott 95 percent certain war will commence." [...] On 20 June 1941, Sorge reported: [...] "Ott told me that war between Germany and the USSR is inevitable.... Invest [...] <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese General Staff is already discussing what position to take in the event of war.” Moscow received the reports, but ultimately Joseph Stalin and other top leaders ignored Sorge's warnings, as well as those of other sources.|$|E
2500|$|Fred J. Dodge, an {{undercover}} operative for Wells Fargo in Tombstone, asked Curly Bill's associates about his death. He {{wrote that he}} talked to [...] "J. B. Ayers, a saloonkeeper of Charleston where the outlaws and rustlers headquartered, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> men {{who were in the}} fight told him that Wyatt Earp killed Curly Bill and that [...] they took the body away that night and that they buried him on Patterson’s ranch on the Babocomari." [...] The Tombstone Nugget first put up a $1,000 reward for proof Curly Bill lived, and The Tombstone Epitaph countered with a $2,000 reward. Neither was ever collected. Brocius was not wanted by the law in Arizona and if he was not dead had no reason to disappear. He also was unlikely to return to Texas, where according to Wyatt Earp's recollection, he was probably still wanted for murder.|$|E

2500|$|She then {{wrote to}} her mother, Queen Victoria: ...I have heard {{different}} things about poor Rudolf which may perhaps interest you. Prince Bismarck <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> violent scenes and altercations between the Emperor and Rudolf had been the cause of Rudolf's suicide. I replied that I had heard this much doubted, upon which he said Reuss had written {{it and it was}} so! He would send me the despatch to read if I liked, but I have declined. I did not say what I thought, which is that for thirty years I have had the experience of how many lies Prince Bismarck's diplomatic agents (with some exceptions) have written him, and therefore I usually disbelieve what they write completely, unless I know them to be honest and trustworthy men. Szechenyi, the Ambassador at Berlin, whom we know very well, tells me that there had been no scenes with the Emperor, who said to Szechenyi: Dies ist der erste Kummer, den mein Sohn mir macht.|$|E
2500|$|... "In a gully {{above the}} village, I {{saw the first}} body.

[...] They looked like older men, with gray hair or white hair ... They had wounds on their heads, and there was blood on their clothes. [...] I didn't count them. I just looked and saw a lot of holes in the head - in the top of the head and the back of the head. A couple had what appeared to be bullet wounds knocking out their eyes. I was told there were other bodies further up and over the crest of the hill, and I was asked by journalists and inspectors if I was going to go up and see the rest. I said, 'I've seen enough.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Clark often {{expressed}} {{pleasure at}} the flogging of convicts, although rarely performed the punishment himself. After one incident, {{in which a}} particularly troublesome female convict, Elizbaeth Dudgeon, was punished for insulting a guard officer, he noted [...] "she has long been fishing for it, which she has at last got to her heart's content". He did, however, occasionally empathise with the convicts, especially when they were mistreated. Shortly after landing on Norfolk Island, Clark and Robert Kellow came across some convicts, including some women with their children, who {{had been forced to}} sleep in the open far from the main townsite, adequate accommodation being lacking: [...] "on the Road we met a great many of the Convicts both Men and Women Particular the women that have young children Who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> have been obliged to Sleep in the woods all night for the could not get into Town, poor Devils how they are Kick about from one place to a nother". Unusually for the time, Clark was effectively a teetotaller, preferring to drink only lemonade. He often privately chastised his fellow officers' drinking habits, boasting in his diary that he had only been intoxicated once—at his wedding.|$|E
