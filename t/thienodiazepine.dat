5000|$|Bentazepam (also {{known as}} Thiadipone, Tiadipona) is a <b>thienodiazepine</b> {{which is a}} {{benzodiazepine}} analog.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>thienodiazepine</b> is a heterocyclic {{compound}} containing a diazepine ring fused to a thiophene ring.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>thienodiazepines</b> {{interact}} with the benzodiazepine receptor site, they typically have similar effects as benzodiazepines.|$|R
5000|$|... 1,4-Diazepine is a diazepine. It is a core {{element in}} the {{structure}} of benzodiazepines and <b>thienodiazepines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Positive {{allosteric}} modulators: barbiturates, benzodiazepines, certain carbamates (ex. carisoprodol, meprobamate, lorbamate), <b>thienodiazepines,</b> ethanol (alcohol), etomidate, glutethimide, kavalactones, meprobamate, quinazolinones (ex. methaqualone, etaqualone, diproqualone), neuroactive steroids, niacin/niacinamide, nonbenzodiazepines (ex. zolpidem, eszopiclone), propofol, stiripentol, theanine, valerenic acid, volatile/inhaled anesthetics, and lanthanum.|$|R
50|$|Indus Pharmaceuticals is an Indian {{pharmaceutical}} company, {{best known}} for being the primary producer of the <b>Thienodiazepine</b> drug Etizolam, which is produced and marketed under the brand name Etilaam.|$|E
50|$|Clotiazepam (marketed under {{brand name}} Clozan, Distensan, Trecalmo, Rize, Rizen and Veratran) is a <b>thienodiazepine</b> drug {{which is a}} {{benzodiazepine}} analog. The clotiazepam molecule differs from benzodiazepines in that the benzene ring {{has been replaced by}} a thiophene ring. It possesses anxiolytic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, sedative properties. Stage 2 NREM sleep is significantly increased by clotiazepam.|$|E
5000|$|Etizolam, a <b>thienodiazepine</b> derivative, {{is absorbed}} fairly rapidly, with peak plasma levels {{achieved}} between 30 minutes and 2 hours. It has a mean elimination half life of about 3.5 hours. [...] Etizolam possesses potent hypnotic properties, and is comparable with other short-acting benzodiazepines. [...] Etizolam {{acts as a}} full agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor to produce its range of therapeutic and adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thienodiazepine</b> BET inhibitors were {{discovered}} by scientists at Yoshitomi Pharmaceuticals (now Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma) {{in the early}} 1990s, and their potential both as anti-inflammatories and anti-cancer agents noted. However, these molecules remained largely unknown until 2010 when both the use of JQ1 in NUT midline carcinoma and of I-BET 762 in sepsis were published. Since this time a number of molecules have been described {{that are capable of}} targeting BET bromodomains.|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} CPU {{time and the}} wall clock time of the Raffenetti's P file {{algorithm}} with the usual algorithm on the two electron integrals storing with four suffixes of the ab initio Hartree-Fock calculations. The calculations are performed with the flutoprazepam, triazolam, clotiazepam, etizolam, and flutazolam molecules. These molecules are all minor-tranquilizers with the benzodiazepine or <b>thienodiazepine</b> backbone. The 3 - 21 G basis sets ａｒｅ employed. Almost in all cases, P file algorithm gave slower speed than the usual algorithm. The number of two electron integrals increases almost two {{times larger than the}} usual algorithms. In a large molecule, the matrix of the two electron integrals becomes very sparse and the recombination of the integrals just increases the total number of the integrals. It is concluded that the P method sometimes calculates faster but sometimes does not. In a large scale calculation, it should be suggested to perform a test calculation to confirm which method is faster prior to the real calculations. Copyrightは日本コンピュータ化学会, J-STAGEよりダウンロードして使用...|$|E
40|$|The anti-ulcer {{action of}} {{clotiazepam}} (a <b>thienodiazepine</b> derivative) was studied in mice subjected to non-physical and physical stimuli in a communication box. There were {{two groups of}} mice: the &# 34;sender&# 34; mice that received electric shocks on the feet and responded by squealing and jumping, and the &# 34;responder&# 34; mice that were affected by the senders' responses without receiving shocks on the feet. Gastric ulcers resulted in both groups. The effect of clotiazepam was {{compared with that of}} diazepam. The incidence of gastric ulcers was suppressed by clotiazepam at a dose of 3 mg/kg, per os, in &# 34;responder&# 34; and &# 34;sender&# 34; mice, and by diazepam at a dose of 1 mg/kg, per os, in &# 34;responder&# 34; mice. These results suggest that clotiazepam has a suppressive action against gastric ulcers produced by non-physical or physical stimuli, although its potency is slightly weaker than that of diazepam. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen healthy male volunteers {{ingested}} {{a single}} 0. 25 mg {{dose of the}} <b>thienodiazepine</b> hypnotic, brotizolam, on two occasions: once with a typical social cocktail (containing 60 ml of vodka), and in a second trial with an 'ethanol-placebo' cocktail. Brotizolam kinetics were determined from multiple plasma concentrations measured during the 24 h after dosage. Coadministration of brotizolam with ethanol, {{as opposed to the}} placebo cocktail, slightly imparied brotizolam clearance (1. 85 vs 2. 19 ml min- 1 kg- 1 P less than 0. 005), increased peak plasma concentrations (5. 3 vs 4. 3 ng ml- 1, P less than 0. 05), and prolonged elimination half-life (5. 2 vs 4. 4 h, P less than 0. 05). There was evidence of impairment of performance, although not statistically significant, for the first 4 - 6 h after brotizolam dosage in the reaction time test, the digit-symbol substitution test, and a tracking task. None of these was enhanced by ethanol. In both trials, brotizolam produced significant increases in self-rated perceptions of sedation, fatigue, feeling 'spaced-out', and thinking slowed down. These effects were more intense during the brotizolam-ethanol as compared to brotizolam-placebo. In both trials, recovery was essentially complete by 6 - 8 h after dosage. Coadministration of brotizolam with ethanol produces a small but significant impairment of brotizolam clearance. Brotizolam produced self-rated perceptions of sedation and fatigue during 4 - 6 h after dosage, but objective impairment of psychomotor performance was minimal. Subjective perceptions of sedation were enhanced by ethanol coadministration, but the effects on psychomotor performance were not...|$|E
