5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.|$|E
5|$|When Marsh {{responded to}} Lakes, {{he paid the}} {{prospector}} $100, urging him to keep the finds a secret. Learning that Lakes had corresponded with Cope, Marsh sent his field collector Benjamin Mudge to Morrison to secure Lakes' services. Marsh published a description of Lakes' discoveries in the American Journal of Science on July 1, and before Cope could publish his own interpretation of the finds, Lakes wrote <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bones should be shipped to Marsh, a severe insult to Cope.|$|E
5|$|When a Bullhampton farmer is {{murdered in}} the course of a burglary, {{suspicion}} falls on Sam Brattle and his associates. Fenwick believes in Sam's innocence, and acts as one of his bondsmen. Through Sam he discovers Carry's whereabouts, and resolves to rescue her if he can. He finds her a temporary home, but it becomes clear <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only permanent solution must involve bringing her back into the Brattle family, which means winning her father's forgiveness.|$|E

5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits {{that he intends to}} auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps {{the best example of}} fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E

5|$|Still uneasy {{over their}} split, Finn tries {{to show off}} to Flame Princess, though she informs him that they should only remain friends. They return to the kingdom, its {{entrance}} now guarded by the inhabitants. Finn goes directly for the guards, but he and Flame Princess are quickly captured after she reveals <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people are being controlled through Don John's spell. Don John visits the imprisoned duo, where Flame Princess vows never to marry him. Don John complains to the Flame King that he is failing to deliver on his promise. The lord and king box, with the latter authority knocking out Don John, which frees the Flame people from his spell. Cinnamon Bun delivers {{a speech to the}} palace convincing the people to detain the Flame King and Don John while earning the affections of Flame Princess.|$|E
5|$|The {{far left}} wing, under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, guarded the Rhine border from Mannheim to Switzerland. This {{part of the}} army {{included}} the conscripts drafted from the imperial circles. Charles {{did not like to}} use the militias in any vital location and once it seemed clear <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French intended to cross at the middle Rhine, the Archduke felt no qualms placing his militia men at Kehl. In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands, the occasional journeyman, and day laborers drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. The remainder of the force included experienced troops from the Habsburg frontier troops stationed just north of Rastatt and a cadre of French royalists and a couple hundred mercenaries at Freiburg im Breisgau.|$|E
5|$|The serial {{continues}} the loose chronology of the Quatermass adventures. Workmen excavating {{a site in}} Knightsbridge, London, discover a strange skull and what at first {{appears to be an}} unexploded bomb. Quatermass and his newly appointed military superior at the British Experimental Rocket Group, Colonel Breen, become involved in the investigation when it becomes apparent that the object is an alien spacecraft. The ship and its contents have a powerful and malign influence over many of those who come in contact with it, including Quatermass. It becomes obvious <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aliens, probably from Mars, had been abducting pre-humans and modifying them to give them psychic abilities much like their own before returning them to Earth, a genetic legacy responsible for much of the war and strife in the world.|$|E

5|$|Herbert de Losinga was {{appointed}} a papal legate in 1093 by Pope UrbanII {{to investigate the}} matter of Thomas' profession of obedience to Lanfranc. Herbert seems to have done nothing about investigating the issue. Also in 1093, King WilliamII gave the Archbishops of York the right to appoint the Abbot of Selby Abbey in compensation {{for the loss of}} York's claim to the Diocese of Lincoln. While Anselm was in exile after quarrelling with the King in 1097, Thomas consecrated Herbert de Losinga as Bishop of Norwich, Ralph de Luffa to the See of Chichester, and Hervey le Breton as Bishop of Bangor, an unusual step because these dioceses were in Canterbury's province, and it was Anselm's right to consecrate the new bishops. In 1100 after the sudden death of King WilliamII and the seizure of power by the King's younger brother Henry, Thomas arrived in London too late to crown HenryI, as the ceremony had already been performed by Maurice, Bishop of London, in the absence of both archbishops. Anselm at this time was still in exile. Thomas was initially angry at the slight, until it was explained <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> King had worried over the chance of disorder in the kingdom if there was a delay. To mollify him, Thomas was allowed to crown the King publicly at a church council held soon after the coronation.|$|E
25|$|During {{those years}} {{there was also}} work on human fossil anatomy and anthropology. In 1862 he {{examined}} the Neanderthal skull-cap, which had been discovered in 1857. It was the first pre-sapiens discovery of a fossil man, and it was immediately clear <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> brain case was surprisingly large.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{reconnaissance}} missions {{before the}} bombing suggests <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Legion intended {{the destruction of the}} town rather than a specific target. Reconnaissance missions had been ordered as a prerequisite before raids around built-up areas on 6 January 1937. The intent of the order was to minimize civilian deaths and it had been issued by Mola, then Supreme Commander of the Air Force Salamanca.|$|E

25|$|In 1981 A. Lamar Byrd, {{a dentist}} in Southern California, sold his {{practice}} and invested the $160,000 proceeds with Dean Witter Reynolds, a retail brokerage firm.

Byrd claimed that the broker was using his account to churn, or making trades primarily to generate commissions for himself.|$|E

Over time, it became clear <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game {{would need to be}} {{released}} only under the Open Game License. Releasing the game under the d20 Standard Trademark License, as originally planned, would have prohibited the inclusion of ability generation and character advancement rules. Presenting a complete game was seen as taking precedence over having a d20 logo on the product, so {{the decision was made to}} use the OGL without the d20 license.|$|E
25|$|Years {{pass and}} Kamin grows old, outliving his wife. Kamin and his {{daughter}} Meribor continue their study of the drought.

Ultimately, Kamin confronts a government official who privately admits <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government already knows this but wishes to keep it a secret to avoid a panic. The official gravely points out to Kamin that they only just recently managed to successfully launch artificial satellites using primitive rockets: their race simply does not possess the technology level needed to evacuate even a small colony's worth of people before their planet is rendered uninhabitable.|$|E
25|$|The Crathie was a steamer {{of about}} 475 tons gross and 272 net. She left Rotterdam with general cargo for Aberdeen on January 29, 1895 {{carrying}} just 12 hands. The Craithie was also badly damaged in the collision {{and returned to}} Rotterdam flying signals of distress. When later asked why they had not stayed on to help the Elbe and her passengers, the captain, Alexander Gordon, said that he feared that his ship would sink, {{and in any case}} he did not hear any cries for help coming from the liner. It appeared <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Elbe was steaming away from his position.|$|E
