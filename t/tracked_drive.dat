It is designed with three degrees of freedom and two <b>tracked</b> <b>drive</b> systems. This robot consists of two modular mobile units and a joint unit. The mobile unit is a tracked mechanism to enforce the propulsion of robot. And the joint unit can transform the robot shape to get high environment adaptation. A-If robot can not only adapt to the environment but also change its body shape according to the locus space. It behaves two work states including the linear state (named as I state) and the parallel state (named as II state). With the linear state the robot can climb upstairs and go through narrow space such as the pipe,cave,etc. The parallel state enables the robot with high mobility on rough ground. Also,the joint unit can propel the robot to roll in sidewise direction. Two modular A-II robots can be connected through jointing common interfaces on the joint unit to com [...] .

40|$|Among combat {{vehicles}} high {{values have}} tracked combat vehicles. They {{are the most}} universal means of combat, both in offensive and in defense actions. About the usefulness of tanks decide the main battle features, which will include fire power, protection and mobility. The fire power is a feature that describes the quantity, quality and efficiency {{in terms of the}} main weapons system. Mobility of tanks reflects the dynamics of motion and manoeuvrability. On the mobility a large impact has: engine, transmission and <b>tracked</b> <b>drive</b> system. Protections (armour, together with additional systems) decide on the resistance to the enemy fire and the survival ability of the vehicle, crew and internal equipment. This paper presents the impact loads on a load-bearing structures of combat vehicle. Load is generated by the anti-tank mine shock wave. Models of objects were worked out using a method of the finite element, assuming the linear characteristics of elements. Studies of loads {{of the structure of the}} special vehicle body were carried out for the selected, the most common effects of explosives. Worked out research allows: determining the pressure distribution, evaluating the impact resistance of the hulls of vehicles, predicting the results of impact action, identifying the types of damage, designing or modernization of the hulls of vehicles...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{natural and}} {{man-made}} devastations have urged {{the research on}} the Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) robot systems. This paper presents a novel shape-shifting mobile robot system named as Amoeba H (A-H) for the urban search and rescue application. It has been designed with three degrees of freedom (DOFs) and two <b>tracked</b> <b>drive</b> systems. This robot consists of two modular mobile units and a joint unit. The mobile unit is a tracked mechanism to enforce the propulsion of robot. The joint unit can transform the robot shape for getting high mobility. A-II robot not only can adapt to the environment but also can change its body corresponding to locus space. It behaves two states including the parallel state (named as H state) and the linear state (named as I state). The parallel state enables the robot with high mobility on rough ground. With the linear state the robot can climb upstairs and go through narrow space such as the pipe, cave etc. Also, the joint unit can propel the robot to roll in sidewise direction. Especially, two modular A-II robots can be connected through jointing common interfaces on the joint unit to compose a stronger shape-shifting robot, which can transform the body into four wheels-driven vehicle. Finally, the elementary experimental results validate the adaptation and its mobility. IEEE, RS...|$|E

40|$|The {{versatility}} {{of current}} rovers and exploratory vehicles {{is limited by}} a single drive system. The Variable Drive Vehicle (VDV) employs a actuated systemcapable of switching between wheeled and <b>tracked</b> <b>drive</b> modes. This allows the vehicle to travel quickly and efficiently over smooth terrain and to traverse more arduous terrain by switching between these two systems. The small scale prototype built {{over the course of}} this project is equipped with two modular wheel driven track units to demonstrate the viability of the system. Electric linear actuators and servo motors allow for simple control and a smooth transition between each drive system. These devices allow the modular tracks to be rotated out from under the wheels, and stowed on the vehicle when not in use. Finite element analysis ensured that the VDV’s switchingmechanism maintains safe loading at its most critical points during a drive system transition. The VDV was tested on smooth concrete to determine its maximum wheel speed, track speed, and how fast the drive system could be switched. Experiments yielded a top speed of 11. 5 mph in the wheel mode, 0. 8 mph in the track mode, and a switching time of 6. 4 seconds. The vehicle’smaximumobstacle clearance, 1 inch in track mode and 2 inches in wheel mode, and slope, 5 degrees in track mode and 22 degrees in wheel mode, fell short of expected values. These shortcomings resulted from a poor frictional power transfer when attempting to power the tracks using the wheels. However, this prototype provides a proof of concept for a variable drive system successfully incorporating two drive systems, and future improvements may yield a promising platformfor future robotics research...|$|E
