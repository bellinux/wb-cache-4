5|$|In 2011, Alabama {{came into}} the season ranked No.2 in both preseason polls. The Crimson Tide won eight {{consecutive}} games to open the season before they lost to then No.1-ranked LSU 9–6 in overtime. Alabama then won its remaining games and finished the regular season with eleven wins and one loss (11–1) and secured their fourth consecutive ten-win season. The Crimson Tide then finished No.2 in the final BCS rankings over both Oklahoma State and Stanford {{to set up a}} rematch against LSU in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In the game, Alabama defeated LSU 21–0, allowed only 92 yards of total offense, and became the first team in BCS bowl history <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> their opponent.

Against the No. 15 Clemson Tigers, Wake gave up 24 points {{in the fourth quarter}} to give Clemson a 27-17 victory. The Demon Deacons recovered quickly from the loss and proceeded to begin another winning streak, this time against ACC opponents. Over the next four weeks, Wake defeated North Carolina State, North Carolina, No. 16 Boston College, and Florida State. The 30-0 win over Florida State marked several milestones for the Deacons. The win marked the first time in school history that the Deacons had earned nine wins in a single season. In addition, Wake Forest recorded its first win against Florida State in Tallahassee since 1959 and became the first team <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> a Bobby Bowden-coached Florida State team in Doak Campbell Stadium. The game continues to be celebrated in Tallahassee, as it marked the end of the Jeff Bowden era.|$|E
5|$|Grove {{started the}} 1944 season with an {{interesting}} honor: {{he was assigned}} to the 4-F All-Star team, a group of 25 major league players who were the best of those exempt from military service. Grove was given the job of being the Opening Day starting pitcher for the White Sox. He pitched {{the first game of the}} season against the Cleveland Indians and their starting pitcher, Al Smith, on April 19, 1944, and won 3–1. Grove also managed <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> the Yankees on May 18; it was the first time the Yankees had not scored a run in 1944. By mid-season, Grove had seven wins, six losses, five complete games, and a 3.40 ERA. Because of these statistics, he was selected to the American League All-Star team, his first and only career appearance. Five American League pitchers pitched in the All-Star Game on July 11, although Grove was one of the four on the roster who did not; therefore, his lone All-Star appearance was indeed only an appearance. During the second half of the season, Grove performed well at Comiskey Park, but struggled on the road, at one point losing five straight games despite good run support from the White Sox. Grove finished the season with 14 wins, 15 losses, an ERA of 3.72, two shutouts, and a career best of nearly 235 innings pitched.|$|E

25|$|Insomnia is {{a general}} term for {{difficulty}} falling asleep and staying asleep. Insomnia {{is the most common}} sleep problem, with many adults reporting occasional insomnia, and 10–15% reporting a chronic condition. Insomnia can have many different causes, including psychological stress, a poor sleep environment, an inconsistent sleep schedule, or excessive mental or physical stimulation in the hours before bedtime. Insomnia is often treated through behavioral changes like keeping a regular sleep schedule, avoiding stimulating or stressful activities before bedtime, and cutting down on stimulants such as caffeine. The sleep environment may be improved by installing heavy drapes <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> all sunlight, and keeping computers, televisions and work materials out of the sleeping area.|$|E
25|$|The Panthers forced five turnovers, {{limited the}} Giants to only 109 yards of total offense, {{and became the}} first club <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> a home playoff team since the Los Angeles Rams shut out the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1979 NFC Championship Game. Although the Giants entered the game with Pro Bowler Tiki Barber {{starting}} at running back, the Panthers running game, featuring DeShaun Foster and Nick Goings, outgained the Giants 223 yards to 41 on the ground. Carolina wide receiver Steve Smith caught 10 passes for 84 yards and scored two touchdowns, a 22-yard reception and a 12-yard run, while kicker John Kasay added three field goals and Foster rushed for 151 yards.

The Bears defense was able <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> the Sun Devils in the fourth quarter, intercepting Carpenter {{for a second time}} and forcing a fumble that forced them to punt. A Sun Devils field goal attempt in the final minute of the quarter missed.

25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} season on March 31 against the San Francisco Giants at Dodger Stadium.

The incident would provoke increased security at future home games {{as well as a}} joint fundraiser by the two teams in support of the man's family. Back on the field, the Dodgers took the second game of the series also, as some aggressive baserunning by Matt Kemp and two Giants errors were just enough offense to back a solid start by Chad Billingsley in the 4–3 win. Matt Cain and three relievers combined <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>out</b> the Dodgers 10–0 the following day, as Ted Lilly and Kenley Jansen each gave up four runs in the loss.
