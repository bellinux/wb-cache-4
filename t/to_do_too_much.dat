Harris held Haig {{responsible for the}} extension of the objectives in the north to the German second position, which diluted the density of British artillery-fire, although because no study had been made of the details of the preliminary bombardment, caution must accompany a conclusion that bombardment of the closer objectives was unduly dissipated. Harris concluded that the attack front was too broad and that Rawlinson should be held responsible with Haig, for attempting to advance on a [...] front.

50|$|Furthermore, modern CPUs have {{instruction}} pipelines that queue {{instructions for}} execution. A processor with multiple execution units can perform {{more than one}} instruction per cycle if more than one instruction {{is available in the}} pipeline. Branching (the use of conditionals like if) makes it harder for the processor to fill its pipeline(s) because the CPU cannot tell what it needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in advance. <b>Too</b> <b>much</b> branching makes the pipeline less effective and potentially reduces the number of instructions the processor can execute per cycle. Many bitboard operations require fewer conditionals and therefore increase pipelining and make effective use of multiple execution units on many CPUs.|$|R
2500|$|The {{coaching}} {{began to}} be criticized after a pair of midseason losses to the Minnesota Vikings and Denver Broncos. Denver players stated that shutting down Jimmie Giles {{was all it took}} to stop the Buccaneer offense, while the defense was still vulnerable to a short-yardage, ball-control attack. McKay felt that the team had become an [...] "aerial circus" [...] and that Williams' performance was being affected by trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> and so made a decision to establish a running game, taking over playcalling responsibilities on running plays. Having lost 4 of their last 5 games, there was concern that, about to face a Green Bay Packers team on a three-game win streak, the Buccaneers were about to repeat the late-season slides of the last three seasons. After breaking their two-game losing streak by routing the Packers, the Buccaneers demonstrated a newfound ability to continue to stick to and execute their game plan when playing with a deficit. Quarterbacks coach Bill Nelsen correctly predicted that the Buccaneers' performance against the Packers would cause the Vikings to underestimate the Packers, and thus lose their matchup the following week. Nelsen admonished the team not to miss a chance to take charge of the division, and they responded with an uncharacteristic rebound from a 14-point deficit against the Saints. A Week 14 last-minute victory over the Atlanta Falcons, combined with upset losses by the Lions and Vikings the same day, left the Buccaneers needing to win only one of their last two games to make the playoffs. They were one of only five teams in Week 15 who were capable of winning a division championship without help from another team. The season ended with a matchup against the Detroit Lions in front of a Pontiac Silverdome-record crowd of 80,444, with the Buccaneers and Lions tied for the division lead at 8–7. A season-ending New York Giants win against the Dallas Cowboys left the Giants at 9–7, guaranteeing that the winner of the Buccaneers-Lions game would win the division (the Packers were still in contention, but required an improbable set of circumstances that included a Buccaneers-Lions tie), while the loser would miss the playoffs entirely. Although the Lions outplayed the Buccaneers in most statistical categories, numerous Buccaneers stepped forward with key plays at crucial moments in the game, resulting in an upset victory. A crowd of over 8,000 gathered at team headquarters to greet them on their return from Detroit. The Buccaneers traveled to Dallas for a matchup with the Cowboys, where they suffered an embarrassing 38–0 shutout.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with evaluating value at risk estimates.

However, most of the specification tests (also called backtests) avaliable in the literature, such as Christoffersen (1998) and Engle and Maganelli (2004) are based on such variables. In this paper we propose a new backtest that does not realy solely on binary variable. It is show that the new backtest provides a sufficiant condition to assess the performance of a quantile model whereas the existing ones do not. The proposed methodology allows us to identify periods of an increased risk exposure based on a quantile regression model (Koenker & Xiao, 2002). Our theorical findings are corroborated through a monte Carlo simulation and an empirical exercise with daily S&P 500 time series. ...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{choice is}} a watchword {{of the market}} reforms now {{sweeping}} the U. S. health care system. Policy makers, however, must grapple with an important ambiguity: is the objec-tive to expand choice or protect choosers, {{and what should be}} done if the two goals con-flict? Concerns about health care market malfunctions trigger a politics of consumer pro-tection that may emphasize regulatory standards over market flexibility. To complicate matters further, hopes that deluging consumers with information can ensure that choices are at once ample and prudent are likely to be disappointed. What <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>too</b> <b>much</b> information is the great riddle of our time. Theodore Zeldin (1994, 18) In health policy, “choice”—process, symbol, theoretical linchpin of market visions—is now ubiquitous. It is also richly ambiguous. Talk about “protect-ing and promoting consumer choice ” often means two different things, namely, ensuring that consumers have the power to make appropriately abundant choices and ensuring that the products (health plans and providers) from among which consumers choose are safe and reliable. The first meaning expands the range of choices, depends on consumers to shop and buy pru-dently, and invigorates the market. The second eliminates harmful choices, invokes regulation to protect consumers, and expects government to police and discipline the market. The two crudely correspond to Isaiah Berlin’s famous two concepts of liberty. Negative freedom defines a sphere of non...|$|R
