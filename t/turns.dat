5|$|Abrahams Creek {{begins in}} Franklin Township. It flows {{south-southwest}} {{for a short}} distance before turning south for several tenths of a mile, passing through the border between Dallas Township, Franklin Township, and Kingston Township, and entering Kingston Township. The creek then continues south {{for more than a}} mile before turning southeast and eventually entering Frances Slocum Lake. On the southeastern end of the lake, the creek <b>turns</b> east-northeast for more than a mile, entering a deep valley. It then <b>turns</b> south-southeast for a few miles, entering West Wyoming flowing through a water gap. The creek then <b>turns</b> southeast for some distance before turning southwest and entering Wyoming. It then <b>turns</b> west-southwest for a few miles before turning south and then west. The creek then <b>turns</b> south again, crossing US Route 11. It then <b>turns</b> southwest for more than a mile, entering Forty Fort and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, two {{different}} <b>turning</b> processes namely rotational <b>turning</b> and hard <b>turning</b> are compared {{to each other}} regarding surface generation aspects. By experiments it is shown that, with higher feed rates, rotational <b>turning</b> yields same surface quality as hard <b>turning.</b> Feed rates can be chosen six times higher in rotational <b>turning</b> than in conventional hard <b>turning</b> without losses in the surface roughness quality. Also experiments reveal that the tool wear in rotational <b>turning</b> has a beneficial effect on the surface roughness. A corresponding explanation model is thereby presented which takes the specific tool/work piece engagement in rotational <b>turning</b> into account. Furthermore, it is shown that rotational <b>turning</b> has negative effects on the surface integrity. The phase transformation zones (“white layers”) are thicker in rotational <b>turned</b> parts than in hard <b>turned</b> parts. Also the level of tensile residual stress in rotational <b>turning</b> is higher than in hard <b>turning.</b> Both effects are probably caused by high thermal material loads in rotational <b>turning</b> due to increased friction. However, {{the results of this}} paper show that rotational <b>turning</b> has a high potential to become an efficient alternative to hard <b>turning,</b> {{especially when it comes to}} large scale production of simple shaped parts...|$|R

5|$|M-149 is a rural two-lane {{highway that}} {{starts in the}} {{community}} of Thompson southwest of Manistique on Lake Michigan. It runs west-northwesterly through woodlands away from a junction with US2 along a small pond in the area. The road curves to the north and passes the cemetery and some small farms south of a crossing with a line of the Canadian National Railway. North of the tracks, the road meets County Road 442 (CR442) near Indian Lake. M-149 <b>turns</b> to the west at that junction while CR442 runs easterly to connect to the main unit of the Indian Lake State Park. The highway continues to a junction with CR455, which connects to the western unit of the state part, after which the trunkline <b>turns</b> to the northwest through forested terrain. The highway <b>turns</b> back to the west before intersecting another CR442 in the area. At this junction, M-149 <b>turns</b> to the north where it continues for several miles until curving eastward.

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} early head <b>turning,</b> we retrospectively studied {{videotapes of}} 262 seizures from 82 {{patients who were}} seizure free after temporal lobectomy. Early head movements were arbitrarily classified into non-tonic <b>turning,</b> tonic <b>turning,</b> and absence of <b>turning.</b> Among the 222 seizures which showed early head <b>turning,</b> 168 (75. 7 %) had non-tonic <b>turning</b> and 54 (24. 3 %) had tonic <b>turning.</b> The direction of the first head <b>turning</b> was ipsilateral to the epileptogenic foci in 132 (78. 6 %) seizures with non-tonic <b>turning</b> and in 35 (64. 8 %) seizures showing tonic head <b>turning.</b> The proportion of seizures with <b>turning</b> towards the ipsilateral side {{in the presence of}} tonic and non-tonic head <b>turning</b> were significantly different (P= 0. 04). Seventy-four seizures (28. 2 %) evolved to secondary generalization, more frequently found in seizures with early head <b>turning</b> (P= 0. 0015) and especially those showing tonic <b>turning</b> (P< 0. 0001). The direction of head <b>turning</b> immediately preceding secondary generalization was contralateral to the lesion side in 53 seizures (82. 8 %). Dystonic upper limb posturing occurred in 86 seizures (32. 8 %), exclusively contralateral to the seizure focus, whereas 65 (75. 6 %) were associated with initial head <b>turning</b> ipsilateral to the focus. In summary, temporal lobe seizures with tonic head <b>turning</b> tends to secondarily generalize and the direction of head <b>turning</b> before secondarily generalized was contralateral to the seizure foci. Earlier in the seizures the direction of non-tonic head <b>turning</b> tends to be towards the epileptogenic hemisphere. In addition, dystonic posturing of the extremities is a significant lateralizing sign to the contralateral hemisphere in temporal lobe seizures...|$|R
