25|$|D'Erlon {{sent two}} battalions {{downhill}} <b>to</b> <b>hustle</b> {{the withdrawal of}} Pringle's brigade. The bulk of Darmagnac's division began pressing west along the ridge top. By this time, Maransin's division put in an appearance {{on the main road}} while Abbé's division crowded up behind Darmagnac. In the face of this threat, Cameron sent {{the right wing of the}} 71st Foot (Highlanders) to stop the Darmagnac's division, which was formed into a thick swarm of skirmishers by this time.

At 2:00 pm Stewart finally showed up to find the British position critical. Seeing that the pass was lost, he issued orders to withdraw from the crest and reform a new line farther back.

500|$|For one commentator, [...] "The Bill" [...] was {{the closest}} episode of Inside No. 9 to The League of Gentlemen, an earlier project of Shearsmith and Pemberton's, due to its use of gallows humour and back-and-forth dialogue.
