25|$|The initial attack {{focused on}} {{extinguishing}} {{the fire in}} the loading dock area, with a secondary effort to search for and evacuate people inside, and prevent the fire from spreading to <b>the</b> <b>showroom</b> and warehouse. Crews entering <b>the</b> <b>showroom</b> reportedly initially encountered clear visibility with only very light puffs of smoke visible near the ceiling at the back of <b>the</b> <b>showroom.</b> Shortly thereafter, an exterior door was opened near where the fire was raging. Efforts to close the door failed, allowing the fire to enter <b>the</b> <b>showroom.</b> Firefighters were ordered to stretch two hose lines into <b>the</b> <b>showroom</b> to attack the spreading fire; however, the pre-connected hose line from one of the units was too short. This required some firefighters to again exit the building to add additional sections of hose, and left only one small handline to hold back the growing fire. At about this time, fire dispatchers advised the crews on-scene that they had received a 9-1-1 call from an employee who was trapped in the warehouse, which required some firefighters to direct their attention to the rescue. The trapped employee was eventually rescued by firefighters who breached an exterior wall to reach him.|$|E

Do they get ideas from <b>the</b> <b>showrooms</b> or are they looking for a specific furniture? These types of questions have increased young people´s interest for design and decoration over the last decade.

Meanwhile, efforts to stretch and begin operating additional hose lines continued. At 7:41p.m. <b>the</b> <b>showroom</b> area of the store experienced a flashover while at least sixteen firefighters were working inside. The flashover contributed to the rapid deterioration of the structural integrity of the building, leading to a near-complete collapse of the roof minutes later. Many of the firefighters caught in the flashover were unable to escape and were trapped under the collapsed roof and shelving weakened by the fast-spreading fire.

A total of 19 volatile organic compounds (aromatic compounds, aldehydes and terpenes) were investigated and quantified. Additionally, levels of the same chemicals were measured in the private houses of the car vendors for comparison purposes. All measurements were taken using passive samplers over a consecutive time period of 5 days.
