5|$|The Normans {{transformed}} Carmarthen into {{an international}} trading port, the only staple port in Wales. Merchants imported food and French wines and exported wool, pelts, leather, lead and tin. In the late medieval period the county's fortunes varied, as good and bad harvests occurred, increased taxes were levied by England, there were episodes of plague, and recruitment for wars removed <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men.</b> Carmarthen was particularly susceptible to plague as it was brought in by flea-infested rats on board ships from southern France.|$|E
5|$|The first camp {{opened on}} May 15, 1941 near Baltimore, Maryland. A total of 152 camps and units were {{established}} {{over the next}} six years.

50|$|The prototypical {{story of}} the Holy Fool is that of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who asks to {{accompany}} the prophet Elijah. The prophet agrees {{on the condition that}} <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> not question his behaviour. Along their journey the prophet does, what to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> appear as, a number of outrageous and inexplicable things. Finally, unable to stay quiet <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> protests. Elijah clearly explains to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> everything that he did, so that it makes perfect sense, {{and at the same time}} he parts company with him.|$|R
50|$|A game {{is usually}} {{conducted}} as follows. A <b>young</b> <b>man</b> on horseback waits at a starting line. A young woman, also mounted, starts her horse galloping from a given distance behind <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman passes <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> he may start his horse galloping.

If <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> {{is able to}} catch up to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman before they reach the finish line, he may reach out to her and steal a kiss, which constitutes victory. However, if <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> has not caught up to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman by <b>the</b> time they reach the finish line, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman turns around and chases <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> back to <b>the</b> starting line.

5|$|As {{one of the}} few routes into hilly central Westchester, {{the river}} and its {{associated}} roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking near the river crossing on the Dobbs Ferry Road (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> taunted their rivals, who beat them so severely that two later died.

5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood {{with the group}} of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, {{risk-taking}} men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the frail and sickly vice-President in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Eventually many of <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.|$|E

Farkas sought a volunteer to teach junior leader training at the academy and Bánáthy volunteered. Farkas also asked Bánáthy to organize a Scout Troop for young men, 19 years and older, which was a common practice within the Hungarian Scout Association at the time. Bánáthy became committed to training <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> in officer's leadership skills; he served as the voluntary national director for youth leadership development {{and a member of the}} National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) {{established}} ten {{camps in}} Moshannon State Forest, and ten in Elk State Forest. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> of the CCC planted trees, blazed new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which {{continued to be}} a problem. In 1938 a fast-moving fire in the Elk State Forest, north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters. The CCC also built structures and established or improved many of the state parks, including Parker Dam and S. B. Elliott State Parks on the western Quehanna plateau. The United States' entry into World War II ended the CCC, and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942. The Quehanna Trail System passes near or through the sites of several former CCC camps.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Arlington's largest {{employers}} remained its shingle mills and saw mills. Other industries, including dairy processing, mechanical shops, stores, and factories, became prominent after World War I, {{during a period}} of growth for the city. The Great Depression of the 1930s forced {{all but one of the}} mills to close, causing unemployment to rise in Arlington and neighboring cities. The federal government established a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp near Darrington to create temporary jobs; <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> built structures and conducted firefighting in the Mount Baker National Forest. The Works Progress Administration and Civil Works Administration funded the construction of the city's sidewalks, a high school, and a municipal airport that opened in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Skiklubben Ull {{was founded}} on 29 January 1883, and named after the Norse deity Ullr. In Norse mythology, Ullr was a god for hunting and competition, {{superior}} with his skis and his bow.

The club founders were a group of university students who socialized in apartments in Wessels gate. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> usually conversed about their studies or played card games, {{but they were also}} hobby cross-country skiers, and decided to take up skiing in a more organized form by starting a club.

5|$|In {{training}} his men, al-Qassam {{stressed that}} maintaining good character was of paramount importance. As such, fighters should {{provide for the}} needy, aid people with illness, maintain good ties {{with their families and}} pray regularly to God. These virtues, he claimed, were prerequisites to being disciplined and fearless fighters. The moral component of al-Qassam's teachings were especially geared towards <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> of Haifa's labor slums who lived away from their families and who were exposed to activities considered immoral in Islam. He viewed marriage as key to preventing the moral corruption of young men and managed to financially aid his more destitute supporters with their wedding expenses. He encouraged his men to grow beards as a sign of their commitment to jihad and to carry a Qur'an with them wherever they went. Although many of his followers had been illiterate, he taught them how to read and write using the Qur'an as their basis for learning. Al-Qassam also asked his fighters to engage in the spiritual exercises practiced by the Qadiriyya Sufi order and to recite Sufi chants before battle.|$|E

Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> of Lac Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, Lac du Flambeau or other bands beyond La Pointe from going against the Dakota. Historians take this to mean that while he was regarded as the head spokesman of the Ojibwa in Wisconsin, he could not control the day-to-day affairs of all the bands, which were highly decentralized, particularly about warfare. Buffalo also said that, unlike the British before the War of 1812, the U.S. Government had not done enough to help maintain the peace among the tribes.|$|E
