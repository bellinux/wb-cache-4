500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Reese and Wernick were on set every day, which Reynolds {{personally}} {{paid for}} after Fox was unwilling to. The writers had scripted the action very specifically, [...] "every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators {{were free to}} change this. Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the stunt coordinators for the film; Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage. The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors, with Skrein working [...] "nonstop" [...] to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds [...] "has a photographic memory; he'd do something {{three or four times}} and remember it very well." [...] A lot of the jokes in the film were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds. He said that the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one written in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints. Reese said, for example, Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic, but on set Reynolds improvised the line [...] "You know it’s funny how I only see <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> here. It’s like the studio couldn’t afford any more X-Men." [...] This was based in truth, and became then Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos’ favorite line.|$|E

She is also the second Asian American contestant to be crowned Miss America (the first was Filipino American Angela Perez Baraquio in 2001). NPR's Michael Martin commented on this aspect of her win by noting that “there were five Asian-Americans competing for the crown. That's the highest number in pageant history.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} aimed to compare the growth indices in 2 years old children {{with a history of}} low birth weight with normal birth weight children. Methods: Current retrospective cohort study on all two-year children with low birth weight and three times the normal weight children covered by health centers of Kahnooj, was conducted in 2015. Cares at birth, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months of age were studied and, child growth indices (weight, height, head circumference), along with some demographic variables were studied. Information were entered SPSS version 20 and the analysis was performed. Results: There were significant differences in children's growth of both groups in all periods of care. Despite the same slope, growth pattern in children showed a significant difference. Young mother, girl sex of baby and preterm birth are predictor factors of low birth weight. Conclusion: Trends and growth patterns of weight, height and head circumference in underweight children have significant difference with normal children and, despite the same slope, these children can not compensate for the backwardness of its growth to <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>two.</b> So <b>you</b> need to plot separate growth curves for these children and, possible preventive measures should be taken to prevent bearing underweight baby. </p...|$|R

2500|$|After the Battle of Jiangling in 209, Cao Cao left Li Dian, Zhang Liao and Yue Jin {{to defend}} Hefei, a {{strategic}} location {{at the border}} between Cao Cao and Sun Quan's territories. Around 214, when Sun Quan led his forces to attack Hefei, Zhang Liao wanted to lead their troops {{out of the city}} to resist the enemy. However, Zhang Liao was aware that the three of them could not get along with each other and he was worried that they would not comply with his orders. Zhang Liao said, [...] "Our lord is away at war. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for. So he's actually instructing us {{to take advantage of the}} situation, when the enemy has just arrived and not fully gathered yet, to attack them and devastate their morale so as to calm our men and strengthen our defences. Victory or defeat, it all depends on this battle. Why are <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> still hesitating?" [...] Li Dian was moved and he said, [...] "This is a national crisis. We'll see how your strategy works out. How can I allow my personal issues take precedence over my official duties?" [...] Zhang Liao, Li Dian and Yue Jin then worked together and succeeded in defeating and driving away Sun Quan's much larger army. Li Dian was rewarded with an additional 100 taxable households in his marquisate, bringing the total number of households to 300.|$|E
2500|$|When Cao Cao retreated {{after being}} {{defeated}} by Sun Quan and Liu Bei at the Battle of Red Cliffs {{in the winter}} of 208–209, he left behind Zhang Liao, Yue Jin and Li Dian with about 7,000 soldiers to guard Hefei (合肥; present-day Hefei, Anhui) from possible attacks by Sun Quan. In around 214, before Cao Cao went on a campaign against the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery, he instructed Xue Ti (薛悌) to pass a sealed letter to the three generals at Hefei. He wrote, [...] "Open when the enemy comes" [...] on the envelope. Later that year, Sun Quan led about 100,000 troops to attack Hefei, so they opened the letter. It read, [...] "If Sun Quan comes, Generals Zhang and Li will go out to fight the enemy while General Yue will defend the fortress. Xue Ti will stay out of the battle." [...] They were confused after reading the letter. Zhang Liao told Yue Jin and Li Dian, [...] "Our lord is away on a campaign. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for. So he's actually instructing us {{to take advantage of the}} situation – when the enemy has just arrived and isn't fully gathered yet – to attack them and devastate their morale so we can calm our men and strengthen our defences.
