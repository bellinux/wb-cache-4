5|$|The Moon's {{appearance}} is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between <b>two</b> <b>limits</b> — known as lunistices rather than solstices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a sidereal month to complete its cycle {{rather than the}} year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking {{the limits of the}} Moon's movement move on an 18.6 year cycle. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the phase of the Moon. The cycle from one New Moon to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the Synodic month. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See Moon for more details.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} rectify this dilemma, Dewey {{advocated}} for an educational structure that strikes {{a balance between}} delivering knowledge while also {{taking into account the}} interests and experiences of the student. He notes that [...] "the child and the curriculum are simply <b>two</b> <b>limits</b> which define a single process. Just as two points define a straight line, so the present standpoint of the child and the facts and truths of studies define instruction" [...] (Dewey, 1902, p.16). It is through this reasoning that Dewey {{became one of the most}} famous proponents of hands-on learning or experiential education, which is related to, but not synonymous with experiential learning. He argued that [...] "if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind" [...] (Dewey, 1916/2009, pp.217–18). Dewey's ideas went on to influence many other influential experiential models and advocates. Problem-Based Learning (PBL), for example, a method used widely in education today, incorporates Dewey's ideas pertaining to learning through active inquiry.|$|E

By choosing a length scale, L, and velocity scale, U, the equation can be expressed in nondimensional form containing the Reynolds number, Re=UL/ν [...] There are two obvious differences between an insect wing and an airfoil: An insect wing is much smaller and it flaps. Using a dragonfly as an example, Its chord (c) is about 1cm, its wing length (l) about 4cm, and its wing frequency (f) about 40Hz. The tip speed (u) is about 1m/s, and the corresponding Reynolds number, Re=uc/ν about 103. At the smaller end, a Chalcid wasp has a wing length of about 0.5–0.7mm and beats its wing at about 400Hz. Its Reynolds number is about 25. The range of Reynolds number in insect flight is about 10 to 104, which lies in between the <b>two</b> <b>limits</b> that are convenient for theories: inviscid steady flows around an airfoil and Stokes flow experienced by a swimming bacterium. For this reason, this intermediate range is not well understood. On the other hand, it is perhaps the most ubiquitous regime among the things we see.

6000|$|After {{preliminary}} study, I {{handed over}} the collection of racial finger prints to Mr F.

Thus, at one time attention was concentrated on a single finger and a single pattern, the most instructive instance being that of arches on the right fore-finger. They admit of being defined with sufficient clearness, having only one doubtful frontier of much importance, namely that at which they begin to break away into nascent-loops, etc. They also occur with considerable frequency on the fore-finger, so the results from a few hundred specimens ought to be fairly trustworthy. It mattered little in the inquiry, at what level the limit was drawn to separate arches from nascent-loops, {{so long as the}} same limit was observed in all races alike. Much pains were taken to secure uniformity of treatment, and Mr. Collins selected <b>two</b> <b>limits,</b> the one based on a strict and the other on a somewhat less strict interpretation of the term [...] "arches," [...] but the latter was not so liberal as that which I had used myself in the earlier inquiries (see p. 114).

60|$|The Wings of {{all kinds}} of Insects, are, for the most part, very {{beautifull}} Objects, and afford no less pleasing an Object to the mind to speculate upon, then to the eye to behold. This of the blue Fly, among the rest, wants not its peculiar ornaments and contrivances; it grows out of the Thorax, or middle part of the body of a Fly, and is seated a little beyond the center of gravity in the body towards the head, but that Excentricly is curiously balanc'd; first, by the expanded Area of the wings which lies all more backwards then the root, by the motion of them, whereby the center of their vibration is much more backwards towards the tail of the Fly then the root of the wing is. What the vibrative motion of the wings is, and after what manner they are moved, I have endeavoured by many trials to find out: And first for the manner of their motion, I endeavoured to observe several of those kind of small Spinning Flies, which will naturally suspend themselves, as it were, pois'd and steady in one place of the air, without rising or falling, or moving forwards or backwards; for by looking down on those, I could by a kind of faint shadow, perceive the utmost extremes of the vibrative motion of their wings, which shadow, whil'st they so endeavoured to suspend themselves, was not very long, but when they endeavour'd to flie forwards, it was somewhat longer; next, I tried it, by fixing the leggs of a Fly upon the top of the stalk of a feather, with Glew, Wax, &c. and then making it endeavour to flie away; for being thereby able to view it in any posture, I collected that the motion of the wing was after this manner. The extreme limits of the vibrations were usually somewhat about the length of the body distant from one another, oftentimes shorter, and sometimes also longer; that the formost limit was usually a little above the back, and the hinder somwhat beneath the belly; between which <b>two</b> <b>limits,</b> if one may ghess by the sound, the wing seem'd to be mov'd forwards and backwards with an equal velocity: And if one may (from the shadow or faint representation the wings afforded, and from the consideration {{of the nature of the}} thing) ghess at the posture or manner of the wings moving between them, it seem'd to be this: The wing being suppos'd placed in the upmost limit, seems to be put so that the plain of it lies almost horizontal, but onely the forepart does dip a little, or is somewhat more deprest; in this position is the wing vibrated or mov'd to the lower limit, being almost arrived at the lower limit, the hinder part of the wing moving somewhat faster then the former, the Area, of the wing begins to dip behind, and in that posture seems it to be mov'd to the upper limit back again, and thence back again in the first posture, the former part of the Area dipping again, as it is moved downwards by means of the quicker motion of the main stem which terminates or edges the forepart of the wing. And these vibrations or motions to and fro between the <b>two</b> <b>limits</b> seem so swift, that 'tis very probable (from the sound it affords, if it be compar'd with the vibration of a musical string, tun'd unison to it) it makes many hundreds, if not some thousands of vibrations in a second minute of time. And, if we may be allow'd to ghess by the sound, the wing of a Bee is yet more swift, for the tone is much more acute, and that, in all likelihood, proceeds from the exceeding swift beating of the air by the small wing. And it seems the more likely too, because the wing of a Bee is less in proportion to its body, then the other wing to the body of a Fly; so that for ought I know, it may be one of the quickest vibrating spontaneous motions of any in the world; and though perhaps there may be many Flies in other places that afford a yet more shrill note with their wings, yet 'tis most probable that the quickest vibrating spontaneous motion is to be found in the wing of some creature. Now, if we consider the exceeding quickness of these Animal spirits that must cause these motions, we cannot chuse but admire the exceeding vividness of the governing faculty or Anima of the Insect, which is able to dispose and regulate so the the motive faculties, as to cause every peculiar organ, not onely to move or act so quick, but to do it also so regularly.|$|E

60|$|Suppose {{now that}} a Ray coming most obliquely in the Line MC [in Fig. 1.] be refracted at C by the Plane RS into the Line CN, and if it be {{required}} to find the Line CE, into which any other Ray AC shall be refracted; let MC, AD, be the Sines of Incidence of the two Rays, and NG, EF, their Sines of Refraction, and let the equal Motions of the incident Rays be represented by the equal Lines MC and AC, and the Motion MC being considered as parallel to the refracting Plane, let the other Motion AC be distinguished into two Motions AD and DC, one of which AD is parallel, and the other DC perpendicular to the refracting Surface. In like manner, let the Motions of the emerging Rays be distinguish'd into two, whereof the perpendicular ones are MC/NG × CG and AD/EF × CF. And if {{the force of the}} refracting Plane begins to act upon the Rays either in that Plane or at a certain distance from it on the one side, and ends at a certain distance from it on the other side, and in all places between those <b>two</b> <b>limits</b> acts upon the Rays in Lines perpendicular to that refracting Plane, and the Actions upon the Rays at equal distances from the refracting Plane be equal, and at unequal ones either equal or unequal according to any rate whatever; that Motion of the Ray which is parallel to the refracting Plane, will suffer no Alteration by that Force; and that Motion which is perpendicular to it will be altered according to the rule of the foregoing Proposition. If therefore for the perpendicular velocity of the emerging Ray CN you write MC/NG × CG as above, then the perpendicular velocity of any other emerging Ray CE which was AD/EF × CF, will be equal to the square Root of CDq + (MCq/NGq × CGq). And by squaring these Equals, and adding to them the Equals ADq and MCq - CDq, and dividing the Sums by the Equals CFq + EFq and CGq + NGq, you will have MCq/NGq equal to ADq/EFq. Whence AD, the Sine of Incidence, is to EF the Sine of Refraction, as MC to NG, that is, in a given ratio. And this Demonstration being general, without determining what Light is, or by what kind of Force it is refracted, or assuming any thing farther than that the refracting Body acts upon the Rays in Lines perpendicular to its Surface; I take it to be a very convincing Argument of the full truth of this Proposition.|$|E

But if {{the reader}} can give due {{vitality}} in his fancy to these two scenes, he will have in them representative types, clear enough for all future purpose, of the several agencies of debased and perfect art. And the interval may easily and continuously be filled by mediate gradations. Between the entirely immodeset, unmeasured, and (in evil sense) unmannered, execution with the fist; and the entirely modest, measured, and (in the noblest sense) mannered, or moral'd execution with the finger; between the impatient and unpractised doing, containing in itself the witness of lasting impatience and idleness through all previous life, and the patient and practised doing, containing in itself the witness of self-restraint and unwearied toil through all previous life; between the expressed subject and sentiment of home violation, and the expressed subject and sentiment of home love; between the sympathy of audience, given in irreverent and contemptuous rage, joyless as the rabidness of a dog, and the sympathy of audience given in an almost appalled humility of intense, rapturous, and yet entirely reasoning and reasonable pleasure; between these <b>two</b> <b>limits</b> of octave, the reader will find he can class, according to its modesty, usefulness and grace, or becomingness, all other musical art. For although purity of purpose and fineness of execution by no means go together, degree to degree (since fine, and indeed all but the finest, work is often spent in the most wanton purpose --as in all our modern opera--and the rudest execution is again often joined with purest purpose, as in a mother's song to her child), still the entire accomplishment of music {{is only in the}} union of both. For the difference between that [...] "all but" [...] finest and [...] "finest" [...] is an infinite one; and besides this, however the power of the performer, once attained, may be afterwards misdirected, in slavery to popular passion or childishness, and spend itself, at its sweetest, in idle melodies, cold and ephemeral (like Michael Angelo's snow statue in the other art), or else in vicious difficulty and miserable noise--crackling of thorns under the pot of public sensuality--still, the attainment of this power, and the maintenance of it, involve always in the executant some virtue or courage of high kind; the understanding of which, and of the difference between the discipline which develops it and the disorderly efforts of the amateur, it will be one of our first businesses to estimate rightly. And though not indeed by degree to degree, yet in essential relation (as of winds to waves, the one being always the true cause of the other, though they are not necessarily of equal force at the same time,) we shall find vice in its varieties, with art-failure,--and virtue in its varieties, with art-success,--fall and rise together; the peasant-girl's song at her spinning-wheel, the peasant laborer's [...] "to the oaks and rills,"--domestic music, feebly yet sensitively skilful,--music for the multitude, of beneficent or of traitorous power,--dance-melodies, pure and orderly, or foul and frantic,--march-music, blatant in mere fever of animal pugnacity, or majestic with force of national duty and memory,-- song-music, reckless, sensual, sickly, slovenly, forgetful even of the foolish words it effaces with foolish noise,--or thoughtful, sacred, healthful, artful, forever sanctifying noble thought with separately distinguished loveliness of belonging sound,--all these families and graduations of good or evil, however mingled, follow, in so far as they are good, one constant law of virtue (or [...] "life-strength," [...] which is the literal meaning of the word, and its intended one, in wise men's mouths), and in so far as they are evil, are evil by outlawry and unvirtue, or death-weakness.
