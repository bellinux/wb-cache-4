60|$|Mancini's laugh {{faded into}} a tremulous cackle, then died out, and with gaping mouth and glassy eyes he sat <b>there</b> <b>staring</b> at his uncle.|$|E
6000|$|... "It nearly {{took our}} breaths away {{to see them}} settin' <b>there,</b> <b>staring</b> at us with their thimble eyes, an' a-wearin' their little straw hats, both alike.|$|E
6000|$|Several {{carriages}} went jingling by. At last he came. Sitting <b>there,</b> and <b>staring</b> straight before him, {{he did not}} see them. She {{heard her}} husband say: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{elephant}} {{stopped a}} couple of paces from the wounded man's hammock. Malbihn cowered, moaning. He {{was too weak to}} escape. He could only lie <b>there</b> with <b>staring</b> eyes gazing in horror into the blood rimmed, angry little orbs fixed upon him, and await his death.|$|R
6000|$|... “Come on, Wilcox,” Stephen {{said with}} a laugh. “Don’t stand <b>staring</b> <b>there.</b> Dinner is ready, and I am only {{waiting for you to}} begin.” ...|$|R
60|$|The {{situation}} {{was certainly a}} serious one, and the young oarsman was decidedly sober in mind as he sat <b>there,</b> <b>staring</b> vacantly at the hurrying throng.|$|E
6000|$|... "You put me out, {{standing}} <b>there</b> <b>staring</b> at {{me through}} your horrid spectacles!" [...] she said irritably. [...] "Don't look at me, and I will tell you directly." ...|$|E
60|$|The pale, fretful-looking little pair went solemnly to Christie's knee, {{and stood}} <b>there</b> <b>staring</b> {{at her with}} a dull {{composure}} that quite daunted her, it was so sadly unchildlike.|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} went to church. There were the same persons there {{to stare at her}} now, in her quiet wretchedness, who were <b>there</b> before <b>staring</b> at her in her--triumph may I say?

60|$|The time passed. No sound {{broke the}} silence but the lumpish snoring of Schwartz. No change {{appeared}} in Jack; <b>there</b> he lay, <b>staring</b> up at the moon.|$|R
6000|$|... "D--n you, go out, and don't stand <b>staring</b> <b>there,</b> you booby!" [...] screams out Sir Barnes to the clerk. [...] "Stop, Boltby. Colonel Newcome, {{unless you}} leave this room I shall--I shall----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't stand <b>staring</b> <b>there,</b> Hiram; {{run for the}} doctor. Look {{what you}} have done, with your stories about your courts and your verdicts. You have just scared {{her out of her}} mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look again," [...] I said. [...] "He {{reaches the}} top of the mount and stands <b>there</b> <b>staring</b> towards the south. Oh! now he turns, and the {{moonlight}} shines upon his face." ...|$|E

He had made no secret of whence those studs had come to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} enough to have you rising and sinking <b>there,</b> without your <b>staring</b> at all: If you're going to stay, I wish you'd lie down. I don't see why you're so well, anyway, after getting us all to come on this wild-goose chase." ...|$|R
60|$|I stood <b>there</b> <b>staring</b> {{at those}} {{beautiful}} blind {{eyes and the}} blind eyes stared back at me. Presently a look of understanding gathered on the face and Quilla spoke, or rather murmured to herself.|$|E
60|$|As {{the words}} passed his lips Jan {{let go of}} him so {{suddenly}} that Gaasha {{fell to the ground}} and sat <b>there</b> <b>staring</b> at us, for without doubt he thought that we had all gone mad.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter; {{it makes no}} difference," [...] Mrs. Mulready said feverishly, [...] "so that I get away. Put some of my things together, Abijah.

5000|$|US mono version (mixed on 12 May 1966): No {{backwards}} track {{during the}} second verse but a quick fragment is heard on the [...] "time" [...] in [...] "taking my time" [...] and [...] "ceiling" [...] in [...] "lying <b>there</b> and <b>staring</b> at the ceiling".

5000|$|She {{eventually}} {{grew tired}} of the disrespect from club owners and customers and decided {{to get out of}} the trade in 2010. “Men come in there and they act like they don’t know why we’re <b>there.</b> Stop <b>staring,</b> give us a tip. We’re working,” she says. Henderson felt that men were there for [...] "faceless treats" [...] and didn't understand that the industry is all about [...] "fantasy with mutual respect." [...] She states that she misses the experience, learned a lot but the disrespect is why “I don’t dance anymore," [...] says Henderson. [...] "Fuck ‘em.” ...|$|R
60|$|The {{good wife}} was in bed, snoring away for dear life; {{but such a}} noise as the {{fisherman}} made coming into the house was enough to wake the dead.
