5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Apollonius problem is obtained from <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E
