5|$|By early May, <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> authorities, {{being unable}} to {{suppress}} the revolt, became willing to start discussions with {{the intervention of the}} International Commission. Thus, Prince William of Wied of Albania asked the Commission, which represented <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> government, to initiate negotiations. Subsequently, on May 6, the members of the Commission informed Zografos that they were willing to discuss the demands of the Northern Epirote side.|$|E
5|$|Football (soccer) {{is popular}} in Gjirokastër: the city hosts Luftëtari Gjirokastër, a club founded in 1929. The club has competed in {{international}} tournaments and played in <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> Superliga until 2006–2007. Currently the team plays in <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> First Division. The soccer matches are played in Gjirokastër Stadium, which can {{hold up to}} 8,500 spectators.|$|E
50|$|Nikephoros II Orsini {{gathered}} his forces and marched against <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> in <b>the</b> regions they {{had settled in}} Aetolia, modern western Greece. <b>The</b> <b>Albanians</b> gathered their forces and {{under the leadership of}} Peter Losha fought against Orsini in the late spring of 1359 near the Achelous river. <b>The</b> <b>Albanians</b> won <b>the</b> battle. Orsini was killed and his whole army was destroyed.|$|R
50|$|A similar stance {{was taken}} by <b>the</b> ethnic <b>Albanian</b> Democratic League in Montenegro, which called <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> of Montenegro to boycott <b>the</b> referendum. Most <b>Albanians</b> voted for independence.|$|R
50|$|Nikephoros II Orsini {{launched}} a campaign against <b>the</b> invading <b>Albanians,</b> and also faced {{with the threat of}} Radoslav Hlapen to the north, he negotiated with Simeon Uroš, presumably to prevent Simeon's Albanian allies from supporting <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> in Epirus. <b>The</b> negotiations were thwarted by Nikephoros' death fighting <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> at Acheloos (1359).|$|R
5|$|Notably, {{during the}} 1960s, the Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked the {{communist}} leader of Albania Enver Hoxha about giving autonomy to the minority, but this initiative was without any result. The autonomy question {{remains one of}} the main issues on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania (1991). Moreover, a certain degree of autonomy, based on the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, is the main objective of the organization Omonoia, as well as the Unity for Human Rights Party, which represents the Greek minority in <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> government. Such proposals were rejected in 1991 by <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> government, thus spurring Omonoia's radical wing to call for Union with Greece. In another incident, in 1993, Omonoia’s chairman was immediately arrested by <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> police, after explaining in public that the goal of the Greek minority was autonomy inside <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> borders, based on the terms of the Protocol.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Albanians,</b> during <b>the</b> Middle Ages, {{referred}} {{to their country}} as Arbëria (Arbënia) and called themselves Arbëreshë (Arbëneshë). In the Balkans, a similar term is still used today by the Vlachs, who call <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> in their language Arbineshi.|$|R
50|$|In 1881, when Dervish-Pasha crushed <b>the</b> rebel <b>Albanians</b> in Ferizovići (Uroševac), he hung Albanian Sejf-Košar to a {{pear tree}} between Ferizovići and Štimlje. Some of <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> sought rest in Dulje Hana, after their defeat. When the innkeeper burnt trees in <b>the</b> furnace, <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> {{woke up in}} fear; they thought Dervish-Pasha had come after them {{shooting}} guns, after which they fled.|$|R
50|$|Vatra (The earth) is an {{association}} of Albanian Americans, created in 1912, that has historically protected the rights of <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> in <b>the</b> United States, as well as has endeavored in lobbying with the United States Congress about the rights of <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> throughout <b>the</b> world.|$|R
5|$|When Kosovo {{was under}} the {{administration}} of the United Nations, the UN flag was flown in Kosovo. However, the flag used by the Kosovar Albanian population was <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> flag. <b>The</b> <b>Albanian</b> flag was also used on public buildings, even though it was against UN regulations. Regulations stated only the UN flag and other authorised flags, like those of cities, could fly on public buildings. If <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> flag did have to go up, then the Serbian flag must go up too, according to UN regulations. However, this was never done in practice and the flag of Albania was ever-present in Kosovo during the UNMIK period.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> {{independence}} movement gathered momentum. On 28 November 1912 in Vlorë, Ismail Qemali declared Albania's independence, and a provisional government was soon formed that exercised its authority {{only in the}} immediate area of Vlorë. Elsewhere, the Ottoman general Essad Pasha formed the Republic of Central Albania at Durrës, while conservative Albanian tribesmen still hoped for an Ottoman ruler. Most of the area that would form <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> state was occupied at this time, by the Greeks {{in the south and}} the Serbs in the north.|$|E
5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian {{sources of}} that time, the Northern Epirote {{movement}} was directly {{supported by the}} Greek state, {{with the help of}} a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania. In Albanian historiography, the Protocol of Corfu is either scarcely mentioned or seen as an attempt to divide <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> state and proof of the Great Powers' disregard for Albania's national integrity.|$|E
5000|$|King Urnayr of Caucasian Albania invaded Utik. But in 370 AD, the Armenian sparapet Mushegh Mamikonyan {{defeated}} <b>the</b> <b>Albanians,</b> restoring <b>the</b> frontier back to {{the river}} Kura. In 387 AD, the Sassanid Empire helped <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> to seize from the Kingdom of Armenia a number of provinces, including Utik.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Albanians</b> can {{be divided}} into two {{cultural}} and linguistic groups such as the northern Ghegs and the southern Tosks. The geographic border between the two groups, based on dialect is the Shkumbin River. The Gheg dialect is mostly spoken, along with <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> of Croatia (Arbanasi), Kosovo, Montenegro, and northwestern Macedonia. However, the Tosks includes <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> of Greece, (Chams), southwestern Macedonia, and southern Italy (Arbëreshë). The diversity between the Ghegs and Tosks can be substantial, both sides identify strongly with the common national and ethnic culture.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Albanians</b> {{clashed with}} <b>the</b> Ottomans at the Kodra e Kuqe, {{near the village}} of Klesna. <b>The</b> <b>Albanians</b> managed to defeat the first wave of Ottoman forces but when {{reinforcements}} arrived <b>the</b> <b>Albanians</b> were temporarily defeated and returned. The commander Isuf Sokoli was wounded and died later that day. In 1880, 23 November, the Ottomans continued to march in the city and surrendered the city to the Montenegrin army. The city had officially been handed over to Montenegro and after a 30 month long negotiation process, with European powers involved, the battle ended.|$|R
5|$|In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled {{during the}} Conference of Ambassadors and Northern Epirus was {{definitively}} ceded to <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern Epirus continued. In 1921 <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> government, during the country's {{entrance to the}} League of Nations, committed itself {{to protect the rights}} of minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokastër and Sarande, and none of the main towns. Moreover, Greek education was viewed as a potential threat to the territorial integrity of <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to Albanian ones. As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934–1935). Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in April 1935, did <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of Albanian in Greek schools.|$|E
5|$|In February 1922, <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> Parliament {{approved}} the Declaration of Minority Rights. However, the Declaration, {{contrary to the}} Protocol of Corfu, recognized minority rights only in a limited area (parts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë district and 3 villages in Himarë), without implementing any form of local autonomy. All Greek schools in the excluded area were forced to close until 1935, in violation of obligations accepted by <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> government at the League of Nations. In 1925, Albania's present borders were set, leading Greece to abandon its claims to Northern Epirus.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1914, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was {{declared}} in Gjirokastër and the provisional Government {{was formed to}} support the state's objectives. The Protocol of Corfu was signed on May 17, 1914 and <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> Government officially recognized the area of Northern Epirus as an autonomous region within <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> state. Soon after the outbreak of World War I (July 1914), the situation in Albania became unstable and political chaos ensued. As the country split {{into a number of}} regional governments, Prince William departed the country in September 1914.|$|E

5|$|The {{autonomy}} {{question remains}} on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations {{as part of the}} Northern Epirote issue. In 1925, Albania's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence, and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus. In the 1960s, Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked his Albanian counterpart about giving autonomy to the Greek minority, with no results. In 1991, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania, the chairman of Greek minority organization Omonoia called for autonomy for Northern Epirus, on the basis that the rights provided for under <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> constitution were highly precarious. This proposal was rejected, spurring the minority's radical wing to call for a union with Greece. Two years later, Omonoia’s chairman was arrested by <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> police after publicly stating that the Greek minority goal was the creation of an autonomous region inside <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> borders, based on the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu. In 1997, Albanian analysts stated that the possibility of a Greek minority-inspired breakaway Republic still exists.|$|E
5|$|A {{competition}} {{for a new}} flag, held in June 2007, received 993 entries. Under the terms of UN talks, all such symbols would have to reflect the multi-ethnic nature of Kosovo, avoiding the use of <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> or Serbian double-headed eagles {{or the use of}} solely red and black or red, blue and white color schemes. Red and black are the colours used on <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> flag; red, blue and white are the main colours used on the Serbian flag. Additionally, all entries had to be rectangular and have a 2:3 proportion. The Kosovo Symbols Commission eventually selected three designs, which were then voted on by the Assembly of Kosovo (with a two-thirds majority required for approval), when independence was declared after the status talks. The three proposals selected were forwarded to the Assembly on 4 February 2008.|$|E
5|$|After {{falling out}} of favor with Ali Pasha, for reasons unknown, Meksi left the court in 1810 to travel around Europe. During a brief stay in Venice he began to develop an {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> alphabet and grammar. He published two translations into Albanian during 1814, both now lost, {{one of which was}} a religious work by Abbé Claude Fleury (1640–1723).|$|E

5|$|After {{the army}} was marshaled, Skanderbeg would not permit the {{trumpets}} to give the signal for battle until he saw Ali Pasha advancing. After looking upon <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> army, the Pasha ordered his army to charge {{with one of the}} units ahead of the rest. <b>The</b> <b>Albanian</b> front line retreated; Skanderbeg sent a body of horsemen to prevent the line from breaking and marshaled the retreating troops back to their places. Ali Pasha believed he had the Albanians trapped. The same situation occurred on the left wing and, when all were in their places, the army prepared for the main offensive. As it began, the wings were fiercely led on by Thopia and Golemi and pushed back the Ottoman wings. In the centre, Skanderbeg assaulted a selected battalion. When the proper signal was given, the 3,000 horsemen hidden in the woods sprang out and charged into the Ottoman rear, causing large parts of their army to rout. The wings of <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> army turned towards the Ottoman centre's flanks. Ajdin Muzaka, having charged the Turkish centre, was met by fierce resistance and the Turks continued to pour in fresh forces until Vrana Konti came in with his reserves and decided the battle. The Turkish army was surrounded. The Ottoman front ranks were annihilated except for 300 soldiers. Ali Pasha's personal battalion fled although the commander nearly met his death.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the First Balkan War in May 1913, Giuseppe Garibaldi was {{deployed}} to <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> port of Scutari to ensure that it was returned by Montenegro to the Ottoman Empire and to protect Italian interests in the city. She returned home in August before deploying to Benghazi in February–March 1914.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Italy {{transformed}} <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> Kingdom into Greater Albania, a protectorate of Italy {{that included}} most of Kosovo and {{a portion of}} western Macedonia which was detached from Yugoslavia after the Axis powers invaded in 1941. Kosovo Albanians enthusiastically welcomed the Italian occupation. Although officially under Italian rule, the Albanians in Kosovo controlled the region and were encouraged to open Albanian schools, which had been prohibited under Yugoslav rule. They were also given Albanian citizenship by Italian authorities and allowed to fly <b>the</b> <b>Albanian</b> flag. Nevertheless, the Italians kept {{hundreds of thousands of}} troops in Albania and surrounding areas. Yugoslav sources indicated that there were approximately 20,000 Italian soldiers and 5,000 Italian police and frontier guards in Kosovo, and 12,000 soldiers and 5,000 police and border guards in the Albanian-annexed portion of Macedonia. At the same time, Italian military authorities warned that at least ten hostages would be shot for every Italian soldier killed or wounded in these regions.|$|E
