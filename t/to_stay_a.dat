Giridhar took vairagi (renouncer) initiation or Virakta Diksha in the Ramananda Sampradaya on the Kartika full-moon day of 19 November 1983 from Shri Ramcharandas Maharaj Phalahari. He now {{came to be known}} as Rambhadradas.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer brought {{together}} intellectuals {{at the height}} of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> bastion of pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.|$|E
5|$|Prescott {{found it}} {{difficult}} to evaluate Mesoamerican scientific and mathematical achievements, because of his relative ignorance of those subjects. While working in Boston in 1841, he met George Howard, who was <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> close friend for the remainder of his life. Prescott worked industriously throughout 1840–1842, and as a result, the work was finished by August 1843. It was published by Harper & Brothers, New York in December, Bentley issuing the British edition. His elderly father had suffered a stroke in October, which resulted in temporary paralysis, so Prescott spent most of the winter attending him in Pepperell. The History of the Conquest of Mexico was received extremely well, both critically and by the general public, despite Prescott's fears to the contrary. Those praising the work included George Hillard in the North American Review, George Ticknor Curtis in the Christian Examiner, Joseph Cogswell in the Methodist Quarterly, as well as the Dean of St. Paul's, Henry Hart Milman in the Quarterly Review.|$|E

For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E
5|$|The first European {{visitor to}} publish {{an account of}} Quiriguá was English {{architect}} and artist Frederick Catherwood, who reached the ruins in 1840. The previous landowner, by the surname of Payés, had related {{the existence of the}} ruins to his sons and to Carlos Meiney, a Jamaican Englishman resident in Guatemala. The elder Payés had recently died and passed the land to his sons and, since neither Meiney nor Payés' sons had visited the land containing the ruins, they invited John Lloyd Stephens and Catherwood to join them on their first trip to the site. Stephens had other duties to attend to, but Catherwood was able to accompany the Payés brothers to Quiriguá. Due to adverse conditions he was only able <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> short time at the ruins, but made drawings of two of the stelae, which were published with a short account of Catherwood's visit in John Lloyd Stephens's book Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan in 1841. Quiriguá was the first site that Stephens and Catherwood could claim to have discovered themselves. A longer account of the ruins was made in 1854 by Dr. Karl Scherzer.|$|E

By March 21, 1967, his release day, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken a number of federal laws. Then as now, federal sentences were much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses. Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> <b>a</b> fact mentioned in a 1981 television interview with Tom Snyder.|$|E

25|$|Between 1888 and 1890, Narendra visited Vaidyanath in Allahabad. In January 1890 he {{went from}} Allahabad to Ghazipur and met Pavhari Baba, an Advaita Vedanta ascetic who {{spent much of his}} time in meditation. At the time he {{suffered}} from lumbago, and it was becoming impossible for him to move or sit in meditation. After meeting Baba, Narendra wanted to become his disciple and Baba asked him <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> few more days at Ghazipur. However, the night before his initiation Narendra had a dream in which Ramakrishna looked at him with a melancholy face. This dream convinced Narendra that no one other than Ramakrishna could be his teacher, and he abandoned the idea of becoming Baba's disciple.|$|E
25|$|Managers – Many {{nurses who}} have worked in {{clinical}} settings {{for a long time}} choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS and independent care sector management. This used {{to be seen as a}} natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions; however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option. Nonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organisations and independent healthcare organisations, some even as board members or directors. Others choose <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>a</b> little closer to their clinical roots by becoming regional managers, service managers, clinical nurse managers or Modern Matrons.|$|E
