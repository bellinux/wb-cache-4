5|$|Within the Australian {{region in}} the Southern Hemisphere between 90°E– 160°E, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis indicate that a system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Indonesian Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika names systems <b>that</b> <b>develop</b> between the Equator and 10°S and 90°E and 141°E, while Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service names systems <b>that</b> <b>develop</b> between the Equator and 10°S and 141°E and 160°E. Outside of these areas, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology names systems <b>that</b> <b>develop</b> into tropical cyclones. If a name is assigned to a tropical cyclone that causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to {{the way of life}} of a community, then the name assigned to that storm is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting.|$|E
5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life <b>that</b> <b>develop</b> into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP gene can modify {{the course of the}} disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms <b>that</b> <b>develop.</b> This gene produces prion protein, which is active in the brain and other tissues and also appears to be involved in transporting copper. A role for the ApoE gene was initially suspected but could not be confirmed.|$|E

In the final agreement, the Clean Development Mechanism was designed to limit emissions in developing countries, but {{in such a way}} <b>that</b> <b>developing</b> countries do not bear the costs for limiting emissions. The general assumption was <b>that</b> <b>developing</b> countries would face quantitative commitments in later commitment periods, and at the same time, developed countries would meet their first round commitments.|$|R

5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of the brain can {{manifest}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate problems <b>that</b> <b>develop</b> may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae <b>that</b> <b>develop</b> within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s {{samples of}} extremophile molds {{were taken from}} Mir. Ninety species of {{micro-organisms}} were found in 1990, {{four years after the}} station's launch. By the time of its decommission in 2001, the number of known different micro-organisms had grown to 140. As space stations get older, the problems with contamination get worse. Moulds <b>that</b> <b>develop</b> aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber. The moulds in Mir were found growing behind panels and inside air-conditioning equipment. The moulds also caused bad smell, which was often cited as visitors' strongest impressions.|$|E
5|$|MS is {{the most}} common {{autoimmune}} disorder of the central nervous system. As of 2010, the number of people with MS was 2–2.5 million (approximately 30 per 100,000) globally, with rates varying widely in different regions. It is estimated to have resulted in 18,000 deaths that year. In Africa rates are less than 0.5 per 100,000, while they are 2.8 per 100,000 in South East Asia, 8.3 per 100,000 in the Americas, and 80 per 100,000 in Europe. Rates surpass 200 per 100,000 in certain populations of Northern European descent. The number of new cases <b>that</b> <b>develop</b> per year is about 2.5 per 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles are {{typically}} herbivorous, feeding mostly on algae, including diatoms filtered {{from the water}} through the gills.

Tadpoles <b>that</b> <b>develop</b> legs early may be eaten by the others, so late developers may have better long-term survival prospects.|$|E
