5|$|When the core's mass {{exceeds the}} Chandrasekhar limit of about , {{degeneracy}} pressure {{can no longer}} support it, and catastrophic collapse ensues. The outer part of the core reaches velocities of up to 70,000km/s (23% {{of the speed of}} light) as it collapses <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the star. The rapidly shrinking core heats up, producing high-energy gamma rays that decompose iron nuclei into helium nuclei and free neutrons via photodisintegration. As the core's density increases, it becomes energetically favorable for electrons and protons to merge via inverse beta decay, producing neutrons and elementary particles called neutrinos. Because neutrinos rarely interact with normal matter, they can escape from the core, carrying away energy and further accelerating the collapse, which proceeds over a timescale of milliseconds. As the core detaches from the outer layers of the star, some of these neutrinos are absorbed by the star's outer layers, beginning the supernova explosion.|$|E

Nine galaxies are detected and useful upper limits are placed on the remaining eight. Using the CO(2 - 1) /CO(1 - 0) ratio of antenna temperature as a diagnostic of optical depth, it is found that all of the galaxies contain predominantly optically thick molecular gas.

A new method for estimating the mass of associated H 2 is suggested that emphasizes the different kinds of clouds in these different regions. There appears to be no correlation of CO and H I linewidths. However, there are good correlations between CO emission, far-infrared emission, and nonthermal radio continuum emission. The correlation with infrared emissions shows that more molecular gas implies more star formation in galactic centers...|$|R
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lure out and destroy {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet with sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers and thirty-one torpedo boats {{commanded}} by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May.

The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, at that time consisting of twenty-eight dreadnoughts and nine battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

40|$|Single-cell-laden microgels support {{physiological}} 3 D culture conditions while enabling straightforward {{handling and}} high-resolution readouts of individual cells. However, their widespread adoption for long-term cultures {{is limited by}} cell escape. In this work, it is demonstrated that cell escape is predisposed to off-center encapsulated cells. High-speed microscopy reveals that cells are positioned at the microgel precursor droplets' oil/water interface within milliseconds after droplet formation. In conventional microencapsulation strategies, the droplets are typically gelled immediately after emulsification, which traps cells in this off-center position. By delaying crosslinking, driving cells <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> microgels is succeeded. <b>The</b> <b>centering</b> <b>of</b> cells in enzymatically crosslinked microgels prevents their escape during at least 28 d.

The facile nature of this microfluidic cell-centering method enables its straightforward integration into many microencapsulation strategies and significantly enhances control, reproducibility, and reliability of 3 D single cell cultures...|$|R
30|$|Focused {{placement}} of spherical particles {{also can be}} achieved by exploiting both electrostatic forces and capillary forces. Using microscale polystyrene (PS) spheres as model systems, Aizenberg et al. have demonstrated a focused assembly of PS spheres (∼ 1 μm in diameter) onto small targeted spots using a two-step process; first, electrostatic attachment of the particles onto functionalized surface patterns of circular shape, then rearrangement of <b>the</b> attached particles <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circular patterns [210]. The functionalized surface patterns were made using μCP [78], which created patterns with negatively charged SAMs, and the remainder with positively charged SAMs. When the sample was immersed into the PS colloid in water, the PS particles (positively charged with amidine termination) selectively attached onto the negatively charged areas. In this process, the long-range electrostatic interaction (the electrical double-layer interaction [211, 212]) repelled the particles away from the positively charged SAMs and pushed them <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pattern that was charged negatively, resulting in the first stage focusing effect. Second stage focusing effect, which is more dominant, was achieved during the drying process when the immersed sample was pulled from the colloid, rinsed, and allowed to dry. While the sample was drying, they monitored the movement of PS particles in real time using an optical microscope, which revealed dynamic rearrangement <b>of</b> particles <b>toward</b> to <b>the</b> <b>center</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circular patterns. This rearrangement, the second focusing effect, was attributed to lateral capillary forces that were created when water–air interfaces formed asymmetrically on the particle surfaces during the drying process.|$|R
