25|$|Cloninger’s <b>tridimensional</b> {{personality}} theory offers three independent “temperament” dimensions which aid {{in measuring}} how different individuals feel or behave. Reward Dependence (RD) {{is one of}} the three temperament dimensions, the other two being “Harm Avoidance (HA)” and “Novelty Seeking (NS)”. A temperament, according to Cloninger, is the automatic emotional response to experience.|$|E
25|$|By {{understanding}} the specific temperamental traits {{that are common}} among individuals with specific disorders, clinicians can form a more targeted, informed approach to treatment and look to newer psychotherapies for guidance. The relationship between temperament and individual clusters of DSM personality disorders is often investigated. According to the DSM-IV, the <b>tridimensional</b> structure allows up to nine major personality disorders to be identified, the theory thereby making a great contribution {{to the understanding of}} psychiatric disorders.|$|E
25|$|Two {{questionnaires}} were devised by Cloninger {{to measure the}} temperaments and characters of individuals. RD can be measured using both the <b>Tridimensional</b> Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) personality test and by the newer and refined version of the personality test called Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and its revised version (TCI-R). Owing to the limitations encountered in the TPQ, in that the three dimensions’ clinical utility was not readily apparent to many clinicians, Cloninger revamped the questionnaire and produced the TCI scale, which incorporates four dimensions of “temperament” and three dimensions of “character”.|$|E

50|$|A {{precursor}} idea to the IC was {{to create}} small ceramic squares (wafers), each containing a single miniaturized component. Components could then be integrated and wired into a bidimensional or <b>tridimensional</b> compact grid.

However, as the project was gaining momentum, Kilby came up with a new, revolutionary design: the IC.|$|E
50|$|Cloninger {{is known}} for his {{research}} on the genetics, neurobiology, and development of personality and personality disorders.

50|$|Interaction-mediated {{suppression}} {{occurs when}} a deleterious mutation in a component of a protein complex destabilise the complex. A compensatory mutation in another component of the protein complex can then suppress the deleterious phenotype by re-establishing {{the interaction between the}} two proteins. It usually means that the deleterious mutation and the suppressive mutation occurs in two residues that are closely located in the <b>tridimensional</b> structure of the multi-protein complex. As thus this kind of suppression provides indirect information on the molecular structure of the proteins involved.|$|E
