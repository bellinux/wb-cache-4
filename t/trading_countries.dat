6000|$|It {{has been}} seen, as in Chart No. XIII, that, {{considering}} the [...] {{exports and imports}} merely as merchandise, there is, in fact, no [...] actual equilibrium {{at any given time}} in accordance with the [...] equation of International Demand. Another element, the “financial [...] account” between the United States and foreign countries, must be [...] considered before we can know all the factors necessary to bring [...] about the equation. If we had been borrowing largely of England, [...] Holland, and Germany, we should owe a regular annual sum as [...] interest, and our exports must, as a rule, be exactly that much [...] more (under right and normal conditions) than the imports. Or, [...] take another case, if capital is borrowed in Europe for railways [...] in the United States, this capital generally comes over in the [...] form of imports of various kinds; but, if our exports are not [...] sufficient at once to balance the increased imports, we go in debt [...] for a time—or, in other words, in order to establish the balance, [...] we send United States securities abroad instead of actual exports. [...] This shipment of securities is not seen and recorded as among the [...] exports; and so we find a period, like that during and after the [...] war, from 1862 to 1873, of a vast excess of imports. Since 1873 [...] the country has been practically paying the indebtedness incurred [...] in the former period; {{and there has been a}} vast excess of exports [...] over imports, and an apparent discrepancy in the equilibrium. But [...] our government bonds and other securities have been coming back to [...] us, producing a return current to balance the excessive [...] exports.(280) In brief, the use of securities and various forms of [...] indebtedness permits the period of actual payment to be deferred, [...] so that an excess of imports at one time may be offset by an [...] excess of exports at another, and generally a later, time. [...] Moreover, the large expenses of people traveling in Europe will [...] require us to remit abroad in the form of exports more than would [...] ordinarily balance our imports by the amount spent by the [...] travelers. The financial operations, therefore, between the United [...] States and foreign countries, must be well considered in striking [...] the equation between our exports and imports. As formulated by Mr. [...] Cairnes,(281) the Equation of International Demand should be [...] stated more broadly, as follows: “The state of international [...] demand which results in commercial equilibrium is realized when [...] the reciprocal demand of <b>trading</b> <b>countries</b> produces such a [...] relation of exports and imports among them as enables each country [...] by means of her exports to discharge all her foreign [...] liabilities.” If we were a great lending instead of a great [...] borrowing country, we should have, as a rule, a permanent excess [...] of imports.|$|E

50|$|Free {{trade is}} a trade policy that allows traders {{to act and}} transact without {{interference}} from government. Under a free trade policy, prices are a reflection of true supply and demand, and are the sole determinant of resource allocation. Free trade differs from other forms of trade policy where the allocation {{of goods and services}} amongst <b>trading</b> <b>countries</b> are determined by artificial prices {{that may or may not}} reflect the true nature of supply and demand. These artificial prices are the result of protectionist trade policies, whereby governments intervene in the market through price adjustments and supply restrictions. Such government interventions can increase as well as decrease the cost of goods and services to both consumers and producers.|$|E

[...] The second volume contained digests of the laws of 82 major <b>trading</b> <b>countries</b> as well as brief descriptions of their government and legal systems. In case of Australia and Canada, digests of the states and provinces of these countries were included along with the digest of their federal laws, and a separate digest of the European Union law, because of its significance for a number of European countries. The aim of the digests was: [...] "to present the points of law most likely to be of assistance to a lawyer with a matter at hand, some facet of which is controlled by the law of that country". [...] The digests were compiled and revised by distinguished lawyers and legal scholars of the respective states and countries. [...] The second volume contained also the texts of ten international conventions, to which the United States of America was a party, the complete texts of many Uniform Acts including the Uniform Commercial Code and the Uniform Probate Code and four Model Acts including the Revised Model Business Corporation Act.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the uneven}} {{geographical}} distribution of rare earths (RE), most countries obtain RE {{on the international}} market. Trade patterns and trading countries' role characteristics are two important aspects to understand {{the current status of}} world RE trade and furthermore to formulate RE trade policies for each trading country. A complex network theory is adopted to analyze the world RE trade based on the trading data of 2011 - 2015. The results show that world RE trade favors a tendency towards collectivization since 146 <b>trading</b> <b>countries</b> only form three trade communities. Of these communities, the one headed by the United States, China, Japan, and Germany, has the largest clustering coefficient and has the greatest effect on the world RE trade. Moreover, the average path length valued by 2. 294 steps in the network shows that the <b>trading</b> <b>countries</b> are quite close to each other, i. e., building up trade relations between any two countries needs an average path length of only 2. 294 steps. Based on the role characteristics analysis of the degree centrality, strength centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness centrality, our study characterized the competing and complementary relationships between the major <b>trading</b> <b>countries.</b> Finally, the policy implications for different <b>trading</b> <b>countries</b> are proposed.
