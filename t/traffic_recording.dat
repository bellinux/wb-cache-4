50|$|A {{traffic count}} is {{a count of}} {{vehicular}} or pedestrian traffic, which is conducted along a particular road, path, or intersection. A traffic count is commonly undertaken either automatically (with the installation of a temporary or permanent electronic <b>traffic</b> <b>recording</b> device), or manually by observers who visually count and record traffic on a hand-held electronic device or tally sheet. Traffic counts {{can be used by}} local councils to identify which routes are used most, and to either improve that road or provide an alternative if there is an excessive amount of traffic. Also, some geography fieldwork involves a traffic count. Traffic counts provide the source data used to calculate the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), which is the common indicator used to represent traffic volume. Traffic counts are useful for comparing two or more roads, and can also be used alongside other methods to find out where the CBD of a settlement is located. Traffic counts that include speeds are used in speed limit enforcement efforts, highlighting peak speeding periods to optimise speed camera use and educational efforts.|$|E

A satisfactory usage of the video technology needs various simplifications of the data source structure and the processing algorithms.

40|$|Transportation {{agencies}} often {{determine what}} the annual average daily traffic (AADT) count is on streets and highways by counting traffic for short time periods (usually for 24 hours) and then estimating the AADT based on this count and a numerical factor {{that takes into account}} day-of-week and/or seasonal variations in traffic volumes found at a small number of permanent automatic <b>traffic</b> <b>recording</b> stations (ATR’s). Considerable research has been devoted to help state departments of transportation (DOTs) and other agencies develop cost-effective pro-grams to develop factoring procedures to ensure reasonably accurate estimates of AADT from short-term counts.

40|$|In this study, {{effects on}} task {{performance}} and annoyance by aircraft and road traffic noise and attitudes towards these noise sources were {{addressed in a}} lab-setting. On day 1 of the study, participants performed a 3 -back working memory task in silence and with noise samples played over a headphone at four different loudness levels. On day 2, they filled out questionnaires on aircraft/road traffic-related attitudes and noise sensitivity. We hypothesized that attitudes would only affect task response times for noise samples with recognizable sources. For this reason unrecognizable noise samples were generated from the sound characteristics of an Airbus 320 flyover and of a road <b>traffic</b> <b>recording</b> and were used next to the original noise samples. Preliminary results showed no differences of attitudes on annoyance. For participants with negative attitudes towards the noise source, response times were rising with increasing loudness levels during recognizable samples, whereas response times decreased during unrecognizable samples when loudness levels rose. For the group with positive attitudes towards the noise source, reaction times seemed fairly stable across conditions. These results indicate that attitudes towards noise sources may mediate the effect of noise on cognitive tasks...|$|E

40|$|Detection of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks has {{attracted}} researchers since 1990 s. A variety of detection systems {{has been proposed}} to achieve this task. Unlike the existing approaches based on machine learning and statistical analysis, the proposed system treats <b>traffic</b> <b>records</b> as images and detection of DoS attacks as a computer vision problem. A multivariate correlation analysis approach is introduced to accurately depict network <b>traffic</b> <b>records</b> and to convert the records into the respective images. The images of network <b>traffic</b> <b>records</b> are used as the observed objects of our proposed DoS attack detection system, which is developed based on a widely used dissimilarity measure, namely Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD). EMD takes cross-bin matching into account and provides a more accurate evaluation on the dissimilarity between distributions than some other well-known dissimilarity measures, such as Minkowskiform distance Lp and X 2 statistics. These unique merits facilitate our proposed system with effective detection capabilities. To evaluate the proposed EMD-based detection system, ten-fold cross-validations are conducted using KDD Cup 99 data set and ISCX 2012 IDS Evaluation data set. The results presented in the system evaluation section illustrate that our detection system can detect unknown DoS attacks and achieves 99. 95 % detection accuracy on KDD Cup 99 data set and 90. 12 % detection accuracy on ISCX 2012 IDS evaluation data set with processing capability of approximately 59, 000 <b>traffic</b> <b>records</b> per second...|$|R

30|$|A {{recording}} framework was deployed {{on every}} host machine. It was running and logging {{in the background}} during the recording period. The FFmpeg [29] program was used for video <b>traffic</b> <b>recording.</b> It logged the compressed H. 264 video information (i.e., frames sizes, GOP structure, frames’ time of arrival etc.) of the host’s machine desktop. The frame resolution {{was the same as}} the PC’s screen resolution, i.e., it is not a constant; we used different resolutions depending on the different PC screens that were being used. The default windows resolution is 1920  ×  1080, so this was often the case for our videos. The frame rate was 30 fps. Although FFmpeg was running constantly, it was capable of logging video traffic information only if the host’s machine GPU was active (i.e., the host machine was not in hibernation, sleep or monitor energy saving mode). A Windows PowerShell [30] script was used for logging and timestamping the active foreground applications. Windows PowerShell was programmed to log the application’s name every 33.3  ms (in order to keep up with FFmpeg logs, where we had one frame every 33.3  ms). We should also note that Windows PowerShell is capable of reporting the application’s name only if the host machine is unlocked and the user is not logged off. The average PSNR of our videos was 65  dB.|$|E
40|$|From {{the passage}} of the National Maximum Speed Limit (NMSL) of 55 mph in 1974 through its repeal in 1995 speed {{monitoring}} programs have been mandated by the federal government. The speed-monitoring program was primarily intended to provide reliable data to be included {{as a part of the}} State’s annual certification in order to be approved for Federal Aid highway projects. The repeal of the NMSL in 1995 not only authorized states to set their own speed limits, it also allowed states to develop their own speed monitoring programs. The goal of this research is to provide the framework for a speed-monitoring program to meet the needs of agencies and organizations that use speed-monitoring data in the State of Indiana. A proposed speed monitoring plan is developed which distributes speed monitoring stations to highway classes according to three primary criteria: spatial distribution, crash distribution, and distribution of daily vehicle miles traveled. The proposed speed-monitoring program will utilize 38 existing speed, weigh-in-motion, and automated <b>traffic</b> <b>recording</b> stations. The stations will be monitored four times a year for a 24 -hour period. Furthermore, the proposed program will monitor speeds based on vehicle length. It is the recommendation of this research that Indiana phase in the proposed speed-monitoring plan developed in the present research, during the 1999 calendar year. The implementation should include a visual inspection of all the WIM, ATR, and speed monitoring stations listed in Appendix A to ensure they are still capable of monitoring speeds by vehicle class and travel direction. If any problems should arise with the existing stations, that station should be substituted for another station within that district and highway class...|$|E
