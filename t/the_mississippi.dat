5|$|Tennessee, United States, {{located on}} the banks of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. The lands of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River Basin were {{inhabited}} by Paleo-Indians and later Native American tribes of the Mississippian culture for thousands of years. The Tipton Phase people and the Chickasaw Indian tribe populated <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River valley near Randolph during the Mississippian period. In 1541, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto crossed <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River at or near Randolph. French explorer Cavelier de La Salle built the first French fortification at or near Randolph on his 1682 canoe expedition of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River.|$|E

50|$|Geologists {{believe that}} <b>the</b> lower <b>Mississippi</b> {{could take a}} new course to the Gulf. Either of two new routes—through the Atchafalaya Basin or through Lake Pontchartrain—might become <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi's</b> main channel if flood-control {{structures}} are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe flood.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Middle <b>Mississippi</b> is {{relatively}} free-flowing. From St. Louis to the Ohio River confluence, <b>the</b> Middle <b>Mississippi</b> falls 220 ft over 180 mi {{for an average}} rate of [...] At its confluence with the Ohio River, <b>the</b> Middle <b>Mississippi</b> is 315 ft above sea level.

50|$|The Old River Control Structure, between <b>the</b> present <b>Mississippi</b> River {{channel and}} the Atchafalaya Basin, {{sits at the}} normal water {{elevation}} and is ordinarily used to divert 30% of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi's</b> flow to <b>the</b> Atchafalaya River. There is a steep drop here away from <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi's</b> main channel into the Atchafalaya Basin. If this facility were to fail during a major flood, {{there is a strong}} concern the water would scour and erode the river bottom enough to capture <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi's</b> main channel. <b>The</b> structure was nearly lost during the 1973 flood, but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play. In particular, the Corps of Engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity. These additional facilities give the Corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973, which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods, such as that of 2011.|$|R
5|$|Halleck {{appointed}} Pope {{to command}} the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> (and the District of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> Department of the Missouri) on February 23, 1862. Given 25,000 men, {{he was ordered to}} clear Confederate obstacles on <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. He made a surprise march on New Madrid, Missouri, and captured it on March 14. He then orchestrated a campaign to capture Island No. 10, a strongly fortified post garrisoned by 12,000 men and 58 guns. Pope's engineers cut a channel that allowed him to bypass the island. Assisted by the gunboats of Captain Andrew H. Foote, he landed his men on the opposite shore, which isolated the defenders. The island garrison surrendered on April 7, 1862, freeing Union navigation of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> as far south as Memphis.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the banks}} of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River, the {{topography}} of Randolph provided for an ideal harbor for steamboats and flatboats at all river stages.

5|$|Spain had, since 1763, {{controlled}} the lands west of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River, Spanish Louisiana, plus New Orleans on its east bank.

Spain gained possession of British Florida south of 31° N and claimed {{the rest of}} itnorth to 32° 22′ (the junction of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> and Yazoo Rivers). Thereafter, Spain attempted to slow the migration of American settlers into the region, and to lure those already there to secede from the United States. Toward this end, in 1784 the Spanish closed New Orleans to American goods coming down <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi,</b> which was the only viable outlet for the goods produced by many American settlers, and also began selling weapons to the Indian tribes in the Yazoo.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} of Randolph is situated {{on top of}} the second Chickasaw Bluff, on the eastern bank of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River in Tipton County.

No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights.

5|$|Around 1800, Europeans began {{settling}} the land east of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River that was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries {{prior to the}} arrival of Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return for the right to the land east of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River and north of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> state line.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Cantillon became {{involved}} with British mercantilist John Law through <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Company. Based on the monetary theory proposed by William Potter in his 1650 tract The Key of Wealth, John Law posited that increases in the money supply {{would lead to the}} employment of unused land and labour, leading to higher productivity. In 1716, the French government granted him both permission to found the Banque Générale and virtual monopoly over the right to develop French territories in North America, named <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Company. In return, Law promised the French government to finance their debt at low rates of interest. Law began a financial speculative bubble by selling shares of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Company, using the Banque Générales virtual monopoly on the issue of bank notes to finance his investors.|$|E

5|$|Drawn by the city's prosperous economy, the Blackburns {{relocated}} to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1847. Luke Blackburn quickly became {{an active member}} of the community, helping found a temperance society, joining a militia group, and becoming the administrator of a local hospital. He became a close associate of Jefferson Davis and William Johnson. In 1848, Blackburn served as the city's health officer and implemented the first successful quarantine against a yellow fever outbreak in <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River valley. Using his own personal funds, he established a hospital for boatmen who navigated <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. He also successfully lobbied the Congress to establish a hospital in Natchez; upon its completion in 1852, he was appointed surgeon there. In 1854, he implemented another successful quarantine against yellow fever. <b>The</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Legislature commissioned Blackburn to lobby the Louisiana State Legislature to establish a quarantine at New Orleans to protect cities along <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River; Louisiana authorized him to organize such a system.|$|E
5|$|General Kirby Smith {{tried to}} send {{reinforcements}} from his Army of the Trans-Mississippi east of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River to relieve Vicksburg, Mississippi, {{in the spring}} of 1864 following the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill. This was not practicable due to the Union naval control of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. Smith instead dispatched Major General Sterling Price and his cavalry on an invasion of Missouri that was ultimately not successful. Thereafter the war west of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River was principally one of small raids. By May 26 a representative of Smith's negotiated and signed surrender documents with a representative of Major General Edward Canby. Canby in Shreveport, Louisiana, then took custody of Smith's force of 43,000 soldiers when they surrendered, by then the only significant Confederate forces left west of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. With this ended all organized Southern military resistance to the Union forces. Smith signed the surrender papers on June 2 on board the U.S.S. Fort Jackson just outside Galveston Harbor.|$|E
