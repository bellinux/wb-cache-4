25|$|Chronic heavy alcohol {{consumption}} impairs brain development, causes alcohol dementia, brain shrinkage, physical dependence, alcoholic polyneuropathy (also known as 'alcohol leg'), increases neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders and causes {{distortion of the}} brain chemistry. At present, due to poor study design and methodology, <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>is</b> inconclusive on whether moderate {{alcohol consumption}} {{increases the risk of}} dementia or decreases it. Evidence for a protective effect of low to moderate alcohol consumption on age-related cognitive decline and dementia has been suggested by some research; however, other research has not found a protective effect of low to moderate alcohol consumption. Some evidence suggests that low to moderate alcohol consumption may speed up brain volume loss. Chronic consumption of alcohol may result in increased plasma levels of the toxic amino acid homocysteine; which may explain alcohol withdrawal seizures, alcohol-induced brain atrophy and alcohol-related cognitive disturbances. Alcohol's impact on the nervous system can also include disruptions of memory and learning (see Effects of alcohol on memory), such as resulting in a blackout phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics was {{the first}} edited {{collection}} devoted to the [...] "political turn in animal ethics", and the first [...] "book-length attempt at seeking to define the contours" [...] of this literature. The book engages with what the editors call [...] "animal political philosophy", which they identify as an academic literature at the meeting point of animal ethics, political philosophy and real-world but theory-driven politics. Wissenburg and Schlosberg posit that this literature, though at one time {{only a small part}} of more morally-focused animal ethics, has developed into a separate field of enquiry in its own right. They single out two key texts: Robert Garner's 2013 A Theory of Justice for Animals (Oxford University Press) and Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's 2011 Zoopolis (Oxford University Press). Recognising the editors' identification of the political turn in animal ethics, Garner, writing with Siobhan O'Sullivan and Alasdair Cochrane, argues that <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>is</b> both made distinct and unified by its focus on justice; contributions to this literature, these authors argue, [...] "imagine how political institutions, structures and processes might be transformed so as to secure justice for both human and nonhuman animals.

2500|$|Caveat: Not all proofs and proof {{outlines}} below have universal validity.

2500|$|One example {{which is}} cited {{frequently}} throughout <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>is</b> {{the case of}} “shattered silk.” [...] During {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries, many silk manufacturers treated their fabrics with metallic salts (usually containing tin and iron) to give them a heavier, more luxurious feel. [...] However, as these fabrics have aged, the metals in the fibres have accelerated their decay and caused them to become extremely brittle. [...] The shredded or “shattered” effect this causes is the reason for the name. [...] In this case, the environment of the textile contributes very little to the deterioration from the metallic salts, though exposure to light may accelerate it even further.|$|E

For example, an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra {{may or may not}} have a corresponding Lie group. That is, there may be a group corresponding to the Lie algebra, but it might not be nice enough to be called a Lie group, or the connection between the group and the Lie algebra might not be nice enough (for example, failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity).

2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{consistent}} and significant relationships that has been examined in <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>is</b> the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction. [...] In fact, when Judge et al. (1997) developed the construct of core self-evaluations, they did so {{in an effort to}} identify a valid dispositional predictor of job satisfaction. [...] Since the creation of this construct in the Judge et al. (1997) study, research has continued to support the relationship between core self-evaluations and job satisfaction, which suggests that people who appraise themselves positively (i.e., rate themselves highly on core self-evaluations) {{are more likely to be}} satisfied with their jobs. [...] Additional research has also confirmed that CSE traits can predict job satisfaction over time. People who have positive core-self evaluations are likely to be satisfied with their jobs throughout the duration of their lives spent in the work environment.|$|E
2500|$|Another case in <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>is</b> Eugene Pauly, {{known as}} E.P., a {{severely}} amnesic patient (owing to viral encephalitis) {{who was able}} to learn three-word sentences. He performed better on consecutive tests over a 12-week period (24 study sessions). However, when asked how confident he was about the answers, his confidence did not appear to increase. Bayley and Squire proposed his learning was similar to the process required by procedural memory tasks; E.P. could not get the answers right when one word in the three-word sentence was changed or the order of words was changed, and his ability to answer correctly, thus, became more of a [...] "habit." [...] Bayley and Squire claim the learning may have happened in the neocortex, and it happened without the conscious knowledge of E.P. They hypothesized the information may be acquired directly by the neocortex (to which the hippocampus projects) when there is repetition. This case illustrates the difficulty in separating procedural from declarative tasks; this adds another dimension to the complexity of anterograde amnesia.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{findings}} emerge when {{observed and}} self-report procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini’s [...] "irrational" [...] and [...] "postponement" [...] criteria. They {{also sought to}} measure this behavior objectively. During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified {{with the number of}} practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = −0.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = −0.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = −0.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>is</b> based, {{may not be the most}} appropriate measure to use in all cases. It was also found that procrastination itself may not have contributed significantly to poorer grades. Steel et al. noted that those students who completed all of the practice exercises [...] "tended to perform well on the final exam no matter how much they delayed." ...|$|E
