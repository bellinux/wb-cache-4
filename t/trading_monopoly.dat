5|$|The {{mainstay}} of its economy was sugar, grown on cane plantations worked by slaves. The {{sale of the}} crop in Britain enjoyed preferential terms. There were 2,571 declared slaves working on 68 plantations in Essequibo, and 1,648 slaves in Demerara in 1762. These numbers {{were known to be}} much understated, as the slave headcount was the basis of taxation. By 1769, there were 3,986 declared slaves for Essequibo's 92 plantations and 5,967 for Demerara's 206 plantations. The slave labour was in short supply and expensive due to the <b>trading</b> <b>monopoly</b> of the DWIC, and smuggling from Barbados was rife. Dutch colonists ensured white dominance over their growing slave population through the collaboration of indigenous natives, who strongly resisted white domination but could also be relied upon to take up arms against any Spanish incursions. When slaves rose up in Berbice in 1763, natives blocked the border to prevent the disruption from spreading into Demerara.|$|E
25|$|In 1668, Nonsuch {{reached the}} bay and traded for beaver pelts, leading to the {{creation}} of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) which still bears the historic name. The HBC negotiated a <b>trading</b> <b>monopoly</b> from the English crown for the Hudson Bay watershed, called Rupert's Land. France contested this grant by sending several military expeditions to the region, but abandoned its claim in the Treaty of Utrecht (April 1713).|$|E
25|$|Count Roger I of Sicily (1071–1101) {{is known}} to have {{maintained}} men in Mahdia to collect export duties, while Roger II (count from 1105, king 1130–54) twice sent forces against African towns when their rulers defaulted on payments for grain imports. In 1117, when Rafi, governor of Gabès, challenged the <b>trading</b> <b>monopoly</b> of his overlod, Ali ibn Yahyā, emir of Mahdia, he asked Roger for assistance. Rafi was trying to send out a merchant ship from his own port, and Roger responded by sending a small flotilla, which fled when confronted by Mahdian forces. Ali then arrested the Sicilian agents in his town and requested help from his allies, the Almoravids, and Roger pleaded with him to return relations to normal. A low-level naval war of raids and counter-raids ensued between the Normans and the Almoravids into the 1120s. The most serious raid took place against Nicotera in 1122, when women and children were taken captive.|$|E

500|$|By then, however, Rupert's {{attention}} {{had turned}} to North America. The French explorers Radisson and des Groseilliers had come to England after conducting a joint exploration of the Hudson's Bay region in 1659; there their account {{attracted the attention of}} the King and Rupert. Rupert put an initial investment of £270 of his own money into a proposal for a fresh expedition and set about raising more; despite setbacks, including the Great Fire of London, by 1667 he had formed a private syndicate and leased the Eaglet from the King for the expedition. The Eaglet failed, but her sister vessel, the Nonsuch, made a successful expedition, returning in 1669 with furs worth £1,400. In 1670, the King approved the charter for [...] "The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay" [...] that would form the Hudson's Bay Company, which was granted a <b>trading</b> <b>monopoly</b> in the whole Hudson Bay watershed area, an immense territory named Rupert's Land, with Rupert appointed the first Governor. Rupert's first company secretary was Sir James Hayes and Radisson named the Hayes River, in present-day Manitoba, in his honour. The company continued to prosper, forming the basis for much of the commercial activity of colonial Canada. Rupert's role in colonial commerce was marked by his being asked to lay the cornerstone of the new Royal Exchange in 1670, and being made one of its first councillors.|$|E

2500|$|In 1642 the English Civil War began between Charles I and the Parliamentarians, and the Newcastle burgesses {{sided with}} the monarchy. In 1644 Cromwell's forces {{blockaded}} the river to prevent the royalist burgesses from profiting from their coal exports. As a result, London passed that winter almost without coal to burn. To ease this situation Parliament encouraged the export of coal from Blyth and from Wearside. Unfortunately not enough coal was available from those sources to replace the Tyne coal. In the winter of 1644, Scottish troops again crossed the border and Newcastle was besieged for {{three months before the}} garrison capitulated. The Scots occupied Northumberland and Durham for two years and taxes from the coal trade were used to pay for the occupying army. After the Civil War had ended, in 1648, Puritans replaced the Royalist burgesses on the Newcastle Corporation, but the new men were just as anxious to maintain Newcastle's <b>trading</b> <b>monopoly</b> as the burgesses that they replaced. It was at about this time, in 1655, that Ralph Gardiner of Chirton accused the Newcastle Corporation of [...] "tyranny and oppression". He was imprisoned for illegally brewing in North Shields and contravening the monopoly of the Bakers and Brewers Company of Newcastle. Gardiner petitioned Parliament for the abolition of the regulations that forced traders to deal through Newcastle. His petition was unsuccessful.|$|E

However, the Gabel rule was harsh and repressive, breeding much resentment in the Faroese.

However, they too struggled to keep the economy going, and many merchants were trading at a loss. Finally, on 1 January 1856 the <b>trading</b> <b>monopoly</b> was abolished.|$|E
