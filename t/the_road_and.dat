As NY28 continues trending southwest, the valley becomes less developed. Balsam Mountain, another High Peak, looms ahead.|$|E

5|$|After {{environmental}} {{studies on the}} White Slough, Caltrans widened and elevated that section of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>and</b> converted it to a freeway. To accommodate bicycles and pedestrians, a cycleway was built along the eastbound side of the freeway. Finally, Caltrans completed the overpass which crossed SR 29, Broadway, and Mini Drive (bypassing Marine World Parkway, three traffic signaled intersections, and a railroad grade crossing). The project was completed {{in the summer of}} 2005, and fully open to traffic on August 20.|$|E

Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E

5|$|Despite being a major {{coaching}} route, {{there were}} several obstacles along it, including the bridge over the Tyburn. A turnpike trust {{was established in the}} 1730s to improve upkeep of the road. It became notorious as the route taken by prisoners on their final journey from Newgate Prison to the gallows at Tyburn near Marble Arch. Spectators drunkenly jeered at prisoners as they carted along <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>and</b> could buy rope used in the executions from the hangman in taverns.
