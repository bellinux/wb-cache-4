5000|$|... (An {{alternative}} way {{of producing}} a sharp luminance image was the <b>three</b> <b>tube</b> luminance-red-blue <b>camera</b> (the 'YRB' camera). [...] However, this system was not favoured by most manufacturers, because it was deficient in colour hue fidelity. Even so, a 3-tube camera of this type was produced by Bosch/Fernseh, their type KCU40 [...] ).|$|R
25|$|A system sending {{all three}} signals {{at the same}} time at a {{conventional}} refresh rate would be greatly preferable. Transmitting such a signal could be accomplished by using <b>three</b> <b>camera</b> <b>tubes,</b> each with a color filter in front of them, using mirrors or prisms to aim at the same scene through a single lens. Each signal would then be separately broadcast using three conventional TV channels, and using the luminance concept, one of those could be received on a conventional black and white set. This would use a considerable amount of bandwidth, but this was a small cost in the era of only a few television channels.|$|R
5000|$|In 1963, {{prior to}} the {{development}} of the 2001, an experimental four <b>tube</b> <b>camera</b> was constructed by EMI engineers. This experimental camera had been inspired by RCA's new four <b>tube</b> <b>camera,</b> the TK42, and used the same tube arrangement, i.e. a 4½ inch image Orthicon tube in the luminance channel and <b>three</b> 1” Vidicon <b>tubes</b> in the colour channels. In addition, the experimental camera had an integrally mounted Varotal III zoom lens. It was demonstrated to the BBC in 1964 [...] where it received a mixed reception. Pictures from the camera had disappointing colorimetry, but sharp luminance detail.|$|R
2500|$|In 1938 Georges Valensi {{demonstrated}} an encoding scheme {{that would allow}} color broadcasts to be encoded {{so they could be}} picked up on existing black-and-white sets as well. In his system the output of the <b>three</b> <b>camera</b> <b>tubes</b> were re-combined to produce a single [...] "luminance" [...] value that was very similar to a monochrome signal and could be broadcast on the existing VHF frequencies. The color information was encoded in a separate [...] "chrominance" [...] signal, consisting of two separate signals, the original blue signal minus the luminance (B'–Y'), and red-luma (R'–Y'). These signals could then be broadcast separately on a different frequency; a monochrome set would tune in only the luminance signal on the VHF band, while color televisions would tune in both the luminance and chrominance on two different frequencies, and apply the reverse transforms to retrieve the original RGB signal. The downside to this approach is that it required a major boost in bandwidth use, something the FCC was interested in avoiding.|$|R

50|$|In 1962, {{in order}} to address these {{stability}} problems, RCA announced their prototype four-tube camera. The aims of the designers of the camera were, firstly, to produce a camera that was more tolerant to mis-registration and, secondly, to achieve a lighter camera by using smaller vidicon tubes to replace some of the large heavy IO <b>tubes.</b> The <b>camera</b> had an image orthicon tube for the luminance channel and <b>three</b> vidicon <b>tubes</b> for the colour channels. In addition, the camera was fully transistorized, apart from the four pick-up <b>tubes.</b> The <b>camera</b> went into full production in 1963 and sales of several hundred of the model were achieved over the next few years.|$|R
