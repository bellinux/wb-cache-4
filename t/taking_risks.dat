5|$|During {{the months}} leading up to the battle, Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston had {{repeatedly}} retreated from Sherman's superior force. All along the Western and Atlantic Railroad line, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Marietta, Georgia, a pattern was played and replayed: Johnston took up a defensive position, Sherman marched to outflank the Confederate defenses, and Johnston retreated again. After Johnston's withdrawal following the Battle of Resaca, the two armies clashed again at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, but the Confederate senior leadership in Richmond was unhappy with Johnston's perceived reluctance to fight the Union army, even though he had little chance of winning. Thus, on July 17, 1864, as he was preparing for the Battle of Peachtree Creek, Johnston was relieved of his command and replaced by Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. The dismissal and replacement of Johnston remains one of the most controversial decisions of the civil war. Hood, who was fond of <b>taking</b> <b>risks,</b> lashed out at Sherman's army at Peachtree Creek, but the attack failed with more than two thousand five hundred Confederate casualties.|$|E

Therefore, the current cross-sectional study investigated age-related differences in medical <b>risk</b> <b>taking</b> with N = 317 adults aged 20 - 77 years using newly developed scenarios to assess medical <b>risk</b> <b>taking,</b> and additional measures designed to evaluate risk-taking behavior in the medical domain. Greater expected benefits on the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale-Medical (DOSPERT-M) predicted more active <b>risk</b> <b>taking,</b> whereas higher perceived risk predicted less active <b>risk</b> <b>taking.</b> Next, we examined differences in active and passive <b>risk</b> <b>taking,</b> where passive <b>risk</b> <b>taking</b> refers to <b>risk</b> <b>taking</b> that is associated with inaction. Age was associated with less passive <b>risk</b> <b>taking,</b> but not with active <b>risk</b> <b>taking,</b> <b>risk</b> perception, or expected benefits on the DOSPERT-M. Participants were overall more likely to opt for taking medical action than not, even more so for a scenario about a vaccine for a deadly flu than for a scenario about a chemotherapy treatment for cancer. Overall, participants were more likely to accept medication (vaccine or chemotherapy) for their child than for themselves.

In the present study, age patterns in risk-taking propensity (using two laboratory tasks: the Stoplight and the BART) and real-world <b>risk</b> <b>taking</b> (using self-reports of health and antisocial <b>risk</b> <b>taking)</b> were examined in a sample of 5, 227 individuals (50. 7 % female) ages 10 - 30 (M = 17. 05 years, SD = 5. 91) from 11 Western and non-Western countries (China, Colombia, Cyprus, India, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the US). Two hypotheses were tested: (1) <b>risk</b> <b>taking</b> follows an inverted-U pattern across age groups, peaking earlier on measures of <b>risk</b> <b>taking</b> propensity than on measures of real-world <b>risk</b> <b>taking,</b> and (2) age patterns in <b>risk</b> <b>taking</b> propensity are more consistent across countries than age patterns in real-world <b>risk</b> <b>taking.</b> Overall, <b>risk</b> <b>taking</b> followed the hypothesized inverted-U pattern across age groups, with health <b>risk</b> <b>taking</b> evincing the latest peak.

5|$|Johnson then removed Hutton for 57 {{without further}} {{addition}} to the total, caught by Bradman on the run, leaving England at 129/2. The Yorkshire batsman went for a lofted shot and mistimed it {{high in the air}} after being beaten in flight, and the Australian captain ran backwards from mid-on to complete the catch. This meant the two new batsmen at the crease, Edrich and Compton, were still yet to score, and the second new ball was only six overs away, so they had to preserve their wickets while conditions were at their most favourable for Australia's fast bowlers. During a slow period in which only 15 runs came in half an hour, Edrich and Compton were pinned down by defensive field settings with no slips in place. After 45 minutes, Compton premeditated a charge down the pitch and hit Johnson to the leg side for a boundary. The pair accelerated, Compton <b>taking</b> <b>risks</b> in cutting Johnson against the spin. Australia took the new ball and each batsman hit a boundary to bring up the fifty partnership, which took an hour. Worried by the substantial and hazardous craters he and the other bowlers had created in the pitch while following through on the left-hand side of the crease, Lindwall changed to bowling from around the wicket and was warned by umpire Baldwin for running on the pitch, before reverting to over the wicket, although he delivered {{from the edge of the}} crease to avoid the holes. O'Reilly said Baldwin's warning to Lindwall had played into Australia's hands as the bowler's follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander's off stump, which the English bowlers could target when Bradman's men had to chase the target. Compton then hit boundaries with hooks and pulls from Lindwall and Johnston and England went to tea at 209/2. Compton was on 42 and Edrich 33.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without <b>taking</b> <b>risks</b> was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E
