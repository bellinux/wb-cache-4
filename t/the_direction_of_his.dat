5|$|Another {{month of}} {{discussion}} and relatively minor refinement followed, during which several {{attempts were made}} to alter the Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money. Madison in particular wanted to push the Constitution back in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Virginia plan.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} break between the Old Vic 1930–31 and 1931–32 seasons, Richardson {{played at the}} Malvern Festival, under <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> old Birmingham director, Ayliff. Salaries at the Old Vic and the Festival were not large, and Richardson was glad of {{a job as an}} extra in the 1931 film Dreyfus. As his wife's {{condition}} worsened he needed to pay for more and more nursing; she was looked after in a succession of hospitals and care homes.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} frigates contained {{more than}} 200 cannon, which were being transported to Trieste, {{a city in}} north-east Italy {{on the border of}} the Balkan States. It has been suggested by the British historian James Henderson that this action was a factor in Napoleon's decision to change <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> planned eastward expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the underdrawing {{shows that}} the artist {{intended}} a van Eyckian angel crowning the Virgin, but this was omitted from the final painting. He heavily reworked {{the positions of the}} three main figures even towards the end of completion. The draperies of the mantles were at first larger. Christ's body at first faced Luke, but was later tilted in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother. The mother and child were brought closer together. Luke's head was at first level with the Virgin's, but in the final painting is raised slightly above. The differences extend beyond those in the foreground. The fortifications of the inner courtyard have been enlarged, while the two figures looking out over the river were smaller, the river itself narrower.|$|E
5|$|In November HMS Eagle chased and {{captured}} the small French frigate Corcyre in a failed attempt by a French convoy to transport supplies to Corfu. A day later, {{the action of}} 29 November 1811 foiled the most significant French attempt to bring more forces to the Adriatic in 1811 when a British squadron under Captain Murray Maxwell in Alceste chased and engaged two frigates and an armed store ship. One frigate and the store ship were captured, the other reaching Ancona in a disabled state. This action had wide-ranging effects; Napoleon himself {{took an interest in}} the reports, and {{it has been suggested that}} it was this engagement that convinced him to change <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plans for eastwards expansion from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|The British seized her in {{an action}} on 25 September 1806, and the Royal Navy took Minerve into service as Alceste in March 1807; Alceste then {{continued}} to serve throughout the Napoleonic Wars. On 29 November 1811, Alceste led a British squadron that captured a French military convoy carrying more than 200 cannon to Trieste in the Balkans. After this loss, Napoleon changed <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> planned eastward expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia. The British historian James Henderson {{has suggested that the}} two events were linked, and may have changed the course of the war.|$|E

5|$|The action {{came over}} {{eight months after}} the British had {{achieved}} a decisive victory over the French at the Battle of Lissa and was the first squadron action since that engagement. The action of November 1811 {{was the result of the}} British interception of a French military convoy traveling from Corfu to Trieste with a consignment of cannon, and resulted in a British victory, only one French ship escaping capture by the British force. It has been suggested that this action was a factor in Napoleon's decision to change <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> planned eastwards expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{feud with}} Flair he was {{involved}} in angles with The Sandman and Triple H. He then lost to Triple H at Unforgiven 2007 in a no disqualification match where the no disqualification rule only applied to Carlito. In late 2007, Colón requested his release from the WWE as he was unhappy with <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character. Following a meeting with Vince McMahon, however, he was convinced to stay. On December 10, 2007, he was featured in a ladder match at the Raw 15th Anniversary against Jeff Hardy for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, which Hardy won. Carlito defeated Cody Rhodes to qualify for the money in the bank ladder match at Wrestlemania 24. He failed to win at the event. Carlito then formed a tag team with Santino Marella. The team was placed in several matches involving the World Tag Team Championship, twice being named the number one contenders; however, they lost the relevant championship matches.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Carte {{became the}} {{business}} {{manager of the}} Royalty Theatre, under <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> client, the popular singing actress Madame Selina Dolaro. There he programmed Offenbach's La Périchole. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act comic opera that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called Trial by Jury. Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, Cox and Box, had been revived at the Gaiety Theatre in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create Thespis in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for Trial by Jury. Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time. Trial by Jury, a comic treatment of an English courtroom, was an unexpected hit, outrunning La Périchole, and becoming {{the first step in}} Carte's scheme to establish a new genre of English comic opera.|$|E

Harassed due to <b>the</b> <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> studies and frustrated with the Franciscan order's ban {{on the study of}} Greek (because of Erasmus' commentary on the Greek version of the Gospel of Saint Luke), Rabelais petitioned Pope Clement VII (in office 1523-1534) and gained permission to leave the Franciscans and to enter the Benedictine order at Maillezais in Poitou, where he was more warmly received.|$|R
