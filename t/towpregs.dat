40|$|Thermoplastic powder {{impregnation}} {{of continuous}} reinforcement filaments is studied in this work, focusing on impregnation mechanisms and interfacial phenomena. Various existing techniques to mingle powdered resins to continuous filaments are reviewed; a powder impregnation line designed at the Laboratoire de Technologie des Composites et Polymères (LTC) is presented. Two important types of powder coated <b>towpregs</b> are addressed: FIT bundles (Fibres Imprégnées de Thermoplastique) of powder loaded fibres enclosed {{in a thin}} resin sheath, and molten powder <b>towpregs</b> in which the particles are fixed to the fibres in an oven by melting the resin. The impregnation mechanisms of powder coated <b>towpregs</b> are examined. The formation of resin bridges between adjacent fibres is first investigated using a hot stage placed on a microscope. In the absence of externally applied pressure, impregnation is driven by surface energy effects. The driving forces leading to the spreading of the bridge along the fibres are analysed at two levels: at a macroscopic scale, characterising the capillary pressure governing the flow of a liquid into a porous solid, and at a micro-mechanical level analysing the capillary forces in a system defined by a liquid drop in contact with two solid particles. To achieve impregnation at a satisfactory rate, however, {{it is essential to}} apply external pressure to most thermoplastic systems during consolidation. An analytical model for the consolidation stage of unidirectional-powder coated <b>towpregs</b> is presented, placing in context effects due to surface energy, viscous flow, externally applied pressure and fibre bed elasticity. The initial conditions for the computation depend on the impregnation technique used. FIT bundles, and molten powder <b>towpregs</b> are examined. The model is compared at each stage to experimental data obtained by compression moulding powder impregnated <b>towpregs</b> in an instrumented hydraulic press using a closed matched-die mould. This model optimises the processing conditions of a given fibre-resin system to achieve a void free laminate with improved mechanical properties. Mechanical properties can further be improved by optimising interfacial adhesion between resin and fibres. Surface energy effects on composite mechanical properties are studied, relating thermodynamic quantities to adhesive strength. A criterion for optimum adhesion is proposed. The influence of the thermodynamic adhesion between fibres and matrix on the mechanical properties of a continuous fibre reinforced composite is studied for two systems: carbon fibre reinforced poly(ether-ether-ketone) and glass fibre reinforced poly(ether-imide). The fibre surface is modified chemically and characterised by optical contact angle measurements of molten resin droplets on the fibres. Unidirectional fibre reinforced laminates are manufactured. Transverse flexural strength is reported as a function of thermodynamic wetting parameters. Adhesion at the fibre-resin interface is found to correlate with both composite strength and void morphology within the laminate after consolidation. Full potential of powder coated <b>towpregs</b> as a precursor for compression moulded composite parts can be reached by the fabrication of drapeable textile preforms. Corrugated sheets are processed usign FIT woven fabrics.

40|$|In recent years, {{continuous}} fibre reinforced thermoplastic matrix composites {{have been successfully}} employed in the aircraft, military and aerospace industries due to the excellent properties (Brandt et al. 1993 & Nunes et al 2005 a). In these and many other commercial engineering applications, they can replace other materials, such as thermosetting matrix composites. However, {{the high cost of}} the impregnation of {{continuous fibre}} thermoplastic composites, arising from the melting of the polymer or the use of solvents, still restricts their use in commercial applications. Hence, cost reduction largely depends on developing more efficient methods for impregnating fibres with high-viscosity thermoplastics and for processing final composite parts. This chapter summarizes the development of new technologies to fabricate long and continuous fibre reinforced composite structures from thermoplastic matrix semi-products (<b>towpregs</b> and PCT – pre-consolidated tapes) for commercial and highly demanding markets. The production of continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic matrix <b>towpregs</b> and PCT’s was done using a recently developed coating line (Nunes et al. 2008, 2010 & Silva, R. F. et al. 2008). Using this prototype equipment, it was possible to produce glass fibre polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) <b>towpregs</b> for commercial markets and <b>towpregs</b> from carbon fibres and Primospire®, an amorphous highly aromatic material developed by Solvay Advanced Polymers, for application in advanced markets (Nunes et al. 2005, 2009 & Silva, J. F. et al. 2010). To process these thermoplastic pre-pregs into composite structures, conventional thermosetting equipments were adapted to fabricate thermoplastic matrix composites. Filament winding, pultrusion and hot compression moulding were the studied technologies. The mechanical properties determined on the final composites were compared with the theoretical predictions and have shown to be acceptable for the targeted markets. As applications, filament wound pressure vessels prototypes for gas and incompressible fluids were produced from <b>towpregs</b> and submitted to internal pressure burst tests [Silva, J.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Commingling is {{becoming}} an important method for developing thermoplastic composites, which demonstrate significant advantages over thermoset composites in several applications including aerospace, marine, sporting, and auto-motive industries. Although the commingling technique has a very high potential to produce <b>towpregs</b> with a good blending of matrix and reinforcing fibers, {{it has been reported}} that these <b>towpregs</b> tend to de-mingle due to nonuniform stretching during textile and other preforming processes, leading to the segregation of stiffer reinforcing fibers and matrix-forming fibers, which in turn results in poor mechanical properties. Therefore, the current research focuses on the enhancement of stability and homogeneity of commingled yarns during subsequent processing. An attempt has been made to study the effect of the commingling process variables, namely air pressure and volume fraction of matrix-forming fibers on the structure and properties of Glass/Polypropylene, Glass/Polyester, and Glass/Nylon commingled yarns. In this paper, nips are classified into different categories based on their structure. The causes of occurrence and their effect on the commingled yarn properties are identified. Other parameters including nip frequency, nip length, and degree of interlacing are also studied in relation to the process parameters.

40|$|Composite solid {{freeform}} fabrication (C-SFF) or composite layer manufacturing (CLM) is an automated process in which an advanced composite material (a matrix reinforced with continuous fibers) is formed into a freestanding, possibly complex, three-dimensional object. In CLM, {{there is no need}} for molds, dies, or other expensive tooling, and there is usually no need for machining to ensure that the object is formed to the desired net size and shape. CLM is a variant of extrusion-type rapid prototyping, in which a model or prototype of a solid object is built up by controlled extrusion of a polymeric or other material through an orifice that is translated to form patterned layers. The second layer is deposited on top of the first layer, the third layer is deposited on top of the second layer, and so forth, until the stack of layers reaches the desired final thickness and shape. The elements of CLM include (1) preparing a matrix resin in a form in which it will solidify subsequently, (2) mixing the fibers and matrix material to form a continuous pre-impregnated tow (also called "towpreg"), and (3) dispensing the pre-impregnated tow from a nozzle onto a base while moving the nozzle to form the dispensed material into a patterned layer of controlled thickness. When the material deposited into a given layer has solidified, the material for the next layer is deposited and patterned similarly, and so forth, until the desired overall object has been built up as a stack of patterned layers. Preferably, the deposition apparatus is controlled by a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The basic CLM concept can be adapted to the fabrication of parts from a variety of matrix materials.
