5|$|Until 17,800 {{years before}} present, the region {{southeast}} of Hudson {{was covered by}} the glaciers of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age. Their retreat left a series of lakes that caught tephra deposited by volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age only {{large mammals}} such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests {{they came from}} {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Cleveland tri-state area, Youngstown {{is in the}} Mahoning Valley on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, {{the glaciers}} left behind a uniform plain with valleys eroded by the Mahoning River {{crossing}} the plain. Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.|$|E

5|$|Mauna Kea in {{tropical}} Hawaii. There {{is evidence of}} past subglacial eruptive activity on the volcano {{in the form of}} a subglacial deposit on its summit.

5|$|Nueces Bay formed {{approximately}} 9,000 years ago, as the {{sea level}} rose {{at the conclusion of}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age. The sea level stabilized 6,000 years later, shaping the present-day Nueces Bay. The first human inhabitants were the nomadic Aransas Indians, who settled between the Copano and Baffin bays about 8,000 years ago, until 1300 CE. In the next century, the Karankawa Indians arrived, and were present when Europeans came ashore.|$|E
5|$|The Red River Valley is {{the result}} of an ancient glacier carving its way south during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>Ice</b> Age. Once the glacier receded, it formed a glacial lake called Lake Agassiz. The valley is formed from the ancient lake bed. The ancient beaches can still be seen as rolling hills west of the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Fairbanks, the second-largest city in Alaska, {{can be traced}} to the {{founding}} of a trading post by E.T. Barnette on the south bank of the Chena River on August 26, 1901. The area had seen human occupation since at least <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age, but a permanent settlement was not established at the site of Fairbanks until the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} the Chetco River {{watershed}} was created approximately 130million {{years ago when}} the microcontinent collided with the much larger North American continent. The process uplifted the complex and exotic terranes of the microcontinent to form the Klamath Mountains. Many glaciers carved U-shaped valleys and cirques during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age, and several alpine lakes still exist today.|$|E
5|$|The size of glaciers on Mount Rainier has fluctuated {{significantly}} in the past. For example, during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age, from about 25,000 to about 15,000years ago, glaciers covered most of the area now {{within the boundaries of}} Mount Rainier National Park and extended to the perimeter of the present Puget Sound Basin.|$|E
50|$|Tribute to the Gods is {{the seventh}} studio album by heavy metal band Iced Earth. It is notable as <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>Iced</b> Earth album {{featuring}} Larry Tarnowski on lead guitar, and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> featuring singer Matt Barlow on vocals until his 2007 return, and their last album with Century Media. This record technically was first released {{the year before}} in the box set Dark Genesis, but was re-released as a standalone disc in 2002. It was then re-released {{as part of the}} set Enter the Realm of the Gods along with the band's 1989 demo Enter the Realm in 2008 with new cover artwork.|$|R

5|$|The {{species is}} {{believed}} to have evolved from mainland-based ancestors, and may share ancestors with C. melanosterna and C. palearis, as it is phylogenetically closer to these two than it is to C. similis. Access to Utila may have involved over-water dispersal during hurricanes, as is known for Iguana iguana in the Lesser Antilles or a land bridge to the mainland lost during the close of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age.|$|E
5|$|The vastness {{and variety}} of Canada's climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landform separations have defined ancient peoples implicitly into {{cultural}} or linguistic divisions. Canada is surrounded north, east, and west with coastline and since <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age, Canada has consisted of distinct forest regions. Language contributes to {{the identity of a}} people by influencing social life ways and spiritual practices. Aboriginal religions developed from anthropomorphism and animism philosophies.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks of}} which the mountain is made were formed in the caldera of an ancient volcano, {{many of them in}} violently explosive eruptions, about 450 million years ago during the Ordovician period.

40|$|In 2006 the British Geological Survey {{initiated}} a new cross-thematic project specifically {{to examine the}} palaeo-glaciology of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> British <b>Ice</b> Sheet. <b>The</b> project aims to formalise the research carried out by BGS staff since 2001. In collaboration with colleagues at Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberystwyth and Exeter universities and UK Research Centres (BAS, SAMS) we have started to constrain the spatial and temporal limits {{as well as the}} flow dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> British <b>Ice</b> Sheet using geological field evidence, radiometric dating and numerical simulations. This poster summarises some of the key findings so far, including: •	Identification of palaeo-ice streams within the British Ice Sheet, both onshore and on the continental shelf. These include: The Minch, Moray Firth, Forth-Strathmore, Tweed and Witch Ground palaeo-ice streams. •	Reconstruction of lateral and vertical ice-mass extents, in key locations such as the Central Grampian Highlands, the North West Highlands, the Cairngorms and the Southern Uplands. •	Dating of ice-sheet margins using cosmogenic 10 Be in the Cairngorms, Strathspey, Wester Ross, Shetland and the Central Grampian Highlands. •	Simulations of the dynamical evolution of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> British <b>Ice</b> Sheet with high-resolution numerical modelling. •	Recognition of complexity within the Lateglacial landscape record. ...|$|R

5|$|A relict species nearly exterminated by <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age, box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, and {{is found}} in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots. One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to {{be as many as}} 13,000 years old; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8,000 years, which would make it the oldest woody plant east of the Rocky Mountains. Another colony in Pennsylvania, about 1,300 years old, has been protected by the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.|$|E
5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor, which is composed of Blue Lias, the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, {{following the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>ice</b> age. As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E
50|$|Dark Genesis is a five-disc box set by American {{heavy metal}} band Iced Earth, {{released}} on November 27, 2001. It contains remastered versions {{of their first}} three studio albums (Iced Earth, Night of the Stormrider and Burnt Offerings), their rare demo Enter the Realm, and a newly recorded tribute CD, Tribute to the Gods, which contains covers of many songs that have influenced Iced Earth. The Tribute to the Gods CD was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>Iced</b> Earth release to feature lead guitarist Larry Tarnowski, and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> to feature Matt Barlow until his 2007 return. As well, that same disc marked bassist James MacDonough's first Iced Earth disc since 1999, {{as he had been}} absent during the recording of Horror Show.|$|R
