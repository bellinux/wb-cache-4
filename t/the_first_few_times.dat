Furthermore, there was an abundance of ascospores of coprophilous fungi from the pollen spectrum of the baby's mother. Coprophilous fungi are fungi that grow on animal dung and disperse spores in nearby vegetation, which the baby mammoth would then consume.

Rather than disorder-averaged correlation and response functions (as for fully connected systems), the dynamic order parameter is here a measure which represents the disorder averaged single-spin path probabilities, given external perturbation field paths. In the limit of completely asymmetric graphs our macroscopic laws close already {{in terms of the}} single-spin path probabilities at zero external field. For the general case of arbitrary graph symmetry we calculate <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>time</b> steps of <b>the</b> dynamics exactly, and we work out (numerical and analytical) procedures for constructing approximate stationary solutions of our equations.

40|$|The {{parallel}} {{dynamics of}} the fully connected Blume-Emery-Griffiths neural network model is studied for arbitrary temperature. By employing a probabilistic signal-to-noise approach, a recursive scheme is found determining the time evolution {{of the distribution of}} the local fields and, hence, the evolution of the order parameters. A comparison of this approach is made with the generating functional method, allowing to calculate any physical relevant quantity as a function of time.

40|$|Two {{widely used}} channel routing models are the Muskingum and Muskingum-Cunge (M-C) models. However, no {{significant}} {{research has been}} conducted on how input parameter uncertainty and model sensitivity affect the accuracy of the downstream hydrograph. Therefore, the goal of this research was to perform uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of the Muskingum and M-C models. The results of the sensitivity analyses show that neither model is particularly sensitive to variations in channel routing input parameters, although the Muskingum method is slightly more sensitive. The results of the uncertainty analyses indicate that in all models uncertainty in the channel routing input parameters introduce only a moderate amount of error in the downstream hydrograph; whereas uncertainty in the upstream hydrograph could introduce significant errors. Finally, the M-C method gave negative outflows in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>time</b> steps, in agreement with other widely reported results in the literature; however, while others have claimed that negative outflows do not {{have a significant effect on}} the downstream hydrograph, the results presented herein suggest that this is not always true...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of {{a version of the}} batch minority game, with random external information and with different types of inhomogeneous decision noise (additive and multiplicative), using generating functional techniques à la De Dominicis. The control parameters in this model are the ratio alpha=p/N of the number p of possible values for the external information over the number N of trading agents, and the statistical properties of the agents' decision noise parameters. The presence of decision noise is found to have the general effect of damping macroscopic oscillations, which explains why in certain parameter regions it can effectively reduce the market volatility, as observed in earlier studies. In the limit N [...] >infinity we (i) solve <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>time</b> steps of <b>the</b> dynamics (for any alpha), (ii) calculate the location alpha(c) of the phase transition (signaling the onset of anomalous response), and (iii) solve the statics for alpha>alpha(c).

40|$|In many cases, an oil {{production}} rate increase {{can result in}} excessive sand production, casing collapse and expensive workover jobs. In this thesis {{the strength of the}} rock formation around casing perforations is studied by means of the theories of poroelasticity and poroplasticity. Three plasticity models, Tresca, Mohr-Coulomb and Quadratic yield criteria, are considered, with the emphasis for each model being on the use of strain-softening plasticity for calculating inelastic stresses. Hemispherical and long cylindrical cavities are modeled to simulate the perforation cavity. Both associated and nonassociated flow rules are implemented to describe the plastic stress-strain relations. The maximum allowable drawdown and stress distribution in the formation are determined for fluid flowing into the cavity. Effects of formation properties and boundary conditions on cavity collapse are studied and compared. The effect of permeability change in the formation is also studied and analyzed. Calculations based on the strain-softening model are compared with published experimental results. The difference between ground surface pressure and bottom hole pressure in the unsteady-state reservoir problem is studied by an electric analog method. Transient pressure effects can cause premature casing collapse since large pressure gradients exist during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>time</b> steps.

40|$|We {{focus on}} robust and {{efficient}} iterative solvers for the pressure Poisson equation in incompressible Navier-Stokes problems. Preconditioned Krylov subspace methods are popular for these problems, with BiCGStab and GMRES(m) {{most frequently used}} for nonsymmetric systems. BiCGStab is popular because it has cheap iterations, but it may fail for stiff problems, especially early on as the initial guess {{is far from the}} solution. Restarted GMRES is better, more robust, in this phase, but restarting may lead to very slow convergence. Therefore, we evaluate the rGCROT method for these systems. This method recycles a selected subspace of the search space (called recycle space) after a restart. This generally improves the convergence drastically compared with GMRES(m). Recycling subspaces is also advantageous for subsequent linear systems, if the matrix changes slowly or is constant. However, rGCROT iterations are still expensive in memory and computation time compared with those of BiCGStab. Hence, we propose a new, hybrid approach that combines the cheap iterations of BiCGStab with the robustness of rGCROT. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>time</b> steps <b>the</b> algorithm uses rGCROT and builds an effective recycle space, and then it recycles that space in the rBiCGStab solver. We evaluate rGCROT on a turbulent channel flow problem, and we evaluate both rGCROT and the new, hybrid combination of rGCROT and rBiCGStab on a porous medium flow problem. We see substantial performance gains on both problems. Comment: 26 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|Radiative cooling {{in glass}} {{manufacturing}} is simulated using {{the partition of}} unity finite element method. The governing equations consist of a semi-linear transient heat equation for the temperature field and a stationary simplified P 1 approximation for the radiation in non-grey semitransparent media. To integrate the coupled equations in time we consider a linearly implicit scheme in the finite element framework. A class of hyperbolic enrichment functions is proposed to resolve boundary layers near the enclosure walls. Using an industrial electromagnetic spectrum, the proposed method shows an immense {{reduction in the number}} of degrees of freedom required to achieve a certain accuracy compared to the conventional h -version finite element method. Furthermore the method shows a stable behaviour in treating the boundary layers which is shown by studying the solution close to the domain boundaries. The time integration choice is essential to implement a q -refinement procedure introduced in the current study. The enrichment is refined with respect to the steepness of the solution gradient near the domain boundary in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>time</b> steps and is shown to lead to a further significant reduction on top of what is already achieved with the enrichment. The performance of the proposed method is analysed for glass annealing in two enclosures where the simplified P 1 approximation solution with the partition of unity method, the conventional finite element method and the finite difference method are compared to each other and to the full radiative heat transfer as well as the canonical Rosseland model...|$|R
