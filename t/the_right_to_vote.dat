5|$|By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, {{women still}} lacked some {{significant}} rights. Feminists {{in these countries}} continued to fight for voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced {{to do so by}} the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{suffrage}} {{began in}} Britain's Australasian colonies {{at the close}} of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of New Zealand granting women <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in 1893 and South Australia granting female suffrage (<b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> and stand for parliamentary office) in 1895. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902.|$|E

5|$|Biographers Fraser and Navarro {{wrote that}} Eva Perón {{has often been}} {{credited}} with gaining <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for Argentine women. While Eva did make radio addresses in support of women's suffrage and also published articles in her Democracia newspaper asking male Peronists to support women's right to vote, ultimately the ability to grant to women <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> was beyond Eva's powers. Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva's actions were limited to supporting a bill introduced by one of her supporters, Eduardo Colom, a bill that was eventually dropped.|$|E

5|$|After the American Civil War, both Stanton and Anthony {{broke with}} their {{abolitionist}} backgrounds and lobbied strongly against {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted African American men <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> Believing that African American men, {{by virtue of the}} Thirteenth Amendment, already had the legal protections, except for suffrage, offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in the country would only increase the number of voters prepared to deny women <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists, their former partners in working for both African American and women's rights, refused to demand that the language of the amendments be changed to include women.|$|E

5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E
5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court {{suggested}} on an obiter {{basis that}} voting {{is a privilege}} rather than a right. It has been suggested by law academic Thio Li-ann that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer the existence of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in the Constitution from its text and structure, and {{from the fact that}} it is an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy. If <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the judiciary would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore {{position}} may {{be compared}} with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> is entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms. In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960– who have not been convicted of any crime– still enjoy <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in Singapore is not {{explicitly}} stated in Singapore's Constitution, but the Government has expressed {{the view that}} it may be inferred from the fact that Singapore is a representative democracy and from specific constitutional provisions, including Articles 65 and 66 which set out requirements for the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament and the holding of general elections. Speaking on the matter in Parliament in 2009, the Minister for Law, K. Shanmugam, said that <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> could not be a mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in a free country. In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin advocated entrenching <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.|$|E
