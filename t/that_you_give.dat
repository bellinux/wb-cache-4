500|$|In the {{original}} script, Frink appeared more evil. However, when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed {{a voice for}} Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film The Nutty Professor, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide that [...] "He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, and suddenly he became this nutty professor persona. What I love about Hank is <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> him a single lineand most of these characters have very few linesand he just brings it to life. Every time." [...] Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth; they were added later on {{to make him look}} even more like Lewis's character. He was named after television writer John Frink, who was later hired on The Simpsons. The nonsensical utterances that Frink makes are written in the scripts as [...] "Frink noise".|$|E

500|$|While {{residing}} at Greenway Court, Martin {{would have}} preferred more comfortable quarters than the rustic estate, as their living situation there was originally {{supposed to have been}} only temporary until the construction of a grander estate. In 1767, Martin wrote that plans for further construction and improvements at Greenway Court [...] "remain in status quo and in quo state they are likely to remain, ...we are building castles, tho' not on earth where one is greatly wanted, but castles in the air." [...] Martin's uncle Robert Fairfax remarked on the primitive life at Greenway Court among [...] "strange, brutish people... past all conception". For the next thirty years, until Lord Fairfax's death in 1781, Martin remained at Greenway Court and shared in the loneliness and solitude of his [...] "self-exiled" [...] uncle. While established at Greenway Court, Martin engaged in agricultural pursuits. In 1768, Martin described tobacco as the crop [...] "which is our all". Like many other planters and farmers in the Shenandoah Valley, Martin had transitioned to the farming of wheat by 1792, at which time he wrote to his brother in England, [...] "Are you all starving <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> such prices for our flour; farming is now my object." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Young from BBC Music {{said that}} he did not see the actual {{performances}} on the tour and felt that [...] "some of the magnitude of the performance is lost and the track/scene changes appear needlessly long-winded. [...] As far as live albums go, this is a job well done." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork gave a negative review for the album, stating [...] "Madonna herself is mostly to blame. On stage, she draws from a deep well of amazing pop songs and has the money and power to reinvent this sort of traveling circus. So why not try to break down the wall between performance and audience and hold a gigantic rave? [...] Åkerlund gives you everything you don't want from a concert film: incessant quick cuts <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> you no sense of space or stage, overdubbed music and vocals that give you no sense of performance, and only a few shots of the audience to gauge their excitement." [...] Mini Anthikad-Chhibber The Hindu commented that [...] "Madonna pulls out all stops in this effort turn the world into a dance floor and one just has to doff one's hat to her energy." [...] At the 50th Grammy Awards held on February 10, 2008 at Staples Center in Los Angeles, The Confessions Tour won in the category of Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E

2500|$|In Sara Bareilles' album The Blessed Unrest (2013), the 7th {{track is}} titled [...] "Cassiopeia" [...] and is lyrically and metaphorically about the stars. During {{the making of}} The Blessed Unrest, she was given a book about astronomy. She found herself fascinated reading about the {{different}} constellations, especially Cassiopeia, {{as well as the}} topic of supernovas, the incredibly bright bursts of light that stars give off when they explode. Inspired, she penned this song imagining Cassiopeia as a human, and falling in love with another star. [...] "I started to think about how that might feel to personify, you know? The idea of being a star and so far away from everything around you," [...] she told Radio.com [...] "What if a star falls in love? The song is this idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> something up to come together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gregory {{began by}} aggressively {{requiring}} his churchmen {{to seek out}} and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not. In {{a letter to a}} subordinate in Sicily he wrote: [...] "I asked you most of all {{to take care of the}} poor. And if you knew of people in poverty, you should have pointed them out ... I desire <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> the woman, Pateria, forty solidi for the children's shoes and forty bushels of grain ...." [...] Soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a build-up to a great plan that he had in mind. He understood that expenses must be matched by income. To pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici. The churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding a citizen’s {{obedience}} to authority, Socrates {{says that a}} lawful authority, either human or divine, should always be obeyed. That in a conflict of {{obedience to}} such authorities, obeying divine authority supersedes obeying human authority: [...] "Gentlemen, I am your grateful and devoted servant, but I owe a greater obedience to the [...] god than to you; and, as long as I draw breath and have my faculties, I shall never stop practicing philosophy". That, as spokesman for the Oracle at Delphi, he is to spur the Athenians to greater awareness of ethics and moral conduct, and always shall question and argue, even if his accusers — Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus — withdraw their accusations against him. Therefore, the philosopher Socrates of Athens asks his fellow citizens: [...] "Are you not ashamed <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> your attention to acquiring {{as much money as}} possible, and similarly with reputation and honour, and give no attention or thought to truth and understanding, and the perfection of your soul?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2013 {{he again}} {{suggested}} that African Americans possess a [...] "slick" [...] style of boxing which {{is superior to}} other styles (presumably practiced by non-African Americans). [...] "The great Sugar Ray Leonard, right now, if he was boxing, {{the way that they}} want you to fight, the people that pull the strings of the puppet, he would be boring today. Ray Robinson – the great Robinson – would be boring today…Because the feeders of the people that buy entertainment. They're being fed that if they duck, don't buy it. If they're slick, and they beat [...] nine out of the 12 rounds, and the guy just can't hit him because they were slick and smart enough to hit and not get hit, 'He's not crowd-pleasing, he don't sell tickets.' Because they done fed the followers and they done fed [...] to the customers. The customers will drink anything <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> them if it's promoted right…But when you take away the skill and you take away the slick, and you take away the boxing ability and say that's not entertaining, or that's not entertainment, then, to me, it's like trying to erase a culture that you know has dominated the sport way back then where you were slick. And I'm talking about black fighters. Yes, I said it", said Hopkins.|$|E
2500|$|Jo Garfein at TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} preview, saying, [...] "This episode {{has more of}} an early X-Files feel, in a good way... To {{those of you who}} have either given up on the series or are on the fence, I recommend <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> Fringe another try. If 'Inner Child' is any indication, we are in for a very satisfying and engaging journey for the rest of the season." [...] Alan Sepinwall's review in The Star-Ledger was overall positive, [...] "As far as the episode as a whole goes, I thought it was fairly solid procedural hour of 'Fringe.' No, it didn't follow up on any of the revelations from 'Ability,' but it also didn't feature any of Agent Harris, and both the serial killer case and Olivia's rapport with the kid were compelling enough that I can wait on the mythology stuff for later." [...] Jane Boursaw at TV Squad rated the episode very highly in her recap, and also mooted a theory about the Child, [...] "My theory is that the boy is another Observer. They certainly looked a lot alike, didn't they? Could the boy have come from another dimension and ended up beneath the building? And why did the CIA guy say that they'd found 'another one.'" [...] Apparently, they're keeping track of these creatures or Observers. And if so, where are the others?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
