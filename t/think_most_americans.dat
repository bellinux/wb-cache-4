"I dare say, Miss Eve, {{that your}} gentle nature was {{disposed}} to judge him as kindly as possible; and, then, I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans,</b> {{ever since the}} treaty of Ghent, have been disposed to view all Russians too favourably. No, no; I am satisfied with {{the account of the}} English; they live much nearer to St. Petersburg than we do, and they are more accustomed, too, to give accounts of such matters." ...|$|E
5000|$|Althouse {{has said}} that she is pro-choice and opposes overruling Roe v. Wade, but {{has said that}} she [...] "does in fact think {{abortion}} is wrong. I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> agree with me and think it's wrong, but not {{the role of government}} to police." ...|$|E
40|$|Substantial {{reductions}} in {{personal income tax}} rates and an elimination of the estate tax have been major priorities for the current presidential administration. When arguing for tax cuts, George W. Bush has frequently told Americans that “It’s your money. ” According to Princeton University ethicist Peter Singer, “His message was that when governments tax their subjects, they take money that belongs to the taxpayers and spend it—instead of letting the taxpayers decide for themselves {{how they want to}} spend it” (Singer 2004, p. 11). Singer <b>thinks</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> believe taxes are their money. As he puts it, “Of course it was their money—where else did the government get its money from, but by taxing the money they earned?” (p. 14) ...|$|R
5000|$|Vice President Dick Cheney {{weighed in}} on the Wright matter on April 10, 2008. He {{appeared}} on Sean Hannity's radio show and said, [...] "I thought {{some of the things}} he said were absolutely appalling... I haven't gotten into the business of trying to judge how Sen. Obama dealt with it, or didn't deal with it, but I <b>think,</b> like <b>most</b> <b>Americans,</b> I was stunned at what the reverend was preaching in his church and then putting up on his Web site." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shimkus {{has been}} a proponent of {{legislation}} to increase {{the ability of the}} Food and Drug Administration to institute recalls of tainted foods. He has served as one of the chief Republican negotiators on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. Of the bill, he said: [...] "When you're talking about {{the health and safety of}} folks, if the FDA has enough evidence to make a declaration of recall, I <b>think</b> that <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> would support the government having that authority." ...|$|R

5000|$|In an August 2008 interview, Carter accused Republican {{presidential nominee}} John McCain of [...] "milking every {{possible}} drop of advantage" [...] in mentioning {{his status as}} a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. McCain responded to Carter's comments during an appearance on Fox News: [...] "I have great respect for former president Carter, but it's not first time we have disagreed. I don't <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> share that view. In fact, most of my supporters say talk more about your experiences, they were formative experiences." ...|$|E
5000|$|An initial {{objection}} of Republicans in the Senate {{was that}} proposing {{to pay for}} the services by raising the federal tax on cigarettes, from 24 cents a pack to 67 cents a pack, ignored the likely consequence that sale of tobacco products would decrease and tax revenues would increasingly fall short of those needed {{to pay for the}} expansion of benefits. [...] Kennedy and Hatch scoffed at the objection, with the former saying, [...] "If we can keep people healthy and stop them from dying, I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> would say 'Amen; isn't that a great result?' If fewer people smoke, states will save far more in lower health costs than they will lose in revenues from the cigarette tax." [...] Republicans also criticized the bill as an open-ended entitlement program, although it was structured as a block grant rather than an entitlement; Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was an early opponent of the measure, calling it a [...] "big-government program" [...] that would not pass.|$|E
40|$|In 2004, President George W. Bush said, “I {{believe in}} private {{property}} so much, I want everyone in America to have some. ” Much earlier, in 1948, {{an economics professor}} from the University of Texas expressed the same sentiment in strikingly similar terms. When asked by an investigatory committee of the Texas legislature whether he favored private property, he replied, “I do... and so strongly that I want everyone in Texas to have some. ” Even putting aside {{the possibility that the}} President’s speechwriters found inspiration in an unacknowledged source, there are several interesting things to note about these two statements. More than a half-century stands between them. One speaker, President Bush, was and is a Republican politician somewhat to the right. The economist, in contrast, was a wellknown leftist. Yet despite the distance between the two men in years and ideological outlooks, both seemed to endorse the property system and the wide distribution of property rights. I am inclined to <b>think</b> that <b>most</b> <b>Americans</b> would express similar sentiments today, although the meanings they attach to their words might vary considerably {{when it comes down to}} particulars. And regarding particulars, I am confident that there is much less contentiousness about the operation of the property system for any given distribution of rights then there is about what the actual distribution of rights should be. In other words, property rights are one thing, and rights to property quite another...|$|R

"I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> of us {{secretly}} know - {{and those}} of us at the radical middle are inclined to say - that without such concepts as duty and honor and service, no civilization can endure. ...

Exactly the kind of choice my generation did not have during the Vietnam War." [...] - Mark Satin in 2004, on mandatory national service and the individual conscience.|$|R
