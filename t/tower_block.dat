5|$|Construction on the {{buildings}} for the Canterbury College, which {{later became the}} University of Canterbury, began {{with the construction of}} the clock <b>tower</b> <b>block.</b> This edifice, which opened in 1877, was the first purpose built university in New Zealand. The College was completed in two subsequent stages in Mountfort's usual Gothic style.|$|E
5|$|EWH Gifford and Partners {{were the}} {{structural}} engineers, while the general contractors were {{a company called}} Trollope and Colls Limited. The designers settled on a <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> so as to leave {{as much of the}} gardens and grounds intact as they could.|$|E

5000|$|However, the <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> soon {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} and were blighted by crime, and refurbishment and concierge programmes {{in the late}} 1980s and early 1990s did little to solve these problems. In March 1998, the council decided to demolish the two tallest <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> while retaining the third, and by the following April all of the 170 residents in the condemned <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> had been rehoused. The <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> were flattened in a controlled explosion on 18 July 1999, by which time the remaining block had been refurbished.|$|R

Planned for {{the ninth}} and tenth episodes of the fifth series, it would have focused on Clyde and Rani and seen them trapped in the lift of a <b>tower</b> <b>block.</b> This script has since been {{reworked}} by Ford and was featured {{as part of the}} Wizards vs Aliens series.|$|E
5|$|Another tragedy {{occurred}} {{on the morning of}} 16 May 1968 when Ronan Point, a 23-storey <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> in Newham, suffered a structural collapse due to a natural gas explosion. Four people were killed in the disaster and seventeen were injured, as an entire corner of the building slid away. The collapse caused major changes in UK building regulations and led to the decline of further building of high rise council flats that had characterised 1960s public architecture.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} {{extensively}} redeveloped during the 1950s and 1960s. This included {{the construction of}} large <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> estates, such as Castle Vale. The Bull Ring was reconstructed and New Street station was redeveloped. In the decades following World War II, the ethnic makeup of Birmingham changed significantly, as it received waves of immigration from the Commonwealth of Nations and beyond. The city's population peaked in 1951 at 1,113,000 residents.|$|E
50|$|While local {{authorities}} and their architects intended to create <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> that encouraged harmonious and vibrant communities, often the results were far from ideal. Post-war <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> were compromised from the outset {{by a combination of}} faults: {{local authorities}} advocated impractical architectural methods; design and construction faults were frequently reproduced; and there appeared to be a lack of understanding about the social consequences of certain design features. Collectively, these oversights transformed many <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> into undesirable places to live. By 1985, 45% of people living in <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> were in the ten poorest local authorities in the country.|$|R
50|$|Two of {{the four}} <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> on the 1960s Riddins Mound Estate in Cradley Heath were {{demolished}} in 1996. The remaining properties in the area, including the two surviving <b>tower</b> <b>blocks,</b> have been refurbished.|$|R
50|$|After discussions over height, it {{was decided}} that the <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> should be 32 storeys tall, one storey taller than the Red Road <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> in Glasgow, Scotland. It was decided to {{construct}} them out of concrete, which was common among <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> in the city during that time. They were designed by Bryant's Ltd. and both towers were identical though angled differently to provide a different perspective to each block.|$|R
5|$|In {{a partial}} {{reaction}} against the Manzoni years, Birmingham City Council is demolishing {{some of the}} brutalist buildings like the Central Library and has an extensive <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> demolition and renovation programme. There has been much redevelopment in the city centre in recent years, including the award-winning Future Systems' Selfridges building in the Bullring Shopping Centre, the Brindleyplace regeneration project, the Millennium Point science and technology centre, and the refurbishment of the iconic Rotunda building. Funding {{for many of these}} projects has come from the European Union; the Town Hall for example received £3million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{redevelopment}} and anti-Victorianism {{resulted in}} the loss of dozens of Victorian buildings like New Street station and the old Central Library, often replaced by brutalist architecture. Sir Herbert Manzoni, City Engineer and Surveyor of Birmingham from 1935 until 1963, believed conservation of old buildings was sentimental and that the city did not have any of worth anyway. In inner-city areas too, much Victorian housing was demolished and redeveloped. Existing communities were relocated to <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> estates like Castle Vale.|$|E
5|$|H.S. Pledge & Sons Ltd built two flour {{mills in}} Ashford, {{and became an}} {{important}} employer in the town. The first opened on Victoria Road in 1890 while the second opened on East Hill in 1901. The mills closed in 1972 and were both partially destroyed by subsequent fires. The East Hill Mill fire occurred in 1974, but the main six-storey <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> survived. It {{was used as a}} nightclub until 2014, when the nearby Ashford School, which acquired the building in 2011, decided not to renew the lease. The Victoria Mills were almost completely destroyed by a fire in September 1984, and the remainder of the building had to be demolished.|$|E
50|$|Originally called Gutters {{and later}} Goodtrees, the estate was renamed Moredun in 1769. In the sixties six <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> were built, whilst all six remain a large project was {{undertaken}} to refurbish these <b>tower</b> <b>blocks,</b> {{to coincide with}} the building of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Two of these <b>tower</b> <b>blocks,</b> Moncreiffe House and Forteviot House, are within the geographical boundary of Moredun proper, while the other four are in neighbouring Craigour.|$|R
5000|$|In South Korea the <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> {{are called}} Apartment Complex (...) [...] The first {{residential}} towers {{began to be}} built after the Korean War. The South Korean government needed to build many apartment complexes in the cities {{to be able to}} accommodate the citizens. In the 60 years since, as the population increased considerably, <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> have become more common. This time however the new <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> integrated shopping malls, parking systems and other convenient facilities.|$|R
2500|$|Other <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> {{are being}} {{investigated}} over structural safety concerns. Four 13-storey <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> on the Ledbury estate in Peckham {{have had their}} gas supplies cut off as a precaution. In {{the event of a}} gas explosion, they could be at risk of collapse. These blocks, containing 242 flats, were constructed using the same [...] "large panel system" [...] as Ronan Point, which partly collapsed in 1968. There are fears that more <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> across the country may also be at risk.|$|R
5|$|Mass {{entertainment}} {{facilities in}} the town include the Brookside Theatre, Romford Greyhound Stadium, {{one of the few}} remaining dog racing tracks in London; 2 multi-screen cinemas; and until April 2013 Romford Ice Arena, which was home to the local Romford Raiders ice hockey team. The Dolphin Centre was a popular swimming and leisure facility located in the town from 1982 to 1995, but the site was redeveloped into the current Axis residential <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> and Asda superstore in the mid-2000s. There is also a Romford F.C. associated with the town. Romford Bowls Club, the premier bowls club in Essex, is based in Lodge Farm Park. The town is strongly associated with the electronic music group Underworld.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} utilitarian, {{as part of}} the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the <b>tower</b> <b>block,</b> championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|In April 1972 {{her husband}} Casimiro died; {{he had never}} taken an {{interest}} in Wicca or esotericism and Valiente later claimed that theirs had been an unhappy relationship. Newly widowed, she soon had to move as the local council decided that her home was unfit for human habitation; she was relocated into council accommodation in the mid-1960s <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> of Tyson Place in Grosvenor Square, Brighton. Her flat was described by visitors as cramped, being filled with thousands of books. It was there that she met Ronald Cooke, {{a member of the}} apartment block's residents' committee; they entered into a relationship and she initiated him into Wicca, where he became her working partner. Together they regularly explored the Sussex countryside, and went on several holidays to Glastonbury, further considering moving there. She also joined a coven that was operating in the local area, Silver Malkin, after it was established by the Wiccan High Priestess Sally Griffyn.|$|E
50|$|Seven <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> {{in total}} were refurbished. A row of four {{overlooking}} the Middleway called Audleigh, Chiswick, Faraday and Hogarth House were refurbished {{early in the}} development. A group of three shorter <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> known as Avon, Lansdown and Nash House were also refurbished.|$|R
50|$|The Sentinels are two 90 metre tall {{residential}} <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> on Holloway Head in Birmingham, England. The two towers, called Clydesdale Tower and Cleveland Tower, {{are both}} 31 stories tall and {{were part of}} a major regeneration scheme following World War II which consisted of the construction of hundreds of <b>tower</b> <b>blocks.</b> They are the tallest purely residential <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> in the city. They are surpassed by the newer Radisson Blu directly across Holloway Circus Queensway with 40 floors but this incorporates a hotel as residences.|$|R
50|$|Initially, <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> were welcomed, {{and their}} {{excellent}} views made them popular living places. Later, as the buildings themselves deteriorated, they grew {{a reputation for}} being undesirable low cost housing, and many <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> saw rising crime levels, increasing their unpopularity. One response to this was the great {{increase in the number of}} housing estates built, which in turn brings its own problems. In the UK, <b>tower</b> <b>blocks</b> particularly lost popularity after the partial collapse of Ronan Point in east London in 1968. They are still present in many British cities.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} was first operated as the Christchurch studio for Television New Zealand (TVNZ), who displayed their logo on the building. Shows such as What Now, After School, Simon Barnett's quiz show Face the Music and later The Son of a Gunn Show were filmed in the <b>tower</b> <b>block.</b> TVNZ vacated {{the building in}} late 1998 following a decision to move all of their Christchurch-produced shows to Wellington. In the late 1990s, Telstra New Zealand, the telecommunications company of Telstra in New Zealand, owned the naming rights to the building. After Clear Communications was acquired in December 2001 to form TelstraClear, the Clear logo was prominently displayed on the building. The building's naming rights were sold to The Radio Network and it was renamed to Radio Network House during the ownership of Nor West Arch No.4 Ltd. At the time of demolition the logo of Newstalk ZB, a subsidiary of The Radio Network, was displayed on the building.|$|E
5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM transmitters were being built by more adventurous builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality cassette recorder, a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting {{from the roof of}} a fifteen storey <b>tower</b> <b>block</b> could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary transmitters on the roof of tower blocks.|$|E
5|$|The main {{thrust of}} post-war {{planning}} {{would be one}} of clearance and rebuilding, beginning in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began, resulting, in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, in low flats in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end.

Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow, for demolitions at the University of Edinburgh and the stark rebuilding typified by the David Hume Tower (1960–63). The new confidence of this period can also be seen in infrastructure projects, of which the Forth Road Bridge (opened 1962) was a key example.|$|E
