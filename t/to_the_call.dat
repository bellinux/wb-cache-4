5|$|The maindeck of Chesapeake {{was almost}} deserted, having been swept by Shannons gunfire; the {{surviving}} gun crews had either responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> for boarders or had taken refuge below. Two American officers, Lieutenant Cox (who {{had returned from}} carrying Captain Lawrence down to the surgeon) and Midshipman Russell saw that the aftmost 18-pounders on the port side, still bore on Shannon and working between them managed to fire both.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, Lipsett responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> {{from the}} Colonial Office for young staff {{officers}} {{to operate in}} colonial military academies, as military education had been standardised throughout the British Empire in 1909. Lipsett was sent to Canada and promoted to major (in 1913), working hard to improve training in the Dominion. He instigated numerous new training courses and special schools, establishing close ties with the Canadian military establishment and personally training most {{of the next generation}} of Canadian staff officers and generals.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} future, in the year 2039, where humans have begun deep space exploration. A {{distress}} call is transmitted from a crippled ship near an alien planet. The game's protagonist, a special soldier, responds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>call.</b> Upon boarding the ship, the soldier discovers it has been overrun by hostile aliens. The aliens have captured the human crew for an unknown purpose. The story has sections that take place aboard the space craft and on the planet's surface. The protagonist's overall goal is to rescue as many human hostages as possible, eliminate the alien threat, and escape the space craft.|$|E
5|$|The tremolo call—sometimes {{called the}} “laughing” call—is {{characterized}} by its short, wavering quality. It often uses this call to signal distress or alarm caused by territorial disputes or perceived threats. It emits a tremulous series {{of up to}} 10 rather high notes (hu)-heheheheheheha. It also uses the tremolo to communicate its presence to other loons when they arrive at a lake, often when they are flying overhead. It is the only vocalization used in flight. The tremolo call has varying three levels of intensities that correlate with a loon’s level of distress, and the types are differentiated by increasingly higher pitch frequencies added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, the {{residents}} of Romney set about repairing public buildings and reestablishing the town's antebellum institutions, including the Romney Literary Society. The society remained on a hiatus until May 15, 1869 when a meeting was held by nine members, as only nine original members had responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> for reorganization. These nine members tasked with rebuilding the society were James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. Lupton, James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. These men sought to collect {{what remained of the}} library's books and engaged in a campaign to recruit new members, which resulted in the enrollment of 20 younger men over a period of a few years. Many of the men who had been members in 1861 had died during the war, and the recruitment of new members was essential to the revival of the society. Among the new members elected between 1869 and 1886 were John Collins Covell, Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy, Henry Bell Gilkeson, Howard Hille Johnson, and Christian Streit White. The society, with renewed vigor, took a lead role in Romney's civil development during the Reconstruction Era.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005 Sihanouk accused Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam of {{encroaching}} into Cambodian territory, through unilateral border demarcation exercises without Cambodian participation. Two months later, Sihanouk {{formed the}} Supreme National Council on Border Affairs (SNCBA), which he headed, {{to address these}} concerns. While the SRP and Chea Sim expressed support for Sihanouk {{for the formation of}} the SNCBA, Hun Sen decided to form a separate body, National Authority on Border Affairs (NABA), to deal with border concerns, with SNCBA to serve only as an advisory body. After Hun Sen signed a border treaty with Vietnam in October 2005, Sihanouk dissolved the SNCBA. In August 2007 the Cambodian Action Committee for Justice and Equity, a US-based human rights NGO, called for Sihanouk's State immunity to be lifted, so as to allow him to testify in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Sihanouk responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> by inviting the ECCC public affairs officer, Peter Foster, for a discussion session on his personal experience under the Khmer Rouge regime. Both Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC criticized the suggestion, with the latter accusing the NGO of being disrespectful. The ECCC subsequently rejected Sihanouk's invitation.|$|E
5|$|The Anonimalle Chronicle gives a clear {{account of}} the unrest in East Anglia. On hearing of the rebellion, Henry le Despenser acted swiftly, moving through Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk {{from his home in}} Burley, Rutland. His armed force {{initially}} consisted of his personal retinue, but ultimately became a much larger force consisting of many knights and other men who had previously not dared to confront the rebels. According to the historian Edgar Powell, Henry Dispenser undertook the task of dealing with the revolt in his diocese and punishing the rebels. He was involved in crushing rebellions at Peterborough and elsewhere, before moving on to suppress the revolts in Cambridge. The authorities were alerted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> in Norfolk for men to join the revolt in the name of Litster. On 17 June the rebels from the north and east of the county assembled on Mousehold Heath, outside Norwich: shortly afterwards, Sir Robert Salle, who had come out of the city to speak with the commons, was killed. According to Thomas Walsingham, the knight died soon after he was 'knocked on the head by a rustic who was one of his own serfs'. The rebels then entered Norwich and wreaked havoc, destroying property and killing several prominent citizens. Other houses and church properties within the county (such as at Yarmouth) were attacked by the rebels at this time.|$|E
