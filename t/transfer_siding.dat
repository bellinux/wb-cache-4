50|$|The GWR Coleford branch from Wyesham Jn closed after 31 December 1916, but 71 chains from Coleford to Whitecliff was {{retained}} {{to serve}} the quarry there. Access was via the <b>transfer</b> <b>siding</b> and involved four reversals, until 1951 when the siding was realigned.|$|E
50|$|At Furzebrook, {{the railway}} crossed the mineral tramway {{belonging}} to Pike Brothers, {{known as the}} Furzebrook Railway; the tramway {{was used for the}} transport of ball clay. No connection was made at first, and the Furzebrook line used the track gauge of 2 ft 8½ in (825 mm), but a <b>transfer</b> <b>siding</b> was later installed.|$|E

50|$|The 1890 Act for the West Highland Railway {{included}} a short branch {{line from a}} junction near Fort William to Banavie, at a location adjacent to the Caledonian Canal. This was duly completed and opened on 1 June 1895. The line arched round to the north-east {{and there was a}} station, alongside the canal and some distance north-east of the present-day station. This location was near the head of the series of locks known as Neptune's Staircase by which the canal rises 20 m and a <b>transfer</b> <b>siding</b> adjacent to the canal needed to climb by a 1 in 24 gradient to reach a backshunt.|$|E
50|$|PANi is a {{conductive}} polymer that is stable in air. When {{combined with the}} free radical-forming TCNQ as an acceptor molecule, it can mimic the mechanism of metallic magnets. The magnetic properties arise from the fully pi-conjugated nitrogen-containing backbone combined with molecular charge <b>transfer</b> <b>side</b> groups. These properties cause the molecule {{to have a high}} density of localized spins that can give rise to coupling of their magnetic fields. When this polymer magnet is synthesized, the polymer chains need 3 months to line up before displaying any notable magnetism.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{measurement}} error of heat transfer in water and air side for finned-tube heat-exchanger as little as possible, and design a heat-exchanger test-board measurement system economically, based on the principle of test-board system error analyses and design, the equation of measurement error of heat <b>transfer</b> in air <b>side</b> and water side about orifice meter for the finned-tube heat-exchanger was obtained. This paper studies the major factors that may influence the largest admitted measurement error of measurement instruments for heat transfer in water and air side, and analyzes the degree that water temperature and pressure measurement influence heat <b>transfer</b> in water <b>side,</b> and the degree that wet bulb temperature difference measurement influences heat <b>transfer</b> in air <b>side.</b> Finally, this paper indicates that the key problem of reducing heat <b>transfer</b> in water <b>side</b> is water temperature measurement of the in-out pipe of heat-exchanger, and wet bulb temperature difference is a key to decrease the heat <b>transfer</b> in air <b>side</b> for finned-tube heat-exchanger. This paper gives a theoretical instruction for designing the measurement system of a finned-tube heat-exchanger test-boar...|$|R

5000|$|During suction blistering, the lamina lucida of {{the skin}} is cleaved from the {{underlying}} layers. This separates the epidermis from the dermis. With the use of small vacuum pumps, little fluid-filled blisters are created, typically on the abdomen. Blisters are usually formed within 2 to 3 hours. A well-recognized instrument, the Negative Pressure Instrument, from Electronic Diversities, Finksburg MD, US, is used with heated chambers to produce various-sized suction blisters with less time and improved success. [...] The blisters are then cut, emptied and the loose skin is <b>transferred</b> <b>side</b> by side to the non-healing wound.|$|R
