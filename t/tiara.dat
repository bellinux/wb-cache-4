5|$|The Papal <b>Tiara</b> or triregnum is the three-tiered crown {{used by the}} Pope as a {{sovereign}} power. It is first found as an independent emblem in the 13th century, though at that time with only one coronet. In the 15th century, the <b>tiara</b> was combined with the keys above the papal shield. The <b>tiara</b> and keys together within a shield form the arms of Vatican City. In heraldry, the white <b>tiara</b> is depicted with a bulbous shape and with two attached red strips called lappets or infulae. The coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI sparked controversy by displaying a mitre and pallium instead of the customary <b>tiara.</b>|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary had the <b>tiara</b> {{altered to}} {{accommodate}} 15 of the Cambridge cabochon emeralds. The original drop pearls {{can easily be}} replaced {{as an alternative to}} the emeralds. Queen Elizabeth II inherited the <b>tiara</b> directly from her grandmother in 1953. It is almost exclusively worn together with the Cambridge and Delhi Durbar parures, also containing large emeralds. Elizabeth wore the <b>tiara</b> in her official portrait as Queen of Canada as none of the Commonwealth realms besides the United Kingdom have their own crown jewels.|$|E
5|$|The George III Fringe <b>Tiara</b> is a circlet {{incorporating}} brilliant diamonds {{that were}} formerly owned by George III. Originally commissioned in 1830, the <b>tiara</b> has been worn by many queens consort. Originally, {{it could be}} worn as a collar or necklace or mounted on a wire to form the <b>tiara.</b> Queen Victoria wore it as a <b>tiara</b> {{during a visit to}} the Royal Opera in 1839. In Franz Xaver Winterhalter's painting The First of May, completed in 1851, Victoria can be seen wearing it as she holds Prince Arthur, the future Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. In a veiled reference to the adoration of the Magi, the Duke of Wellington is seen presenting the young prince with a gift.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, Neoclassicism {{gave rise to}} a revival of <b>tiaras,</b> but this time it was a solely female adornment. Jewelers taking {{inspiration}} from Ancient Greece and Rome created new wreaths made from precious gemstones. [...] Napoleon and his wife Jos√©phine de Beauharnais are credited with popularizing <b>tiaras</b> along with the new Empire style. Napoleon wanted the French court to be the grandest in Europe and had given his wife many fabulous Parures which included <b>tiaras.</b>|$|R
5|$|This <b>tiara,</b> made by Cartier in 1936, was {{purchased}} by the Duke of York (later George VI) for his wife (later the Queen Mother) three weeks before they became king and queen. It has a rolling cascade of 16 scrolls that converge on two central scrolls topped by a diamond. Altogether, it contains 739 brilliants and 149 baton diamonds. The <b>tiara</b> was given to Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944, and was borrowed by Princess Margaret, who used it at the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Later, Elizabeth lent the Halo <b>Tiara</b> to Princess Anne, before giving her the Greek Meander <b>Tiara</b> in 1972. The Halo <b>Tiara</b> was lent to the Duchess of Cambridge to use at her wedding to Prince William in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Holy See, another Catholic see has {{the right}} to bear the triple <b>tiara</b> in its coat of arms: the Patriarchate of Lisbon. The title of Patriarch of Lisbon was created in 1716 and is held by the {{archbishop}} of Lisbon since 1740. While the coat of arms of the Holy See combines the <b>tiara</b> with the crossed keys of St. Peter, that of the Lisbon Patriarchate combines it with a processional cross and a pastoral staff.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Queen Mary asked Garrard & Co. {{to make a}} copy of a <b>tiara</b> {{owned by}} her grandmother, Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel, using the queen's own {{diamonds}} and pearls. French in its neo-classical design, the <b>tiara</b> has 19 oriental pearls suspended from lover's knot bows each centred with a large brilliant. Mary left the <b>tiara</b> to Elizabeth II, who later gave it to Diana, Princess of Wales, as a wedding present. She wore it often, notably with her 'Elvis dress' on a visit to Hong Kong in 1989, but on her divorce from Prince Charles it was returned to the Queen. In 2015 and 2016, the Duchess of Cambridge wore it to a diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace.|$|E

Examples include <b>tiaras</b> given to Popes John XXIII and Paul VI, the former by John's home region, the latter by Paul's previous archiepiscopal see of Milan on their election to the papacy.|$|R

5|$|The Delhi Durbar <b>Tiara</b> {{was made}} by Garrard & Co. for Queen Mary, the wife of George V, to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911. As British law {{prohibited}} {{the removal of the}} Crown Jewels from the country, George V wore a specially made crown (the Imperial Crown of India) to the Durbar, and his consort Queen Mary wore the <b>tiara.</b> It was part of a set of jewellery made for Queen Mary to use at the event which included a necklace, stomacher, brooch and earrings. Made of gold and platinum, the <b>tiara</b> is 8cm (3in) tall and has the form of a tall circlet of lyres and S-scrolls linked by festoons of diamonds. It was originally set with 10 of the Cambridge emeralds, acquired by Queen Mary in 1910 and first owned by her grandmother, the Duchess of Cambridge. In 1912, the <b>tiara</b> was altered to take {{one or both of the}} Cullinan III and IV diamonds; the pear-shaped diamond was held at the top, and the cushion-shaped stone hung in the oval aperture underneath. Mary lent the <b>tiara</b> to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) for the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, and it remained with her until she died in 2002, when it passed to Queen Elizabeth II. In 2005, the Queen lent the <b>tiara</b> to her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, {{the pope}} {{would later be}} crowned by the triregnum or Triple <b>Tiara</b> at the Papal Coronation. All popes since John Paul I have refused an {{elaborate}} coronation, choosing instead to have a simpler papal inauguration ceremony.|$|E
50|$|Toddlers & <b>Tiaras</b> or Another Toddlers & <b>Tiaras</b> is an American reality {{television}} series that aired on TLC from December 12, 2008, to October 16, 2013. After a three-year hiatus due to much controversy, Another Toddlers and <b>Tiaras</b> aired the sequel on August 24, 2016. The show follows the personal lives of families of contestants {{in a child}} beauty pageant. Like many shows about children pageants, it generated controversy for dressing the children provocatively. The show led to other reality show spin-offs: Eden's World, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, and Cheer Perfection. On November 24, 2016, they decided to cancel the show after its 8th season.|$|R

5|$|The Brazil Parure {{is one of}} {{the newest}} items of {{jewellery}} in the collection. In 1953, the president and people of Brazil presented Elizabeth II with the coronation gift of a necklace and matching pendant earrings of aquamarines and diamonds. It had taken the jewellers Mappin & Webb an entire year to collect the perfectly matched stones. The necklace has nine large oblong aquamarines with an even bigger aquamarine pendant drop. The Queen had the drop set in a more decorative diamond cluster and it is now detachable. She was so delighted with the gift that in 1957 she had a <b>tiara</b> made to match the necklace. The <b>tiara</b> is surmounted by three vertically set aquamarines. Seeing that the Queen had so liked the original Coronation gift that she had a matching <b>tiara</b> made, the Government of Brazil decided to add to its gift, and in 1958 it presented Elizabeth II with a bracelet of oblong aquamarines set in a cluster of diamonds, and a square aquamarine and diamond brooch.|$|E
5|$|During the Russian Revolution in 1917, the <b>tiara</b> {{was hidden}} with other jewels somewhere in Vladimir Palace in Petrograd, and later saved from Soviet Russia by Albert Stopford, a British art dealer and secret agent.

5|$|The George VI Victorian Suite was {{originally}} a wedding present by George VI {{to his daughter}} Elizabeth in 1947. The suite consists of a long necklace of oblong sapphires and diamonds {{and a pair of}} matching square sapphire earrings also bordered with diamonds. The suite {{was originally}} made in 1850. The stones exactly matched the colour of the robes of the Order of the Garter, although this may have been a coincidence on George's part. Elizabeth had the necklace shortened by removing the biggest sapphire in 1952, and later had a new pendant made using the removed stone. In 1963, a new sapphire and diamond <b>tiara</b> and bracelet were made to match the original pieces. The <b>tiara</b> is made out of a necklace that had belonged to Princess Louise of Belgium, daughter of Leopold II. In 1969, the Queen wore the complete parure to a charity concert.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} continues, {{several of the}} vessels are {{destroyed}} by explosions.

Turlough, while attempting to escape control of the Black Guardian, ends up aboard the Buccaneer, and meets the Eternal Captain Wrack, learning she too is working for the Black Guardian. He finds equipment aboard her ship that appears to be the source of the device destroying the other ships and hears the Black Guardian's voice nearby. Later, Wrack offers the Edwardian officers a reception aboard her ship. During the reception, Turlough demonstrates the equipment to the Doctor, while Wrack gifts Tegan with a <b>tiara</b> with a red crystal. After the reception and continuation of the race, the Doctor sees the Buccaneer nearing the Edwardian ship, and determines that the red crystal is used as a focal point of the weapon, and gets rid of the <b>tiara</b> before Wrack can destroy the ship.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{chandelier}} earrings, and 60 other pieces of jewellery, Mrs Greville left the Queen Mother a set of pear-drop earrings that she had bought from Cartier in 1938. The pear-shaped drop diamonds each weigh about 20carats (4g). Diana, Princess of Wales, borrowed them in 1983 to wear on her first official visit to Australia. At a state banquet, she wore the earrings with a <b>tiara</b> from her family's own collection. The Greville Pear-drop Earrings passed to the Queen upon her mother's death in 2002.|$|E
5|$|As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses {{worn by the}} Parthian kings {{changed over}} time. The {{earliest}} Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps, known as the bashlyk (Greek: kyrbasia). This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the pointy hats depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and Persepolis. The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing the soft cap, yet coins from {{the latter part of}} his reign show {{him for the first time}} wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem. Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian <b>tiara,</b> embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Bond calls Tree to enquire further {{about the}} payment of his fee and is told {{to go to the}} <b>Tiara</b> Hotel in Las Vegas. The <b>Tiara</b> is owned by Seraffimo Spang and {{operates}} as the headquarters of the Spangled Mob. Spang also owns an old Western ghost town, named Spectreville, restored to be his own private holiday retreat. At the hotel Bond finally receives payment through a rigged blackjack game where the dealer is Tiffany. After winning the money he is owed he disobeys his orders from Tree by continuing to gamble in the casino and wins heavily. Spang suspects that Bond may be a 'plant' and has him captured and tortured at Spectreville. With Tiffany's help he escapes from Spectreville aboard a railway push-car with Seraffimo Spang in pursuit aboard an old Western train. Bond changes the points and re-routes the train onto a dead-end, and shoots Spang before the resulting crash. Assisted by Leiter, Bond and Tiffany go via California to New York, where they board the RMS Queen Elizabeth to travel to London, a relationship developing between them as they go. Wint and Kidd observe their embarkation and follow them on board. They kidnap Tiffany, planning to kill her and throw her overboard. Bond rescues her and kills both gangsters; he makes it look like a murder-suicide.|$|E
