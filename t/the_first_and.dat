40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{describing how}} brand names with English in Indonesian products are created. To {{analyze the data}} found the researchers applied English word formation in English morphology. This is a descriptive research. The data were brand names using English found in Indonesian product which were taken from three supermarkets in Solo namely Hypermart Solo Grand Mall, Hypermart Gorro Assalam, and Carefur from February up to April 2010. The research found that the brand names with English in Indonesian products can be created by applying word formation such as compounding, blending, affixation, reduplication, onomatopoeia, abbreviation, acronym and clipping. The process of compounding consists of pure compounding and modification compounding, The process of blending includes <b>the</b> <b>first</b> syllable of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> words <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> syllable of <b>the</b> second words, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> syllable of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> words <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second syllable {{from the front of}} the second words., <b>the</b> <b>first</b> words <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last syllables of the second words, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> words <b>and</b> two syllables {{from the front of the}} second words, two syllables from the front of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> words <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second words, two syllables from the front of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> words <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> syllable of <b>the</b> second words, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> words <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two last syllables from the back of the second words, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> words <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> syllables of <b>the</b> second words. The affixation process covers prefixes pro-, -bio and suffixes –y, - er, -ness, -ish, and –s.
