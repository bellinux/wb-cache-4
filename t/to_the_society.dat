5|$|A local landowner, E. D. Till, leased {{the castle}} in 1897 and {{undertook}} restoration work. Agnes Lady Fountain {{took over the}} lease {{after his death in}} 1917. She agreed to a plan to protect the castle, under which she purchased the freehold and transferred this <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in 1937; then, once the leasehold on the property had expired, the castle was passed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1948.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Society</b> was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Rubinstein {{handed over}} the {{directorship}} of the Conservatory to Zaremba. Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, {{to be replaced by}} Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>society.</b> In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, Gillespie {{and others}} founded a {{registered}} charity {{which was to}} become the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. The Society's first president was lawyer and politician Edward Theodore Salvesen, son of the Norwegian merchant Christian Salveson—a connection which would prove significant in later years. A series of lectures given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>society</b> by J. Arthur Thomson gave yet more momentum to the modern approach being spearheaded by Hagenbeck in Germany.|$|E
5|$|John Playfair {{carried out}} a second survey of Schiehallion in 1811; {{on the basis of}} a rethink of its rock strata, he {{suggested}} a density of 4,560 to , though the then elderly Hutton vigorously defended the original value in an 1821 paper <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society.</b> Playfair's calculations had raised the density closer towards its modern value, but was still too low and significantly poorer than Cavendish's computation of some years earlier.|$|E

5|$|The {{society was}} {{successful}} in raising the necessary funds by 1845.

5|$|William Watson, a {{scientist}} {{specializing in the}} study of electricity, theorized that perhaps electricity was attracted to conductors that were pointed. Watson received in 1746 from Dr. John Mitchell a lengthy Franklin letter on theories about thunderstorms and pointed conductors as related to electricity. He read part of the letter to fellow members of the Royal Society of London on November 9, 1749. A week later he finished the reading. On December 4 Watson received another similar Franklin letter dated April 29, 1749, from Collinson and read it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> on December 21, 1749. Over the next two years Collinson had transmitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> more of Franklin's letters he had received describing electrical experiments done by Franklin and his team of experimenters. Many talked about the tendency of an electrical discharge to be attracted to a pointed conductor that was grounded - the basics to his lightning rod invention to protect wooden buildings such as houses and churches.|$|E
5|$|A {{supplementary}} {{member of}} the Storting, he met in the parliament once, acting as secretary for the constitution committee.

He became a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1821, and was its secretary from 1825 to 1831. Having a profound wish to spread erudition in Norway, he used his acquaintances in England to supply the society with enlightenment books and journals.

5|$|Beyond architecture, Burges {{designed}} metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, {{furniture and}} stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, {{a series of}} lectures he gave <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. However the revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century {{has led to a}} renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} {{the founding of}} a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, at which time Colonel Lewis Morris wrote <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college. However, {{it was not until}} the founding of the College of New Jersey (the present Princeton University) across the Hudson River in New Jersey that the City of New York seriously consider founding a college. In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{was born}} on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope. The death of his mother when he {{was three years old}} seemed to have had little effect on young Edward, as he {{mentioned}} in his letters that he had no recollection of her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. Alfred, an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth.|$|E

5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>society</b> by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the room to store the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient {{and there was not}} enough room to store the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, {{the society}} {{presented}} a new code and system of bylaws {{for the government}} of the Romney Classical Institute, which reserved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>society</b> the power to appoint assistant teachers, fix the amount of salaries, and provide the conditions and manners of payment and reimbursement. Foote differed with the society over these matters, and he ultimately declined to accept the new bylaws and resigned his leadership position in October 1849; in 1850, he established a rival institution known as the Potomac Seminary. Rather than falling under the patronage of the society, Foote's new institution fell {{under the control of the}} Presbyterian church. Following Foote's departure, the society selected Professor E. J. Meany to head the Romney Classical Institute. Despite the schism, the society also provided financial support from the lottery to the Potomac Seminary.|$|E
5|$|In June 1904, Beilhart {{invited the}} public to an 'open house' where he {{attempted}} to explain the motives and beliefs of the society. Over 400 people attended the gathering.

In the end, the society's rejection of marriage {{on the grounds that it}} made a 'slave of the woman', and the misinterpretations of their views on free-love were too much for the people of Lisbon to accept. In late 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago, in the hope that their progressive ideas might be better tolerated there.|$|E
