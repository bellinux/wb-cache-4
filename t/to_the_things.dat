5|$|In word learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E

500|$|In October 1913, Innis started {{classes at}} McMaster University (then in Toronto). McMaster {{was a natural}} choice for him {{because it was a}} Baptist {{university}} and many students who attended Woodstock College went there. McMaster's liberal arts professors encouraged critical thinking and debate. Innis was especially influenced by James Ten Broeke, the university's one-man philosophy department.

500|$|Many of the {{illustrations}} that have most frequently been reproduced in other books and as decorations are the small tailpieces that Bewick had {{placed at the}} bottoms of {{the pages of the}} original. The worlds depicted are so small that a magnifying glass is necessary to examine their detail; each scene, as Adrian Searle writes, [...] "is a small and often comic revelation", each tiny image giving [...] "enormous pleasure"; Bewick [...] "was as inventive as he was observant, as funny and bleak as he was exacting and faithful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he saw around him." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1909, the Supreme Court of the United States propounded {{a test to}} {{determine}} the reasonableness of a classification, stating that the classification [...] "must always rest upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> in respect to which the classification is made". Based on this principle, the Supreme Court of India subsequently formulated a two-stage test {{to determine}} if a classification made by a law was constitutional. The relevant stages were (1) whether the classification was founded on an intelligible differentia; and (2) whether the differentia had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question.|$|E

Alasdair Stuart of Bleeding Cool commented it [...] "builds on this idea of the reflection that you know is fake but can't look away from and internalizes it". With the plot twist, Stuart said, [...] "we're shown exactly what's been a reflection of the truth all along; everything". He also affirmed it questions [...] "our own fundamental need to be the hero or heroine of our own story".|$|E

500|$|While Chaplin's comedic {{style is}} broadly defined as slapstick, it is {{considered}} restrained and intelligent, with the film historian Philip Kemp describing {{his work as a}} mix of [...] "deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags". Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters. Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology. Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] and [...] "serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action" [...] are other key aspects of his comedy, while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features.|$|E
500|$|The album {{itself was}} {{described}} as [...] "one of the hip hop albums of the century" [...] by the British newspaper The Observer and was successful on European music charts. Other reviews have been positive; Matthew Pollesel of Splendid Magazine praised the album for its lyrical content: [...] "...as Daara J show throughout Boomerang, it's possible to get the meaning of those words just by listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that surround them—the intensity of the rappers' delivery, {{the quality of the}} beats, and how well all those other factors coalesce around the words. And on that score, Daara J's message comes through loud and clear." [...] However, Katharina Lobeck of BBC Music noted that one of the tracks, the R-influenced [...] "Hip Hop Civilization" [...] is [...] "too generically soppy for even the most hardened R fans", but {{went on to say that}} the album is [...] "a successful sonic adventure which thrives on its defiance of the margins of established sales categories".|$|E

[...] They left there on April 7, 1805 and came within view of the Pacific Ocean, near Astoria, Oregon, on November 7. [...] After exploring the area, they departed eastward on March 23, 1806 and arrived in St. Louis six months to the day later. [...] Only one of the expedition members died en route, most likely of appendicitis. While they did not find the mammoths or salt mountains reputed to be in the American West, [...] "these were a small loss compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that were gained". In addition to knowledge of the territories purchased by the US, these included the establishment of relations with Native Americans and increased public interest in the West once their diaries were published. [...] Further, the exploration of the Oregon Country later aided American claims to that area. In gratitude for their service to the nation, Congress gave Lewis and Clark land grants and they were appointed to government offices in the West.|$|E

500|$|... "Boyfriend" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews. Andrew Hampp of Billboard rated it 82 out of 100, stating that Bieber sounds more adult than ever, but noted {{that most of}} his fans are still 12-year-old girls. Amy Sciaretto of Pop Crush praised the track, and said that the result of trying new music styles resulted on [...] "a more mature, more well-rounded Justin Bieber song." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV said that [...] "Boyfriend" [...] is [...] "crazy dope", and realized that the lyrics are directed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> Bieber does with his current girlfriend Selena Gomez. Becca Grim of Rolling Stone thought that the song is [...] "edgier-than-usual," [...] while Artistdirect reviewer Breña Brandano said that [...] "Boyfriend" [...] not only marks Bieber's transition to an adult, but also deemed it as a [...] "new dawn for pop." [...] Marc Hogan of magazine Spin said that Bieber [...] "wants to sex you up" [...] with the track, but thought that [...] "Bieber might be a wealthy suitor, but he's not grown up just yet." [...] A Rap-Up reviewer complimented [...] "Boyfriend" [...] for showcasing a mature Bieber and urban sound on it. The A.V. Club editors Steven Hyden and Genevieve Koski rated the song an A-, complimenting its production and vocals and considering it [...] "irresistible, and when Bieber launches into that Timberlakian falsetto, it all feels pretty perfect." [...] They also ranked it among his best singles, although they criticized its lyrical content.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{awarded the}} album a [...] "B-" [...] grade, opining that, [...] "the peaks on Neighborhoods — their first disc {{in eight years}} — {{do little more than}} recall past triumphs. Outside of some latent goth leanings ('This Is Home') and a gauzy detour ('Ghost on the Dance Floor'), it's mostly twitch-crunch-whine-repeat." [...] Michael Brown of Drowned in Sound gave a mixed review, {{awarding}} the album a lukewarm five out of ten. He critiqued that, [...] "Blink have the potential for much more than their past reputation may convey, but Neighborhoods is reminiscent of that first awkward conversation after a heated argument, as no-one's quite sure where to go next." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave the album three stars out of five, noting elements of sophistication, introspection, and darkness in the music and lyrics and commenting that [...] "Some Clinton-era pants-dropping might've been a fun nostalgia move. But those days are gone; it's their early-2010s nightmare as much as anyone else's." [...] Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club was critical of DeLonge's vocals, saying that he [...] "sounds flat as ever, and has a fondness for clunky lyrics", concluding that [...] "Although Blink-182 has long since left its past as a bare-bones punk band behind, overwrought rock isn't its forte, either. Neighborhoods finds a nice balance between the two, but it could still use a little less fussiness." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine considered it uninspired: [...] "When they try to add relatively ambitious elements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> they actually do well, Blink-182 is more successful. [...] It's admirable that Blink-182 tries to challenge themselves over the course of Neighborhoods, but their growing pains don't make for a particularly good album or a welcome comeback." [...] Scott McLennan of The Boston Globe considered the album a step forward, summarizing, [...] "Blink-182 again delivers a record with nothing outright awful and enough dynamite songs to pack a punch at future tours." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin called the album [...] "surprisingly and refreshingly low-key," [...] but its self-examination [...] "comparatively adrift" [...] with the sound of their past.|$|E

500|$|The European {{sovereign}} debt crisis was another important {{issue in the}} election, even more so after Portugal applied for an EU bailout on 6 April, {{the first day of}} advance voting. According to an opinion poll nearly 60% of Finns were against Finland's participation in bailing out the crisis-ridden countries. All four parties of the governing coalition (Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Green League and the Swedish People's Party) support Finland's participation in the bailout and all four opposition parties (Social Democrats, Left Alliance, Christian Democrats and the True Finns) oppose such measures. The issue helped Soini become the most visible opposition leader. Soini then also stated that his party would not join in any coalition that supports guarantees to the crisis-ridden EU countries. He said that their crises are a consequence of the EU's failure. Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen had commented that a bailout for Portugal should only happen if the Portuguese parliament passed even tougher austerity measures than the failed programme that led to an early Portuguese election: [...] "The package must be really strict because otherwise it doesn't make any sense. The package must be harder and more comprehensive than the one the parliament voted against." [...] Despite his comments, the National Coalition Party believed the bailout to be in Finland's interests. It, along with the Centre Party, supported the bailout under the EU's auspices, while the True Finns and the Social Democrats were opposed to it. The True Finns said that Finnish taxpayers were being unjustly burdened by [...] "squanderers" [...] within the eurozone and pointed out that no one aided Finland during its own financial crisis in the 1990s. Helsingin Sanomat read the affair as having added [...] "confusion" [...] and complexity to the electoral race. The effect of the Finnish election on a possible EU bailout caused concern amongst to international investors as [...] "it is a very distinct possibility that the next government and parliament of Finland will not want to agree <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that the current government has signed up for, namely supporting Portugal and agreeing to the permanent and temporary crisis mechanisms," [...] as there was said to be an [...] "even chance" [...] of Finland blocking a bailout for Portugal as its support was crucial because it would need the unanimous support of all national governments to pass. Finland's participation was further thrown in doubt as it was the only eurozone country to require parliamentary approval of any such measure. Should a new Finnish administration opt out of the bailout, this could throw into doubt the eurozone's capacity to maintain financial stability.|$|E
