Despite strengthening river currents and continued VRS artillery fire, small reconnaissance elements managed <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the river, only to be forced back an hour later.|$|E

5|$|The Hurdt-Amangkurat army {{arrived at}} Singkal, {{on the west}} bank of the Brantas River north of Kediri, on 13 October.

5|$|After the Warrior left, Black Hawk {{decided to}} seek {{refuge in the}} north with the Ojibwes. Only about 50 people, {{including}} Wabokieshiek, agreed to go with him; the others remained, determined <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the Mississippi and return to Sauk territory. The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north {{when he learned that}} the American army had closed in on the members of the British Band who were trying <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the Mississippi.

5|$|As CTroop {{reached the}} forming up {{point for the}} assault it met heavy machine gun fire from the gun battery. ATroop {{bypassed}} them to occupy houses to cover the assault. The next to arrive was DTroop, which had a special ladder <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the anti-tank ditch around the battery. Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind, they looked for another way <b>to</b> <b>cross.</b> They discovered wooden planks bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town. DTroop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the battery. With the machine guns taken, EandFTroops began their assault. The attack was successful but they discovered the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles. The real guns had been removed three days previously and positioned further inland.|$|E
