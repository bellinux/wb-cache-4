This is in contrast to any other Hindu temple in Sri Lanka or India. Almost all shrines are built of stone except that one dedicated to Valli which shows <b>timber</b> <b>construction.</b> They have been left as originally constructed and there are not any plans to improve upon them, because people are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the common}} {{period in which}} castles rose to {{prominence}} in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11thcentury, the motte and keep– an artificial mound surmounted by a palisade and tower– {{was the most common}} form of castle in Europe, everywhere except Scandinavia. While Britain, France, and Italy shared a tradition of <b>timber</b> <b>construction</b> that was continued in castle architecture, Spain more commonly used stone or mud-brick as the main building material.|$|E

30|$|The {{transitional}} dynamic {{behavior of}} nailed timber joints {{depends upon the}} composition of the frequency components of input waves, which may be an essential key to understand the actual responsive behavior of <b>timber</b> <b>constructions</b> under earthquakes of various wave characteristics. <b>Timber</b> <b>constructions</b> are composite structural systems composed of multi-members and multi-joints, therefore, the dynamic responsive characteristics of them, which are related to the lateral load-deformation characteristics or the restoring force characteristics of them, are the integrated results of all members and joints. The element dynamic tests of mechanical timber joints, however, are very important because nonlinearity, cyclic degradation and hysteretic damping of <b>timber</b> <b>constructions</b> are generally determined by them.|$|R
30|$|Nailed joints {{are widely}} used as a {{principal}} choice for structural joints in <b>timber</b> <b>constructions.</b> The static lateral resistance of nailed joints of various kinds, therefore, has been investigated from both the academic and the practical viewpoints [1 – 6].

5|$|English castles, {{including}} Kenilworth, did {{not play}} a decisive role during the Wars of the Roses (1455–85), which were fought primarily {{in the form of}} pitched battles between the rival factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists. With the mental collapse of King Henry VI, Queen Margaret used the Duchy of Lancaster lands in the Midlands, including Kenilworth, as one of her key bases of military support. Margaret removed Henry from London in 1456 for his own safety and until 1461, Henry's court divided almost all its time among Kenilworth, Leicester and Tutbury Castle for the purposes of protection. Kenilworth remained an important Lancastrian stronghold {{for the rest of the}} war, often acting as a military balance to the nearby castle of Warwick. With the victory of Henry VII at Bosworth, Kenilworth again received royal attention; Henry visited frequently and had a tennis court constructed at the castle for his use. His son, Henry VIII, decided that Kenilworth should be maintained as a royal castle. He abandoned the Pleasance and had part of the <b>timber</b> <b>construction</b> moved into the base court of the castle.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages cruck <b>timber</b> <b>construction</b> {{was used}} in cottages, but the most common {{building}} material was stone. From the twelfth century, burghs contained the houses of significant inhabitants, but little has survived of the urban housing of the poor. In the early modern era most {{of the population was}} housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. Most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets, with temporary sheilings becoming permanent settlements. The standard layout of a house was a byre-dwelling or long house, with humans and livestock sharing a common roof. Cottages in the Highlands tended to be cruder while those from the Lowlands had distinct rooms and were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. In towns, traditional thatched half-timbered houses occurred beside the larger, stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. In the eighteenth century new farm buildings replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. The Industrial Revolution transformed the scale of Scottish towns. Gridiron plans were used to lay out new towns in Edinburgh, Glasgow and smaller burghs. In Glasgow the growing workforce was lived in squalid sub-urban tenements like those of the Gorbals. New towns aimed at improving society through the foundation of architecturally designed communities, were an important part of Scottish thinking from the mid-eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy <b>timber</b> <b>construction</b> of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E

25|$|The defence {{installations}} at False Cape were concrete structures, comprising two gun emplacements, {{a battery}} observation post, and a main magazine which stored 400 rounds of 155mm ammunition {{for the two}} guns. Ready ammunition was housed in smaller shell and cartridge magazines constructed as part of each gun emplacement. Duty personnel quarters, probably of <b>timber</b> <b>construction,</b> were erected adjacent to the battery observation post. An anti-aircraft gun was mounted above the main magazine and No.2 gun emplacement. All of these installations were camouflaged with netting.|$|E

25|$|In 1864 this {{pavilion}} {{was erected}} {{on the first}} Canterbury Cricket Club's grounds, called Dilloway's, {{in order to be}} ready in time for the visit of an English eleven, captained by George Parr. In the match against Canterbury the English team won convincingly but were impressed by the facilities provided at the grounds at the north-western corner of South Hagley Park (by the junction of Deans and Riccarton Avenues). The well prepared field was neatly fenced and the handsome pavilion, the envy of other local clubs still using tents on match days, provided fine accommodation. Of <b>timber</b> <b>construction</b> the pavilion was built to a traditional English design and provided changing facilities, a communal area for meetings and teas, an open verandah and a viewing balcony.|$|E
25|$|Dzongs {{comprise}} heavy masonry {{curtain walls}} surrounding {{one or more}} courtyards. The main functional spaces are usually arranged in two separate areas: the administrative offices; and the religious functions - including temples and monks' accommodation. This accommodation is arranged along {{the inside of the}} outer walls and often as a separate stone tower located centrally within the courtyard, housing the main temple, that can be used as an inner defensible citadel. The main internal structures are again built with stone (or as in domestic architecture by rammed clay blocks), and whitewashed inside and out, with a broad red ochre band at the top on the outside. The larger spaces such as the temple have massive internal timber columns and beams to create galleries around an open central full height area. Smaller structures are of elaborately carved and painted <b>timber</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E

500|$|Many {{countries}} had both timber and stone castles, however Denmark had few quarries, {{and as a}} result, most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick. Brick-built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone-built counterparts. Brick castles are less common in England than stone or earth and timber constructions, and often it was chosen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was fashionable, encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries. For example, when Tattershall Castle was built between 1430 and 1450, {{there was plenty of}} stone available nearby, but the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick. About 700,000bricks were used to build the castle, which has been described as [...] "the finest piece of medieval brick-work in England". Most Spanish castles were built from stone, whereas castles in Eastern Europe were usually of <b>timber</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{second phase}} was {{built around the}} year 160. Although it was again of turf and <b>timber</b> <b>construction,</b> it was larger than the {{previous}} fort, measuring [...] to accommodate extra granaries (horrea). Around 200, the gatehouses of the fort were rebuilt in stone and the walls surrounding the fort were given a stone facing.

The vicus may have been abandoned by the mid-3rd century; this is supported by the excavated remains of some buildings that were demolished and the materials robbed for use elsewhere. Evidence from coins indicates that although the civilian settlement associated with the fort had declined by the mid-3rd century, a small garrison may have remained at Mamucium into the late 3rd century and early 4th century.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{its border}} with Wales, Cheshire played an {{important}} role in defending England against the Welsh. Many castles were built along the border, and 8 of the 20 castles in Cheshire are within [...] of the Welsh border. Castles along the border were constructed when the Norman invasion of Wales was slowed by Welsh opposition; when conquest was swift, there was less need for fortifications. Compared to north Wales, relatively few castles are found in Cheshire since many, such as Holt Castle, were built on the western side of the River Dee. Most of these castles were motte-and-baileys and were originally of turf and <b>timber</b> <b>construction,</b> although they were sometimes later replaced by stone structures if a long-term castle was needed. Away from the borders, baronial castles were built in Cheshire and were a status symbol. The castles in Cheshire were built over a period of several centuries, with the earliest in 1070 and the latest in the 15th century. Most, 12 out of 20, were built between 1070 and the end of the 12th century. Of the three castles in Cheshire known to have been built after the 13th century, they are either tower houses or fortified manor houses; this type of structure was more important as a feudal residence than a military structure and reflects the national trend of castles after the 13th century being used as a symbol of authority rather than primarily military.|$|E
