40|$|Literature on {{transportation}} planning and modeling {{is replete with}} the concept of a travel time budget. According to this concept, average daily travel times tend to be relatively constant. However, evidence from the 1983 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey and the 2001 National Household Travel Survey suggest that the average daily travel time has increased by 1. 9 minutes per year. Understanding travel <b>time</b> <b>expenditures</b> is important for forecasting travel demand, especially future vehicle miles of travel. Historically, travel demand models considered vehicle availability and income as limiting factors for travel, but going forward time may be the constraint. As individuals spend more time devoted to travel, less time will be available for other activities. Therefore, future travel demand is dependent on people 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to spend time traveling. Growth of travel demand has been per capita based not just population based. This has been enabled by several cultural trends, including fewer children to care for; specialization of activities; multitasking during travel, for example, cell phone use can add value to travel time; seeking socialization away from home; and increases in real income enabling more activity participation. This study will report the increase in average daily travel <b>time</b> <b>expenditures</b> and analyze the increase by various demographic segments of the population. Travel <b>time</b> <b>expenditures</b> are also related to activity participation, the characteristics of the area, and many other interrelated factors at the person level. Aggregate values will be used to investigate the general relationships between daily travel <b>time</b> <b>expenditures</b> and socio-demographic characteristics. Careful consideration of the implications of the increase in travel time, as well as the changes in society that have contributed to these changes will be explored. The increase in travel <b>time</b> <b>expenditures</b> is likely to {{play a significant role in}} future travel demand growth in the United States and will impact the performance of the transportation system going forward. If travel <b>time</b> <b>expenditures</b> continue to grow, the hope for slowing VMT growth may not materialize.

40|$|Travel {{behavior}} {{researchers have}} been intrigued {{by the amount of}} time that people allocate to travel in a day, i. e., the daily travel <b>time</b> <b>expenditure,</b> commonly referred to as a “travel time budget”. Explorations into the notion of a travel time budget have once again resurfaced in the context of activity-based and time use research in travel behavior modeling. This paper revisits the issue by developing the notion of a travel time frontier (TTF) that is distinct from the actual travel <b>time</b> <b>expenditure</b> or budget of an individual. The TTF is defined in this paper as an intrinsic maximum amount of time that people are willing to allocate for travel. It is treated as an unobserved frontier that influences the actual travel <b>time</b> <b>expenditure</b> measured in travel surveys. Using travel survey datasets from around the world (i. e., US, Switzerland and India), this paper sheds new light on daily travel time expenditures by modeling the unobserved TTF and comparing these frontiers across international contexts. The stochastic frontier modeling methodology is employed to model the unobserved TTF as a production frontier. Separate models are estimated for commuter and non-commuter samples to recognize the differing constraints between these market segments. Comparisons across the international contexts show considerable differences in average unobserved TTF values. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B.

The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to compare three different software packages for semi-automatic brain tumor segmentation of glioblastoma; namely BrainVoyagerTM QX, ITK-Snap and 3 D Slicer, and to make data available for future reference. Pre-operative, contrast enhanced T 1 -weighted 1. 5 or 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in 20 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for glioblastoma. MRI scans were segmented twice in each software package by two investigators. Intra-rater, inter-rater and between-software agreement was compared by using differences of means with 95 % limits of agreement (LoA), Dice’s similarity coefficients (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD). <b>Time</b> <b>expenditure</b> of segmentations was measured using a stopwatch. Eighteen tumors were included in the analyses. Inter-rater agreement was highest for BrainVoyager with difference of means of 0. 19 mL and 95 % LoA from - 2. 42 mL to 2. 81 mL. Between-software agreement and 95 % LoA were very similar for the different software packages.
