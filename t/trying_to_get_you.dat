500|$|...The Take Over, the Breaks Over"" [...] was {{released}} in August 2007 in the US as the third single and failed to chart on the Hot 100, although it did reach number 48 on the UK Singles Chart, with its highest position at number seventeen in Australia, becoming the third consecutive top twenty hit from Infinity on High in that region. The fourth and last single, [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> Off (Me & You)" [...] managed to reach number 68 in the US and made the top 30 in Australia. [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] was not an official single but it {{was released}} online by the band before Infinitys release and was later given as an exclusive download to iTunes; it managed to reach number eighty-one on the Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Fall Out Boy began searching for {{potential}} producers. The band sought out R singer/producer Babyface, as they admired {{his work on}} the soundtrack to the 2001 film version of Josie and the Pussycats. Babyface saw one of the interviews in which the band discussed its desire to work with him and contacted the group. Babyface produced two of the songs, [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> Off (Me & You)" [...] and [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs". Neal Avron, who also produced the band's previous album, handled production for eleven of Infinity on Highs fourteen tracks. Before recording, the band began with six weeks of pre-production, which was encouraged by Avron. This period included both rehearsals and writing, as well as working out all the sounds and arrangements. It began in Chicago before the group relocated to the Swing House studios in Los Angeles. Additionally, some rough recordings of songs were created {{to be used in the}} studio as a future reference.|$|E

500|$|Stump called [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] the [...] "funkiest thing we’ve ever done", and {{attributes}} {{the change in}} musical style to his love of soul music, which he acquired by listening to oldies stations as a child. Wentz describes the song [...] "a bit of '70s funk mixed with [...] Take This to Your Grave with tight verses and big, fat choruses". The song closing sing-along was influenced by Justin Timberlake's [...] "Señorita". Cory Apar of Allmusic compared the Babyface-produced track [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> Off (Me & You)" [...] to Maroon 5. Wentz characterized Stump’s vocal performance on the song as [...] "straight-up Motown", continuing to say [...] "If there wasn't a rock band playing, it'd be straight R, and he'd go on tour with just an upright bass and a drum and open up for R. Kelly." [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] {{has been referred to}} as [...] "a prime slab of what the boys have become famous for: highly caffeinated pop-punk mixed with a little white-boy soul and some hard-core yelping." [...] The song features Stump singing in a falsetto in the chorus over Trohman’s [...] "crunchy" [...] guitars, as well as a breakdown in which Wentz employs death growl-style vocals.|$|E
2500|$|Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club {{argued that}} {{through the use of}} a spoken {{introduction}} and other exposition-filled dialogue, the film fails by [...] "baldly revealing up front everything that the novel is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> to wonder about and to explore slowly". Youyoung Lee wrote in a December 2007 Entertainment Weekly that the film [...] "leaves out the gore", such as the book's ritualistic heart-eating that concludes the bear fight, [...] "to create family-friendlier fare". Lee also said that the film [...] "downplays the Magisterium's religious nature", but Robinson argued that the depiction of the Church in the film is as [...] "a hierarchical organization of formally robed, iconography-heavy priests who dictate and define morality for their followers, are based out of cathedrals, and decry teachings counter to theirs as 'heresy.'...doing ugly things to children under cover of secrecy". Robinson then asks, [...] "Who are most people going to think of besides the Catholic Church?" [...] The film gives more prominence to scenes showing the Magisterium officials' perspective than the novel. The novel rarely mentions explicitly the Magisterium's intentions, relying on the gossip of others, and the comments of Mrs. Coulter.|$|E

40|$|We asked 771 {{children}} in grades 5 - 8 about the dares or challenges {{they received from}} other children.

Peer pressure was reported most frequently by 8 th grade students. About 50 per cent of the dares encouraged problem behaviors that placed the children (or others) at risk for personal injury, or the potential development of habits hazardous to their health. With increasing age, more occurred in the school environment and fewer involved risk of personal injury. Among 7 th and 8 th graders, more boys were dared to perform acts of violence, and more girls were challenged to be sexually active...|$|R
