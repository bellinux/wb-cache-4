50|$|The first TCMC {{section was}} built in a double track configuration. However, {{the absence of any}} balloon loop at the {{provisional}} terminus at Avanchet, or at the permanent termini at Meyrin-Gravière and CERN, as well as the inclusion on this section of several stations with island platforms, made necessary the exclusive use of bidirectional vehicles to run services on the section. As the numbers of the Flexity Outlook trams in the fleet were then rather limited, the TPG exercised its existing option for 17 more vehicles, while in the meantime the previous <b>through-connection</b> of line 12 with line 16 at the Moillesulaz terminus had to be suspended. According to various sources, the opening of the second stage of the TCMC (Avanchet-Meyrin) took place on 12 December 2009, with the entry into service of the section to Meyrin (Gravière). On 30 April 2011, operations commenced on the section to CERN.|$|E

The first and second doping types are partially arranged {{adjacent to each other}} for forming a pn-junction. The contact structures are arranged at a metallization side of the semiconductor substrate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The solar cell comprises a semiconductor substrate (1) having a front side and a rear side, first (3 a) and second metallic contact structures, and first and second electroconductive connection structures, where the semiconductor substrate has a first doped region of a first doping type and a second doped region of a second doping type that is opposite to the first doping type. The first and second doping types are partially arranged adjacent to each other for forming a pn-junction. The contact structures are arranged at a metallization side of the semiconductor substrate and the metallization side is the front- and rear side of the solar cell. The first and second contact structures are electroconductively connected with the first and second doped regions respectively. The electroconductive connection structures are arranged at the metallization side of the solar cell. The contact structures are partially covered by an electrically non-conducting insulating layer, which is partially covered by the connection structures. The first and second connection structures are electroconductively connected with the first and second contact structures respectively. The insulating layer and the first and second connection structures are integral component of the solar cell, and exceed in their dimensions parallel to the metallization side not over the dimensions of the solar cell. The contact structures are completely covered with the insulating layer up to hole-like recesses and the connection structures directly adjoin to the assigned contact structures in the hole-like recesses for forming an electrically conducting connection. The connection structures have a cross-sectional surfaces counter-rotatingly increasing and decreasing parallel to the metallization side, so that the cross-sectional surface of the first connection structure outcoming from the first edge region of the solar cell linearly decreases to a second edge region of the solar cell that is opposite to the first edge region and the cross-sectional surface of the second connection structure outcoming from the first edge region linearly increases to the second edge region. The first edge region and the second edge region are formed for bringing a cell binder. One of the contact structures has a solder pad and is covered with the insulating layer such that the insulating layer has a recess {{in the area of the}} solder pad, so that the assigned connection structure directly adjoins to the solder pad to form the electrically conducting connection. The solar cell corresponds to a metal wrap through-solar cell in the basic construction of the structure. The substrate has a through-plating (7), which electroconductively connects the metallization side with the opposing side of the solar cell using a metallic <b>through-connection.</b> The first contact structure on the metallization side adjoins to the metallic <b>through-connection</b> for forming the electrically conducting connection. The first contact structure is covered with the insulating layer, so that the insulating layer has a recess in the area, at which the <b>through-connection</b> adjoins to the contact structure. The first contact structure and the <b>through-connection</b> are produced in a process step. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for manufacturing a solar cell. USE - Solar cell useful in a solar cell module (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The solar cell can be economically, optimally and simply manufactured and interconnected with high efficiency and improved light-coupling properties, and enables an optimal collection of charge carriers from the semiconductor substrate...|$|E
40|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} plays {{a dominant}} {{role in the}} passivation of crystalline silicon surfaces by layers of amorphous silicon. In order to research into this role, this thesis presents the method of hydrogen effusion from thin amorphous films of silicon (a-Si:H) and silicon oxide (a-SiOx:H). The oxygen concentration of the sub-stoichiometric a-SiOx:H films ranges up to 10 at. -%. The effusion experiment yields information about the content and thermal stability of hydrogen and about the microstructure of the films. A mathematical description of the diffusion process of atomic hydrogen yields an analytical expression of the effusion rate depending on the linearly increasing temperature in the experiment. Fitting of the calculated effusion rates to measured effusion spectra yields the diffusion coefficient of atomic hydrogen in a-SiOx:H. With increasing oxygen concentration, the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in the a-SiOx:H films decreases. This is attributed to an increasing Si-H bond energy due to back bonded oxygen, resulting in a higher stability of hydrogen in the films. This result is confirmed by an increasing thermal stability of the p-type c-Si passivation with a-SiOx:H of increasing oxygen concentrations up to 5 at. -%. The passivation reaches very low recombination velocities of below 10 cm/s at the interface. However, for higher oxygen concentrations up to 10 at. -%, the passivation quality decreases significantly. Here, infrared spectroscopy of Si-H vibrational modes and hydrogen effusion show an increase of hydrogen-rich interconnected voids in the films. This microstructure results in a high amount of molecular hydrogen (H 2) in the layers, which is not suitable for the saturation of c-Si interface defects. Annealing of the films at temperatures around 400 °C leads to a release of H 2 from the voids, {{as a result of}} which Si-Si bonds in the material reconstruct. Subsequently, hydrogen migration in the films is dominated by the diffusion of atomic hydrogen being suitable for the saturation of interface defects. This shows in a distinct increase of the passivation quality of annealed films. The heterostructure back contact for solar cells on p-type c-Si consists of an undoped, full area passivation film, followed by a boron doped p-type contact layer. If highly doped, this layer generates a back surface field effect which decreases the recombination by reflecting minority charge carriers from the defect rich interface. An undoped passivation layer of a-Si:H improves the passivation by saturating interface defects. Effusion measurements on stacks of undoped and doped layers show an increase of the hydrogen diffusion in the undoped layer due to the presence of the doped layer. The doped layer shifts the Fermi level of the undoped layer towards the valence band edge. This shift increases the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen due to an effective reduction of the Si-H bond energy. As a consequence, the presence of the doped contact layer increases the mobility of atomic hydrogen in the passivation layer, with atomic hydrogen being necessary for the passivation of interface defects. The thickness of the passivation layer critically affects both the passivation and the electrical conductance of the back contact. Whereas the passivation quality steadily improves with increasing thickness, the conductance drops when exceeding a critical thickness in a range of 4 nm to 8 nm. Temperature dependent measurements yield a thermal activation of the conductance with an activation energy of approximately 0. 5 eV, which is attributed to the valence band offset between a-Si:H and c-Si. This high barrier requires a tunneling process for majority charge carriers and explains the abrupt decrease of conductance with increasing passivation layer thickness. Passivation layers of a-SiOx:H form a blocking junction on p-type c-Si, which is explained by an oxygen induced n-type conduction of a-SiOx:H. Therefore, full area contacts require local <b>through-connections</b> of the a-SiOx:H layers. However, these films offer themselves as passivating interlayers at the solar cell front side between p-type base and n-type emitter. Symmetrical test structures on p-type c-Si allow for studying two-stage emitter structures consisting of undoped and phosphorous doped a-SiOx:H layers. Low and thermally stable emitter saturation current densities result, allowing for high open circuit voltages of above 700 mV in solar cells. However, the efficiency of solar cells with these emitter structures is limited by a high contact resistance between n-type a-SiOx:H and ZnO:Al at the front side as well as a non-optimized back contact...|$|R
