When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|E

Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released <b>the</b> <b>brace</b> holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E

Bengaluru played the next game against I-League debutant Aizawl F.C.. Curtis Osano's header from Keegan Pereira's free-kick in 27th minute was enough for Bengaluru to secure three points. In the first home game of the season, Bengaluru played Shillong Lajong. C.K. Vineeth registered the fastest goal of the season (38 seconds) for Bengaluru. Bengaluru doubled the lead when Kim Song-Yong scored his first goal for the team in 35th minute. Kim scored <b>the</b> <b>brace</b> in the 60th minute and Bengaluru {{reached the top of}} the table with the 3–0 and the third consecutive win. In the next away game against Mumbai F.C., Bengaluru quickly conceded the lead as Arata Izumi and Son Min-chol scored a goal each within 11 minutes. In spite of fair possession and counter-attack, Bengaluru couldn't convert their chances and faced the first loss of the season. The loss also ended Bengaluru FC's unbeaten streak of 16 games in the league dating back to previous season's game against Sporting Clube de Goa on 28 February 2015. In the month's last game, Bengaluru FC faced East Bengal and registered their first every away victory against the Kolkata side with a solitary goal by the captain Sunil Chhetri in the 60th minute and finished the month at the top of the table.|$|E

At the 35th International Gun Dog League trials held at Douglas Castle in August 1935, she was awarded a diploma in the Champion Stakes for Pointers and Setters. The following month, Nagle took the silver perpetual challenge trophy in the Open Stake of the field trials of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society at Newlyn, near Newquay, competing with her Irish Setter Sulhamstead Baffle D'Or. At the Kennel Club field trials for pointers and setters in April 1936, she entered Sulhamstead Bluff D'Or into the All-Aged Stake and was awarded the Penheale Challenge Cup by Captain N. R. Colville for the [...] "best constitutioned dog or bitch, displaying the greatest game-finding ability".

2500|$|Since {{scoliosis}} {{was discovered}} by Hippocrates, physicians and orthopedic surgeons have sought {{to find a cure}} for the condition. In the mid-twentieth century, modern medicine and treatment made it possible to decrease the progression of scoliosis within patients and alleviate the pain they experienced. This {{was the result of the}} progression of scoliosis screenings and treatment. New ways were developed to treat scoliosis because the condition was increasingly understood among medical professionals and orthopedic surgeons. These treatments such as bracing and rod insertion into the spine were made possible at the turn of the twentieth century. During this time, many schools subjected their students to physical examinations and posture tests. It was believed that students suffered from negative effects such as poor posture due to hunching over desks for hours in the classroom. Although these screenings were not intended to detect spinal curvature, physicians diagnosed many students with scoliosis. Scoliosis was considered a disease-based condition during the mid-twentieth century caused by tuberculosis or poliomyelitis. These diseases responsible for causing spinal deformities were successfully managed throughout the 1960s due to the distribution of vaccines and antibiotics. Despite the successful management of diseases causing spinal deformity, many patients suffered from scoliosis with no known cause. The unknown cause was eventually determined to be idiopathic scoliosis. Alfred Shands Jr., an orthopedic surgeon, discovered that two percent of patients had non-disease related scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis, also known as the [...] "cancer of orthopedic surgery", was determined to be dangerous because there was no current treatment. The condition needed to be detected in patients promptly so treatment could be developed in time to halt its progression. As a result, schools made it mandatory for students to have screenings for scoliosis. Early on, set symptoms could be recognized among the students being tested from ages five to eighteen, but subsequent studies never confirmed them for this age-range. To begin the screenings, children would have their shoulder height, leg length and spinal curvature measurements taken while partially clothed. This was followed with the forward-bend test and bodily comparisons to wall charts that were printed reproductions of the ideal human posture. Unfortunately, these screenings were not always accurate and many students were misdiagnosed because poor posture could often be mistaken for scoliosis. One of the first treatments designed was the Milwaukee brace, a rigid contraption of metal rods attached to a plastic or leather girdle, designed to straighten the spine. As a result of the constant pressure <b>the</b> <b>brace</b> inflicted on a patients' spine, it was particularly painful and inconvenient to wear due to physical limits it imposed. Wearing <b>the</b> <b>brace</b> was known to cause jaw pain, skin irritation, muscle pain and low self-esteem among patients. The 'Harrington rod' technique was the second major treatment for scoliosis to emerge and became the first significant surgical procedure to manipulate spinal positioning. This treatment was initially developed to treat paralytic scoliosis that resulted from the polio epidemic of the 1950s. The Milwaukee brace was the only nonoperative and noninvasive alternative to surgery at the time to provide postoperative correction to polio patients. A curve exceeding sixty degrees required the Harrington rod technique, otherwise the Milwaukee brace was recommended. However, Canadian physician, Elizabeth Wyne, observed that fifty percent of patients wearing the Milwaukee brace still required surgery later in life. Surgery may straighten the spine however it does not necessarily eradicate a patient of all the pain they suffer from due to scoliosis. Individuals who undergo surgery are left with scars and often have a lack of feeling in their backs to the invasive nature of this treatment. Despite the advancements of scoliosis treatments, yet to be determined is a cure that is reliable, risk-free and that results in few or no consequences for patients.|$|E
