Ir tokiu būdu, remiantis Lietuvos Respublikos įstatymais valstybė bylose dėl neteisėto disponavimo akcizais apmokestinamomis prekėmis negautų pajamų pavidalu prisiteisia nusikaltimo pagrindu kilusios žalos kuri yra lygi nesumokėto akcizo mokesčio dydžiui, atlyginimą. Toks reguliavimas sukelia tam tikrą problematiką, kadangi kyla klausimas ar gali iš neteisėtos (nusikalstamos) veikos kilti pareiga apskaičiuoti ir mokėti mokesčius ir ar toks mokesčio numatymas neprieštarauja bendriesiems protingumo, sąžiningumo ir teisingumo principams bei draudimui versti asmenis duoti parodymus prieš save? Atsižvelgiant į tai, baigiamajame darbe keliama hipotezė, kad civilinio ieškinio dėl nesumokėto akcizo mokesčio nagrinėjimas ir priteisimas baudžiamosiose bylose dėl neteisėto disponavimo akcizais apmokestinamomis prekėmis prieštarauja baudžiamosios teisės principams. Siekiant patvirtinti hipotezę šio baigiamojo darbo struktūrа išdėstytа atitinkаmai išsikeltam tyrimo tikslui bei uždаviniams ir susideda iš keturių dalių. Pirmoje darbo dalyje trumpai pateikiama akcizo mokesčio samprata bei vieta mokesčių teisės sistemoje ir remiantis akcizo mokesčio objektu bei prievolės mokėti akcizą atsiradimo momentu yra apibrėžiamas akcizo mokestis. Antroje dalyje aptariami bendri civilinio ieškinio baudžiamojoje byloje klausimai bei konkrečiai nagrinėjamos teismų praktikos bylos dėl neteisėto disponavimo akcizais. Šioje dalyje nustatomas žalos atsiradimo valstybei pagrindas bei rūšis, t. y., kad žala valstybei kyla neteisėtos veikos pagrindu ir turi būti atlyginama priteisiant valstybei akcizo mokesčio dydžio sumą kaip negautas pajamas. Trečioje šio darbo dalyje vertinama ar akcizo mokesčio priteisimas už neteisėtą veiką neprieštarauja bendriesiems teisingumo, protingumo ir sąžiningumo principams. Atlikus teismų praktikos analizę nustatoma, jog žalos atlyginimas negautų pajamų pavidalu priteisiant akcizo mokesčio dydžio sumą prieštaravo teisingumo, sąžiningumo ir protingumo principams tuo atveju, kai prekės buvo neteisėtai importuojamos ir konfiskuojamos ar sunaikinamos, tačiau toks reglamentavimas buvo pakeistas, bet akcizo mokesčio priteisimas už neteisėtai pagamintas ir konfiskuotas ar sunaikintas prekes iki šiol prieštarauja minėtiems principams. Be to šioje dalyje buvo nustatyta, kad situacijos, kai vienose baudžiamosiose bylose civilinis ieškinys dėl neteisėto disponavimo akcizais apmokestinamomis prekėmis pareiškiamas, o kitose baudžiamosiose bylose dėl to paties dalyko – nepareiškiamas, vertintinos kaip prieštaraujančios sąžiningumo principui. Paskutinėje šio darbo dalyje siekiama nustatyti ar įpareigojimas mokėti akcizo mokestį neteisėtos veikos pagrindu neprieštarauja parodymų davimo prieš save principui ir yra nustatoma, jog prieštaravimo nėra. Baigiamojo darbo pabaigoje yra pateikiamos išvados bei rekomendacijos ir nurodoma, kad darbe iškelta hipotezė, jog civilinio ieškinio dėl nesumokėto akcizo mokesčio nagrinėjimas ir priteisimas baudžiamosiose bylose dėl neteisėto disponavimo akcizais apmokestinamomis prekėmis prieštarauja baudžiamosios teisės principams iš dalies pasitvirtino.  Without paying {{excise tax}} is {{the damage done}} by the state, so the state (to {{represent}} the relevant authorities) to gain access to a civil action in a criminal case. And so, in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Lithuania, the State in cases of illegal disposal of excise goods adjudge compensation of damages which is equal to the amount of the unpaid excise tax. This poses certain problems, since the question of whether to illegal (criminal) offense be obliged to calculate and pay taxes, and whether such a tax anticipation in compliance with the general reasonableness, fairness and justice and the principles of the prohibition to force persons to give evidence against himself? Taking into account, the general target of this Thesis is to determine whether a civil claim for unpaid excise tax examination and award in criminal cases of illegal possession of excise goods contrary to the principles of criminal law by analyzing the doctrine of the doctrine of Lithuanian and foreign case law and science of law. The hypothesis of this Thesis is that a civil claim for unpaid excise tax examination and award of criminal cases of illegal possession of excise goods contrary to the principles of criminal law. This Thesis consists of four parts. On the first part are briefly presented excise tax concept and place of tax system {{on the basis of the}} excise tax on the object and the obligation to pay excise duty on the occurrence of the time, indicating that the excise tax is a European Union-wide harmonized indirect tax levied on ethyl alcohol and other alcoholic and fermented beverages processed tobacco, energy products and electricity, and the obligation to pay the duty arises in the case of the absence of a duty suspension arrangement <b>taxable</b> <b>product</b> or service release, storage, production and importation, irrespective of whether these actions were carried out legally or illegally. The second part deals with general civil claim in a criminal case and the issues specifically examined case files for the illegal disposal excise. This section determined that {{the damage done by}} the state on the basis of a wrongful act and should be compensated for award of state excise tax rate amount as a loss of income. Also, given the fact that the different tax law and criminal law framework, the legislative branches of the substance and the objectives, in this Thesis refers that the obligation to pay taxes and the obligation to answer for the commission of a crime or misdemeanor may be present at the same time, the rise of the same action or its result, also in view of the fact that it must be guided by principle of fiscal neutrality, which does not draw a distinction between legally and illegally circulation of similar goods, it is concluded that all excise goods both in legally and illegally circulation, if only can compete with each other, must be subject to excise tax. If it is determined that the damage to the state caused by the illegal disposal of excise goods, the third part of this Thesis assessed excise tax for the award of a wrongful act contrary to justice, reasonableness and fairness principles. This part after case law analysis determined that the compensation of lost income in the form of an award of the sum of the excise tax was contrary to justice, fairness and reasonableness in the case where the goods were illegally imported and confiscated or destroyed. But the entry into force of the Union Customs Code, damages for illegally imported and confiscated or destroyed excise duty and goods are no longer compensated. However, for illegally produced and confiscated or destroyed goods damages award to pay excise tax on the sum has not been repealed, but it is also contrary to justice, fairness and reasonableness. Moreover in this section it has been found to be a situation where some criminal cases, civil claim for wrongful disposition of excise goods brought in, and in other criminal cases concerning the same subject - has been expressed, assessed as contrary to the principle of fairness and it is recommended to establish a common procedure which entails the obligation to file a civil action in a criminal case for illegal possession of excise goods. In the fourth part of this thesis aims to determine whether the obligation to pay excise duty on the basis of illegal activities in compliance with giving evidence in front of you, as it is concluded that the consolidation of these duties in compliance with statutory level of insurance compelled to give evidence against himself principle. At the end of this Thesis indicates that the hypothesis that a civil claim for unpaid excise tax examination and award of criminal cases of illegal possession of excise goods contrary to the principles of criminal law is hereby confirmed...|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} extant maps {{found in}} archeological sites of China {{date to the}} 4th century BC and {{were made in the}} ancient State of Qin. The earliest known reference to the application of a geometric grid and mathematically graduated scale to a map was contained in the writings of the cartographer Pei Xiu (224-271). From the 1st century AD onwards, official Chinese historical texts contained a geographical section, which was often an enormous compilation of changes in place-names and local administrative divisions controlled by the ruling dynasty, descriptions of mountain ranges, river systems, <b>taxable</b> <b>products,</b> etc. The ancient Chinese historian Ban Gu (32-92) most likely started the trend of the gazetteer in China, which became prominent in the Southern and Northern Dynasties period and Sui Dynasty. Local gazetteers would feature a wealth of geographic information, although its cartographic aspects were not as highly professional as the maps created by professional cartographers.|$|R

50|$|An excise {{is imposed}} on listed {{specific}} <b>taxable</b> events or <b>products</b> {{and is usually}} not collected or paid directly by the consumer. Excise taxes are collected by the producer or retailer and paid to the Internal Revenue Service, state or local tax agency. The producer can usually pass {{at least some of}} the burden of the excise tax to the consumer, the amount of which is added to the price of the product when it is sold. The degree to which consumers and producers will share the burden, called tax incidence, depends upon the price elasticities of supply and demand. Often sales taxes are collected as a percentage of the cost of the product including its excise tax—a tax on a tax.|$|R

The audit risk is also cited as a principal concern of the E Mainstreet Alliance, a group of small businesses, some of which are online only but many of which also have a brick and mortar presence, who are worried about being crippled by this legislation.|$|R
40|$|Oil revenue plays {{a central}} role in Russia''s {{economic}} development. Thus, the recent decline in oil production and investment, and the possible contribution of the current fiscal regime to these developments, have prompted a reassessment of the oil tax system in Russia. Some important changes have already been made, while others are underway. This paper uses a simulation model to evaluate Russia''s current oil fiscal regime. Based on these simulations, the paper proposes ways to make the fiscal regime more supportive of investment, while ensuring an appropriate share of oil sector profits for the government.

In {{this paper}} we present {{results of the}} {{research}} made between 2008 - 2010 {{on the effectiveness of}} soil fertilization with organic fertilizers and value cultivars tested, in terms of production. Experiences had been located in the experimental field of Jucu, CJ. We took four cultivation of artichokes in the study: “Unirea”, “Violet”, “Agrosel 656 ” and “Chişinău”. They were placed in the experimental field of Jucu- Cluj, made in two densities (3. 57 pl/sqm and 2. 38 pl/sqm) and three levels of fertilization (unfertilized, fertilized with 20 t/ha farmyard manure and 40 t/ha manure in the fall plowing). The sowing was performed manually in the artichokes nests (2 - 3 seeds/nest). The experience was located in four repetitions of 10 sqm. Biometric measurements were conducted at 10 plants in each plot experimental environments. Harvesting has been done manually with a sickle. Economic efficiency was established by calculating the following economic indicators: production per hectare achieved, value of trading, average price recovery, cost of production, cost per unit of <b>product,</b> <b>taxable</b> profit, net income + grants, rate is expressed as %, net profit + subsidy rate. From the cultivars studied, the highest net profit was obtained in cultivation Unirea (8, 976 lei/ha), followed by far by the Purple (6, 745 lei/ha). The main driver of profit was due to the production of plant material. From the three agrofunds, the ones fertilized with 40 t / ha manure {{turned out to be the}} most economically efficient of all cultivars due to higher production per hectare...|$|R
40|$|Multinational groups (MNGs) {{produce a}} major part of global output. Further, a {{substantial}} fraction of international transactions happens to be internal, i. e., intermediate products and services are traded between group members. Thus, the problem of co-ordinating economic decisions like investment or production within such large entities has been widely recog-nized in the theoretical and empirical literature. The findings suggest that transfer prices are a widespread device for splitting up complex decision situations and allocating the responsibility for the resulting subproblems to several decision makers. Apart from its co-ordination function transfer pricing is also used for tax purposes. Legally independent group members realize intra-group sales and contribute to a single <b>product.</b> <b>Taxable</b> group profits are often allocated among the participating companies by means of transfer prices. In this case, from the group's perspective, transfer pricing is a device of international tax planning. Of course, national tax authorities have been aware of potential misuse. In Europe, the problem has become especially severe since the mid-European countries joined the EU. Due to the emerging large tax rate differentials, tax revenues of high-tax legislations eroded. For mitigating this problem formula apportionment (FA) is discussed intensively. Under FA, a common tax base is calculated and divided among the host countries in accordance with given apportionment factors. As a consequence, earnings management fails to re-allocate profits to low-tax legislations and tax base erosion seems to be stopped. However, FA could even be more harmful than transfer pricing because under FA income shifting would require changing economic decisions instead of just taking advantage of accounting options. In addition to the erosion of tax revenues, capital investments and employment could decrease in high-tax legislations. The goal of our paper is to analyze the impact of different international tax allocation regimes on the MNG's investment and production decisions. In our theoretical model, we derive optimal decisions under transfer pricing and FA. A prominent result of our analysis is that FA offsets the advantages of decision decentralization as it reverses the separation of responsibility areas. It is not clear whether FA is desirable from a fiscal or an entrepreneurial perspective. We show that the effects of FA compared to transfer pricing depend strongly on the parameter setting under consideration. One of the most important determinants is the internal decision procedure within the MNG.
