5|$|Before Rommel was {{assigned}} {{defense of the}} Atlantic Wall, obstacles to amphibious landing were being built upon <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Belgium and France. On February 3, 1944 {{during a visit to}} the beach at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Rommel was shown a method by which local troops employed a high pressure water hose to quickly create a hole in beach sand, one which could be used to set high wooden stakes (Hochpfähle) into the beach as an obstacle to landing craft. The water hose method took three minutes, fifteen times faster than using a pile driver. Rommel ordered such methods to be used to place wooden beams, metal rails and other obstructions along <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Normandy. Nearly 11,000 were emplaced in the south part of Normandy's coastline where the Allies would eventually land.|$|E
5|$|Rommel's {{asparagus}} refers {{specifically to}} wooden poles used against aerial invasion. The term {{has also been}} used to describe wooden logs set into <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean to disrupt amphibious landings of troops. Testing found these wooden defenses too weak to stop boats, and they were largely abandoned in favor of Hemmbalken ("obstruction beams") and other beach defenses.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} neared land, a ridge over Mexico {{prevented}} Kiko from coming ashore, resulting in far less damage than forecast. As Kiko traveled {{parallel to the}} coast, heavy rain affected the region for two days. In Kiko's rough seas {{off the coast of}} Mexico, a ship capsized with twenty-fivepassengers and crew. Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts, forcing officials to call off the rescue attempt. Authorities searched <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> San Francisco Ixhuatán and San Francisco del Mar for any signs of the ship. Only twopeople survived; fifteenbodies were recovered, and ninepassengers were never found.|$|E

At least $600,000 was lost in damages dealt to the citrus industry and several maritime incidents resulted in over 55 fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Historically, Lihou was an {{important}} location for a commercially significant industry based around the harvesting of seaweed (or vraic in the local language, Guernésiais). Records suggest considerable activity {{as early as the}} beginning of the nineteenth century. The value of the seaweed as a fertiliser was so great that in 1815 Eleazor Le Marchant, lieutenant bailiff of Guernsey and owner of Lihou, initiated a court case to prevent islanders from drying seaweed on <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Lihou. The case eventually led to new regulations issued in 1818 by the Bailiwick legislature, known as the Chief Pleas at the time, based on a review of ancient royal decrees. However, the Royal Court of Guernsey ruled in favour of the islanders in 1821, with the effect that permission to harvest seaweed on Lihou was granted to inhabitants of the parishes of St Peters and St Saviours. More than a century later, in 1927, a factory was established on the island to produce iodine from the seaweed.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1944, Feldwebel Günther Henschel of 8./JG 1 downed a Mustang {{north of}} Caen. One Fw 190 was downed without human loss.

During the transfer, 8./JG 1, was probably attacked by the P-51s of the 354th Fighter Wing, near Alençon. JG 1 lost three pilots and one mechanic riding passenger, and also lost were two other aircraft without human loss with a claiming of two P-51s downed credited to Lt. Friedrich Krakowitzer (24th kill) and Oberfeldwebel Günther Heckmann (13th kill). The base at Essay was bombed the same day by B-24 Liberators, making the airfield unsuitable for missions.|$|E

5|$|On August3, the United States Weather Bureau {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch for coastal {{areas of the}} Big Island in Kau and Puna districts. As Dot swept by the Hawaiian islands, various gale warnings and small craft warnings shifted westward to reflect the hurricane's predicted path. Due to the storm's sudden northward shift in movement, hurricane warnings were issued for portions of Oahu and the Kauai channel before being issued for only the island of Kauai. All watches and warnings were discontinued on August7 after Dot weakened below hurricane intensity. Disaster workers in Oahu and Kauai were warned by civil defense agencies and the American Red Cross to prepare for emergency. Roughly 400people fled from <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Kauai due {{to the threat of}} storm surge, with an additional 500people being evacuated by authorities as the storm neared the island. After the storm caused flooding in Kauai, nearly 1,000people evacuated out of submerged areas into schools, armories, and public facilities repurposed as emergency shelters.|$|E

Póvoa {{is one of the}} twelve national sea borders controlled by the Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF) and it as an ISN Lifeboat recue station. The Póvoa de Varzim Maritime Police patrols Póvoa de Varzim seafront, including the seaport, beaches and maritime waters under the national sovereignty and jurisdiction. It often acts against illegal fisheries, unruly harvest of shellfish, and smuggling.

5|$|Sand art is {{a special}} art form that is created on <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Puri. The art form is {{attributed}} to Balaram Das, a poet {{who lived in the}} 14th century. Sculptures of various gods and famous people are now created in sand by amateur artists. These are temporary in nature as they get washed away by waves. This art form has gained international fame in recent years. One of the famed sand artists of Odisha is Sudarshan Patnaik. He established the Golden Sand Art Institute in 1995, in the open air on the shores of Bay of Bengal, to provide training to students interested in this art form.|$|E

5|$|She {{was part}} of the Neutrality Patrol at the {{beginning}} of World War II and supported Allied landings at North Africa, and then conducted convoy patrol duty to North African and European ports throughout 1943. On 6 June 1944, she supported Operation Overlord, covering Allied landings on <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> Normandy, France, in particular the battle at Pointe du Hoc. Later that month on 25 June, she supported the bombardment of Cherbourg and there was damaged when she was hit with a German artillery shell. In July she moved to support Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. Following extensive repairs and training, she moved to the Pacific and supported the invasion of Iwo Jima in February 1945. She then moved to support landings on Okinawa in April. Following the end of the war, Texas was decommissioned and in 1948 she was moved to San Jacinto State Park and converted into a museum ship, where she remains today.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{operation}} was to secure the vital ports on the French Mediterranean coast and increase pressure on the German forces by opening another front. After some preliminary commando operations, including the British 4th Para's landing behind enemy lines to secure vital transport links, the US VI Corps landed on <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>of</b> the Côte d'Azur under the shield of a large naval task force, followed by several divisions of the French Army B. They were opposed by the scattered forces of the German Army Group G, which had been weakened by the relocation of its divisions to other fronts and the replacement of its soldiers with third-rate Ostlegionen outfitted with obsolete equipment.|$|E
