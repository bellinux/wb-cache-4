5|$|Two more Fat Man {{bombs were}} detonated during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946. Some 120 Fat Man units were {{produced}} between 1947 and 1949, {{when it was}} superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. <b>The</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> was retired in 1950.|$|E
5|$|While many Manhattan {{scientists}} {{expected that}} the development of the means of delivery of the atomic bomb would be straightforward, Parsons, with his experience of the proximity fuze program, expected that it would involve considerable effort. The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where a scale model of <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> plutonium bomb was developed. On 3 March 1944, testing moved to Muroc Army Air Field, California. The initial tests demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> assembly was unstable in flight, and that its fuzes did not work properly.|$|E
5|$|From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney, pilot of the B-29 Superfortress Bockscar that dropped <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> nuclear bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. During his tenure, the wing developed from a rather new unit to {{the mainstay of}} air defense in the Northeastern United States.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, Benito Mussolini's fascist {{government}} passed anti-Semitic laws barring Jews from university positions. As a Jew, Segrè was now rendered {{an indefinite}} émigré. At the Berkeley Radiation Lab, Lawrence {{offered him a}} job as a research assistant. While at Berkeley, Segrè helped discover the element astatine and the isotope plutonium-239, which was later used to make <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> {{plutonium}} bombs used explosive {{compression of}} plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, {{combined with a}} central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. Hypothetically, as little as 4kg of plutonium—and maybe even less—could {{be used to make}} a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.|$|E
5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces {{had already}} {{commenced}} work on improving the design. The North American B-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Martin XB-48, and Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers, {{then on the}} drawing boards, had bomb bays sized to carry the Grand Slam, which was much longer but not as wide as <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man.</b> The only American bombers that could carry <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> were the B-29 and the Convair B-36. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs. At the time {{there were only two}} sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design {{to make it easier to}} manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime Project W-47 was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.|$|E

5|$|The impracticability of a gun-type bomb using {{plutonium}} {{was agreed}} {{at a meeting}} in Los Alamos on July 17, 1944. All gun-type work in the Manhattan Project was directed at the Little Boy enriched uranium gun design, and almost all of the research at the Los Alamos Laboratory was re-oriented around the problems of implosion for <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> bomb.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{met with}} Arnold again in September 1943. He {{informed}} Arnold {{that there was}} now a second bomb shape under consideration, <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man,</b> and formally requested that further tests be carried out, that not more than three B-29s be modified to carry the weapons, and that the USAAF form and train a special unit to deliver the bombs. Arnold delegated responsibility for this to Major General Oliver P. Echols. In turn, Echols designated Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson as the Project Officer.|$|E
5|$|He later {{served with}} Project Alberta, {{the part of}} the Manhattan Project for {{operations}} in the field. He served on Tinian, where the worked with the X-Unit Section, which was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> bomb's firing unit. He flew a number of practice missions, but not the bombing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. After the fighting ended, {{he was part of the}} Manhattan Project team sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the bomb damage.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fattest</b> <b>Man</b> in Britain was an ITV Studios {{production}} for ITV. The drama {{was commissioned by}} Commissioning Editor of Comedy at ITV. Michaela Hennessy-Vass. The Executive Producer was Saurabh Kakkar. It was directed by David Blair and produced by Jeff Pope.|$|R
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the work on uranium {{was an effort to}} produce plutonium. After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor was demonstrated in Chicago at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the production reactors in Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. <b>The</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{polonium}} {{was produced}} {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project during World War II. It was a critical part of the implosion-type nuclear weapon design used in <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> bomb on Nagasaki in 1945. Polonium and beryllium were the key ingredients of the 'urchin' detonator {{at the center of the}} bomb's spherical plutonium pit. The urchin ignited the nuclear chain reaction at the moment of prompt-criticality to ensure the bomb did not fizzle.|$|E
5|$|Pumpkin {{bombs were}} {{a means of}} {{providing}} realistic training with non-nuclear bombs for the 509th Composite Group's Boeing B-29 Superfortress crews assigned to drop the atomic bomb. The pumpkin bomb had the same weight, size, and weight distribution as <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> plutonium bomb, giving it the same ballistic and handling characteristics. Specifications for the bomb required that it be carried in the forward bomb bay of a Silverplate B-29 bomber and be fuzed to be effective against actual targets.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> and Pumpkin bombs (non-nuclear {{bombs that}} resembled and handled like Fat Man) weighed over , so weight was a concern, {{even with the}} more {{powerful}} engines. Weight reduction was accomplished by removal of all gun turrets and armor plating. This work {{was done by the}} 509th Composite Group for the early Silverplate aircraft, but later models were delivered without them. These B-29s represented a significant increase in performance over the standard variants.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> {{design was}} {{tested in the}} Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. Project Y {{personnel}} formed pit crews and assembly teams for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and participated in the bombing as weaponeers and observers. After the war ended, the laboratory supported the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. A new Z Division was created to control testing, stockpiling and bomb assembly activities, which were concentrated at Sandia Base. The Los Alamos Laboratory became Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The first {{production}} batch of uranium slugs were dissolved at the separation plant on 26 December 1944, and in January 1945 Matthias personally couriered {{the first batch}} of plutonium nitrate to Los Angeles, where he handed it over to another courier, who {{took it to the}} Los Alamos Laboratory. Plutonium from Hanford would be used in <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> bomb used in the bombing of Nagasaki. For his wartime services, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{he served}} at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, where he was {{involved}} in an effort to improve aircraft instrumentation, notably the compass and altimeter. He attended the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering, and studied nuclear physics. In June 1942, he assumed command of a new patrol bomber squadron, VB-106, equipped with PB4Y-1 Liberators, which he led in a daring raid on Wake Island, in the Solomon Islands campaign, and in the Southwest Pacific Area. Returning to the United States in 1944, he was posted was to the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California, where he joined the Manhattan Project, participating in Project Camel, the development of the non-nuclear components of <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> bomb, and in its drop testing.|$|E
5|$|In August 1945, <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Man</b> was {{assembled}} on Tinian by Project Alberta personnel. When {{the physics}} package was fully assembled and wired, it was placed inside its ellipsoidal aerodynamic bombshell and wheeled out, {{where it was}} signed by nearly 60 people, including Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell and Captain William S. Parsons. It was then wheeled to the bomb bay of the B-29 Superfortress named Bockscar after its normally assigned command pilot, Captain Frederick C. Bock, who flew The Great Artiste with his crew on the mission. Bockscar was flown by Major Charles W. Sweeney and his crew, with Commander Frederick L.
