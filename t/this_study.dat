25|$|<b>This</b> <b>study</b> is now disputed on {{the basis}} of simple coding errors and biased sampling. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> also {{supports}} a continuing increase in both theoretical and observed upper human lifespan, based on observed data from 200 national populations. However, a theoretical study also suggested that the maximum human life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value δ, which is around 104 years.|$|E

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>studies</b> {{is about}} recommending {{food for the}} anemia patient by using rule base. Anemia is a blood {{disorder}} diseases which is having low iron level in the blood. The rule base technique is applied in <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> to recommend suitable food for the anemia patient, as the anemia patient having problem to consume food that can help to increase the iron level in the blood. The aim of <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> is to develop the prototype for recommending food for the anemia patient by using rule base. The first objective of <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> is to gathered food information from the dietician, an interview {{is being held in}} order to get further information and a better understanding about Malaysian foods. The second objective of <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> is to analyse the relationship between the suitable food and the preferences of the animatic user by using rule based. The third objective is to create and embedded the rules to the prototype to recommends foods to the animatic users. <b>This</b> <b>studies</b> consists of four phases for methodology, which is data gathering, data analysis, design and implementation. In the first phases, which are data gathering, interview with the dietician is conducted to gather the information regarding the food information as well as the iron level needed daily for the anemia patient. Data analysis is the second phases of methodology in <b>this</b> <b>studies,</b> the gathered data is being analyse and preprocess to produce cleaned data. The third phases is design, the design of the database, interface of the prototype is being done in this phase. The last phases is implementation which are implementing the generated rule base for recommending food to the anemia patient to the prototype. The phases of this methodology is to achieve the objective of <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> and fulfilled the aim of <b>this</b> <b>studies.</b> The final result of <b>this</b> <b>studies</b> is the developed system prototype is able to recommend suitable food for the anemia patient base on the animatic preferences...|$|R

The preparation phase corresponds to the release concept planning phase in the new solution of this paper (see Fig.  2). The activities of Pregame and <b>this</b> <b>study’s</b> release concept planning include some iterations and intermediate checkpoints. Pregame’s planning step corresponds to the release backlog and project planning activities in <b>this</b> <b>study’s</b> solution.

40|$|Research on {{sexuality}} in Ghana has been scanty {{due to the}} nature of the Ghanaian society where sensitive issues like sexuality are not openly discussed and researched. <b>This</b> qualitative <b>study</b> examined how social contact with Canadian society has impacted the views of Ghanaian students living in Canada about sexuality. The data for <b>this</b> research <b>study</b> were gathered through in-depth interviews with 15 Ghanaian students between ages 18 to 30 who had been living in Canada for more than one year. <b>This</b> <b>study’s</b> findings revealed that religion plays a central role in shaping views about sexuality among young Ghanaians living in Canada. The findings also highlighted the impact of cultural contact in shaping several aspects of {{sexuality in}}cluding contraception and same-sex relations. The theoretical implications of <b>this</b> <b>study’s</b> results are discussed in terms of how they can help to clarify culturally informed models focusing on the role played by society, religion, family and peers in the development of adolescent perspectives about sexuality.
