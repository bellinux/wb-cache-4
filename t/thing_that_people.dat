It's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind..." [...] Barrett later said of the album: [...] "I liked what came out, only it was released far too long after it was done. I {{wanted it to be}} a whole <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> would listen to all the way through with everything related and balanced, the tempos and moods offsetting each other, and I hope that's what it sounds like." [...] In a bid to increase sales, Jones wrote a letter to music magazine, Melody Maker, under an alternate name, writing how great the album was.|$|E
500|$|Film analyst Lina Badley {{has written}} that the Alien's design, with strong Freudian sexual undertones, {{multiple}} phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm {{not going to go}} after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men.

[...] "I'd much rather experiment and do something surprising, and not have everybody appreciate it, than just turn the crank and do another alien war movie with a space marine," [...] said Halo 2 design lead Jaime Griesemer. Community lead Brian Jarrard attributed some of the fan backlash to a discord between the game's marketing and the actual gameplay. [...] "I think, {{even more so than}} playing as the Arbiter, the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> were disappointed with and angry about is that they were promised this experience, through the marketing, of being really backs against the wall, Earth's under siege, we're going to do all we can to save our home planet... In reality, the game only had two missions that actually did that." [...] Referring to Halo 2s cliffhanger ending, Griesemer said, [...] "I think if we'd been able to finish that last couple of missions and get you properly back on Earth, a lot of the reaction would have been placated." ...|$|E

500|$|Lauer {{thought that}} the surge in {{interest}} in bacon products prior to the book's publication was [...] "media driven". She noted that a response to political correctness as related to cooking and food consumption may have driven interest in the product. Lauer said that bacon seems to be [...] "the one <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are unwilling to give up". In a post of her blog in March 2009, Lauer lamented those that were willing to posit {{an end to the}} trend of interest in bacon. She commented, [...] "Bacon is something that everybody is familiar with and most people grew up eating. It has a comfort aspect to it and a familiarity. It's also got an addictive aspect to it— that sweet and salty combination of flavors." [...] She asserted that interest in the product is as much due to the culture surrounding it as to bacon itself. [...] "Current food trends focus on eating real and eating local, and there's nothing more real than a delicious strip of bacon. In many U.S. cities, local producers and chefs are making a name for themselves because of bacon," [...] said Lauer. She stated that [...] "most chefs would admit that bacon has long been one of their secret weapons in the kitchen." [...] The book was marketed as the [...] "most comprehensive book about bacon to date". Lauer promoted her book in a September 2009 appearance as a co-host at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Tour in Pennsylvania, hosted by fellow bacon blogger Jason Mosley (Mr. Baconpants, at mrbaconpants.com).|$|E

[...] MacDonald lived next to columnist Leavitt, whom the Muskie aide inveigled to accompany Muskie on a fishing trip to an Ellsworth, Maine, lake. Muskie landed the prize-winning fish, headlined in the next day's Bangor newspaper. As Muskie recalled, his fishing trip with Leavitt made a deeper impression than most of his electoral efforts. [...] "Muskie {{throughout the rest of}} his career would say, 'You know, I fought for Dickey-Lincoln , and I prevented them from closing Loring, but the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> talk about is that fish.'" ...|$|E

I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." [...] When asked if people had a legitimate reason to question the certificate, she stated, [...] "I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records– all of that is fair game." [...] She also stated that the questions were 'fair play' because, [...] "the weird conspiracy theory freaky <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> talk about that Trig isn't my real son– 'You need to produce his birth certificate, you need to prove that he's your kid,' which we have done.

2500|$|On October 22, 2003, Moody {{left the}} band during the European tour for Fallen, {{reportedly}} because of creative differences. In an interview several months later, Amy Lee said: [...] "...we'd gotten {{to a point}} that if something didn't change, we wouldn't have been able to make a second record." [...] This became a point of confusion, as Moody and Lee stated on the Fallen album liner notes that they were best friends. Lee said it was almost a relief that Moody left because of tensions created within the band. During an interview, Lee has said, [...] "I don't know, I just think it's exactly what I would've expected. He's more about kind of the pop influence sort of thing and also, you know, about being commercial and I mean selling albums: That's the part of him we often disagreed on. I wanted to do the more artistic weird thing and he'd wanna do the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> would want to hear..." [...] She adds [...] "So that's a lot of the reason [...] it's been so fun writing now, is [...] we're not thinking about that. It's like 'what do we like?', 'what's fun?', like 'what do we want to do that's different?'" [...] Moody was replaced by Terry Balsamo from Cold.|$|E
2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> often say about Him: I'm {{ready to accept}} Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That {{is the one thing}} we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E

As {{far as the}} comedies are concerned, that {{will depend on the}} answer to the question, Are plays objectionable, the staple subject of which is {{adultery}}? Now, we cannot but agree with the Puritans, that adultery is not a subject for comedy at all. It may be for tragedy; but for comedy never. It is a sin; not merely theologically, but socially, one of the very worst sins, the parent of seven other sins,--of falsehood, suspicion, hate, murder, and a whole bevy of devils. The prevalence of adultery in any country has always been a sign and a cause of social insincerity, division, and revolution; where a people has learnt to connive and laugh at it, and to treat it as a light <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> has been always careless, base, selfish, cowardly,--ripe for slavery.

A distant response is heard from the yard, and Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman come running down it, quite out of breath, for they have been having a glass of ale a-piece, and Mr. Pickwick's fingers are so cold that he has been full five minutes before he could find the sixpence to pay for it. The coachman shouts an admonitory 'Now then, gen'l'm'n,' the guard re-echoes it; the old gentleman inside thinks it a very extraordinary <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> WILL get down when they know there isn't time for it; Mr. Pickwick struggles up on one side, Mr. Tupman on the other; Mr. Winkle cries 'All right'; and off they start.
