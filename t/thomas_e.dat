5|$|Despite his pro-slavery views, Dixon was {{loyal to}} the Union during the Civil War. He {{represented}} his county and his state {{in a number of}} failed conventions that sought to resolve the upcoming conflict before it began. In 1864, he joined Kentucky governor <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Bramlette in an audience with President Abraham Lincoln protesting the recruitment of former slaves as Union soldiers in Kentucky. Dixon died on April 23, 1876.|$|E
5|$|In December 1916, Tinker became {{part-owner}} of the Columbus Senators of the American Association, with <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Wilson {{serving as}} the principal owner. The duo paid $65,000 for 75% ownership of the team. Tinker also served as the team's manager. He allowed Grover Hartley to succeed him as manager in 1919 and chose Bill Clymer to manage the team for the 1920 season, leading Hartley to request a trade.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 Presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton carried Virginia, {{marking the}} third {{consecutive}} win for the Democratic Party at the presidential level {{and the first time}} the state gave its electoral votes to a Democrat, who did not win the national Electoral Vote, since 1924. In contrast, the state gave Donald J. Trump the smallest percentage of Virginian votes for any Republican Party presidential nominee since <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Dewey in 1948.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his term}} in Congress, Wickliffe was thrown from a {{carriage}} and permanently crippled. Despite his injury, he remained politically active. In 1863, he ran for governor as a Peace Democrat on an anti-Lincoln platform. Military authorities considered him subversive, however, and interfered with the election; Wickliffe lost to <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Bramlette in a landslide.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Wickliffe {{was again}} {{elected to the}} U.S. House, serving a single term. He tried to avert the Civil War by serving as a {{delegate}} to both the 1861 Peace Conference and the Border States Convention. After war was declared, he sided with the Union cause. In 1863, he again sought the office of governor, but federal military forces interfered with the election, resulting in a landslide victory for <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Bramlette. Later in life, Wickliffe was crippled in a carriage accident and also went completely blind. He died on October 31, 1869, while visiting his daughter in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In March 1864, Dixon {{accompanied}} Kentucky Governor <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Bramlette and John Marshall Harlan, the state's attorney general, to {{an audience}} with President Lincoln to protest the recruitment of blacks {{into the ranks of}} the Union Army. The governor eventually agreed to allow the practice, but only when whites failed to meet their draft quotas. Since recruitment of blacks had been taking place in the Commonwealth for more than two months already, the concession {{was little more than a}} face-saving gesture by Bramlette. Following the end of the Civil War, Dixon retired from public life. He died in Henderson on April 23, 1876, and is buried in Fernwood Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|In early September, Confederate and Union forces entered Kentucky, ending her neutrality. On September 18, Unionists {{shut down}} the pro-Southern Louisville Courier {{newspaper}} and arrested former governor Charles S. Morehead, who was suspected of having Confederate sympathies. Learning that Colonel <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Bramlette was under orders to arrest him, Breckinridge fled to Prestonsburg, Kentucky, where he was joined by Confederate sympathizers George W. Johnson, George Baird Hodge, William E. Simms, and William Preston. The group continued to Abingdon, Virginia, where they took a train to Confederate-held Bowling Green, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|On July 27, 1939, he died {{following}} an operation for a chest tumor at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, Manhattan, New York, {{at the age}} of 52. He was survived by his widow, Ida Berthold, and two daughters, Helen Paterno – who had married the son of prominent real estate developer Charles V. Paterno – and Sally Cotillo. More than 3,000 people attended his funeral in Saint Patrick's Cathedral, including New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia, Lieutenant Governor Charles Poletti, District Attorney <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Dewey and former New York Governor Alfred E. Smith. He {{was the subject of a}} biography by Nat Ferber, A New American, published in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Creek Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center {{is located}} east of Harrington Regional Medical Center. The {{facility}} opened in 1940 and was renamed in 2005, honoring the 18-year-old Amarillo Marine who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Construction began in 2006 {{for a new}} Texas State Veterans Home in northwest Amarillo. The United States government, through the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, provided the funding to build the facility, while the Texas government will run it after construction is completed. The home {{is scheduled to open}} in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately {{his career}} in the Busch Series was for the most part underwhelming. He never could hold a steady ride in his NASCAR career, which lasted from 1994 to 1998. Reeves was {{employed}} by five different car owners in his five seasons (Mark <b>Thomas,</b> <b>Ed</b> Whitaker, Mike Curb, Donald Laird, and David Ridling).|$|R

5|$|An Act of Parliament in 1857 {{provided}} {{for the establishment of}} a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made many works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Stephens and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. Sir Frank Brangwyn was Welsh by origin but spent little time in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{continued}} his independence from his party throughout his term, vocally opposing Republican {{plans to cut}} taxes despite record national budget deficits and resisting the party's efforts to reduce funding for the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe {{in the aftermath of}} the war. He worked with fellow Kentuckian Alben Barkley and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse to undermine Jim Crow laws enacted by the states and remove obstacles to suffrage for minorities. He also co-sponsored a bill to create the Medicare system, although it was defeated at the time. Although he had voted with the Republicans just 51% of the time during his partial term– the lowest average of any member of the party– Cooper headed the Kentucky delegation to the 1948 Republican National Convention. He supported Arthur Vandenberg for president, but <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Dewey ultimately received the party's nomination. Cooper himself was mentioned as a possible candidate for vice-president, but ultimately did not receive the nomination and sought re-election to his Senate seat instead. Also in 1948, Centre College awarded Cooper an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.|$|E
5|$|During Pettit's tenure, the Institute progressed {{into the}} top tier of {{technological}} education institutions. Under his leadership, Tech's research budget surpassed the $100 million mark {{for the first time}} in its history. <b>Thomas</b> <b>E.</b> Stelson was Georgia Tech's Vice President for Research from 1974 to 1988. Faced with a longstanding cultural war over the relative merits of basic research versus applied research, Stelson emphasized the importance of both. An increased focus on research activities allowed more funding for academics, which allowed the school's ranking to start a long and continuing rise from that of the 20s. Stelson simultaneously served as the interim director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute from 1975 to 1976, during which time he reorganized the station into eight semi-autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele—a model that GTRI retains (with slight modifications) to this day.|$|E
