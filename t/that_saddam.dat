40|$|In a {{statement}} issued after the execution of Saddam Hussein, President Bush said <b>that</b> bringing <b>Saddam</b> to justice "is an important milestone" of Iraq's evolution into a democracy and ally {{in the war on}} terror. As attacks in Iraq increase and the US military death toll continues past 3, 000, however, one must wonder if Bush is seeking to distract us from the truth <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> execution is extremely dangerous and more of a setback to national unity than anything else...|$|R
50|$|United States' forces {{braced for}} a {{backlash}} {{of violence in}} Iraq due to the execution. United States President George W. Bush stated <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> death would not end the violence in Iraq. In Tikrit, Iraq, where Saddam was buried, police barred entrances to and departures from the city for four days as a safety precaution.|$|R
2500|$|Reports {{circulated}} <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> {{behavior was}} [...] "submissive" [...] {{and that he}} was carrying the Qur'an he had been keeping with him throughout his trial before his execution.

[...] Al-Rubaie reportedly asked Saddam if he had any remorse or fear, to which Saddam replied: ...|$|R
25|$|Bush {{responded by}} {{discussing}} the War on Terror, and stated {{as a reason}} for the invasion <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein chose to deny inspectors and not to disclose required information. Thomas was criticized by some commentators for her exchange with Bush.|$|E
25|$|Moore has {{frequently}} stated his opinion <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> was a brutal tyrant, though this opinion is {{not mentioned in}} the film. He said calling attention to Saddam's crimes was unnecessary considering the corporate media had continually pressed that point themselves, making it public knowledge.|$|E
25|$|There {{were more}} than 100,000 Iranian victims of Iraq's {{chemical}} weapons during the eight-year war. The total Iranian casualties of the war were estimated to be between 500,000 and 1,000,000. Almost all relevant international agencies have confirmed <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> engaged in chemical warfare to blunt Iranian human wave attacks; these agencies unanimously confirmed that Iran never used chemical weapons during the war.|$|E

5000|$|Cohen {{supported}} the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq. He criticised the Bush administration's {{handling of the}} occupation while still supporting the cause given the brutality of Saddam Hussein's regime. In January 2009, he commented <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> [...] "death-and-genocide machine killed about 400,000 Iraqis and another million or so people in Iran and Kuwait." [...] He wrote that [...] "I still believe Iraq's freedom outweighs its terrible price." ...|$|R
25|$|Saddam pushed oil-exporting {{countries}} to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, however. In addition to refusing the request, Kuwait spearheaded the opposition in OPEC to the cuts <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> had requested. Kuwait was pumping {{large amounts of}} oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off a huge debt.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, the Iraqi Special Tribunal {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein and six co-defendants {{would face}} trial on 21 August 2006, {{in relation to}} the Anfal campaign.

50|$|In 1998, Armitage {{signed a}} letter to President Bill Clinton. The letter urged Clinton to target the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime from power in Iraq. It stated <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> massive {{violations}} of the cease-fire that had ended the First Gulf War has caused erosion of the Gulf War Coalition's containment policy. It also raised the possibility that Iraq, emboldened by Western inaction, might re-develop weapons of mass destruction.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2005, the CIA updated the 2004 {{report to}} {{conclude}} <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime [...] "did {{not have a}} relationship, harbor, or even {{turn a blind eye}} toward Mr. Zarqawi and his associates," [...] according to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (see 2006 report below). Two counterterrorism analysts told Newsweek that Zarqawi did likely receive medical treatment in Baghdad in 2002, but <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> government may never have known Zarqawi was in Iraq because Zarqawi used [...] "false cover." [...] An intelligence official also told Newsweek the current draft of the report says that [...] "most evidence suggests Saddam Hussein did not provide Zarqawi safe haven before the war. It also recognizes that there are still unanswered questions and gaps in knowledge about the relationship." [...] According to Newsweek, [...] "The most recent CIA analysis is an update—based on fresh reporting from Iraq and interviews with former Saddam officials—of a classified report that analysts in the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence first produced more than a year ago." ...|$|R
25|$|The main {{allegations}} were: <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> possessed or {{was attempting}} to produce weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam Hussein had used {{in places such as}} Halabja, possessed, and made efforts to acquire, particularly considering two previous attacks on Baghdad nuclear weapons production facilities by both Iran and Israel which were alleged to have postponed weapons development progress; and, further, that he had ties to terrorists, specifically al-Qaeda.|$|E
25|$|In August 1995, Raghad and {{her husband}} Hussein Kamel al-Majid and Rana {{and her husband}}, Saddam Kamel al-Majid, {{defected}} to Jordan, taking their children with them.

Within three days of their return in February 1996, both of the Kamel brothers were attacked and killed in a gunfight with other clan members who considered them traitors.|$|E
25|$|One bomb {{missed the}} {{compound}} entirely {{and the other}} three missed their target, landing {{on the other side of}} the wall of the palace compound. Saddam Hussein was not present, nor were any members of the Iraqi leadership. The attack killed one civilian and injured fourteen others, including four men, nine women and one child. Later investigation revealed <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein had not visited the farm since 1995.|$|E
5000|$|Yasin hasn't {{been seen}} or heard from since the 2002 prison interview. He was not located during the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq. After the invasion, large numbers of documents were retrieved. Some analysts [...] "concluded that the documents show <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> government provided monthly payments and a home for Yasin." [...] Many experts today believe that Yasin managed to escape from Iraq before the invasion, and is living today somewhere in Jordan.|$|R
50|$|The US-funded {{satellite}} network Al Hurra broadcast {{a story on}} 6 January 2005 detailing allegations <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime had bribed news reporters with oil coupons. Reporters named include Ahmed Mansour of Al Jazeera and , a writer based in France known for her pro-Saddam positions. Two types of oil coupons were used: silver coupons that entitled holders to nine million barrels of oil, and gold coupons worth more. Hamida Naanaa {{is said to have}} received a gold coupon.|$|R
2500|$|The primary news {{source for}} the {{execution}} was the state-run Iraqi television news station Al Iraqiya. A scrolling headline read, [...] "Saddam's execution {{marks the end of}} a dark period of Iraq's history." [...] The BBC noted that a doctor, a lawyer, and various officials, were present, and that a video recording of the execution was made. Al Arabiya reported <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> lawyer had confirmed Saddam's death. Al Iraqiya also confirmed his death, whose announcer said, [...] "criminal Saddam was hanged to death ..." ...|$|R
25|$|Following 2003 media {{speculation}} <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein could {{launch a}} poison chemical attack on London, Cauty designed the Stamps of Mass Destruction for Blacksmoke Art Collective. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd class stamps featuring the Queen's head wearing a gas mask were released as limited edition prints and exhibited at Artrepublic Gallery, Brighton. Following {{a legal battle}} over alleged copyright infringement, the stamps were sent to Royal Mail for destruction.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Saddam {{asked his}} ministers for candid advice. Health Minister Dr. Riyadh Ibrahim {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> temporarily step down to promote peace negotiations. Initially, Saddam Hussein appeared {{to take in}} this opinion {{as part of his}} cabinet democracy. A few weeks later, Dr. Ibrahim was sacked when held responsible for a fatal incident in an Iraqi hospital where a patient died from intravenous administration of the wrong concentration of potassium supplement.|$|E
25|$|On 13 December 2003, in Operation Red Dawn, Saddam Hussein was {{captured}} by American forces after being found hiding in {{a hole in the}} ground near a farmhouse in ad-Dawr, near Tikrit. Following his capture, Saddam was transported to a U.S. base near Tikrit, and later taken to the American base near Baghdad. On 14 December, U.S. administrator in Iraq L. Paul Bremer confirmed <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein had indeed been captured at a farmhouse in ad-Dawr near Tikrit. Bremer presented video footage of Saddam in custody.|$|E

50|$|The Bush {{administration}} based its {{rationale for}} war principally on {{the assertion that}} Iraq possessed {{weapons of mass destruction}} (WMDs) and <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> government posed an immediate threat to the United States and its coalition allies. Some U.S. officials accused Saddam of harboring and supporting al-Qaeda, while others cited the desire to end a repressive dictatorship and bring democracy to the people of Iraq. After the invasion, however, no substantial evidence was found to verify the initial claims about WMDs. The rationale and misrepresentation of pre-war intelligence faced heavy criticism within the U.S. and internationally.|$|R
25|$|The Iraqi {{government}} and military collapsed within {{three weeks of}} the beginning of the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq on 20 March. By the beginning of April, U.S.-led forces occupied much of Iraq. The resistance of the much-weakened Iraqi Army either crumbled or shifted to guerrilla tactics, and it appeared <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> had lost control of Iraq. He was last seen in a video which purported to show him in the Baghdad suburbs surrounded by supporters. When Baghdad fell to U.S.-led forces on 9 April, marked symbolically by the toppling of his statue by iconoclasts, Saddam was nowhere to be found.|$|E
25|$|In March 2003, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, Spain, Denmark, and Italy began {{preparing}} for the invasion of Iraq, {{with a host of}} public relations and military moves. In his 17 March 2003 address to the nation, Bush demanded <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> and his two sons, Uday and Qusay, surrender and leave Iraq, giving them a 48-hour deadline. But the U.S. began the bombing of Iraq on the day before the deadline expired. On 18 March 2003, the bombing of Iraq by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, Spain, Italy and Denmark began. Unlike the first Gulf War, this war had no explicit UN authorisation.|$|E
25|$|On 16 March 1988, the Kurdish town of Halabja was {{attacked}} {{with a mix}} of mustard gas and nerve agents, killing 5,000 civilians, and maiming, disfiguring, or seriously debilitating 10,000 more. (see Halabja poison gas attack) The attack occurred in conjunction with the 1988 al-Anfal Campaign designed to reassert central control of the mostly Kurdish population of areas of northern Iraq and defeat the Kurdish peshmerga rebel forces. The United States now maintains <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> ordered the attack to terrorize the Kurdish population in northern Iraq, but Saddam's regime claimed at the time that Iran was responsible for the attack which some including the U.S. supported until several years later.|$|E
50|$|Scholars {{have argued}} <b>that</b> <b>Saddam’s</b> choice of Qādisiyyah {{reflects}} the emotive power of religious {{history in the}} Middle East; invoking its name imbues subconscious meaning to its audience. Qādisiyyah has continued {{to appear in the}} Middle East today, as radical Islamists have named training bases, religious courts, and mosques after the engagement and have cited it in their speeches and sermons. In addition, Qādisiyyah graces the names of schools, sports clubs, bridges, businesses, and medical facilities across the Middle East and even in Europe. A full list of the Qādisiyyah nomenclature can be found online.|$|R

The primary goal {{of this study is to}} explain the discrepancy between Saddam Hussein's rigid behavior during the Gulf crisis, in contrast to the pragmatic style of decision making he has demonstrated in the past. It is suggested here that crisis-induced stress impaired Saddam's ability to process information, allowed his personality traits more influence on his choices, and activated a number of coping mechanisms <b>that</b> made <b>Saddam</b> less responsive to crisis-relevant information. Stress has been long assumed as a characteristic of international crises. This study goes beyond this to test the hypothesis that crisis situations are stressful for decision makers. Three types of nonverbal behavior indicators are used to test whether the Gulf crisis was stressful for Saddam: facial expression and eye blinking, acoustic indicators, and speech disturbance. While facial expression did not show signs of stress, acoustic and speech disturbance indicators showed that the crisis was stressful for Saddam. The impact of stress on Saddam's thought structure was tested by applying the method of integrative complexity. This analysis showed <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> integrative complexity significantly dropped during the crisis. A number of alternative interpretations of the crisis-related information were excluded from Saddam's during-crisis simple thought structure. Saddam's personality is suggested to be the variable that set the parameters of the accepted range of interpretations. A profile of Saddam's personality was drawn by applying a thematic apperception analysis to a sample of Saddam's interviews and press conferences. Five personality traits were investigated: the power motive, the affiliation motive, the belief in one's ability to control events, nationalism, and conceptual complexity. This analysis showed <b>that</b> <b>Saddam's</b> personality traits are more likely to dispose him to act in an aggressive and nonconciliatory manner when under crisis-induced stress...|$|R
