They beat Rushden & Diamonds over two legs to advance to the play-off final against York City on 16 May 2010. Oxford won the final 3–1, to return to the Football League for the 2010–11 season. The attendance was 42,669, a new record for the final, with around 33,000 being United fans.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal made an {{indifferent}} {{start to}} their league campaign with four consecutive draws {{from their first}} five matches. After defeat to Aston Villa in December 1998, the team embarked on a 19 match unbeaten run to steadily climb up the league table. A 6-1 win against Middlesbrough in April 1999 moved Arsenal {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time in the}} season and victory against Tottenham Hotspur put the team three points clear as main challenger United drew with Liverpool. Both Arsenal and Manchester United went into the final two games of the league season on the same number of points, but the latter's defeat to Leeds United all but ended their chances of retaining the title.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the sale}} of Mike Flanagan to Crystal Palace, new manager Mike Bailey played Walsh in a strike {{partnership}} with Derek Hales in the 1980–81 campaign. Due to a League Cup draw the season opened with three matches against Brentford, and Walsh scored his first senior goal at Griffin Park in a 3–1 defeat before scoring a hat-trick in the return fixture at The Valley, a 5–0 victory; this made him the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the club's history. He ended the campaign with 18 goals in all competitions, whilst Hales was named in the division's PFA Team of the Year. Charlton were top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> {{most of the season}} but a loss of form from February cost them the title, though promotion was still secured with a third-place finish.|$|E
5|$|March {{started with}} two more {{consecutive}} defeats. Dagenham & Redbridge defeated City 2–0 in their first game at Valley Parade, when Barry Conlon missed a penalty and then an open goal both when the score was 1–0. In the following game, Peter Thorne scored a penalty to give City the lead against Stockport County, but County scored twice to win 2–1. Four days later, Bradford recorded their third victory of the season against Chester City, when Conlon scored the only goal {{of the game in}} a 1–0 victory. Conlon scored another in the following game but City again were beaten, 2–1 by Mansfield Town. Following Wetherall's announcement that he would retire, City's supporters staged a special day to celebrate his career and contribution to the club, during the away fixture on 22 March 2008 at Rotherham United, where the team had lost 4–1 the previous season during Wetherall's spell as player-manager. The result of the game finished 1–1, during which Omar Daley was sent off. City played a second game two days later, because of the Easter fixture list, when Peter Thorne scored the 150th league goal of his career to help City beat Chesterfield 1–0. The month finished with a 3–1 victory over Darlington, when Tom Penford scored his first goal for the club, and both Barry Conlon and Joe Colbeck scored against their former club. The victory put City into the top half of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> the first time since September. During March, City also won a Football League award for their season ticket deal {{at the start of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Next was the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament finals for {{the vacant}} TNA World Tag Team Championship between LAX, {{accompanied}} by Guerrero and Salinas, and Team 3D. The duration was eleven minutes and thirty seconds. Devine tried {{to interfere in}} the contest by setting up a table for Team 3D, but Guerrero stopped him and set up <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> himself outside the ring, placing Devine on top. Guerrero then climbed a padded turnbuckle and jumped onto Devine with a diving foot stomp, forcing him through the table. In the ring, Team 3D performed one of their signature tag team maneuvers, the 3D II, forcing Homicide into the mat and following with a cover, but the referee refused to count because Homicide was not the legal man in the contest. Hernandez then performed his signature Border Toss maneuver on Devon, slamming him into the mat {{from the top of}} a turnbuckle. Homicide followed with a splash from the top of a padded turnbuckle on Devon for the pinfall victory, winning the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament and the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|Smith left to {{take over}} at Sunderland in May 1987, and former Blackburn Rovers manager Bobby Saxton was {{appointed}} in June. Only two players were under contract {{at the time of}} Saxton's arrival; his hastily arranged squad struggled from the start of 1987–88, and only won their first match in late October 1987. York were bottom of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> most of the season, and were relegated after finishing in 23rd place. The season was statistically the club's worst in the Football League, with the fewest wins (eight), most defeats (29) and the fewest points since the three points for a win system was introduced (33). York made a poor start to 1988–89, and Saxton resigned with the club bottom of the Fourth Division in mid September 1988. Swallow took over on a caretaker basis before the former Hartlepool United manager John Bird was appointed in October 1988. York's away form improved {{in the second half of}} the season, and in the last week they had a slim chance of reaching the play-offs. They missed out on a play-off place and finished the season in 11th place. A record loss of £190,000 was posted for the season, but the club carried no overdraft because of interest-free loans from directors and a £100,000 share issue. York started 1989–90 strongly and were in third place by mid December 1989. Successive home defeats in late December 1989 marked the start of a decline that saw them finish the season 13th in the table.|$|E
5|$|Benfica began December {{hoping to}} extend their {{domestic}} winning streak, and the club's first game hosted Vitória de Setúbal on 1 December. Laionel opened the score for Setúbal in the 35th minute, with Benfica only responding {{in the second half}} with Kostas Katsouranis. In the 59th minute, David Suazo fired a powerful shot that beat Pedro Alves and put Benfica in the lead. However, in the 91st minute, a bicycle kick by Anderson do Ó cleared Quim and levelled the game. Although Sánchez Flores called the equaliser an accident, he soon dropped Quim in favour of José Moreira. A week later, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Barreiros to play Marítimo. They had their best performance of the season, winning 6–0 with Suazo and Nuno Gomes each scoring twice. The win put Benfica at the top of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> the first time since May 2005, and was their largest away win since 1974. On 13 December, Benfica played Leixões for a place in the Portuguese Cup quarter-finals. On a rainy night at Estádio do Mar, neither team could find the back of the net in regular and extra time. Reyes missed a penalty, giving Leixões the win. Although Nuno Gomes was frustrated with the elimination, he said it was time to hold their heads high and win the league. On Thursday the 18th, Benfica closed their European campaign by hosting Metalist Kharkiv. To qualify, Benfica had to win 8–0 and Olympiacos not win; in case of a draw, Benfica needed a better goal average. They lost one-nil, finishing last in Group B. Sánchez Flores assumed full responsibility for his team's performance in the competition. Of 40 teams, only Partizan, Heerenveen and Feyenoord played worse than Benfica. The year ended with a home game against Nacional. Benfica never overcame Nacional goalkeeper Rafael Bracalli, wasting an opportunity to open a four-point lead in the league table. The match ended in controversy after Cardozo had a goal disallowed because Miguel Vítor had deflected the ball with his hands. According to Sánchez Flores, the goal was legitimate and Benfica were deprived of three points.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>for</b> a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E
