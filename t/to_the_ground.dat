5|$|A {{snowflake}} {{consists of}} roughly 1019 water molecules, which {{are added to}} its core at different rates and in different patterns, depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> As a result, snowflakes vary among themselves, while following similar patterns.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the House of Saud's nineteenth century (1806) control over Mecca and Medina, they demolished many of the religious buildings including tombs and mosques, whether inside or outside the Baqi, in accordance with their doctrine. These were razed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and plundered for their decorations and goods.|$|E
5|$|Bart and his sister, Lisa, {{enter the}} empty ring {{and decide to}} settle their lifelong feud then and there. As they {{approach}} each other to throw a punch, the credits begin, but the scene immediately returns to depict Lisa easily punching Bart <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{was completed}} in two stages, {{the first in the}} 1160s and the second in about 1200. It guarded <b>the</b> entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of Sorø Abbey, then surrounded by a wall. It faced the town centre of Sorø, just south of its marketplace. Few outsiders, and never any women, were afforded access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary reports {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{throughout its}} lifetime as Coventry Road. Writer and researcher Steve Beauchampé {{suggests that the}} Muntz Street name may have been adopted to distinguish it from St Andrew's, which was also built just off the Coventry Road.|$|E
5|$|Earlier ornithologists {{felt that}} the kakapo might be related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> parrots and night parrot of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is contradicted by recent studies; rather, the cryptic colour seems to be {{adaptation}} to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently.|$|E

5|$|In November 2011, {{the club}} {{announced}} that the away supporters' section would be moved from the South Stand to the North Stand Upper {{from the beginning of}} the 2012–13 season. As a result, minor modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> will be necessary.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and crashed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide {{made their way to}} the pavement from high up. Police started to block off areas where the ice was falling, however one man was hit in the head by the falling ice and was knocked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the Revolt of 1173–74 by Henry II's sons {{against their}} father, the king gave de Broc custody of Haughley Castle. On 13 October 1173, Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, {{captured}} the castle for the rebels and burned it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum {{formed when}} resin from kauri trees leaked out through {{fractures}} or {{cracks in the}} bark, hardening with the exposure to air. Lumps commonly fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and became covered with soil and forest litter, eventually fossilising. Other lumps formed as branches forked or trees were damaged, which released the resin.|$|E

50|$|The Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) Exhibition Grounds, {{which was}} {{situated}} further <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, was slowly growing eastward. Permanent buildings were being built {{further and further}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, including the Coliseum, the Electrical and Engineering Building and the Automotive Building. <b>The</b> only gate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exhibition was the Dufferin Gates at {{the west end of}} <b>the</b> <b>grounds,</b> although entry was possible by Strachan Avenue which turned west just south of the railway lines and continued west <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b> <b>The</b> CNE decided <b>to</b> build a new eastern gate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds,</b> a sixtieth anniversary of Canadian Confederation project.|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is a much}} more approachable bird than the water pipit.
