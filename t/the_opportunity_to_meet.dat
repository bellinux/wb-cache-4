40|$|Abstract. In {{the age of}} {{the digital}} residence, it has become {{imperative}} for both new teachers and experienced teachers to meaningfully incorporate the technological tools in daily teaching. Using technology daily as an essential instructional tool enhances <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> instructional needs of all students. This study presents the collaborative efforts of a higher education faculty member and a new teacher, engaged in using interactive video conferencing to enhance the cyclical teaching and learning process of a group of fourth grade students. Ultimately the project supported that technology should be used in all classrooms to enhance student performance on authentic applications and be integrated into core aspects of the daily curriculum, (Miranda & Russell, 2012). The study also points to the fact that collaboration between higher education and p- 12 school faculty can make a positive difference for all participants...|$|R
40|$|The multifamily {{building}} sector {{presents a}} {{unique set of}} challenges and opportunities for utilities seeking to implement effective energy efficiency programs. To deliver successful programs, utilities must understand what motivates building owners to take part in these programs, as well as barriers that may prevent participation. This paper outlines <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> energy efficiency goals with multifamily programs. It then describes the benefits that multifamily building owners gain from these programs, and the barriers they face to participation. The paper focuses on rental housing, because these buildings are owned by a single entity and form the largest sector of the multifamily housing market. The paper provides a framework to help utilities develop successful programs that maximize energy savings and create benefits for building owners, tenants, and communities. And lastly, the paper recommends nine program design considerations that can help attract multifamily building owners to utility energy efficiency programs...|$|R
