25|$|In higher education, {{linguistic}} profiling {{has been found}} to impede student comprehension. In a 1992 study, D.

When the same non-accented lecture was presented with a European American teaching assistant, students had a greater ability <b>to</b> <b>comprehend</b> <b>the</b> material. This suggests that face identification may be enough to make students believe that language performance will be accented, which corresponded with a belief that comprehension would be reduced.|$|E

This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, fairness, and honesty.|$|E

The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was Eléments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton’s theories beyond scientific academies and the university.|$|E
