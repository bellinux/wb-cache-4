25|$|The {{legions of}} the late Republic and early Empire are often called Marian legions. Following the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian {{soldiers}} Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>of</b> battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard type based on the Principes: armed with two heavy javelins called pila (singular pilum), the short sword called gladius, chain mail (lorica hamata), helmet and rectangular shield (scutum).|$|E

Once more, Fremantle climbed his tree {{to see what was}} happening, this time in the company of Captain Scheibert. After touring the Confederate lines, Fremantle returned to that position at about 2pm on the advice of General Longstreet, but was frustrated that the attack did not take place until well after 4pm. For the first time, the Englishman heard the 'Rebel Yell', as well as a Confederate band playing polkas and waltzes above <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>of</b> battle. That evening, news reached the observers of the wounding of General Hood, as well as the death of General William Barksdale.|$|E

25|$|While Khan {{was away}} from Mangalgarh, Mohammad Farooq Hakim, the Governor of Bhilsa, imprisoned his men and confiscated his {{personal}} property. When Khan returned and confronted him, {{he said that he}} believed that Khan had died in the battle with the Mughals. He released the imprisoned men, but returned only half of the Khan's belongings. The resulting hostility eventually led to a battle near Bhilsa. Farooq's army included 40,000 Maratha and Rajput soldiers, while Khan commanded just 5000 Afghans, supported by some Rajput soldiers. In a one-sided battle, Khan lost his brother Sher Mohammed Khan, and his men fled from the battlefield. Dost Mohammad Khan, with some of his most loyal men, had to hide in a thicket near the battlefield. As he lay hidden, he saw Farooq riding an elephant in the victory procession. He dressed himself in the uniform of one of Farooq's slain soldiers, hiding his face with a scarf and a helmet. Amid <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>of</b> the victory drums, he mounted the howdah (seat) on the elephant, killed Farooq and his guard, and claimed victory.|$|E
25|$|With the {{darkness}} of night, now rapidly deepening, <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>of</b> battle, which had been terrific and incessant until the last faint glimmering of twilight, became gradually hushed: its expiring sounds still issuing from the heights in front of Brye, whence the flashes from the fire of artillery, and from that of skirmishers along the outskirts of this village (held by General Jagow with the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 9th Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Westphalian Landwehr), indicated to the French army the extreme verge of its advance; while the still more vivid flashes emitted from the rattling musketry fire of the two Battalions of the 30th Regiment, which had so gallantly sallied forth out of Mont-Potriaux, under Major Dittfurth were still engaged, as also from the Prussian guns which defended the approach to Sombreffe, and frustrated the renewed attack along the high road towards that point, plainly intimated that the Prussian left wing (Thielemann's Corps) still firmly maintained itself in a position whence it might seriously endanger the flank of any further movement in advance against the centre.|$|E
25|$|The Battalion Forming up Place(FUP) {{was secured}} and marked by C Company, under Major HC Singh. Just before the H Hour it was {{realized}} by Lieutenant Ashok Nagpaul, the battalion intelligence officer, that the FUP was misaligned. Sathe, the commanding officer, who had located {{himself in the}} centre of the two assaulting Rifle Companies, on learning that there was mistake in the marking of the FUP, coolly and without causing a flap had the FUP marking corrected. The assault was conducted by A and D Rifle companies under the command of Captain Subash C Jolly and Maj Hem Chander Tiwari respectively. Before the assault Sathe shook hands with the two company commanders and wished them victory. The Battalion advancing through sugar cane fields secured Anula by first light 8 September against 'comparatively light' opposition, according to the Ministry of Defense, History of the war, published 27 years later. The defenders, consisting mainly of Pakistan para-military troops, prompted by <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>of</b> war and the impending assault, abandoned their position before the assault reached their position. Anula and Bajragarhi were captured by 0539 hours 8 September 65. Soon after Anula was captured Sathe reached the objective. He first visited A Company, and then D Company, where he was wounded by own artillery fire.|$|E

500|$|Although the 1965 song [...] "Yesterday" [...] was not {{the first}} pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first {{recorded}} use of classical music elements. Gould observes: [...] "The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>of</b> drums and electric guitars." [...] They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; Sgt.

500|$|The assault troops rose {{early on}} 3 January 1941, ate a meal and drank a tot of rum. The leading {{companies}} began {{moving to the}} start line at 0416. The artillery opened fire at 0530. On crossing the start line the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Eather, came under Italian mortar and artillery fire. The lead platoons advanced accompanied by sappers of the 2/1st Field Company carrying Bangalore torpedoes— pipes packed with ammonal—as Italian artillery fire began to land, mainly behind them. An Italian shell exploded among a leading platoon and detonated a Bangalore torpedo, resulting in four killed and nine wounded. The torpedoes were slid under the barbed wire at [...] intervals. A whistle was blown as a signal to detonate the torpedoes but could not be heard over <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>of</b> the barrage. Colonel Eather became anxious and ordered the engineering party nearest him to detonate their torpedo. This the other teams heard, and they followed suit.|$|E
500|$|Following {{their failure}} to advance the radical agenda in Louisville, Trotter and the other {{radicals}} sought a more sympathetic forum in which to attack Booker T. Washington. An opportunity arrived when Washington was set to speak in Boston in July 1903. When the Tuskegee Institute leader was introduced to a visibly hostile crowd, a small riot broke out. Trotter, who had arrived prepared with several provocative questions to ask Washington, attempted to read them over <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>of</b> the melee. He was among the arrested, and the [...] "Boston riot" [...] received national press coverage. [...] Trotter later claimed {{that there was no}} plan to break up the meeting. Bookerites pressed charges against Trotter for disrupting the meeting; defended by Archibald Grimké, Trotter was convicted and spent thirty days in the Charles Street Jail. Although the Bookerites had hoped to discredit the radicals with the trial, they gained them wider publicity. After the trial, Trotter founded the Boston Suffrage League (1903), and when a New England Suffrage League was founded in 1904, Trotter was elected president.|$|E

Vivid descriptions of Aqil by Lynch are quoted at length {{in the works of}} Finn. Lynch's first encounter with Aqil was in the divan of Said Bey, the Ottoman kaimakam of Acre, and is recorded as follows:But what especially attracted my attention was a magnificent savage enveloped in a scarlet cloth pelisse richly embroidered with gold. He was the handsomest, and I soon thought also the most graceful being I had ever seen. His complexion was of a rich mellow indescribable olive tint, and his hair a glossy black; his teeth were regular and of the whitest ivory, and the glance of his eye was keen at times, but generally soft and lustrous. With the tarboosh upon his head which he seemed to wear uneasily, he reclined, rather than sat upon {{the opposite side of the}} divân, while his hand played in unconscious familiarity with the hilt of his yataghan. He looked like one who would be 'Steel amid <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>of</b> arms, and wax when with the fair.' ...|$|E
500|$|As {{commanding}} officer of No.3 Squadron, Jeffrey came up with innovative ways of improving morale {{in the face of}} living conditions that were [...] "primitive at best". On one occasion he arranged accommodation for his men near a beach, well away from <b>the</b> <b>din</b> <b>of</b> night-time bombing that was causing them to lose sleep on a regular basis. Another of his more [...] "radical ideas" [...] and lasting legacies was a combined mess for all pilots in the combat zone, whether commissioned or non-commissioned. The concept was initially frowned upon by Royal Air Force units, but when Air Vice Marshal [...] "Mary" [...] Coningham dined at the shared mess on 11October 1941 and gave his approval, it took root across the entire Desert Air Force; leading ace Clive Caldwell later put the same idea into practice as commander of the RAAF's No.1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, Northern Territory. One of No.3 Squadron's flight sergeants recalled that Jeffrey made it a rule for new pilots to get to know their ground crew to increase their sense of comradeship, and also gave one of his senior warrant officers special responsibility for keeping track of the location of Allied airfields and petrol supplies to ensure that the unit was never short of fuel or places to land in an emergency.|$|E

Batra courageously exposed himself to enemy fire to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process was shot in the chest by an enemy sniper from very close range and a split-second later, by a splinter from an RPG which hit him in the head.
