25|$|Spinoza’s second {{knowledge}} involves reasoning plus emotions. He {{explains that}} this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes that have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> {{common to the}} human mind. An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't have anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything,</b> really. We knew that.|$|E
500|$|Western astrology {{has taken}} the earth's axial {{precession}} (also called precession of the equinoxes) into account since Ptolemy's Almagest, so the 'first point of Aries', {{the start of the}} astrological year, continually moves against the background of the stars. The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being [...] "...empty boxes that have nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars." [...] Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.|$|E

[...] In a CBS 60 Minutes II segment, a spokesman for the defendants' families charges that the boys were punished not for what they did, but for who was killed. [...] The spokesman says, [...] "It's about a police officer's son who died. [...] And the only way they could convict all these kids was use the felony murder rule."

2500|$|Ever {{since his}} days in the Louisiana State Legislature, Vitter has been a {{longtime}} opponent of gambling. Beginning in 2002, Vitter opposed the bid by the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians to build a casino in Louisiana, arguing that the build site was not historically part of their tribal lands. He lobbied the Interior Department and included language in an appropriations bill to stop the casino. Although the Interior Department gave its approval, the casino {{has not yet been}} approved by the state. The Jena chief accused Vitter of ties with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who simultaneously lobbied against the casino. The chairman of the Senate committee investigating the lobbyist said, [...] "The committee has seen absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Senator Vitter's opposition to (the proposed casino) had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> other than his long-standing opposition to gambling." [...] In 2007 and 2008, Vitter introduced a bill to prohibit Indian casinos such as Jena's. Neither bill became law.|$|E
2500|$|Bishop did not {{see herself}} as a [...] "lesbian poet" [...] or as a [...] "female poet". Because she refused to have her work {{published}} in all-female poetry anthologies, other female poets involved with the women's movement thought she was hostile towards the movement. For instance, a student at Harvard who was close to Bishop in the 60s, Kathleen Spivack, wrote in her memoir, [...] "I think Bishop internalized the misogyny of the time. How could she not? ... Bishop had a very ambivalent relation to being a woman plus poet—plus lesbian—in the Boston/Cambridge/Harvard nexus ... Extremely vulnerable, sensitive, she hid much of her private life. She wanted nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> that seemed to involve the women's movement. She internalized many of the male attitudes of the day toward women, {{who were supposed to}} be attractive, appealing to men, and not ask for equal pay or a job with benefits." [...] However, this was not how Bishop necessarily viewed herself. In an interview with The Paris Review from 1978, she said that, despite her insistence on being excluded from female poetry anthologies, she still considered herself to be [...] "a strong feminist" [...] but that she only wanted to be judged based on the quality of her writing and not on her gender or sexual orientation.|$|E

60|$|Ingrained in Michael's heredity, {{from the}} very {{beginning}} of four-legged dogs on earth, was the defence of the meat. He never reasoned it. Automatic and involuntary as his heart-beating and air-breathing, was his defence of his meat once he had his paw on it, his teeth in it. Only to Steward, by an extreme effort of will and control, could he accord the right to touch his meat once he had himself touched it. Even Kwaque, who most usually fed him under Steward's instructions, knew that the safety of fingers and flesh resided in having nothing further whatever <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> of food once in Michael's possession. But Cocky, a bit of feathery down, a morsel-flash of light and life with the throat of a god, violated with sheer impudence and daring Michael's taboo, the defence of the meat.|$|E

There were seven of us in a gang in Chicago, and Elsie's father was the boss of the Joint. He was a clever man, was old Patrick. It was he who invented that writing, which would pass as a child's scrawl unless you just happened to have the key to it. Well, Elsie learned some of our ways, but she couldn't stand the business, and she had a bit of honest money of her own, so she gave us all the slip and got away to London. She had been engaged to me, and she would have married me, I believe, if I had taken over another profession, but she would have nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> on the cross. It was only after her marriage to this Englishman that I was able to find out where she was. I wrote to her, but got no answer.

6000|$|That is clumsy. Battles do not wage, battles are waged. Mrs. Eddy has {{one very}} curious and {{interesting}} peculiarity: whenever she notices {{that she is}} chortling along without saying anything, she pulls up with a sudden [...] "God is over us all," [...] or some other sounding irrelevancy, and for the moment it seems to light up the whole district; then, before you can recover from the shock, she goes flitting pleasantly and meaninglessly along again, and you hurry hopefully after her, thinking {{you are going to}} get something this time; but as soon as she has led you far enough away from her turkey lot she takes to a tree. Whenever she discovers that she is getting pretty disconnected, she couples-up with an ostentatious [...] "But" [...] which has nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> that went before or is to come after, then she hitches some empties to the train-unrelated verses from the Bible, usually--and steams out of sight and leaves you wondering how she did that clever thing. For striking instances, see bottom paragraph on page 34 and the paragraph on page 35 of her Autobiography. She has a purpose--a deep and dark and artful purpose--in what she is saying in the first paragraph, and you guess what it is, but that is due to your own talent, not hers; she has made it as obscure as language could do it. The other paragraph has no meaning and no discoverable intention. It is merely one of her God-over-alls. I cannot spare room for it in this place.|$|E
