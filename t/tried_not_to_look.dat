60|$|Honora was silent. She <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the group, {{in which}} there were two women of very {{attractive}} appearance, and another man.|$|E
60|$|Miss Macrae, in sabbatical raiment, was fresher than a {{rose and}} gay as a lark. Merton <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her; he failed in this endeavour.|$|E
6000|$|Hallam {{bowed and}} <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> surprised. [...] "Very well. I {{have brought the}} {{document}} about which you wrote. I am sorry I find it impossible to renew the loan." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Oh, I Like your Outfit Too, Except When I Dress Up As a Frigid Bitch, I <b>Try</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> <b>Look</b> so Constipated" [...] — Reese Witherspoon (from Legally Blonde) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Infinite! No {{one could}} be so welcome! How pleased Mr. Audley will be! But I must go, and <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> too much {{disposed}} {{to stand on the}} counter and crow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The unsophisticated Gretchen,' I answered, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> concerned; for in {{my heart}} of hearts, {{in spite of her}} innuendoes, I had really grown rather to like the Cantankerous Old Lady.|$|R
6000|$|Nick <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> conscious, for {{he felt a}} {{significance}} in the old man's face. He turned his own everywhere but toward it, thinking again of his mother. [...] "That must be very pleasant, if one has any." ...|$|E
6000|$|Marguerite <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Brogard, lest {{she should}} betray before him the burning anxiety {{with which she}} waited for his reply. But a free-born French citizen is never in any hurry to answer questions: Brogard took his time, then he said very slowly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him; {{the very}} {{sight of him}} filled her with horror--that blotched, gaunt face of his, the fleshy lips, that hideous bandage across his face that hid one of his eyes! She tried not {{to see him and}} not to hear him laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "the old men are hideous, certainly; and {{the young}} ones--I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at them, poking things into the hollows of their faces with spoons and forks--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My patience! if {{that child}} hasn't crept out there, and bolted through that {{hole in the}} fence! Did you ever, Miss?" [...] exclaimed Roxy, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> pleased at being spared the distasteful task of killing the poor chicken.|$|R
5000|$|... "Ha! I {{was really}} pleased about that. I {{was looking at}} it on the monitor, {{watching}} everyone <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at themselves. It was {{a great thing to}} do in the fashion industry—turn it back on them! God, I’ve had some freaky shows.” ...|$|R
60|$|Meekly {{he drove}} past the cars so ebon and silvery, so smug and strong, {{that they would}} have {{regarded}} a Teal bug as an insult. Another attendant waved him into the elevator, and Milt <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> surprised when the car started, not forward, but upward, as though it had turned into an aeroplane.|$|E
60|$|The {{company was}} silent {{in a moment}} at this reinforcement, and only the {{military}} <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> surprised. While all wondered who the singer could be somebody entered the porch; the door opened, and in came a young man, about the size and weight of the Farnese Hercules, in the uniform of the yeomanry cavalry.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile I munched my Infant-Jesus-and-Dove arrangement, {{which was}} rather like eating thin glass, {{so hard and}} sharp. It was made of almond and white of egg presumably, and was not so bad if you could eat it at all. It was a Christmas relic.--And I watched the Holy Family across the narrow board, and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> all I felt.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} Teddy {{vanished}} Londonward on his bicycle. He {{was going to}} lodge in London {{in order to be}} near his training. He was zealous. Never before had Teddy been zealous. Mrs. Teddy came to the Dower House for the correspondence, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> self-conscious and important.|$|R
6000|$|... "I endeavoured {{to do my}} duty, sir," [...] I answered, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Lucy, {{and seem}} meek; [...] "and {{it would have been}} a terrible disgrace to have come home, and been obliged to say the French got the ship from us, when we were all asleep." ...|$|R
60|$|Anne nodded, <b>trying</b> hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> virtuously complacent {{and failing}} miserably.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is {{my promise}} so very important?' she asked. She glanced angrily {{at the three}} ladies who were hesitating in the doorway. Nevertheless, the ladies entered, and seated {{themselves}} {{at the opposite end}} of the carriage. Siegmund did not know whether he were displeased or relieved by their intrusion. If they had stayed out, he might have held Helena in his arms for still another hour. As it was, she could not harass him with words. He <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her, but to think.|$|E
60|$|She {{remained}} {{in her room}} much longer than {{she thought it would}} have taken her aunt to explain what she had to say. At last, however, she heard footsteps in the corridor, and Griffiths knocked at the door. Her aunt would be obliged by her stepping into her room. She <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> disconcerted, and asked if Lord Cashel were still there. She was told that he was; and she felt that she had to muster up all her courage to encounter him.|$|E
6000|$|Phil Dunleavy was there, lofty and cultured in evening clothes, {{apparently}} {{not eager to}} go. He stayed till ten minutes to ten, and, by his manner of cold surprise when Carl tried to influence the conversation, {{was able to keep}} it to the Kreisler violin recitals, the architecture of St. John the Divine's, and Whitney's polo, while Carl <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> sulky, and manoeuvered to get out the excellent things he was prepared to say on other topics; not unlike the small boy who wants to interrupt whist-players and tell them about his new skates. When Phil was gone Ruth sighed and said, belligerently: ...|$|E
6000|$|The Marshal signs his name, Mr. Ballington <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> indignant as {{he makes}} for the door. A small silver bell rings on the Marshal's desk, the one word: [...] "Spot!" [...] breaks the intense silence, which {{is one way of}} saying that Mr. Ballington is detained, and will {{probably}} be lodged that night at Government expense.|$|R
60|$|Sara Ray giggled and Felicity blushed. Peter <b>tried</b> hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> too self-consciously delighted.|$|R
5000|$|The Times {{noted that}} [...] "The blogs buzzed with rumours: that Mr Brainwash {{is nothing but}} a front for Banksy; even that he is Banksy." [...] Fast Company concludes that [...] "The whole thing, it's clear now, was an {{intricate}} prank being pulled on all of us by Banksy, who has never publicly revealed his identity, with Fairey as his accomplice. ... work <b>looks</b> like Banksy <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like Banksy..." ...|$|R
60|$|Frank {{took his}} place with his companion, and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the {{frothing}} water close beneath him as he leaned out on the jerking boom. For the most part, the big spar lay fairly quiet, but now and then the canvas above it shook itself with a bang. It cost him a strenuous effort to drag each handful of it down in turn, and he discovered afterward that he had broken two of his nails. He lost his breath, the perspiration started from every pore in his skin, and he was sick and dizzy, {{but he managed to}} hold on. At last it was finished, and soon afterward Jake, driving the sloop on her course again, turned to Harry.|$|E
60|$|M. de Luxembourg {{was very}} pompous and very slow, {{and there was}} nothing that Lord Eglinton hated worse than what he called amateur valeting. But now there was nothing for it but {{forbearance}} and resignation; patience, too, of which le petit Anglais had no more than a just share. He gathered the frills of his shirt sleeves in his hands and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> as if he wished M. de Luxembourg {{at the bottom of the}} nearest pond; but at this very moment Monseigneur le Prince de Courtenai, who, it appeared, had not gone to flirt with Madame la Marquise, since the latter was very much engaged elsewhere, but had merely been absorbed in political discussions with M. de Vermandois, suddenly realized that one of his numerous privileges was being encroached upon.|$|E
6000|$|He {{went back}} to the house for lunch, but both those guests were out, no one seemed quite to know where. Restless, unhappy, puzzled, he wandered round and about all the afternoon. Just before dinner he was told of Mrs. Stormer's not being well, and that they would be leaving to-morrow. Going--after three days! That plunged him deeper into his strange and sorrowful confusion. He was reduced now to a {{complete}} brooding silence. He knew he was attracting attention, but could not help it. Several times during dinner he caught Gordy's eyes fixed on him, from under those puffy half-closed lids, with asphyxiated speculation. But he simply COULD not talk--everything that came into his mind to say seemed false. Ah! it was a sad evening--with its glimmering vision into another's sore heart, its confused gnawing sense of things broken, faith betrayed; and yet always the perplexed wonder--"How could I have helped it?" [...] And always Sylvia's wistful face that he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander McQueen later {{described}} {{his thoughts on}} the idea used during VOSS of forcing his audience to stare at their own reflection in the mirrored walls for over an hour:"Ha! I was really pleased about that. I was looking at it on the monitor, watching everyone <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at themselves. It was {{a great thing to}} do in the fashion industry—turn it back on them! God, I’ve had some freaky shows." ...|$|R
60|$|Peter <b>tried</b> hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> push off, {{then he gave}} a great gulp {{and jumped}} ashore and sat down miserably in the snow.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS [pulling himself together] I was <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> nice, mother.|$|R
60|$|Duane, {{aware of}} how cramped he had become from long inaction, began to move his legs and uninjured arm and body, and at length overcame a paralyzing stiffness. Then, digging {{his hand in the}} sand and holding the plank with his knees, he edged it out into the river. Inch by inch he {{advanced}} until clear of the willows. Looking upward, he saw the shadowy figures of the men on the bluff. He realized they ought to see him, feared that they would. But he kept on, cautiously, noiselessly, with a heart-numbing slowness. From time to time his elbow made a little gurgle and splash in the water. Try as he might, he could not prevent this. It got to be like the hollow roar of a rapid filling his ears with mocking sound. There was a perceptible current out in the river, and it hindered straight advancement. Inch by inch he crept on, expecting to hear the bang of rifles, the spattering of bullets. He <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> backward, but failed. The fire appeared a little dimmer, the moving shadows a little darker.|$|E
60|$|Feb. 23: What {{a rotten}} flight to-day. Small crowd {{out to see}} me off. No sooner up than trouble with plugs. Wanted to land, but nothing but bayous, rice fields, cane breaks, and marshes. Farmer shot at my machine. Soon motor stopped on me and had to come down awhooping on a small plowed field. Smashed landing gear and got an awful jar. Nothing serious though. It was two hours before a local {{blacksmith}} and I repaired chassis and cleaned plugs. I started off after coaching three scared darkies to hold the tail, while the blacksmith spun the propeller. He would give {{it a couple of}} bats, then dodge out of the way too soon, while I sat there and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> mad, which by gum I was plenty mad. Landed in this bum town, called ----, fourth in the race, and found sweet (?) refuge in this chills and fever hotel. Wish I was back in New Orleans. Cheer up, having others ahead of me in the race just adds a little zip to it. Watch me to-morrow. And I'm not the only hard luck artist. Aaron Solomons busted propeller and nearly got killed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! His success had not lessened my love. Though then I {{could have}} no hope,--though you were utterly removed from me,--all {{that could not}} change me. There it was,--as though my arm or my leg {{had been taken from}} me. It was bad to live without an arm or leg, but there was no help. I went on with my life and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a whipped cur;--though John from time to time would tell me that I failed. But now;--now that it has again all changed,--what would you have me do now? It may be that after all my limb may be {{restored}} to me, that I may be again as other men are, whole, and sound, and happy;--so happy! When it may possibly be within my reach am I not to look for my happiness?" [...] He paused, but she wept on without speaking a word. [...] "There are those who will say that I should wait till all these signs of woe have been laid aside. But why should I wait? There has come a great blot upon your life, and is it not well that it should be covered as quickly as possible?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes! her impetuosity; {{it is her}} misfortune, poor child! Barbara is so {{calm and}} resolute, that--that--" [...] Was Lady Jane really going to regret {{anything}} in her sister? She did not say it, however; but Kate heard her sigh, and add, [...] "Ah, well! if I were stronger, perhaps we could make her happier; but I am so nervous. I must <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> distressed when her spirits do break out, for perhaps it is only natural. And I am so sorry to have brought all this on her, and spoilt those poor children's pleasure!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because you {{expected}} to find a dead lover," [...] said her father, [...] "and you have found a living one, who can receive the tokens of your regard, and return them. Now, were it not a sin, I could find in my heart to thank Heaven that thou hast been surprised at last into owning thyself a woman. Simon Glover is <b>not</b> worthy <b>to</b> have an absolute saint for his daughter. Nay, look not so piteously, nor expect condolence from me! Only I will <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> merry, if you will be pleased to stop your tears, or confess them to be tears of joy." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} sick a-bed several days, {{for the first}} time in 21 years. How little {{confirmed}} invalids appreciate their advantages. I was able to read the English edition of the Greville Memoirs through without interruption, take my meals in bed, neglect all business without a pang, and smoke 18 cigars a day. I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back upon these 21 years with a feeling of resentment, and yet the partialities of Providence do seem to me to be slathered around (as one may say) without that gravity and attention to detail which the real importance of the matter would seem to suggest.|$|R
