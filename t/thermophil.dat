40|$|In {{terms of}} the 'Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz' accruing sludge of WWTP has to be minimized. Furthermore should the {{utilisation}} of matter and energy be preferred opposite to disposal. In the framework of this project the use of sludge for energy production at small and medium sized WWTP's has been investigated and the reduction of green house gas emission has been evaluated. For significant process steps within the wastewater and sludge treatment resulting potential of green house gas emission as been estimated. As one option in reducing this emission the anaerobe sludge stabilisation implicating use of bio gas can be applied. In this regard the mesophil and <b>thermophil</b> sludge digestion has been compared and evaluated. Emphasis {{has been put on}} the investigation with regard to amount of bio gas produced, degradation of organic matter, strain of process water and dewatering. Representative results have been derived from measures over a period of two years of a pilot plant using sludge of small and medium sized WWTP's. The investigation considered two-stage system i. e. mesophil/mesophil as well as thermophil/mesophil operation mode. Furthermore has the change from mesophil to <b>thermophil</b> operation mode been investigated for large WWTP's. For the pilot plant estimation for dimensioning have been developed considering significant aspects present at small and medium sized WWTP's. Finally has the anaerobe sludge stabilisation been economically evaluated allowing conclusions for similar systems in practice. (orig.)

The thermophile has been isolated from hot water spring at Cangar Batu Malang called CG- 10 isolate. The characteristic of CG- 10 are; bolt colony has a brown-white colour, rod form cels with size 6 - 14 µm and Gram positive. Identification with 16 S-rRNA gene of their isolate shows 98. 305 % similarity with B. caldoxylolyticus. The protease characteristic of CG- 10 isolate, fractionated by ammonium sulfate 35 % (w/v), centrifuged by 4000 rpm of speed for 15 minute, (1) has optimum temperature of 80 oC; (2) has optimum pH 8, (3) can survive until 60 minutes of incubation time at temperature 80 oC, (4) the molecule weight of: 60 - 76 kDa with pH 1 value between 7. 5 - 8. 20, (5) this protease is alkaline serine protease, and (6) Vmaks value 0. 622 unit menit - 1 and KM 9. 8 µmol/L, so this CG- 10 isolate protease can be use in detergent industry.   Keywords: Protease, <b>Thermophil...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{importance}} of proteins for the metabolic processes of living organisms has been recognized, there have {{from time to time}} been speculations as to what sort of protein could be present in those organisms which are known to grow and metabolize at temperatures above the coaguiation point of typical proteins. Since these thermophilic organisms engage in enzymatic activities at temperatures at which most enzymes from ordinary mesophilic forms are inactivated, it has been accepted as obvious by most of those who have considered the problem that they must contain heat-resistant enzyme proteins. The present investigation, in fact, was started with the ultimate aim of finding out in what ways such heat-resistant proteins differ from the more usual types. Although we do not know the nature of the difference between thermophilic and mesophific microbes, it is possible, from what is known about <b>thermophils,</b> to describe certain properties of this difference. In the first place, all the evidence which is available indicates that the metabolic processes of <b>thermophils</b> are essentially similar to those of mesophils.

40|$|SUMMARY: To {{approach}} reproducibility of mass {{cultures as}} sources of enzymes, the growth requirements of two mesophils belonging to BaciUus l i chen i fmis and B. Circulans, and three <b>thermophils</b> belonging to B. liehenifomis, B. circulans and B. steuro~hemmphilus, were determined in metal-buffered media. The mesophilic B. lichenifmis required glycerol or glucose, also alanine, aspartate, glycine, glutamate, arginine, histidine and lysine. Cytidylic acid or guanylic acid further increased growth; adenosine was inactive. The thermophilic B. lichenifomis required for good growth either glycerol, gluconate, or glucose, also succinate or glutamate; glutamate was replaceable by the combination of arginine + histidine + proline. In glycerol media, either mi-malate alone, or citrate plus either acetate or fumarate supported growth; neither acetate nor fumarate were effective by them-selves. In the absence of intermediates of the citric acid cycle, sodium bicarbonate {{or a combination of}} protogen + acetate allowed growth. With acetate present, protogen was replaceable by thiamine. The B. stearothmmophilus strain utilized glucose or sucrose; thiamine, biotin an...|$|R
40|$|The Mozzarella cheese {{market is}} growing rapidly. Major {{concerns}} with cheese meltability and color have arisen {{in the fast}} food industry. Pre starter culture {{was used in this}} study to improve the physical properties of Mozzarella cheese. Three tests (stretch test, melt test, and browning test) were modified to evaluate the quality of cheese. A stretch test using the Brookfield helipath viscometer to stretch the cheese sample at 60 °C was successful in distinguishing cheeses from different make procedures and from different proteolytic strains. A melt test using a glass tube to hold the cheese flow at 110 °C for 60 min was used to determine meltability of cheese. A chroma meter was used to measure color change after the cheese sample was subjected to boiling water for 60 min. The b* value was used to indicate the color change. Cheese made with Pre strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus stretched less but showed longer melting flow than that from Prt+ strains. Cheese made with Pre strains was lighter in color than cheese from Prt+ strains. An inverse relationship existed between stretchability and meltability. When mixed cultures of L. bulgaricus and Streptococcus <b>thermophil</b> us were used, the symbiotic interaction in acid production of Prt+ strains was more effective than mixed cultures of Prt- strains. Stretchability of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{mountains}} of north Croatia in <b>thermophil</b> oak wood grows a really nice blue-violet iris, which was considered as Iris germánica, which extended from the gardens to the natural habitats. But, with more carefully observation it was showed, that this plant from natural habitats is very much different from Iris germánica in consideration of stem’s ramification, of leafs length, and especially of more inflated spathes and of many characteristics in constitution and colour of flowers. This iris belongs to the new species from affinity Iris aphylla, so this species is described as Iris croatica, and we bring the description, the differences toward the congenial species, it variability and the distribution. The Latin diagnose with its essential characteristics {{is included in the}} Croatian text. Iris croatica distinguishes from many other subspecies and forms of I. aphylla s. 1. in the first way in the greatness of all parts of the plant, then with the number of flowers on the branches and with short, oval and very inflated spathes. The new iris shows many differences on the same locality depending if this plant has grown on the shallow stony soil, on the uncovered locality or on deeper soil in the scrub or in the bright small wood. This differences are phenotypical. But, this species is different also on the single localities, which include isolated populations with really expressive genotypic speciality. Based on this specialities we can distinguish several forms, but we must still determine if they are not the systematic unities of higher category. The Iris croatica is morphologically narrowly related to Iris aphylla. The same number of chromosoms, the morphology and geographical distribution shows their same origin. Iris aphylla is distributed from the Middle Europe on the west, along the north and southern margin of Carpathians and Pannonian basin, till Ukraine and Caucasus, from where reaches in Asia minor. New species of I. croatica on the contrary inhabits separated area in the north-western part of Croatia, and makes with the area of I. aphylla encircled unbroken ground of panonnian-pontic distribution. Iris croatica is developed in relict centar of tertiary vegetation, and in morphological view unites some characteristics of other forms of species I. aphylla, so we can it consider like probable origin of the whole group...|$|E
