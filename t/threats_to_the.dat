5|$|The main <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park's {{biodiversity}} are wood extraction {{and forest}} clearing for agriculture and pastures. A large {{issue is the}} rejection by some local inhabitants of the new park boundaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{springbok}} {{has been}} classified as least concern by the IUCN. No major <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long-term {{survival of the}} species are known. In fact, the springbok {{is one of the}} few antelope species with a positive population trend.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Scheuer said [...] "The Iranians are no <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States {{unless we}} provoke them. They {{may be a}} <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Israelis. They‘re not a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, inside the United States, comes from al Qaeda....These {{people are going to}} {{detonate}} a nuclear device inside the United States, and we're going to have absolutely nothing to respond against." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a speech}} given at a {{campaign}} event for Colorado Senate candidate Ken Buck on July 8, 2010, Tancredo said of President Barack Obama, [...] "... <b>the</b> greatest <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States today, <b>the</b> greatest <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> our liberty, <b>the</b> greatest <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Constitution of the United States, <b>the</b> greatest <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> {{our way of}} life; everything we believe in. <b>The</b> greatest <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country that our founding fathers put together is the man that's sitting in the White House today." ...|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{introduced}} feral {{dogs were}} a great <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species on Isabela, but they have since been eradicated from the island. Future introduction of rats or cats to Fernandina is a huge potential <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species. Fishing with nets poses a current <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species; this not only reduces {{the availability of the}} cormorant's food, but also often results in birds becoming caught in the nets and killed.|$|R
5|$|<b>Threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park include overuse, urban traffic, {{encroaching}} development, invasive flora, {{and lack}} of maintenance money. Occasional serious crimes and more frequent minor crimes occur in the park.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the main}} common <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park are glacier retreat {{due to global}} warming; {{hydropower}} projects; legal and illegal mining operations with low environmental standards; and loss of biodiversity to agricultural land and pastures (the latter mainly due to a conflict between the park purposes and the ancestral rights to the land by the locals).|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{significant}} and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a pipeline from Myanmar to Thailand may have a negative impact. <b>Threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Myanmar population are not well known.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Threat== Previously Inter{{national}} {{trade was}} major <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species, but {{current status of}} the trade is unknown. However, the local and national trades create <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species (in Nepal). The direct killing is <b>the</b> major <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species. Lack {{of knowledge about the}} species among local people is caused the most of killing the species as most of killing is not related to any good reason, apart from the use and trade. Negligence is root cause for <b>the</b> threat: negligence <b>to</b> stop <b>the</b> local trade, <b>to</b> aware <b>the</b> local people.Creation of Protected areas is insufficient for the species as most of potential habitat lies outside the protected areas and it is often found near to human settlement; this increase <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species.|$|R
2500|$|Alkanes also pose a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> environment. Branched alkanes {{have a lower}} {{biodegradability}} than unbranched alkanes. However, methane {{is ranked}} as the most dangerous greenhouse gas. Although the amount of methane in the atmosphere is low, it does pose a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> environment.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a federally}} listed {{endangered}} {{species of the}} United States, and an IUCN listed Critically endangered species. <b>The</b> main <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species survival has been off-roading, which is no longer permitted in its habitat. Trespassing off-roaders and campers are still a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> five remaining occurrences.|$|R
5|$|Illegal logging of {{precious}} hardwoods, such as rosewood and ebony, {{has become one}} of the greatest <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> silky sifaka's habitat, especially since the 2009 Malagasy political crisis. Its two largest protected areas, Masoala National Park and Marojejy National Park, have been the hardest hit. The disturbance caused by selective logging increases the likelihood of forest fires, helps invasive species take root, impairs habitat, and causes the loss of genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., Casey is {{informed}} by the National Security Director (Wendy Makkena) and CIA Director Langston Graham (Tony Todd) that the computer Bryce destroyed was a government database called the Intersect, which the NSA and CIA used as a joint resource to identify <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government. Casey is ordered {{to track down the}} recipient of Bryce's email in California.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} combat these <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world order, the United Nations has {{expanded}} its influence around the globe to form the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO). It is headquartered near New York City in a bunker beneath Liberty Island, placed there after a terrorist strike on the Statue of Liberty.|$|E

50|$|Alcatrazes Island is {{currently}} {{used as a}} Naval target practice area. Such activities are threatening the habitat of the island, which in turn poses a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species present on the island. Since this snake is known only from this area, habitat disturbance is a particular <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> population.|$|R
5|$|In the past, {{the site}} was {{threatened}} by garbage dumps or by passage of 4x4 vehicles or quads. The installation of gates by the municipality of Bavay solved the problem. Pedestrians rarely venture off the path. The anthropization is limited. The greatest <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species are primary succession and invasive plants.|$|E
5|$|Protecting insect {{habitats}} on farms, {{and planting}} native plants in cities benefit the house sparrow, as does establishing urban green spaces. To {{raise awareness of}} <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house sparrow, World Sparrow Day has been celebrated on 20 March across the world since 2010.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{say that}} asexual {{reproduction}} {{in the wild}} is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species. Species that rely solely on it risk extinction. Asexual reproduction {{may have contributed to}} the blue shark's decline off the Irish coast.|$|E

5|$|Since 1996, {{the status}} of the Ethiopian hare has beendata {{deficient}} on theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is because even though it is widespread species, very little is known about its status and ecology. The current state of its population trend is unclear. There are no known <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species. It occurs in the Abijatta-Shalla National Park and the Gambela National Park. It has also been found in the Baroye Controlled Hunting Area.|$|E
5|$|The 1964 General Assembly also passed {{legislation}} {{to draft a}} new state constitution. Thirty-eight citizens were chosen to draft the new document, {{which was based on}} national models. County leaders opposed the document because of perceived <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> independence of local governments and an apparent consolidation of power in Frankfort. Despite Breathitt's strong support, the proposed constitution was defeated by Kentucky voters by an overwhelming margin of 510,099 to 140,210.|$|E
5|$|The Florida panther {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} mammals on earth. About 50 live in the wild, primarily in the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp. The biggest <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> panther include habitat destruction from human development, vehicle collisions, inbreeding due to their limited gene pool, parasites, diseases, and mercury poisoning.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> main <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{species is}} habitat loss. Damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> habitat has {{occurred}} via development, {{the introduction of}} nonnative plants and animals, agriculture, recreational activity, and fire. Natural disasters such as hurricanes are also a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> habitat. This and other rare Hylaeus bee species were once [...] "widespread" [...] in Hawaii.|$|R

5|$|The {{jungle cat}} {{is listed as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Major <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jungle cat include habitat loss such as the {{destruction}} of wetlands, dam construction, environmental pollution, industrialisation and urbanisation. Illegal hunting is a threat in Turkey and Iran. Its rarity in Southeast Asia is possibly due {{to high levels of}} hunting.|$|E

5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
