40|$|Two precise, {{accurate}} and sensitive UV-Spectrophotometric methods were developed and validated for {{the determination of}} <b>Tiemonium</b> methylsulphate in presence of its degradation product, first derivative spectrophotometric method (1 D) and first derivative of ratio spectrophotometry (1 DD). Forced degradation study was performed using 2 N H 2 SO 4 on cold. For the first method; upon examining the first derivative spectra of the drug and its degradation product, it was noticed that <b>Tiemonium</b> methylsulphate can be determined at 250 nm with zero contribution of its degradation product. The linearity range was 5. 0 to 60. 0 μg/mL. The mean percentage recovery was 100. 17 ± 0. 622 %. For the second method, zero order spectra of the drug were divided by the spectrum of 40 μg/mL of the degradation product as a divisor then {{the first order of}} the ratio spectra was obtained using = 8 and scaling factor 10. The peak amplitudes of the first derivative of the ratio spectra were measured at 250 nm. The linearity range was 5. 0 to 60. 0 μg/mL and the mean percentage recovery was 100. 51 ± 0. 982 %. Statistical comparison between the results obtained by these methods and those obtained by the manufacturer's method was done, and no significance difference was obtained...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThree ion {{selective}} electrodes {{were developed}} for the quantification of <b>Tiemonium</b> methylsulphate (TIM). Two of these sensors involve the construction of water insoluble ion-association complexes; namely sensor 1 TIM-phosphotungstate (TIM-PT) and sensor 2 TIM-Reinecke (TIM-R). Molecular recognition elements have extensive applications in electrochemical sensors with a significant potential for future development thus a third electrode utilizing molecularly imprinted polymer was constructed; sensor 3 TIM-MIP. The proposed sensors showed fast, stable Nernstian responses of 56. 4, 56. 1 and 57. 5 mV/decade for sensors 1, 2 and 3, respectively, across a relatively wide TIM concentration range (1 × 10 − 4 to 1 × 10 − 2 molL− 1 for sensors 1 and 2 and 1 × 10 – 5 to 1 × 10 – 2 molL− 1 for sensor 3) in the pH range of 2 – 7. Sensor 1 and sensor 2 {{can be used for}} five weeks while sensor 3 for 65 days without a significant change in sensitivity. The suggested method was used to determine TIM in dosage forms. No measurable difference was obtained when the result statistically compared with respect to accuracy and precision with reported HPLC method...|$|E
40|$|Effect of <b>tiemonium</b> iodide (Visceralgine) on normal {{ureteral}} contractile {{activity was}} studied on 15 human subjects (25 ureters) {{by means of}} strain gauge manometer. The clinical effect, especially, of subsiding pain by this agent was also studied in 41 urological patients. For the former study, 5 mg (8 cases) or 10 mg (7 cases) of Visceralgine were administered intramuscularly. The following results were obtained. 1) In 3 cases (one with 5 mg; two with 10 mg), irregular spastic contraction of the ureter was released, resulting in normal pattern (Fig. 1, 4 and 5). 2) In 2 cases (both with 10 mg), spastic contractile waves became more regular than before. 3) In 2 cases (both with 10 mg), ureteral contraction stopped for several minutes after administration, followed by accelerated contractions, rather (Fig. 6 and 7). Efficacy rate of Visceralgine for urological use {{was found to be}} approximately 70 % in most of the reports. According to our study on 41 patients, the efficacy rate of this drug was 70. 7 %. Visceralgine was particularly effective for 62. 5 % of vesico-urethral irritability. No side-effect was observed...|$|E

40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of active}} ingredients (AI) in drugs {{is a crucial}} and important step in the drug quality control process. This is usually performed by using wet chemical techniques like LC-MS, UV spectrophotometry and other appropriate organic analytical methods. However, if the active ingredient contains specific heteroatoms (F, S, Cl…), elemental IBA like PIXE and PIGE techniques, using small tandem accelerator of 1 - 2 MV, can be explored for molecular quantification. IBA techniques permit {{the analysis of the}} sample under solid form, without any laborious sample preparations. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of the Thick Target PIXE technique for rapid and accurate quantification of both low and high concentrations of active ingredients in different commercial drugs. Fenofibrate, a chlorinated active ingredient, is present in high amounts in two different commercial drugs, its quantification was done using the relative approach to an external standard. On the other hand, <b>Tiemonium</b> methylsulfate which exists in relatively low amount in commercial drugs, its quantification was done using GUPIX simulation code (absolute quantification) The experimental aspects related to the quantification validity (use of external standards, absolute quantification, matrix effect, [...] .) are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigations}} was to determine the catalytic activity of chiral ligands and reagents and utilize the methodologies in pharmaceutical and drug industries. Although, extensive investigations on asymmetric catalysis have been reported, but most of these systems are complicated. For instance, in chapter 1, a brief idea about chirality, asymmetric catalysis and their growing importance in pharmaceutical and drug industries was described. In organic chemistry, conjugate addition was most widely useful method for carbon-carbon bond formation; as a result catalytic asymmetric addition of organozinc reagents to unsaturated carbonyl compounds represents one of important approach. In chapter 2, a new series of tridentate P,N,O ligands having hard and soft donor atoms derived from chiral amino alcohols were developed and employed in the Cu(II) -catalyzed conjugate addition of diethylzinc to substituted chalcones. The asymmetric additions to a variety of substituted chalcones afforded products in excellent yields with excellent enantioselectivities up to 97 % ee. Accordingly, the absence of efficient and highly enantioselective methods to prepare chiral tertiary alcohols is a long-standing problem for organic chemists. In chapter 3, part I, we report a novel asymmetric addition of vinyl group to ketones using vinylaluminum reagents catalyzed by in situ prepared Ti(OiPr) 4 complexes of (S) -BINOL to afford diversified tertiary allylic alochols. Varieties of aromatic ketones bearing either an electron-donating or an electron-withdrawing substituent on aromatic ring were examined to afford products in excellent enantioselectivities up to 98 % ee with high yields. A 10 -fold scale-up reaction afforded the product in a similar yield with a comparable enantioselectivity. More importantly, additions of a variety of vinyl reagents including functionalized vinyls were demonstrated, affording tertiary allylic alcohols with good to excellent enantioselectivities up to 96 % ee. Finally, (S) -tiemonium iodide, a tertiary thienyl alcohol, is well known for its biological activity as well as key sub-structures in bioactive compounds and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, in chapter 3, part II, a novel direct asymmetric catalytic thienylaluminum addition to ketones catalyzed by in situ-prepared Ti(OiPr) 4 complexes of (S) -BINOL and (R) -BINOL was described. The results showed that the catalytic system worked excellently for aromatic ketones including either an electron-donating or an electron-withdrawing substituent to afford up to 97 % ee with high yields. Importantly, a concise synthesis of (S) -tiemonium iodide using this methodology from the commercially available benzene and 3 -bromopropionyl chloride in 4 steps.
