40|$|To {{ensure a}} high {{signal-to-noise}} power ratio at the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>receiver,</b> the power amplifier aboard the satellite often works {{close to its}} saturation point. Unfortunately, this operating point also adds non-linear distortions in the communication channel. The literature proposes several digital equalizers to compensate for this channel. But their complexity makes their digital implementation difficult in particular for high bandwidth communications. Analog equalizers are an interesting solution to reduce the equalizer complexity. Here we numerically demonstrate that a dedicated analog optoelectronic implementation based on the Echo State Network paradigm can reach state-of-the-art performance of digital equalizers, while reducing the required resolution of the analog-to-digital converters. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Most {{satellites}} in a low-Earth orbit (LEO) with demanding {{requirements on}} precise orbit determination (POD) {{are equipped with}} on-board receivers to collect the observations from Global Navigation Satellite systems (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). Limiting factors for LEO POD are nowadays mainly encountered with the modeling of the carrier phase observations, where a precise knowledge of the phase center location of the GNSS antennas {{is a prerequisite for}} high-precision orbit analyses. Since 5 November 2006 (GPS week 1400), absolute instead of relative values for the phase center location of GNSS receiver and transmitter antennas are adopted in the processing standards of the International GNSS Service (IGS). The absolute phase center modeling is based on robot calibrations for a number of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>receiver</b> antennas, whereas compatible antenna models were subsequently derived for the remaining <b>terrestrial</b> <b>receiver</b> antennas by conversion (from relative corrections), and for the GNSS transmitter antennas by estimation. However, consistent receiver antenna models for space missions such as GRACE and TerraSAR-X, which are equipped with non-geodetic receiver antennas, are only available since a short time from robot calibrations. We use GPS data of the aforementioned LEOs of the year 2007 together with the absolute antenna modeling to assess the presently achieved accuracy from state-of-the-art reduced-dynamic LEO POD strategies for absolute and relative navigation. Near-field multipath and cross-talk with active GPS occultation antennas turn out to be important and significant sources for systematic carrier phase measurement errors that are encountered in the actual spacecraft environments. We assess different methodologies for the in-flight determination of empirical phase pattern corrections for LEO receiver antennas and discuss their impact on POD. By means of independent K-band measurements, we show that zero-difference GRACE orbits can be significantly improved from about 10 to 6 mm K-band standard deviation when taking empirical phase corrections into account, and assess the impact of the corrections on precise baseline estimates and further applications such as gravity field recovery from kinematic LEO positions...|$|E
40|$|Time {{transfer}} from a GPS satellite to a receiver {{fixed on the}} surface of the rotating Earth is investigated. Using experimentally confirmed GPS light signal transfer time and a simple kinematic calculation, light speed variation is demonstrated for light travelling between the satellite and the ground-based receiver. This variable speed is also determined using classical principles applied to light transmission relative to the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>receiver</b> moving as a result of the rotating Earth, all within the Earth-Centred Inertial (ECI) frame. These results produce the accurate time transfer algorithm without any correction and lead to the re-interpretation of the “Sagnac correction” considered by the ITU to be a necessary time correction in GPS time transfer. They also lead to a revision of the Lorentz Transformations that yields the Selleri Transformations which better accord with the observed light speed variation and confirmed relativistic phenomena in the physical world...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{preliminary}} experimental {{results of a}} collaborative research project to determine the feasibility of using AM-radio broadcasts of opportunity for aircraft detection at ranges of thousands of kilometers from a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>receiver.</b> This passive over-the-horizon (OTH) radar concept exploits the unique property of high frequency (HF) signals to allow coverage over very long distances by virtue of skywave propagation.

This system explicitly utilizes the AM-carrier component for proof-of-concept and takes full advantage of fast and robust processing schemes to enable real-time practical implementation. Remarkably, it is shown that aircraft target detection and angle-Doppler parameter estimation is feasible at ranges of thousands of kilometers using conventional processing schemes and modest antenna apertures.

40|$|Purpose: 1) {{to develop}} {{a model of a}} {{communication}} channel of an unmanned aerial vehicle "UAV-Ground station" with adaptive modulation and orthogonal frequency division of channels; 2) to calculate the channel parameters with different types of fading for different levels of satellite transponder nonlinearity. Method: MATLAB Simulink software was used to simulate the channel operation. Results: Based on the IEEE 802. 16 d standard, a realistic model of the communication channel of the unmanned aerial vehicle "UAV-Ground Station" was developed, which is used to estimate the channel parameters. The channel model with adaptive modulation consists of a source of information, a transmitter, a downlink channel with fading, and a terrestrial station receiver. Dependences of the signal-to-noise ratio of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>receiver</b> on the signal-to-noise ratio in the channel down for different types of nonlinearity of the unmanned aerial transmitter, various modulations (BPSK, QPSK, 16 QAM, 64 QAM), various types of fading are obtained. The signal constellations of the received signals for different Doppler frequency shifts are compared. Conclusion: The developed model allows determining the conditions under which the channel is "open" for a given type of a modulation and a data rate. The proposed approach can be considered as a method for estimating the parameters of the satellite communication channel of an unmanned aerial vehicle with fading. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: {{to develop}} {{a model of the}} {{satellite}} communication channel for an remotely piloted air system with adaptive modulation and orthogonal frequency division of channels; 2) to calculate the channel parameters with Rayleigh fading and various types of satellite transponder nonlinearity; 3) analyze the effect of fading and the type of nonlinearity on the parameters of the satellite communication channel. Method: MATLAB Simulink software was used to simulate the channel operation. Results: For the first time, based on the IEEE 802. 16 d standard, a realistic model of the satellite communication channel of an unmanned aerial vehicle was developed, which is used to estimate the channel parameters. The created model takes into account the Rayleigh fading in the downlink and the nonlinearity of the satellite transponder amplifier. Dependences of the signal-to-noise ratio in the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>receiver</b> on the signal-to-noise ratio in the downlink for various types of modulation (BPSK, QPSK, 16 QAM, 64 QAM) and data transmission rates are obtained. The nonlinearity of satellite amplifiers was analyzed {{on the basis of a}} linear model, a cubic polynomial model, a hyperbolic tangential model, the Gorbani model, and the Rapp model. The results for the cubic polynomial model and the hyperbolic tangential model are similar to the linear model, but differ significantly from the Gorbani model and the Rapp model. For the Gorbani and Rapp models, very low values of the signal-to-noise ratio in the receiver are observed. Conclusion: The proposed approach can be considered as a method of estimating the parameters of the satellite communication channel of an unmanned aerial vehicle with fading. It is shown how the type of modulation varies depending on the level of the signal-to-noise ratio and the type of fading. The developed model allows to predict the operation of the channel with Rayleigh fading and can be useful for the design of communication systems. </p...|$|E

50|$|Digital Audio Broadcasting in Ireland is {{one form}} of digital radio {{transmission}} in the state. It was launched to the public on 30 November 2006, with trials taking place in 1998, 2001 and 2006. Currently, 56% of Ireland's population - mainly in Counties Cork, Limerick and the North East - can receive permanent DAB services. Geographic coverage on a portable or car radio is much less. In contrast, all the RTE stations on the DAB multiplex are also available nationwide via Saorsat and about 99% geographic coverage is possible via DVB. Generic DVB receivers do need mains, but are typically cheaper than DAB radios. Many portable DAB radio sets have 1/10th to 1/50th of the running time of an AM/FM set, typically giving only 6 hours use.

50|$|Beacons {{operating}} on 121.5 and 243.0 MHz only simply transmit an anonymous siren tone, and thus carry no information to SAR agencies.
