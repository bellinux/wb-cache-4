25|$|In 1985, a US {{specification}} {{model was}} produced by the factory, with styling changes to allow bumpers <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>US</b> federal safety standards. Many owners, however, had those bumpers removed immediately, or never had them installed at all, as the bulky looking addition to the car was said to ruin the otherwise smooth lines of the body. The 1985 US model had a base price close to $100,000. Only two optional extras were available: a $5,500 aerodynamic spoiler and a $7,500 sound system.|$|E

25|$|By 1935, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) had {{received}} two extension requests for U.S. Route 93 south {{of what was}} then its southern terminus in Glendale, Nevada. Arizona State Highway Engineer T.S. O'Connell requested US 93 extend southwest into California <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>US</b> 99 in El Centro. At a later time, he reconsidered and sent a second request for US 93 multiplex with US 466 over the new Boulder Dam into Arizona and end at US 66 in Kingman. This created a conflict, leading to both proposals being accidentally denied. After a misunderstanding regarding the conflicting proposals from O'Connell, the second proposal was re-evaluated and approved. Thus, US 93 was extended into Arizona. In 1936, the Arizona Highway Department began exploring {{the possibility of a}} further extension of US 93. The first extension proposal called for US 93 to end in Phoenix, being extended from Kingman by way of US 66 through Ash Fork. A new US 193 was proposed from Phoenix through Sacaton and Casa Grande to Picacho. At the time, US 89 served the road between Ash Fork and Phoenix, while State Route 87, State Route 187 and State Route 84 ran between Sacaton and Picacho through Casa Grande (of which only SR 87 still traverses today).|$|E

The roadway then turns southward, and after intersecting Santa Maria River Road, it crosses the Santa Maria River and turns slightly southeastward. Through a hilly area, SR 96 turns eastward and passes {{through a series of}} hairpin turns. The highway ends at the west end of CR 15 at the intersection with Hillside Road.

2500|$|The GTO was {{assembled}} by GM's Holden subsidiary at Elizabeth.

GM Engineers benchmarked the sound of the 1964 GTO held in the Pontiac historical collection, as well as other LS1-powered vehicles, while working with the exhaust vendor to tune the system. The effort was made to make the new GTO invoke the same sound as the original while still meeting the noise threshold required by some states. The 2004 GTO exhaust was a true dual system that followed the original Monaro exhaust routing, thus both tailpipes exited on the driver side of the vehicle. General Motors claimed performance of 5.3 seconds to 60 and a 13.8 second quarter mile time, which was closely verified by several magazine tests.|$|E
