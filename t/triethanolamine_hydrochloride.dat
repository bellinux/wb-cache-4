40|$|The (solid + liquid) phase equilibria of <b>triethanolamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> ([HTEA]Cl) {{ionic liquid}} and aqueous {{hydrochloric}} acid solutions with concentrations from (0 to 8. 37) mol. kg(- 1) {{were determined by}} a dynamic method within the temperature range of (285. 70 to 344. 65) K. Solubilities of [HTEA]Cl were found to increase with increasing temperature for all the investigated solutions. However, solubilities of [HTEA]Cl in aqueous hydrochloric acid decrease with the increment of the concentration of the acid due to the common ion effect. K-SP Values of [HTEA]Cl were obtained by use of the solubility data of [HTEA]Cl in water. The modified Apelblat equation was used successfully to correlate experimental data of solubilities in hydrochloric acid. Molar dissolution enthalpy Delta//(Sol) of [HTEA]Cl in hydrochloric acid solutions was determined with the newly obtained Apelblat equation parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{metastable}} zone widths (MZWs) of <b>triethanolamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> ([HTEA]Cl), {{defined as}} the maximum temperature difference Delta T(max) a solution can withstand before crystallization of a solid phase, in water, ethanol-water, and HCl-water mixed solvents have been determined at a saturation temperature T(0) range from 293. 15 to 303. 15 K with cooling rate R from 3 to 8 K. h(- 1). Solubilities of [HTEA]Cl in ethanol water mixtures have also been obtained using a dynamic method. An equation of MZW with similar form to Sangwal's equation {{was derived from the}} fundamental driving force of crystallization based on chemical potential. With the newly obtained equation, the experimental values of MZW Delta T(max) for [HTEA]Cl-water system at 298. 15 K was correlated with the cooling rate R by ln(Delta T(max) /T(0)) = - 6. 140 + 1. 222 ln R. The enthalpy of mixing Delta H(mix) was calculated with the solubility data, and the result of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For [HTEA]Cl-water system, the value of -Delta H(mix) was determined to be 30. 88 kJ. mol(- 1), and the addition of both HCl and ethanol led to a decrease of -Delta H(mix). The experimental results also showed that MZW could be greatly enhanced when ethanol and HCl were added. It was found that the values of MZW decrease with -Delta H(mix) for both [HTEA]Cl-ethanol-water and [HTEA]Cl-HCl-water systems at the same saturation temperature and cooling rate...|$|E
