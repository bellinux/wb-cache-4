5|$|Downloadable content (DLC) was {{initially}} {{not part of}} the development team's plans. <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> began development later in development, when the main game's visual theme had been finalized. Only the core developers were involved in creating <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link,</b> though development on the DLC did not take a high priority for some time as it would take resources away from the development of Human Revolution. Director Jean-François Dugas, producer David Anfossi, and art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête all returned to their previous roles. The main designer was Antoine Thisdale. Main writer Mary DeMarle returned to write the scenario, alongside supplementary writer and author James Swallow. Additional music was composed for <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> by the game's composer Michael McCann. He wanted to include music from the DLC in the game's , but recording for the release was already complete, and scheduling conflicts prevented him from including any music in the soundtrack. Despite this, he still wished to release the DLC soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The DLC was {{included}} {{as part of}} Feral Interactive's port for OS X, released on April 26, 2012. <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> was subsequently included with other additional content in the director's cut edition of the base game, released on its original platforms and Wii U. The port's developers applied the technical and gameplay enhancements first developed for <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> to Human Revolution. The director's cut was released on October 25, 2013 for PC, Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii U. An OS X port, again handled by Feral Interactive, was released on April 16, 2014.|$|E

5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as <b>the</b> <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral girdle, furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> {{provided}} an opportunity for improving the visuals and gameplay. The visuals were given more contrast, so objects stood out more. Improvements to the lighting was a major focus for the team. The game's engine was also improved, along with character animations and facial movement. Due to the relatively small size of the DLC environment, developers {{did not need to}} focus on a raised concern in the main game about repeating character faces and voices. An element that had been generally criticized by both critics and players of the original game was the boss fights, which had been outsourced to Grip Entertainment and consequently did not follow the player-driven gameplay style {{of the rest of the}} game, instead focusing heavily on action. While a boss fight was included in <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link,</b> it was entirely developed in-house by Eidos Montréal staff and allowed for a variety of solution for defeating the boss, including non-lethal options.|$|E
5|$|Initially unplanned, <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> was {{developed}} by Human Revolutions core staff, including producer David Anfossi, director Jean-François Dugas, writer Mary DeMarle, and composer Michael McCann. The story {{was designed as a}} standalone experience, partially due to the technical and aesthetic improvements the team had made. A boss battle was designed to allow for multiple solutions, in contrast to the limited action-based approaches of the main game's boss fights. Reception was generally positive: despite some mixed opinions on the story, praise was given to the improved visuals and gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Plans for DLC {{were first}} {{announced}} in August 2010, with it being planned {{as an extension}} of the game. The developers initially did not plan for DLC, with it beginning development later in the game's production when the visual theme was finalized. Despite using only core team members, development was slow due to the main focus being on Human Revolution. For <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link,</b> the team improved the lighting, gameplay mechanics, player freedom, and character animation. The DLC was developed entirely at Eidos Montréal, and this gave the team the opportunity of developing a boss fight with multiple solutions, something they regretted not being able to do with the main game.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a DLC {{were first}} {{announced}} in 2010 at that year's Gamescom event, {{where it was}} stated {{that it would be}} an extension to the main narrative. It was later teased by Eidos Montréal through cryptic clues on their website, eventually revealing the DLC one month after the main game's release. <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> was released on October 18, 2011 on Steam for Microsoft Windows personal computers(PC), Xbox Live for Xbox 360, and October 19 on PlayStation Network (PSN) for PlayStation 3. In Japan, the console versions of the DLC were released on March 7, 2012 for PSN and March 20 for Xbox Live.|$|E

There have been subsequent improvements to the road, such as the conversion of the Grass Valley portion of the route to freeway standards.|$|E
30|$|Data augmentation—Wikipedia {{document}} embeddings {{performed better}} than sentence embeddings. However, one major {{limitation of this}} approach is that many links between WordNet concepts and Wikipedia articles could not be recovered from LOD data. Only 60 % of visual classes were successfully matched to a Wikipedia article. Hence, we manually recovered <b>the</b> <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> for <b>the</b> 2 -hop set (623 missing classes), but we did not recover <b>the</b> <b>missing</b> <b>links</b> for classes of larger test splits as manual linking is very time consuming.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Destructoid's Maurice Tan enjoyed the story despite it not adding {{anything to the}} overall experience of Human Revolution and noted that the major choices lacked impact. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more to plug the main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive moments and strong voice acting. Official Xbox Magazines Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found the plot undermined by the villain and some poor dialogue. Tom Francis of PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the story as a whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. <b>The</b> <b>missing</b> <b>link</b> was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|Full focus shifted onto <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but instead be a self-contained experience that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible through the main menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience jarring for players.|$|E

5|$|In {{his review}} of the Director's Cut, IGN's Brian Albert, despite noting {{inconsistencies}} in enemy behavior, shared much of his praised with the original version {{in addition to the}} added gameplay mechanics and improved boss battles. GameSpot's VanOrd again noted dated facial animations and poor AI, but generally praised other aspects of the Director's Cut, particularly pointing out the improvements to boss battles. Bramwell, again writing for Eurogamer, particularly praised the revamped boss battles and the inclusion of additional content such as <b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> that did not function properly as a standalone release. He also echoed much of his praise for the original game. Michael Gapper of Official Nintendo Magazine stated that all the changes made to the game for the Director's Cut had improved it for the better, praising its gameplay balance and freedom of choice in addition to the new features.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Link</b> {{takes place}} during the events of Human Revolution: after staging an {{explosion}} in the docks of Hengsha, Adam Jensen smuggles himself on board a ship bound for a secret research base inside a cryosleep pod. Adam is discovered and captured aboard the ship. Two Belltower commanders, Pieter Burke and Netanya Keitner, torture him for information on his identity. After the EMP chair holding him captive mysteriously deactivates, Adam is able to retrieve his equipment {{with the help of an}} unknown hacker who contacts him via radio. The ship docks at Rifleman Bank Station, a seaborne regional Belltower supply hub. After escaping into the station, Adam discovers that it was Keitner who set him free. Disillusioned with the unethical nature of local Belltower operations, she wants Adam to find concrete proof of illegal research that she can use to deliver to Interpol. She also instructs Adam to obtain weaponry from Garvin Quinn, resident technician and black market weapons trader.|$|E
5|$|The missing {{connection}} between US 1 and MD 295 {{resulted in a}} circuitous path for traffic between I-95 and BWI Airport. In 1974, that route involved exiting I-95 at MD 100, which then served as a connector between the Interstate and US 1. Traffic took US 1 south to MD 176, then took MD 176 east to MD 295 and north to {{the western end of}} MD 46. Construction on <b>the</b> <b>missing</b> <b>link,</b> which by then was planned as part of I-195, began in 1987, when the highway's bridges over US 1 and I-895 were constructed. The remainder of the highway from MD 295 to the I-895 overpass was completed, including reconstruction of the interchange with MD 295, and the intermediate section opened in June 1990. The I-195 designation was applied to the highway's present length at the same time, and MD 166 was truncated to its present southern terminus. In 2002, as part of an expansion project at the airport, several new ramps were constructed to access parking lots and facilitate an easier U-turn for motorists leaving the terminal who wish to return to the terminal. In 2015, the eastern terminus of I-195 was cut back from the BWI Airport to the MD 170 interchange, with the section of road between those two points becoming MD 995A.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> {{formed in}} early 1964 in Sydney, Australia with the line-up of Peter Anson on guitar, Dave Boyne on guitar, Bob Brady on vocals, Danny Cox on drums and Ron Peel on bass guitar (ex-Mystics). With their long hair, {{according}} to one venue owner, [...] "they looked {{like a cross between}} man and ape" [...] and so were named, <b>the</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> (see transitional fossil). In November, the group played a benefit concert to support Oz founders, Richard Neville, Richard Walsh and Martin Sharp. The trio had been charged with obscenity and were awaiting trial.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Missing</b> <b>Links</b> have {{influenced}} many later Australian punk and hard rock groups, including The Saints who covered [...] "Wild About You" [...] {{on their first}} album, (I'm) Stranded (1977).

[...] In 1965 they released records under two completely different lineups within the space of one year. [...] They {{were one of the}} first rock groups to experiment with backward tapes and would do so in 1965, on both sides of their single, [...] "H'tuom Tuhs," [...] almost a year before the Beatles' experiments during the Revolver sessions.|$|R
