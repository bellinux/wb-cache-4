25|$|<b>That</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> as {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, {{in the sense}} that I believe that Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality of the world and that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1935 {{letter to}} her son, Picasso's mother said: [...] "They {{tell me that you}} write. I can believe {{anything}} of you. If one day they tell me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> mass, I shall believe it just the same." [...] That same year André Breton wrote about Picasso's poetry for the French artistic and literary journal Cahiers d'Art, wherein Breton exclaimed that: [...] "Whole pages appear in bright variegated hues like a parrots' feathers." [...] Penrose describes how [...] "..words have been applied as a painter uses colour from his brush." ...|$|E
2500|$|Depp {{stated in}} a BBC radio {{interview}} on July 29, 2013 {{that he hopes}} {{to be involved with}} [...] "quieter things" [...] {{at some point in the}} near future, implying that he will retire from acting. Depp explained in further detail during the interview: [...] "I wouldn't say I'm dropping out any second, but I would say it's probably not too far away. When you add up the amount of dialogue <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> per year and you realise that you've said written words more than you've had a chance to say your own words, you start thinking about that as an insane option for a human being." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1816 Field {{accepted}} a commission as {{judge of the}} Supreme Court of Civil Judicature of NSW, and arrived in Sydney on 24 February 1817. Governor Macquarie, writing to Under-secretary Goulburn in April thanked him [...] "for making me acquainted with Mr Field's character. He appears to be everything <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> of him and I am very much prejudiced in his favour already from his mild modest and conciliating manners, and I am persuaded he will prove a great acquisition and blessing to this colony". Field was soon at work framing the necessary [...] "Rules of Practice and Regulations for conducting the Proceedings of the Court". His salary was £800 a year with a residence, government servants, and rations for himself.|$|E
2500|$|... "'Martin,' said he, 'there {{is no one}} of the heresies {{which have}} torn the bosom of the church, which has not derived its origin from the various {{interpretation}} of the Scripture. The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments. It was with Biblical texts that Pelagius and Arius maintained their doctrines. Arius, for instance, found the negation of the eternity of the Word—an eternity which you admit, in this verse of the New Testament—Joseph knew not his wife till she had brought forth her first-born son; and he said, {{in the same way}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> that this passage enchained him. When the fathers of the Council of Constance condemned this proposition of John Huss—The church of Jesus Christ is only the community of the elect, they condemned an error; for the church, like a good mother, embraces within her arms all who bear the name of Christian, all who are called to enjoy the celestial beatitude.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|All groups talk a {{particular}} language. Thus begins the fifth essay of the book. It {{is the natural}} way of things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> something one way which the lawyer says another way. Same with doctors. A doctor who can only talk like a text book may leave you in serious doubt as to your state of health, Sykes says. Same with sailors, same with all other craftsmen. Then he comments from Shakespeare, for whom language was a vast instrument at his command, {{to what he calls}} the irrational little vocabulary of the movements of fashion: newspaper fashion, pub fashion, cinema fashion, popular song fashion. But, for this English author, the great, the most desired fashion has always been that of “the best society,” of “the fashionable”, of “the chic”, which is kept by snobbism. After further analyzing the use of U and non-U habits and its progress, reflecting either by stress or reaction the mood of any time. Pursuing his argument he introduces Topivity — T-manners and T-customs etc., meaning the likely social conventions of a remote future in which the peerage has survived by infiltrating the trade union movement on a large scale. Abandoning [...] "U", he ends the article with [...] "T" [...] stating that one big T-point remains constant: nobody wants a really poor peer: it is very un-T not to be rich. However, T and non-T do not seem to have become popular though.|$|E
