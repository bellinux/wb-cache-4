40|$|Accurate {{and timely}} {{predictions}} of airline pushbacks can potentially lead to improved performance of automated decision-support tools for airport surface traffic, thus reducing the variability and average duration of costly airline delays. One factor which affects {{the realization of}} these benefits {{is the level of}} uncertainty inherent in the turn processes. To characterize this inherent uncertainty, three techniques are developed for predicting time-to-go until pushback as a function of available ground-time; elapsed ground-time; and the status (not-started/in-progress/completed) of individual turn processes (cleaning, fueling, etc.). These techniques are tested against a large and detailed dataset covering approximately l 0 (exp 4) real-world <b>turn</b> <b>operations</b> obtained through collaboration with Deutsche Lufthansa AG. Even after the dataset is filtered to obtain a sample of <b>turn</b> <b>operations</b> with minimal uncertainty, the standard deviation of forecast error for all three techniques is lower-bounded away from zero, indicating that <b>turn</b> <b>operations</b> have a significant stochastic component.

40|$|Most of the {{engineering}} parts are made from metal based materials. Composites have recently become an economic alternative to traditional materials like metals due to their considerable advantages especially in high specific strength and specific stiffness. But, turning of composites is different from turning conventional metals because of the inhomogeneity and anisotropic characteristics of composites. It also depends on the diversity of fiber and matrix properties, fiber orientation, and the relative volume of matrix and fibers. During a <b>turning</b> <b>operation,</b> vibration and noise are generated {{as a result of}} the interaction between the rotating work piece and moving cutting force. Therefore, there is a need to understand the dynamic behaviour of composites during machining particularly turning.

30|$|Recently, some meta-heuristic {{methods can}} provide better {{solutions}} for various manufacturing optimisation problems. The objectives of multi-pass <b>turning</b> and single-pass <b>operation</b> optimisations are significantly different. Multi-pass <b>turning</b> <b>operations</b> finally finish {{the surface to}} achieve the desired condition. The single-pass operation intends to gain the highest possible material removal rate (MRR) under various machining performance measures. The minimum cost, maximum MRRs, longer tool life, a lower cutting force, and better surface roughness {{are affected by the}} actual combination of cutting parameters. Both objectives of minimising total production cost and minimising machining time are considered quite often in related mathematical models in literatures. There are various cutting constraints considered in machining <b>operations.</b> In <b>turning</b> <b>operations,</b> either single or multiple passes are used for a cutting process. For economic reasons, multiple pass turning is preferable over the single pass turning in almost industries. Machining models consist of some parameters such as machining time, metal removal rate, tool waste and tool life. Several researchers have investigated the optimisation of cutting parameters in <b>turning</b> <b>operations</b> with a variety of models. The machining parameters have been determined by various methods. They consist of conventional modes of deterministic, probabilistic or dynamic programming method (Ermer and Patel 1974). However, these traditional optimisation methods may not be robust due to various complications of multiple constraints and passes. Their solutions are not ideal for solving machining optimisation problems because they tend to obtain a local optimal solution. Thus, meta-heuristic algorithms and their hybridisations have developed for solving machining problems due to their power in searching for a global optimum.|$|R
