This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.|$|E

25|$|In {{his later}} years, however, Rockwell began {{receiving}} more attention {{as a painter}} when he chose more serious subjects such as the series on racism for Look magazine. One example of this more serious work is <b>The</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>We</b> All Live With, which dealt {{with the issue of}} school racial integration. The painting depicts a young black girl, Ruby Bridges, flanked by white federal marshals, walking to school past a wall defaced by racist graffiti. This painting was displayed in the White House when Bridges met with President Obama in 2011.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s {{the marshals}} {{were on the}} front lines of the civil rights movement, mainly {{providing}} protection to volunteers. In September 1962, President John F. Kennedy ordered 127 marshals to accompany James Meredith, an African American who wished to register at the segregated University of Mississippi. Their presence on campus provoked riots at the university, but the marshals stood their ground, and Meredith registered. Marshals provided continuous protection to Meredith during his first year at Ole Miss, and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy later proudly displayed a deputy marshal's dented helmet in his office. U.S. Marshals also protected black schoolchildren integrating public schools in the South. Artist Norman Rockwell's famous painting <b>The</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>We</b> All Live With depicted a tiny Ruby Bridges being escorted by four towering United States Marshals in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Norman Perceval Rockwell (February 3, 1894 – November 8, 1978) was a 20th-century American author, {{painter and}} illustrator. His works {{have a broad}} popular appeal in the United States for their {{reflection}} of American culture. Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine over nearly five decades. Among the best-known of Rockwell's works are the Willie Gillis series, Rosie the Riveter, <b>The</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>We</b> All Live With, Saying Grace, and the Four Freedoms series. He also is noted for his 64-year relationship with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), during which he produced covers for their publication Boys' Life, calendars, and other illustrations. These works include popular images that reflect the Scout Oath and Scout Law such as The Scoutmaster, A Scout is Reverent and A Guiding Hand, among many others.|$|E

2500|$|The {{painting}} was originally published as a centerfold in the January 14, 1964 issue of Look. [...] Rockwell had ended {{his contract with}} the Saturday Evening Post the previous year due to frustration with the limits the magazine placed on his expression of political themes, and Look offered him a forum for his social interests, including civil rights and racial integration. Rockwell explored similar themes in Southern Justice (Murder in Mississippi) and New Kids in the Neighborhood; unlike his previous works for the Post, <b>The</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>We</b> All Live With and these others place black people as sole protagonists, instead of as observers, part of group scenes, or in servile roles. Like New Kids in the Neighborhood, <b>The</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>We</b> All Live With depicts a black child protagonist; like Southern Justice, it uses strong light-dark contrasts to further its racial theme.|$|E

She cited issues such the sexist portrayal of women in public, including the female nudity on Page Three of the Sun newspaper, bullying of girls in schools, and harassment in public spaces. Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, commented on Manjoo's criticisms calling them [...] "a wake-up call to recognise the depth and severity of <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>We</b> still have gender inequality in the UK [...] we are so quick to point the finger at other countries and suggest women [...] are equal." ...|$|E

[...] Because of threats and violence against her, she is escorted by four deputy U.S. marshals; the painting is framed such that the marshals' heads are cropped at the shoulders. On the wall behind her is written the racial slur [...] "nigger" [...] and the letters [...] "KKK"; a smashed and splattered tomato thrown against the wall is also visible.
