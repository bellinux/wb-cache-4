5|$|Despite finding like-minded {{students}} in Vienna, the city's climate took {{a toll on}} Andrić's health. He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill, then asked to leave Vienna on medical grounds and continue his studies elsewhere, though Hawkesworth believes he may actually have been <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> protest of South Slav students that were boycotting German-speaking universities and transferring to Slavic ones. For a time, Andrić had considered transferring to a school in Russia but ultimately decided to complete his fourth semester at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He transferred in early 1914, and continued to publish translations, poems and reviews.|$|E

5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Atlus {{and published by}} Namco for the Famicom. An enhanced Super Famicom port was developed by Opera House and released by Atlus in 1995. The second entry in the Megami Tensei series, the gameplay features the unnamed protagonist exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland, battling and recruiting demons as they are pushed into <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> conflict between the demonic forces of Lucifer and {{the army of the}} One True God.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} of the Old West, tales tended to grow with {{repeated}} telling, and a single fight might grow into a career-making reputation. For instance, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Outlaw Cowboy gang, but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion. Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gunfight or killing unarmed civilians.|$|E
5|$|After <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tour of Jamaica by the Yorkshire team, {{on which}} he scored 115 and 75 in {{successive}} games, Leyland scored 1,790 runs at 45.89 in 1936. He hit seven centuries, including an innings of 263 runs against Essex in the season, the highest first-class score of his career. He played {{in two of the}} three Tests against India that season—he missed the second with injury—but only batted twice. In the first Test, he scored 60 runs against a strong bowling attack when England were in a difficult position. The home side won the series 2–0. During the season, Leyland was among the first players chosen to tour Australia with the MCC in the forthcoming winter.|$|E

5|$|Atlético Mineiro did {{not qualify}} for any {{continental}} competitions in 2001 or 2002, a season in which Brazil did not have representatives in {{the first edition of}} Copa Sudamericana, the new cup which replaced Copa Mercosur and Copa Merconorte. The club qualified for the 2003 Copa Sudamericana, <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single round-robin preliminary group stage for Brazilian clubs, with Fluminense and Corinthians. Atlético defeated the latter 20 in São Paulo, but lost to the former 20 at home, and did {{not qualify for}} the second preliminary stage. The club became a regular participant in the Copa Sudamericana in the 2000s, but failed to advance from the Brazilian preliminary round in most tournaments. In 2004, Atlético fell to Goiás with a 42 away loss and a 11 home draw. Going through a bad period in its history, which included relegation in 2005, the club was absent from continental football for three years between 2005 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|Bedsitcom {{documented}} {{the lives of}} six young adults living in a loft flat in London. Eight episodes in total were created, which {{were divided into two}} distinct halves. The first four episodes centred on the lives of Mel, Paul and Rufus, the three actors, as they lived in the flat with Bob, Dave and Shirine, the three unaware members of the public who believed they were <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> genuine reality TV show. After Bob, Dave and Shirine had learnt {{the true nature of the}} show at the end of episode four, they moved out and were replaced by three new members of the public named Barrington, David and Jessica. These three new cast members remained on Bedsitcom for the final four episodes.|$|E
5|$|But Melody's {{love of the}} sea proves {{too strong}} and she visits Morgana, who turns her into a mermaid temporarily. King Triton uses his trident to {{transform}} Ariel back into her own mermaid form to find and rescue Melody. Morgana tricks Melody into <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plot to steal her grandfather King Triton's trident. Together with Tip the Penguin and Dash the Walrus she goes to Atlantica and succeeds in acquiring the trident. Ariel arrives as they return with it to Morgana, and tries to persuade Melody to give back the trident. Morgana captures Ariel, tightly wrapping her tentacle around Ariel's mouth and body. She then seals Melody behind a block wall. Tip and Dash rescue Melody and Ariel manages to free themselves. Morgana then uses the trident's magic to force everyone to bow before her.|$|E

5|$|In February 1943, {{concurrent}} with No.1 Wing and {{its three}} Supermarine Spitfire squadrons becoming operational in the Darwin area, No.77 Squadron {{was transferred to}} Milne Bay in New Guinea. Along with Nos.6, 75 and 100 Squadrons it came {{under the control of}} the newly formed No.71 Wing, which was part of No.9 Operational Group, the RAAF's main mobile formation in the South West Pacific Area. No.77 Squadron registered its first daytime victory on 11April, when a Kittyhawk shot down a Mitsubishi Zero <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> raid on Allied shipping near Buna. Three days later the Japanese attacked Milne Bay; the squadron claimed four bombers and a fighter for the loss of one Kittyhawk. By this time, Allied headquarters had finalised plans for a drive north to the Philippines involving heavy attacks on Rabaul and the occupation of territory in New Guinea, New Britain and the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5|$|On 26 August 1940, 5K+AR was <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> raid by KG 2 and KG 3, {{targeting}} the RAF stations RAF Debden and RAF Hornchurch. While flying over clouds, the aircraft became {{separated from the}} bomber formation and lost its bearings; it was then attacked by Boulton Paul Defiant fighters of No. 264 Squadron RAF. One of the Dornier's engines was disabled and the other damaged, so the wounded pilot, Feldwebel (Flight Sergeant) Willi Effmert, elected to make a crash landing on the Goodwin Sands. He and another crew member survived and were taken prisoner. The other two crew were killed; one is buried at Cannock Chase German war cemetery {{and the other in}} the Netherlands. The identity of the Defiant that shot down the Dornier is not certain – it may have been one of three 264 Squadron aircraft that was shot down soon after in a battle with Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter escorts from Jagdgeschwader 3.|$|E
5|$|On the June 14 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, Hardy entered the 2012 Bound for Glory Series, {{taking part in}} the opening {{gauntlet}} match, from which he was the first man eliminated by Bully Ray. Hardy wrestled his final group stage match of the tournament on the September 6 episode of Impact Wrestling, defeating Samoa Joe via submission, thus finishing fourth and advancing to the semi-finals. Three days later at No Surrender, Hardy defeated Joe in a rematch to advance to the finals of the tournament. Before the finals took place, Hardy suffered a storyline injury after <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> brawl between the TNA locker room and the Aces & Eights stable. Despite the injury, Hardy defeated Bully Ray in the finals to win the 2012 Bound for Glory Series and become the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy defeated Ray in a rematch to reaffirm his status as the number one contender.|$|E

5|$|Savage {{returned}} to San Francisco {{with his wife}} to stay for ten years, raising a daughter and <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> family business. He served at the rank of colonel in the California National Guard, and {{took part in the}} social activity of the city. During a period of anti-Chinese race riots, Savage stood up for law and order, and thereby gained the respect of San Francisco's leaders, property holders and middle class residents. Savage traveled to many exotic lands but in 1890 he was struck with jungle fever in Honduras. While recuperating in New York state he wrote his first book: My Official Wife. This very successful action-and-adventure story was followed by more, at the rate of about three per year, written for the general public rather than for literary critics; the latter were charmed by the first book but scathing of many later ones. Savage lived primarily in New York City, and was involved in lawsuits, especially against his New York publisher regarding unpaid royalties.|$|E
5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors would prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their best interest to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} and well-recorded duel {{occurred}} on 21 July 1865, in Springfield, Missouri. Wild Bill Hickok and Davis Tutt quarreled over cards and {{decided to have a}} gunfight. They arranged to walk towards each other at 6 p.m. Wild Bill's armed presence caused the crowd to immediately scatter to the safety of nearby buildings, leaving Tutt alone in the northwestern corner of the square. When they were about 50 yards apart, both men drew their guns. The two fired at the same time, but Hickok's shot hit Tutt in the heart, while Tutt's shot missed. This was the first recorded example of two men <b>taking</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quick-draw duel. The following month Hickok was acquitted after pleading self-defense. The first story of the shootout was detailed in an article in Harper's Magazine in 1867, and became a staple of the gunslinger legend.|$|E
