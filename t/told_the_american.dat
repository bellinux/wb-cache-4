5|$|A {{few months}} ago I <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
5|$|They were {{captured}} by the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 206th Mechanized Infantry Regiment of the NK 105th Armored Division. The North Korean troops marched their prisoners down the hill after taking their weapons and valuables. In a nearby orchard, they tied the prisoners' hands behind their backs, took some of their clothing and removed their shoes. They <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> POWs {{that they would be}} sent to the prisoner-of-war camp in Seoul if they behaved well.|$|E
5|$|Phát {{and other}} pro-Diệm {{officers}} opposed the Buddhist influence being exerted on Khánh. Thảo consulted Kỳ—who wanted to seize power for himself—before the plot, and exhorted {{him to join}} the coup, but the air force chief claimed that he was remaining neutral. Thảo thus believed Kỳ would not intervene against him, but Kỳ was strongly opposed to Thảo and Phát. American intelligence analysts had believed that General Don {{was involved in the}} coup with Phát and Thảo, but this was proven false when the action started. Eight months after the coup was over, Don <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> historian George McTurnan Kahin that he had been plotting with Thảo, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but that the Đại Việt and Thảo's Catholic civilian allies had insisted on installing Khiêm, a Catholic. A month before the coup, American intelligence analysts had believed that Thảo was planning to replace Khánh as commander-in-chief with Don.|$|E

25|$|According to Shlaim, Yasser Arafat, at {{that time}} being in Saudi Arabia, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> through <b>the</b> Saudis {{that he was willing}} to suspend {{cross-border}} shelling.

5|$|American negotiators soon {{concluded}} a reciprocity treaty with France, {{and the two}} nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism. The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and his government showed some interest in the idea and <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> envoy, Edward O. Wolcott, {{that he would be}} amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy's Executive Council there agreed. News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard. Even without the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard, but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law, and was able to sign the Gold Standard Act on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the explosion, even before the Kremlin had been informed of the submarine's sinking, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Defense Secretary William Cohen were told that Kursk had sunk. Once officially informed, the British government, along with France, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Norway offered help, and the United States offered the use of one of its two deep submergence rescue vehicles, but the Russian government refused all foreign assistance. Minister of Defence Igor Sergeyev <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Embassy that the rescue was well under way. The Russian Navy told reporters that a rescue was imminent.|$|E

500|$|On foreign affairs, Clinton {{voted in}} October 2002 {{in favor of}} the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, a vote she later [...] "regretted." [...] She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian {{president}} Bashar al-Assad. She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East. She has <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Israel Public Affairs Committee, [...] "America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival." [...] Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields.|$|E

500|$|Eden did {{suggest a}} counter-proposal on 1 July, {{but it was}} reduced, Bauer writes, to a ridiculous minimum. He <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> {{government}} that the British would allow Brand to return to Budapest with a message for Eichmann suggesting that 1,500 Jewish children be given safe passage to Switzerland, 5,000 from Bulgaria and Romania be allowed to leave for Palestine, and that Germany guarantee safe conduct for ships carrying Jewish refugees. He did not say what he would offer in return. On 11 July Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{put an end to}} the idea when he told Eden that the murder of the Jews was [...] "probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed," [...] and that there should be [...] "no negotiations of any kind on this subject". Of Brand's mission he wrote: [...] "The project which has been put forward through a very doubtful channel seems itself also to be of the most nondescript character. I would not take it seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|The four {{officers}} were {{taken aback by}} Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, Kỳ described Taylor as [...] "the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said [...] "For the sake of their own pride, they [...] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?" [...] However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of}} the happiest days of my life...Today I <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti-Americanism; Khánh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta.|$|E
500|$|Many of the German {{units were}} recent conscripts {{with very little}} experience. Sergeant Vinz Kuhlbach's platoon was typical. Most of his {{soldiers}} had little combat experience and even less training. The German units had been formed by conscripting teenage boys and men over 50, men previously rejected as physically unfit for service, wounded soldiers newly released from hospitals, and men transferred from the [...] "jobless" [...] personnel of the shrinking Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe. The German 3rd Fallschirmjäger [...] Division, which had previously acquired a superb combat reputation, had been virtually destroyed during the Normandy Invasion in the Falaise pocket. It had been resurrected by using replacements from the 22nd, 51st, and 53rd Luftwaffe Field Regiments. The German units were usually organized around small cadres of seasoned veterans. Although they carried the new StG 44 and were equipped with rifle grenades, few had ever fired them in combat. The German recruits were <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> soldiers they faced {{would not have the}} nerve to stand and fight. Their officers said the Americans were [...] "a gum-chewing, undisciplined half-breed with no stomach for real war." ...|$|E
50|$|Chiang played <b>the</b> Soviets and <b>Americans</b> {{against each}} other during the war.

500|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts had thought General Trần Văn Đôn {{was involved in}} the coup with Phát and Thảo, but altered their assessment when he stayed in the mountain resort town of Da Lat instead of heading for the capital. Their changed assessment was reinforced by the announcement that Khiêm would be leading the replacement government if the coup was successful. Eight months after the coup was over, Đôn <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> historian George McTurnan Kahin [...] that he had been plotting with Thảo, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but said the Dai Viet and Kiem had insisted on installing the Catholic Khiêm. A month earlier, American {{intelligence analysts}} thought Thảo was planning to replace Khánh as commander-in-chief with Don. Ambassador Khiêm had been putting pressure on his bitter rival Khánh for over two months by charging him and the Buddhists of seeking a [...] "neutralist solution" [...] and [...] "negotiating with the communists", {{and as soon as the}} coup broke, he was immediately deemed by media analysts as a key figure behind the action.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, McCain {{continued}} {{questioning the}} progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: [...] "Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers." [...] In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: [...] "We [...] not <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> people how tough and difficult this could be." [...] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007. The strategy's opponents labeled it [...] "McCain's plan" [...] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, [...] "McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now." [...] The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, [...] "I would much rather lose a campaign than a war." [...] In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.|$|E
500|$|The deposal {{prompted}} US Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor to angrily berate Thiệu, Thi, Kỳ and Cang in {{a private}} meeting and threaten to cut off aid {{if they did not}} reverse their decision. Although nettled by the outburst, Thi took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of the}} happiest days of my life...Today I <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] The dispute escalated for a few days as the junta threatened to expel Taylor, and Khanh went on a media offensive. A CIA informant reported that the arguments with Taylor had incensed the volatile Thi so much he privately vowed to [...] "blow up everything" [...] and [...] "kill Phan Khac Suu, Trần Văn Hương and Nguyen Khanh and put an end to all this. Then we will see what happens." [...] However, the dispute galvanized the officers' nationalist sentiments and they rallied around the embattled Khánh for a time. They ignored Taylor's threats without suffering repercussions because the Americans were too intent on defeating the communists to cut funding in an attempt to force policy change in Saigon. Thi became notorious for his involvement in infighting. A CIA dossier compiled in the 1960s said that Thi [...] "is like a card player, placing his bets now on this leader, then on another; he plays his subordinates in the same manner. His only real objective is to continue the game." [...] Time described him as [...] "vain, ambitious, an inveterate intriguer". The New York Times described him as [...] "a coup specialist".|$|E
