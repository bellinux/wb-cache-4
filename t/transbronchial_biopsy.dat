The diagnosis of tuberculosis {{in patients with}} inability to produce sputum or in patients that remain acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear negative with high index of clinical suspicion remains a challenge and often results in treatment delay. This study examined the role in using endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) to locate parenchymal infiltrates to allow for more accurate sampling of bronchial lavage fluid and <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies.</b> The study examined 121 patients divided into 2 groups, 73 patients received EBUS guided bronchoscopy and 48 pts received conventional bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies.</b> It {{should be noted that}} patients undergoing <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies</b> in the non-EBUS group appeared to have biopsies done without the use of fluoroscopy.

40|$|AbstractFibreoptic {{bronchoscopy}} {{was performed}} on 190 patients with chest radiographic lesions and negative sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli. Aside from obtaining <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies</b> for histological examination, bronchial aspirate specimens were also tested for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA by a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Of 177 <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies</b> performed, a diagnosis was found in 64 cases [43 cases of tuberculosis (TB), 17 cases of lung carcinoma and four cases of other infective/inflammatory diseases] giving a diagnostic yield of 36 · 2 %. PCR was positive in 105 of 108 finally diagnosed cases of TB and 22 of 82 non-TB cases. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of PCR when applied to bronchial aspirate specimens for diagnosing smear-negative pulmonary TB were 97 · 2 %, 73 · 2 %, 82 · 7 % and 95 · 2 % respectively. Therefore, detection of M. tuberculosis complex DNA in bronchial aspirates by PCR might have an adjunctive place to <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies</b> in the rapid diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis...|$|R

50|$|A CT scan of {{the lungs}} and {{histopathology}} along {{with a history of}} working in the flocking industry can diagnose flock worker's lung. A differential diagnosis may also include Sjögren's syndrome and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia. Flock worker's lung may be misdiagnosed as asthma or recurrent pneumonia. Though X-rays may be abnormal, CT scans are more useful as a diagnostic tool in flock worker's lung. Other diagnostic methods may include a <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsy</b> or wedge biopsy.|$|E
50|$|If none {{of these}} {{clinical}} features are present, a biopsy {{may be necessary to}} make the diagnosis. Video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy is the most definitive technique, but <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsy</b> has a yield of over 50% and can also be effective. The safety of the latter procedure in patients with diffuse cystic disease and the profusion of cystic change that predicts an informative biopsy are incompletely understood, however. Cytology of chylous fluids, aspirated abdominal nodes or lymphatic masses can also be diagnostic.|$|E
50|$|Although most {{patients}} tolerate bronchoscopy well, {{a brief period}} of observation is required after the procedure. Most complications occur early and are readily apparent {{at the time of the}} procedure. The patient is assessed for respiratory difficulty (stridor and dyspnea resulting from laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, or bronchospasm). Monitoring continues until the effects of sedative drugs wear off and gag reflex has returned. If the patient has had a <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsy,</b> doctors may take a chest x-ray to rule out any air leakage in the lungs (pneumothorax) after the procedure. The patient will be hospitalized if there occurs any bleeding, air leakage (pneumothorax), or respiratory distress.|$|E

30|$|After a {{negative}} diagnostic workup and BAL are performed, <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies</b> {{might be helpful}} in selected patients.

50|$|A {{flexible}} bronchoscope {{is inserted}} {{with the patient}} in a sitting or supine position. Once the bronchoscope is inserted into the upper airway, the vocal cords are inspected. The instrument is advanced to the trachea and further down into the bronchial system and each area is inspected as the bronchoscope passes. If an abnormality is discovered, it may be sampled, using a brush, a needle, or forceps. Specimen of lung tissue (<b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsy)</b> may be sampled using a real-time x-ray (fluoroscopy) or an electromagnetic tracking system. Flexible bronchoscopy can also be performed on intubated patients, such as patients in intensive care. In this case, the instrument is inserted through an adapter connected to the tracheal tube.|$|E
50|$|Pulmonary {{physiology}} is restrictive with {{a reduced}} diffusion {{capacity of the}} lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Airflow limitation is uncommon; gas exchange is usually abnormal and mild hypoxemia is common. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage reveals up to 40% lymphocytes, along with more subtle increases in neutrophils and eosinophils. In patients with typical clinical and radiographic features, a <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsy</b> that shows the pathologic pattern of organizing pneumonia and lacks features of an alternative diagnosis is adequate to make a tentative diagnosis and start therapy. On surgical lung biopsy, the histopathologic pattern is organizing pneumonia with preserved lung architecture; this pattern is not exclusive to BOOP and must be interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsy</b> and bronchoalveolar lavage was {{assessed}} {{in the diagnosis}} of pulmonary disease in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Seventy four <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsy</b> and 66 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens (60 paired specimens) from 80 examinations in 64 patients were reviewed.

We discuss two patients with bronchiolitis obliterans as a complication of graft versus host disease following allogeneic stem cell transplant. Both underwent bronchoscopy and <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsy,</b> which was complicated by pneumothoraces. Patients with bronchiolitis obliterans have {{an increased risk of}} spontaneous air leak syndromes. Although no data exists regarding the safety of transbronchial biopsies in patients with airflow obstruction in general, they appear to have increased rates of pneumothoraces following transthoracic biopsies.

40|$|Sarcoidosis is a multysistem granulomatous {{disease of}} unknown {{aetiology}} that afects several organs, more frequently the lung and the intrathoracic lymph nodes. It is histologically {{characterized by the}} presence of noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas in different stages of development. The authors evaluated the patients submitted to mediastinoscopy in the period of 2000 - 2002 with lymph node biopsy compatible with Sarcoidosis. They reviewed the diagnostic procedures accomplished prior to mediastinoscopy, in order to understand why the procedures performed until then, had not been enough for the diagnosis, attempting to avoid mediastinoscopy when possible, an invasive procedure with relevant costs. 141 mediastinoscopies were performed in this period, 56 of them histologically compatible with Sarcoidosis. The mean age of the patients was 42, 9 + 15, 7 (16 - 70). 30 were male and 26 female. The predominant symptoms were shortness of breath and nonproductive cough. Chest radiograph abnormalities found, were mediastinal enlargement in 85, 7 % of all the patients, hilar adenopathy in 64, 3 % and pulmonary infiltrates in 12, 5 %. CT scan of the thorax showed hilar adenopathy in 89, 3 % of all patients, mediastinal adenopathy in 98, 4, 3 % and pulmonary infiltrates in 23, 2 %. 13 patients initiated systemic corticosteroid therapy before histological diagnosis. Of the 51 patients with macroscopic description of adenopathy, 31 patients presented with typical sarcoid adenopathy. ACE level determination was done in only 9 patients. Determination of diffusion capacity of CO (TLCO) was accomplished in only 3 patients and Gallium 67 scan in 8 patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was accomplished in 8 patients, with medium CD 4 /CD 8 ratio of 7, 35. <b>Transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies</b> were accomplished in 7 patients, with only one of them diagnostic for Sarcoidosis. Minor complications occurred in only 2 patients submitted to mediastinoscopy, which were incisional heamorrage. Conclusions: The present review confirmed the greater sensitivity of CT scan in relation to chest radiograph in detecting hilar and mediastinal adenopathy and pulmonary infiltrates. DLCO determination, flexible bronchoscopy with BAL and <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies</b> were underused. <b>Transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies</b> diagnostic sensibility was very low in this series. As most of the patients were asymptomatic and in stage I, mediastinoscopy could have been avoided or postponed in some patients, monitoring clinical and imagiological evolution. A greater number of diagnostic procedures could have been accomplished before mediastinoscopy, meaningly flexible bronchoscopy with BAL and <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsies,</b> probably making mediastinoscopy unnecessary.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] value of alveolar lavage as an investigative technique was determined in patients with interstitial lung disease. Alveolar cytology was related to defined histopathological degrees of disease activity found in <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens. The degree of disease activity as assessed by these two techniques was compared with radiological evaluation. Adequate specimens of lung tissue for histopathological evaluation were obtained by <b>transbronchial</b> <b>biopsy</b> in 95 % of the subjects during the first procedure and diagnostic histopathological changes were found in 60 % of the patients. In the evaluation of disease activity, the lymphocyte-macrophage (L-M) ratio and, to a lesser extent, the total alveolar cell counts correlated well with graded histopathological changes of activity. A graded radiological evaluation of activity was accurate in 14 out of 17 patients, but in 3, extreme cellular disease was not recognized.

40|$|Background: Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Lungs and lymphatics {{are the principal}} sites affected by this disease. The disorder is often not suspected by physicians. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study done on 140 <b>transbronchial</b> lung <b>biopsies</b> received for histopathological examination in the Department of Pathology for 1 year in a multispeciality tertiary care hospital, in Delhi. Results: Out of 140 <b>transbronchial</b> lung <b>biopsies</b> studied, 13 cases of sarcoidosis were diagnosed histopathologically. In these patients a clinical, pathological, and radiological corelation was done. And a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis was given after excluding other granulomatous lesions.
