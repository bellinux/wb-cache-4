5|$|Alexander I Aldea (14311436) was {{the first}} Romanian ruler {{to be forced to}} render {{military}} service to the Ottomans. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 14561462, 1476), notorious as <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the Dracula legend, turned against the Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 14611462. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (14621475). Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily depopulated {{after the end of the}} 14thcentury. On the other hand, Wallachia received a steady flow of immigrants, mostly from the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Also {{introduced}} {{in this volume}} were Cutts the butcher (originally Sanzot from the French sans os ("without bones")) and the Bordurian chief of secret police Colonel Sponsz, whose name {{is derived from the}} Brussels dialect term for a sponge (éponge in French). Hergé used his brother, Paul Remi, as <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> Sponsz, although he was also influenced by the image of the Austrian American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} in the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme {{in a manner similar to}} Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and the challenges that this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E
5|$|Centuries after Lisa's death, Mona Lisa {{became the}} world's most famous {{painting}} and {{took on a}} life separate from Lisa, the woman.

5|$|During this period, Pittsburgh {{also became}} a {{national}} model for community development, through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the nationwide NeighborWorks America. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.|$|E
5|$|Eveline was an {{inspiration}} for many of Balzac's characters. She {{can be seen as}} <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> La Fosseue, Mme Claes, Modesta Mignon, Ursule Mirouet, Adelina Houlot, and especially Eugenie Grandet and Mme de Mortsauf. There is less agreement among scholars on whether she was also the inspiration for more negative characters such as Fedora and lady Dudley, as Balzac seems to have used her mostly as a model for more positive personas. His works also mention numerous characters named Eve or Eveline, and have several dedications to her.|$|E

5|$|He used {{friends as}} models, {{most notably the}} painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who {{modelled}} for {{the figure in the}} foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of the}} mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette.

5|$|Pistrucci was {{introduced}} to Lord and Lady Spencer by Banks. Lady Spencer showed Pistrucci a model of Saint George and the Dragon by Nathaniel Marchant and commissioned him to reproduce it in the Greek style {{as part of her}} husband's regalia as a Knight of the Garter.

5|$|The American Gothic House, {{also known}} as the Dibble House, is a house in Eldon, Iowa, {{designed}} in the Carpenter Gothic style with a distinctive upper window.

Generally considered Wood's most famous work and among the most recognized paintings in twentieth century American art, the painting is <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>for</b> hundreds of parodies across every creative medium. Grant Wood, who observed the house only twice in his lifetime, made only an initial sketch of the house—he completed American Gothic at his studio in Cedar Rapids.|$|E
