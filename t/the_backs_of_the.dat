5|$|The Olmec colossal {{heads are}} at least {{seventeen}} monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders. The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the Olmec civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. All portray mature individuals with fleshy cheeks, flat noses, and slightly crossed eyes; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of Tabasco and Veracruz. <b>The</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monuments often are flat. The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances, requiring {{a great deal of}} human effort and resources, it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual Olmec rulers. Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress. The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres, but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and {{relatively}} long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower {{surface of the body}} is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. <b>The</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A black spot, the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present {{at the base of the}} tail. The tip of the tail is white.|$|E

25|$|A {{baseball}} uniform {{is a type}} {{of uniform}} worn by baseball players. Most baseball uniforms have the names and uniform numbers of players who wear them, usually on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uniforms to distinguish players from each other. Baseball shirts (jerseys), pants, shoes, socks, caps, and gloves are parts of baseball uniforms. Most uniforms have different logos and colors to aid players, officials, and spectators in distinguishing the two teams from each other and the officials. They are made out of polyester instead of cotton, because washing shrinks the cotton fabric.|$|E

This proposal was rejected by Bismarck, who feared that the ethnic strife in Schleswig between Danes and Germans would then stay unresolved. Christian IX's negotiations were not publicly known until published in the 2010 book Dommedag Als by Tom Buk-Swientys, who had been given access to the royal archives by Queen Margrethe II.|$|E

Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front seats, and a tonneau cover under the liftback.

25|$|Names began {{appearing}} on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jerseys for bowl games {{beginning in the}} 1970s. Around 1980, the players' names {{began appearing}} on the road jerseys. The home jerseys remained nameless except for when worn during bowl games, with one exception. A brief tradition was established for the last home game of each season, where seniors (playing their final game in Memorial Stadium) were allowed to wear names on their jerseys; underclassmen, however, did not. This explains why footage of many Oklahoma-Nebraska games played in Lincoln during this era feature some Nebraska players with names on their jerseys and some without. From 1990 onward, names were permanently affixed to the home jersey, where they remain.|$|E
25|$|Far to the east, {{a column}} of French conscripts under Jacob Job Élie, set out from Philippeville toward Beaumont.

At dawn when the Austrians attacked again, the second line fired a volley into <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first line and all the infantry took to their heels. Louis Henri Loison capably covered the retreat with the French cavalry, saving the foot soldiers from being cut to pieces. As it was, Élie lost 400 men and 12 artillery pieces, while only 138 casualties were suffered by Benjowsky's division.|$|E
