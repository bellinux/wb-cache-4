In 1990, Ijaz left Van Eck to start Crescent Investment Management LLC, where he developed a <b>trading</b> <b>system,</b> Computer-Aided Regression Analysis Techniques, to manage his first hedge fund.

Since that time, Ijaz has remained active as Crescent's owner, operating it as a quantitative investment adviser and venture investing firm.|$|E
5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This system {{would be similar to}} the existing emissions trading of carbon credit. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would have the option of using these for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota.

40|$|Permit <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> {{are often}} the centre of current {{interest}} and activity {{in the creation of}} market-based environmental instruments as it is assumed that these systems can offer significant advantages over conventional approaches to pollution control. Economic investigation of permit <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> often focuses on case studies for air pollution control. Such permit <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> also exist (in theory and practice) for water pollution control, in form of water quality <b>trading</b> <b>systems.</b> The fact that pressure is being put on the quality of water resources in many countries resulting in serious problems means {{that there is a need}} to analyse the application of this instrument to control water pollution of rivers in more detail in order to identify its potential. Scientific work on water quality <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> is rare. This is the starting point for this study. It tries to fill the gap in the literature in several respects. Firstly, a comprehensive analysis shows the particularities of the application of permit <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> to water, and to rivers, in particular. Ecological and economic criteria are redefined with respect to the specific characteristics of rivers. A comprehensive and standardised evaluation system is developed that allows a comparable examination of the <b>trading</b> <b>systems.</b> Secondly, this study evaluates existing theoretical and practical approaches of water quality <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> with respect to these same developed criteria. For the first time, an integrated, comprehensive and comparable analysis of different <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> applies.

This fact is justified by great number of empirical data from Singapore, Istanbul, New York and other stock exchanges. The main concern of this paper is the focus on the creation, tests of <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> based on the popular trend following indicator, the moving average, and its combinations. The main questions which would be stressed during this research are: 1. What is the efficiency of the <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> based on the selected elements of technical analysis? 2. Which of them do show the greatest efficiency rate? Testing of <b>trading</b> <b>systems</b> based on moving average indicator (single, dual and triple) shows relatively high results on the Russian Stock Exchange (MICEX).

The Red Sea was of secondary importance to the Persian Gulf and overland connections to the Levant. Starting around 100 BC a route from Egypt to India was established, making use of the Red Sea and using monsoon winds to cross the Arabian Sea directly to southern India. By about 100 AD, the volume of traffic being shipped on this route had eclipsed older routes. Roman demand for goods from southern India increased dramatically, resulting in greater number of large ships sailing down the Red Sea from Roman Egypt to the Arabian Sea and India.|$|E
