6000|$|All {{architecture}} {{is what you}} do to it when you look upon it; Did you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the white or grey stone? or the lines of the arches [...] and cornices? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I almost fancy I {{have met}} you somewhere, Miss Wheelock, though I do not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Vancouver," [...] she said. [...] "Toronto is rather {{a long way}} off--but I wonder whether you were ever there?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{believe this}} is a {{cardinal}} mistake to believe that Waziristan is the only centre of terrorist activity. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a lot of other places in our region and a lot of organisations and also madrassas schools, that they are the centre of terrorist activity." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Oregonian quoted Hazelbaker's {{reflecting}} on the Senate campaign, [...] "People {{are not afraid to}} personally attack you if they <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the interests of their candidate," [...] she says. [...] "You have to keep a smile on your face and keep your head down and keep working.... I loved it, but {{you have to learn to}} take your lumps." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know. I {{think he}} would do {{anything}} to rid us from what he believed to have been our danger. I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> George Hotspur to write such a letter out of his own head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blood and sweat! Blood and sweat!" [...] Colonel Trethaway exulted. [...] "Talk {{about putting}} the vim into one! Why, I'm twenty years younger if I'm a day! Corliss, your hand. I congratulate you, I do, I heartily do. Candidly, I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> you. You're a surprise, sir, a surprise!" ...|$|E
60|$|We used {{to trust}} in God. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> 1863 that some genius {{suggested}} that it be put upon the gold and silver coins which circulated among the rich. They didn't {{put it on the}} nickels and coppers because they didn't think the poor folks had any trust in God.|$|E
50|$|Besides is an EP by Do Make Say <b>Think.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} <b>in</b> December 1999 by Resonant Records in a vinyl-only {{format and}} is now out-of-print.|$|R
5000|$|Announcing {{the game}} in November 2010, head of games {{technology}} Robert Henning for Tag said [...] "Doctor Who is the UK's number one science fiction property, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the BBC's top three for worldwide sales, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> great {{to bring it to}} Dundee — especially in light of what happened at Realtime Worlds and the effect it had on Dundee. <b>It</b> shows there <b>is</b> still something positive we can bring to the sector." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ellis {{has also}} noted the {{influence}} of the band's collective Christian faith: [...] "I do think that because I’m a Christian and we’re all Christians, regardless of whether we try not to make our music Christian...it just bleeds through because <b>it’s</b> who we <b>are.</b> I feel like it’s going to happen regardless of what I try to set out to do because God’s <b>in</b> me. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> there, but you just have to look for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Mr. White's own niece, {{and taken}} out of Mrs. White's hands," [...] said Magdalen. [...] "Besides," [...] as Agatha still looked unconvinced, [...] "one thing that made me think the {{invitation}} desirable {{was that it would}} break off any foolishness with Wilfred Merrifield--I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> their minds too." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. May was {{extremely}} gratified, and really esteemed {{this one of}} the greatest compliments his science had ever received; Dr. Spencer could not help observing, 'I did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> him to do such a wise thing. I never can fathom the rogue. I hope he was not bitten during his benevolent exertions last winter.' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a wave of}} {{comprehension}} the significance of all this was revealed to Stephen Brice, The grim humor, the sagacious statesmanship, and (best of all)--the superb self sacrifice of it, struck him suddenly. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> that hour that he realized {{the full extent of}} the wisdom he was near, which was like unto Solomon's.|$|E
5000|$|The Mouse Opossum will [...] "play dead" [...] if <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> danger, <b>it</b> {{will even}} smell as if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> dead.|$|R
50|$|In this book, Kennedy {{argues that}} the {{importance}} of the United Nations is often underestimated, especially by the Great Powers when their own interests are threatened. However, since 1945, the United Nations has been {{at the head of a}} globalising process that is now so powerful that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> beyond the control of any one country, no matter how strong <b>it</b> may <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>In</b> this context, there is a need to revitalise the United Nations to confront the myriad problems that all of humanity now faces.|$|R
25|$|At high {{pressure}} and temperatures, metallic hydrogen might {{exist as a}} liquid rather than a solid, and researchers <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> present <b>in</b> large quantities in the hot and gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some extrasolar planets.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been both," [...] {{said the}} girl; [...] "and both for nothing. After {{that you may}} go. I've told you what I am, and I'll leave you to name yourself. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> me to have been such a fool. It's that that frets me. Never mind, sir; it's all over now, and I wish you good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|BURKE--[Warningly.] Now don't {{be coming}} at me again, I'm saying, or I'll flatten {{you on the}} floor with a blow, if 'tis Anna's father you are itself! I've no {{patience}} left for you. [Then with an amused laugh.] Well, 'tis a bold old man you are just the same, and I'd never <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> you to come tackling me alone. [A shadow crosses the cabin windows. Both men start. ANNA appears in the doorway.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't that enough? God {{seemed to}} <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> {{the case of}} the first murderer, who killed his brother. All that he did to Cain was to set a mark on him. But we have not felt sure that {{we have the right to}} do this. We let God mark him, and He has done it with this man in the sorrow of his face. I was rather glad you, couldn't see him, my dear. It is an awful face." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a public}} {{statement}} following his retirement submission on March 11, 2007, Kiley said: [...] "I submitted my retirement because I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> {{the best interest}} of the Army. I want to allow Acting Secretary Geren, General Schoomaker, and the leaders of the Army Medical Command to focus completely on the way ahead and the Army Action Plan to improve all aspects of Soldier care. We are an Army Medical Department at war, supporting an Army at war - <b>it</b> shouldn't <b>be</b> and <b>it</b> isn't about one doctor." [...] Maj. Gen. Gale S. Pollock assumed the post of Acting Army Surgeon General.|$|R
5000|$|From June to September, 1908, the British monthly The Strand {{published}} {{a series of}} ambigrams by different people in its [...] "Curiosities" [...] column. Of particular interest {{is the fact that}} all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words. Mitchell T. Lavin, whose [...] "chump" [...] <b>was</b> published <b>in</b> June, wrote, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the only word in the English language which has this peculiarity," [...] while Clarence Williams wrote, about his [...] "Bet" [...] ambigram, [...] "Possibly B is the only letter of the alphabet that will produce such an interesting anomaly." ...|$|R
30|$|While {{we do not}} <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely <b>in</b> {{the current}} context of our research, we do {{acknowledge}} the possibility of technology support of work reducing knowledge to work independently (deskilling) if the technology takes over the work rather than serving in a supporting role.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Glasgow that Lizzie met the sailor--three years ago. She {{had gone}} {{there to be}} a servant, but the size of the place (according to her father) frightened her, and in a few months she was back at the clachan. We were all quite excited to see her again in the church, and the general {{impression}} was that Glasgow had [...] "made her a deal more lady-like." [...] In Janet's opinion she was just a little too lady-like to be natural.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a reel healthy-looking child now, though mebbee his colour is a mite too high--sorter consumptive looking, as {{you might}} say. I never thought you'd raise him when I saw him the day after you brung him home. I reely did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> you and I told Albert's wife so when I got home. Albert's wife says, says she, 'There's more in Rilla Blythe than you'd think for, Aunt Sophia.' Them was her very words. 'More in Rilla Blythe than you'd think for.' Albert's wife always had a good opinion of you." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{congregation}} {{being fully}} assembled, now, {{the bell rang}} once more, to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> some foreign country.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales {{stated in}} retrospect about the course {{organized}} by Israel Sheli, [...] "we saw absolutely no impact from that effort whatsoever. I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> ever—it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the press {{but we never}} saw any impact." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jordanian Foreign {{minister}} Ayman Safadi said in {{an interview}} with CNN on 26 July [...] "Absurd are some of the reactions that are coming of Israel which are trying to show this as if the ambassador and the suspect were under siege and were somehow liberated and celebrating them as heroes coming back home. This is really absurd. This is a criminal case and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> everybody’s interest that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> pursued as such." [...] "Jordan acted legally and morally complying to international laws on diplomatic mission. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> upon Israel to do the same and allow for justice to take its course and to stop provocative behaviours that distort the facts here." ...|$|R
5|$|He {{chooses to}} go {{mountain}} climbing; to his initial annoyance, Hernandez invites herself along. That night, Archer dreams {{that he is}} attacked by Reptilians, and Hernandez tries to help him {{come to terms with}} his memories and new-found adulation. In return, Archer tries to caution her that space exploration is not as idealistic as she <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>In</b> spite of this, the two manage to rekindle their romance. Returning to Starfleet Command, Archer is able to keep his emotions in check, and ultimately receives an unexpected thanks from Soval. Elsewhere, Doctor Phlox learns that some humans still hold a grudge over the Xindi attack, xenophobically blaming all aliens, and Phlox's presence in a bar results in a brawl.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{he spoke}} too loudly, {{or it may}} have been an accident, though Austin, who saw Macallister {{flounder}} on the slippery floor-plates as the steamer rolled, did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>In</b> any case, he drew Jacinta back, and a moment later a jet from the spouting hose struck with a great splashing upon the glass. The aggressive passenger, who was looking down just then, got most of it in his face, and he staggered back, dripping, and gasping with anger. When he once more became vociferous, Austin led Jacinta away.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{night we}} stopped somewhere. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a wood, {{and there were}} fires, and we lay down {{to sleep on the}} ground. Then I woke up suddenly, and there was a great noise and firing of guns, and someone caught me up and threw {{something}} over my head, and I don't remember anything more, for a long time. I know that presently I was on horseback, before a fierce-looking man. There were a good many of them, and when I cried for my father and mother, they said they would cut off my head if I were not quiet.|$|E
6000|$|... “As {{a matter}} of fact he had {{received}} some information, though of course I did not know of it at the time. He got a message one day telling him that his wife had been kidnapped and smuggled out of the country; she was said to be hidden away, in one of the islands off the coast of Norway I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> comfortable surroundings and well cared for. And with the information came a demand for money; a lump sum of £2000 was to be paid yearly. Failing this she would be immediately restored to her family.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1998 the 7th Marquess {{sold his}} right to occupy the East Wing of Ickworth House, the family seat since the 15th century. After his death in 1999 the 8th Marquess vigorously criticised the National Trust for not {{reselling}} {{what would have been}} the remaining term of that leasehold to him, arguing that the 7th Marquess could only sell his own life interest, not that of his descendants. This was disputed by the National Trust who have since converted the East Wing into a hotel. However, in 2009 Sir Simon Jenkins, the National Trust's new chairman, stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> our interest for the Marquesses of Bristol to be living there." ...|$|R
2500|$|Personal preferences, beliefs, and experiences: [...] The mother may dislike {{breast-feeding}} or <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> inconvenient. <b>In</b> addition, breastfeeding can {{be difficult}} for victims of rape or sexual abuse; for example, <b>it</b> may <b>be</b> a trigger for posttraumatic stress disorder. Many families bottle feed to increase the father's role in parenting his child.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a female}} street artist, Hassani is often harassed: [...] "It is very {{dangerous}} for a girl to paint in the streets in Kabul," [...] she says, [...] "sometimes people come and harass me; they don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> allowed <b>in</b> Islam {{for a woman to}} stand in the street and do graffiti." ...|$|R
