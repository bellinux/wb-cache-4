[...] Aaron goes on to cite the film's musical format as [...] "further subvert <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> might expect to be 'entertained' by such serious matters as AIDS, media representation, and the legacy of moralism and sexuality." [...] Feminist academic and AIDS video producer Alexandra Juhasz puts forth the film as [...] "an effective critique of the silly sensationalism used in much reportage of AIDS science [...] fights melodrama and tabloid journalism -- with melodrama and tabloid journalism." [...] Not all such critical commentary has been positive, with openly gay film scholar Robin Wood (who saw the film when someone very close to him was {{in the final stages of}} AIDS) calling the film [...] "misguided on the levels both of conception and execution." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Frank {{responded to}} what he called [...] "wholly {{inaccurate}} efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats, and [...] in particular" [...] for the subprime mortgage crisis, which {{is linked to the}} financial crisis of 2007–2009. He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations, but met resistance from Republicans, with the main exception being a bill with Republican Mike Oxley that died because of opposition from President Bush. The 2005 bill included Frank objectives, which were to impose tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing. Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and it passed the House. But the Senate never voted on the measure, in part because President Bush was likely to veto it. [...] "If it had passed, that would have been one of <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing," [...] Oxley told Frank. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote that Frank [...] "is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters." [...] Once control shifted to the Democrats, Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act (...) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (...) to passage in 2007. Frank also said that the Republican-led Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks, contributed to the financial meltdown. Frank stated further that [...] "during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2007, a few months after I became the Chairman, the House passed a strong reform bill; we sought to get the [...] administration's approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008; and finally got it passed and onto President Bush's desk in July 2008. Moreover, [...] "we were able to adopt it in nineteen months, and we could have done it much quicker if the [...] administration had cooperated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some Conservative Christians {{believe that}} the use of sex toys is immoral.

Ireland has stated [...] "There are moral ways and immoral ways to use a firearm ... There is no moral way to use one of these devices." [...] According to Ireland, [...] "Sometimes you have to protect the public against themselves....These devices should be outlawed because they are conducive to promiscuity, because they promote loose morals and because they entice improper and potentially deadly behaviors." [...] On the other hand Heidi Johnson, a Lutheran Christian pastor, teaches that [...] "in the Christian tradition, we are called to love God with all our heart, strength, mind, and soul...Sex toys are presented as a medium to engage in body love, self care, and exploring your sexuality as one of <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> love God with all of our holistic being." ...|$|E
2500|$|Interactivity {{has become}} a term {{for a number of}} new media use options {{evolving}} from the rapid dissemination of Internet access points, the digitalization of media, and media convergence. In 1984, Rice defined new media as communication technologies that enable or facilitate user-to-user interactivity and interactivity between user and information. Such a definition replaces the [...] "one-to-many" [...] model of traditional mass communication with the possibility of a [...] "many-to-many" [...] web of communication. Any individual with the appropriate technology can now produce his or her online media and include images, text, and sound about whatever he or she chooses. Thus the convergence of new methods of communication with new technologies shifts the model of mass communication, and radically reshapes <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> interact and communicate with one another. In [...] "What is new media?" [...] Vin Crosbie (2002) described three different kinds of communication media.

2500|$|Filming did {{not begin}} immediately, but in a September 2006 interview, {{executive}} producer Mike Richardson said that 30 Days of Night would be shot on 35 mm film, though there had been discussion to shoot the film on Genesis. [...] In an interview prior to filming, Slade explained that the illustrations of the graphic novel's illustrator, Ben Templesmith, would be reflected in production design. Slade also considered Nelson's draft {{to be the most}} faithful to the graphic novel. He also stated his intention to make a [...] "scary vampire film", of which he didn't think there were many. [...] "The rest of them, they fall into all kinds of traps.

[...] There was also concern expressed that while the vampires needed to communicate, talking might lessen the effect. To counter this, a fictional vampire language, with click consonants, was constructed with the help of a professor of linguistics and the nearby University of Auckland. [...] Slade explained [...] "we designed this really simple language that didn't sound like any particular accent that you would be aware of, that was based around really simple actions, eating, hunting, yes, no, really basic, because that's what vampires do." ...|$|E

[...] He took umbrage that the Bishops called for Sunday homilies that coincided with Earth Day to be about climate change [...] "during the sacrifice of the Holy Mass", and suggested petitions be given at Mass to call for divine assistance in using [...] "our technological inventiveness to undo the damage we have done to Your creation".

These ideas of substances, though they are commonly simple apprehensions, and the names of them simple terms, yet in effect are complex and compounded. Thus the idea which an Englishman signifies by the name swan, is white colour, long neck, red beak, black legs, and whole feet, and all these of a certain size, with a power of swimming in the water, and making a certain kind of noise, and perhaps, to a man who has long observed this kind of birds, some other properties: which all terminate in sensible simple ideas, all united in one common subject.|$|E

On such days she did not sneeze, reserving those expressions of her joy for sunny days and the crisp winds. At a forking of <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> came suddenly on one grey and three brown ponies, who shied round and flung away in front of us, a vision of pretty heads and haunches tangled in the thin lane, till, conscious that they were beyond their beat, they faced the bank and, one by one, scrambled over to join the other ghosts out on the dim common.|$|E

They were {{entitled}} to supply Negroes, in such and such number, annually to the Spanish Plantations; and besides this delightful branch of trade, to have the privilege of selling certain quantities of their manufactured articles on those coasts; quantities regulated briefly by this stipulation, That their Assiento Ship was to be of 600 tons burden, so many and no more. The Assiento Ship was duly of 600 tons accordingly, promise kept faithfully to the eye; but the Assiento Ship was attended and escorted by provision-sloops, small craft said {{to be of the}} most indispensable nature to it. Which provision-sloops, and indispensable small craft, not only carried merchandise as well, but went and came to Jamaica and back, under various pretexts, with ever new supplies of merchandise; converting the Assiento Ship into a Floating Shop, the Tons burden and Tons sale of which set arithmetic at defiance. This was the fact, perfectly well known in England, veiled over by mere smuggler pretences, and obstinately persisted in, so profitable was it. Perfectly well known in Spain also, and to the Spanish Guarda-Costas and Sea-Captains in those parts; who were naturally kept in a perennial state of rage by it,--and disposed to fly out into flame upon it, when a bad case turned up! Such a case that of Jenkins had seemed to them; and their mode of treating it, by tearing off Mr. Jenkins's Ear, proved to be--bad shall we say, or good?--intolerable to England's thick skin; and brought matters to a crisis, in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> saw."...|$|E
60|$|Although {{imitation}} {{is one of}} {{the great}} instruments used by Providence in bringing our nature towards its perfection, yet if men gave themselves up to imitation entirely, and each followed the other, and so on in an eternal circle, it is easy to see that there never could be any improvement amongst them. Men must remain as brutes do, the same at the end that they are at this day, and that they were in the beginning of the world. To prevent this, God has planted in man a sense of ambition, and a satisfaction arising from the contemplation of his excelling his fellows in something deemed valuable amongst them. It is this passion that drives men to all <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>we</b> see in use of signalizing themselves, and that tends to make whatever excites in a man the idea of this distinction so very pleasant.

It is on this principle that flattery is so prevalent; for flattery is no more than what raises in a man's mind an idea of a preference which he has not. Now, whatever, either on good or upon bad grounds, tends to raise a man in his own opinion, produces a sort of swelling and triumph, that is extremely grateful to the human mind; and this swelling is never more perceived, nor operates with more force, than when without danger we are conversant with terrible objects; the mind always claiming to itself some part of the dignity and importance of the things which it contemplates. Hence proceeds what Longinus has observed of that glorying and sense of inward greatness, that always fills the reader of such passages in poets and orators as are sublime: it is what every man must have felt in himself upon such occasions.|$|E
