Her surviving superstructure was scrapped in 1942, and her main armament was salvaged over the next year and a half. The aft main gun turrets were removed and reinstalled as United States Army Coast Artillery Corps Battery Arizona at Kahe Point on the west coast of Oahu and Battery Pennsylvania on the Mokapu Peninsula, covering Kaneohe Bay at what is now Marine Corps Base Hawaii. Battery Pennsylvania fired its guns for the first and last time on V-J Day in August 1945 while training, while the nearby Battery Arizona was never completed.

In 1986 the line from Derry to Londonderry (Manchester Airport) was abandoned. Freight service between the Manchester railyard and the airport continued until 1989, when a severe washout crippled the railbed just north of Goffs Falls Road in South Manchester. Guilford continued to serve the remaining customers from the railyard to South Manchester until 1998. The entire remaining right-of-way from the railyard to Manchester Airport was abandoned in 2000, and the segment that ran through the airport was sold to extend one of the runways.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the breakup}} of the former Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the 18 class members, and the TEŽ itself, were owned and {{operated}} by the Czechoslovak State Railways (ČSD). In service, their well proven three section articulated configuration allowed successful operation on the TEŽ's tight radius curves. Additionally, their all axle drive system enabled rapid acceleration and good traction, especially on uphill sections. On the other hand, the class did suffer from occasional derailments, leading to service interruptions. There were also problems with torn coupling bellows between the units, and the rubber insulating roof mats. In July 1981, due to delays in the delivery of replacements for worn tyres, all but four of the units had to be <b>temporarily</b> taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> and replaced by road buses.|$|R

First, five stations previously served by only the F train had more frequent service. Additionally, riders from northern Brooklyn and Long Island City had a direct route to Kensington. Finally, since the Church Avenue terminal had four tracks to store terminating G trains, as opposed to only one storage track at Smith–9th Streets, this reduced delays on both services because terminating G trains could switch to the storage tracks without having {{to wait in the}} station for another train to leave, as had occurred at Smith–Ninth Street. On July 19, 2012, MTA officials made this extension permanent because it provided more direct connections between Kensington and north Brooklyn.|$|R

In February 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith {{announced}} that another C-17 would be purchased for {{a cost of}} $A130 million. This aircraft was ordered to prevent a shortfall of airlift capacity while the original four C-17s underwent scheduled heavy maintenance. The decision to purchase this aircraft also supplanted an earlier plan to acquire two more C-130Js. As the deadline for A41-206 to be <b>temporarily</b> taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for maintenance was rapidly approaching, the USAF agreed to transfer a C-17 airframe that was nearing completion to the RAAF. This aircraft was delivered on 14 September 2011 and arrived in Australia nine days later. At the ceremony held to welcome A41-210, Smith announced that the government intended to order another C-17. The $A160 million contract for this aircraft was signed in March 2012, and it was delivered to the RAAF on 1 November that year.

50|$|Polar Bear is a Bagnall steam {{locomotive}} built in 1905 for the Groudle Glen Railway, {{to supplement the}} similar but slightly smaller Sea Lion. The two Bagnalls were <b>temporarily</b> taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in the 1920s when they were replaced {{by a pair of}} battery locomotives. These proved unsatisfactory, and Polar Bear and Sea Lion were returned to traffic. The railway was closed for the duration of World War II, and when the line reopened in the late 1940s only Polar Bear was returned to traffic. Following the 1962 closure of the GGR, Polar Bear was sold to the Brockham Museum Trust in 1967. In 1982 it passed, {{with the rest of the}} Brockham collection, to the Amberley Museum Railway, where it was returned to traffic in the early 1980s. Polar Bears boiler was condemned around 1988, returning to service with a new boiler in 1993. Its boiler certificate expired at the end of 2010; with a retube and work on the firebox being required before a return to service.

40|$|Due {{to large}} oil supply and stagnating demand {{the oil price}} {{significantly}} decreased in 2014, leaving many actors in the offshore industry with {{a hard time finding}} profitability in their business. Among these actors are the many ship-owners who operate so called offshore supply vessels (OSV: s). These vessels are used to supply the offshore installations of the oil companies and assist with services such as anchor handling, tugging and repair & maintenance. The activity of the offshore installations in Norway has, since the oil price collapse, decreased to the extent that many of the vessels owned by Norwegian ship-owners no longer have enough work to cover their operating expenses. Ship-owners have therefore chosen to put vessels in lay-up. A lay-up means that a ship is <b>temporarily</b> taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for a longer period, awaiting increased rates on the market. The thesis has studied the causes behind the laid up OSV-fleet in Norway, which effects the lay-ups have had on the concerned market and what expectations the industry has on the future. The ship-owners and shipbrokers active in the Norwegian offshore industry interviewed for this thesis have given a unanimous view of the current market situation as a supply-and-demand issue. Too many vessels in combination with too many ship-owners have contributed to a very high competition which has led to low rates on the spot market and difficulties finding long-term contracts. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> the about 600 vessels in the Norwegian OSV-fleet, about 150 have been laid up. The lay-ups have had a positive, but small, effect on the tough situation that the ship-owners are in, but there is a long way left until the market is in balance again. Moreover, bankruptcy and consolidation among ship-owners have occurred and are expected to continue. There are different opinions regarding whether a further increased oil price or not is what is needed for the ship-owners to regain profitability. None the less, there is a common opinion amongst the ship-owners that the oil companies’ activities must increase is the market is to be stabilised...|$|R

40|$|Friday, November 22, 2002, 17 : 08 EST (5 : 08 PM EST) CDCHAN- 00106 - 2002 - 11 - 22 -ADV-NThis {{notice is}} to advise readers that {{questions}} {{have come up}} in the media regarding a possible terrorist link to two recent outbreaks of gastroenteritis on cruise vessels. The cause of the outbreaks has not been determined but {{there is no indication that}} they are intentional. The characteristics of these outbreaks are similar to other cruise ship outbreaks that CDC has investigated in the past. The Vessel Sanitation Program at CDC has investigated a persistent outbreak of gastroenteritis among passengers and crew of the Holland America Lines vessel, the Amsterdam. The cause of the outbreak has been determined by laboratory confirm ation to be Norwalk or norovirus. Passengers disembarked from the most current voyage on the morning of November 21 in Port Everglades, Fort Lauderdale. There w ere 1232 passengers and 562 crew on the most recent voyage and 64 cases reported among passengers and 18 cases among the crew. The vessel has been <b>temporarily</b> taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for aggressive cleaning, isolation of infected crew, and other control measures. CDC continues to closely monitor the situation. Epidemiologic data suggest that the probable mode of transmission on the Amsterdam is person to person through hand-to-mouth activity arising from contamination of environmental surfaces. On the evening of November 21, the CDC w as made aware of a reported 175 cases of gastroenteritis (vomiting and/or diarrhea) among 2318 passengers and 988 crew members of the Disney Magic. We are currently working with Disney Cruise Lines to investigate these reports. The vessel is on a cruise in the Bahamas, and will reach port in Port Canaveral on November 23. The etiologic agent has not been determined. NLV or norovirus are the most common etiologic agents for viral gastroenteritis outbreaks on cruise vessels and in land-based foodborne or waterborne outbreaks. Common modes of transmission for these viruses include person-to-person contact or consuming contaminated food or water. Gastroenteritis, 2002 VirusNorovirusNorwalk viru...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} a national push to create a smarter electric grid; introducing new technologies that will create a more controllable and flexible grid {{is part of the}} smart grid concept and integral to its success. The full control of transmission assets are not currently built into electric energy dispatch optimization models. Optimal transmission switching is a straightforward way to leverage grid controllability: to make better use of the existing system and meet growing demand with existing infrastructure. Previous research has shown that transmission switching as a corrective mechanism can help relieve line overloading, voltage violations, etc. However, there has been limited focus on the use of transmission switching as a means to improve the economic efficiency of the network by incorporating the control of transmission assets into the overall economic dispatch problem. This research discusses the ways that the modeling of flexible transmission assets can benefit the multi-trillion dollar electric industry. It presents and analyzes novel formulations by which the operator can incorporate this flexibility into the economic dispatch formulation. This research focuses on modeling transmission assets {{so that they can be}} <b>temporarily</b> taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> i. e., by opening breakers, or kept in service, i. e., by keeping the breakers closed. By incorporating this control into the network optimization problem, this provides the ability for the operator to consider the state of a transmission line as a decision variable instead of treating it as a static asset, which is the current practice today. The possible benefits demonstrated from this research indicate that the benefits to society are substantial. On the contrary, the benefits to individual market participants are uncertain; some will benefit and other will not. Consequently, this research also analyzes the impacts that optimal transmission switching may have on market participants as well as the policy implications. Methods to improve the solution time of this difficult problem are discussed as well...|$|R
