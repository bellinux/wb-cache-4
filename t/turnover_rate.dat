Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate, such as triosephosphate isomerase, aim to measure the affinity with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the <b>turnover</b> <b>rate.</b> Some other examples of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, both of which are important for cellular respiration (glycolysis).|$|E

Because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (considering the geological discussion above), this molecular oxygen may make its way to the ocean, where it could aid in biological processes. One estimate suggests that, given the <b>turnover</b> <b>rate</b> inferred from the apparent ~0.5 Gyr maximum age of Europa's surface ice, subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans.|$|E
5|$|The skyrocketing {{prices were}} {{driven by the}} high {{salaries}} paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money. The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could {{not keep up with}} the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a <b>turnover</b> <b>rate</b> of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a <b>turnover</b> <b>rate</b> of more than 1,000 percent. Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, Lathrop High School ran in two shifts: one in the morning and the other in the afternoon to teach students who also worked eight hours a day. More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services. Waiting in line became a fact of life in Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks McDonald's became No. 2 in the world for sales—behind only the recently opened Stockholm store. Alyeska and its contractors bought in bulk from local stores, causing shortages of everything from cars to tractor parts, water softener salt, batteries and ladders.|$|E

5|$|Fremantle Prison's {{officers}} {{were known as}} warders until the early 20th century. They lived in specially built terrace houses {{within walking distance of}} the prison, and their lives were just as regimented as the prisoners. In the 1890s warders still had stringent living and working conditions, including ten- to twelve-hour working days. Due to a high <b>turnover</b> <b>rate,</b> many had little knowledge of either official policies or unofficial rules and traditions. The warder's role, previously unwritten, only became clearly defined in 1902. As well as guarding against escapes and enforcing discipline, they oversaw prisoner work and instructed inmates in trades. The warders were also supposed to be moral role models for prisoners, while maintaining a formal, distant, relationship.|$|E

Such anthropogenic disturbances {{are known to}} reduce species turnover across horizontal distances.

We measured turnover in birds across horizontal and vertical sampling transects in three land-use types of Sri Lanka: protected forest, reserve buffer and intensive-agriculture, from 90 to 2100 m a. s. l. Bird <b>turnover</b> <b>rates</b> across horizontal distances were similar across all habitats, and much less than vertical <b>turnover</b> <b>rates.</b> Vertical <b>turnover</b> <b>rates</b> were not similar across habitats. Forest had higher <b>turnover</b> <b>rates</b> than the other two habitats for all bird species.

30|$|The clear theme {{among these}} 16 studies is {{a focus on}} top {{management}} teams (TMTs). This contrasts with the large Western literature where the focus tends to be on <b>turnover</b> <b>rates</b> among core employee groups or on <b>turnover</b> <b>rates</b> in the entire organization. Firm performance, pay structure, and pay levels were the most-studied antecedents of TMT turnover in the Chinese papers. As examples, Cai and Li (2016) examined whether firm performance and incentives would explain top management turnover. Taking an agency theory view, the authors found that firm performance and stock incentive were negatively related to top management <b>turnover</b> <b>rates,</b> but pay level was not significantly related. Drawing on tournament theory and fairness theory, Deng et al. (2016) predicted and found among 376 top management teams from listed A-share companies that TMT pay dispersion increased <b>turnover</b> <b>rates</b> and, further, that pay level attenuated this positive relationship.|$|R

According to a 2008 report, <b>turnover</b> <b>rate</b> among sales people has exceeded 40% annually with similar figures in the US. This is a disadvantage to businesses because replacing labor is extremely costly. The report studied the impact cognitive-behavioral therapy had on 166 financial service sales agents from a major British insurance company which had recently been acquired by a competitive, results-oriented organization. Measurements were based on employee well-being, job satisfaction, productivity and turnover. Major organizational changes lead to {{a substantial number of}} employees quitting. Three months prior to the study, 71% of the participants reported experiencing work-related stress and performing poorly. According to the results, there were major improvement in employees' attributional style, psychological distress, self-esteem, job satisfaction and intention to quit. Symptoms of psychological stress warranting intervention reduced from 37% of the sample to 10% after training. The psychological changes were also accompanied by a 66% reduction in employee <b>turnover</b> <b>rate.</b> Productivity had also improved post two years after training where 65% of the sample had achieved sales figures above the average. This is {{a significant}} increase prior to training where 29% of participants were barely performing at acceptable standards.|$|E

We here study the community structures in Chinese stock markets from the aspects of both price returns and <b>turnover</b> <b>rates,</b> by using a combination of the PMFG and infomap methods based on a distance matrix. We find that a few of the largest communities are composed of certain specific industry or conceptional sectors and the correlation inside a sector is generally larger than the correlation between different sectors. In comparison with returns, the community structure for <b>turnover</b> <b>rates</b> is more complex and the sector effect is relatively weaker. The financial dynamics is further studied by analyzing the community structures over five sub-periods. Sectors like banks, real estate, health care and New Shanghai take turns to compose a few of the largest communities for both returns and <b>turnover</b> <b>rates</b> in different sub-periods. Several specific sectors appear in the communities with different rank orders for the two time series even in the same sub-period. A comparison between the evolution of prices and <b>turnover</b> <b>rates</b> of stocks from these sectors is conducted to better understand their differences. We find that stock prices only had large changes around some important events while <b>turnover</b> <b>rates</b> surged after each of these events relevant to specific sectors, which may offer a possible explanation for the complexity of stock communities for <b>turnover</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
