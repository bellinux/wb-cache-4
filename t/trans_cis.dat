50|$|Cyclodecapentaene or 10annulene is an annulene with {{molecular}} formula C10H10. This organic compound is a conjugated 10 pi electron cyclic system {{and according to}} Huckel's rule it should display aromaticity. It is not aromatic, however, because various types of ring strain destabilize an all-planar geometry. The all-cis isomer (1), a fully convex decagon, would have bond angles of 144°, which creates large amounts of angle strain relative to the ideal 120° for sp2 atomic hybridization. Instead, the all-cis isomer can adopt a planar boat-like conformation (2) to relieve the angle strain. This is still unstable compared to the next planar <b>trans,</b> <b>cis,</b> <b>trans,</b> <b>cis,</b> cis isomer (3). Yet even this isomer is also unstable, suffering from steric repulsion between the two internal hydrogen atoms.

Overall, the acquired full-scan, positive-ion ESI-MS spectra of 2, 3, and 5 {{were characterized by}} the presence of relatively low-intensity [M+Nar and [M+Kt mass spectral peaks, whereas those of 1 and 4 were dominated by extremely intense [M+Hr peaks. Complexes 2 and 3 were also noted to form [2 M+Ht and [2 M+Nat dilneric cations. The source of Na + and K+ ions {{is believed to be the}} sample, the solvent systems used or the transport line carrying the sample solutions into the ES ion source. Further, the fragmentation pathway of all complexes studied was found to be almost identical with concurrent loss of py and H 20 molecules, loss of a {N(p-YC 6 F 4) CH 2 } (Y = F, H) group and/or concomitant release of the latter group and a py ligand being the most conunon. The photochemical degradation behaviour of 1 and 2 was also investigated using either fluorescent or ultraviolet light and some products of that degradation were positively identified. Altogether, light irradiation of solutions of both complexes resulted in cation cationisation, reductive-elimination, ligand-release, ligand-exchange and ligand-addition reactions. Finally, positive- and negative-ion ESI-MSn spectra of 5 ' -GMP, guanosine, inosine and products of their reactions with 1, 2, 3, and 4 were also recorded. On the whole, full-scan ESI-MS spectra of the pure nucleobases revealed the presence of cationic and anionic species that are highly reflective of both their solution ionic composition and their propensity t 9 form polymeric clusters. Analyses of mass spectra acquired from their reaction solutions with the aforementioned platinum complexes indicated very slow kinetics. However, all complexes investigated formed, to various degrees, Pt-nucleobase adducts with guanosine and inosine, but not with 5 '-GMP. The products included species having coordination numbers of III, IV, V, and VI, among which the first-time· observed, coordinatively saturated, jive-coordinate PtlI-nucleobase complexes were of most interest. The latter complexes are presumably stabilized by 7 tback- donation involving the filled d orbitals of the PtII centre and the empty pz· orbital of MeCN. All products, whose peaks appeared inlull-scan ESI-MS spectra, are believed to represent solution species rather than artifacts of gas-phase processes. Finally, negativeion ESI-MSn spectra recorded in reaction solutions of 1 and 4 with guanosine and of the latter complex with inosine revealed the negative-ion-ESI-MS first-time observed, noncovalent, nucleoside-chloride adducts, with the source of chloride anion being complexes 1 and 4 theillselves. In contrast, no such adducts were observed to form with Na 25 '-GMP or its protonated fonn. Few suggestions are offered for the possible cause(s) behind the absence of such adduct ions...|$|E

Milk fat responses to increasing amounts of short- and medium-chain fatty acids (SMCFA), added in the proportion as synthesized denovo, were studied in lactating dairy cows. The results showed a significant linear increase in milk fat concentration with SMCFA supplementation. However, milk fat yield was similar for all treatments. A subsequent study was aimed at increasing the availability of SMCFA during <b>trans</b> - 10, <b>cis</b> - 12 CLA-induced milk fat depression (MFD) in lactating dairy cows to determine whether SMCFA can rescue part of CLA-induced MFD. Post-ruminal infusion of butterfat (BF) {{was used as a}} source of SMCFA. The BF treatment was compared to a mixture of fats containing only the long-chain FA (LCFA) with or without <b>trans</b> - 10, <b>cis</b> - 12 CLA infusion. Milk fat content and yield were significantly reduced with <b>trans</b> - 10, <b>cis</b> - 12 CLA. However, increased availability of SMCFA with BF infusion had no effects on milk fat yield and concentration. <b>Trans</b> - 10, <b>cis</b> - 12 CLA significantly reduced the mRNA expression of transcription factor SREBP- 1 c along with its downstream targets including ACC, FASN, LPL, SCD and AGPAT. The increased availability of SMCFA had no effect on either lipogenic gene or protein expression suggesting that nutritional manipulation was not sufficient to rescue <b>trans</b> - 10, <b>cis</b> - 12 CLA-induced MFD.

It is revealed that the trans configuration is the thermodynamically stable form of porphycene on Cu(111) and Ag(111), whereas the cis configuration occurs as a meta-stable form. The <b>trans</b> → <b>cis</b> or <b>cis</b> → <b>trans</b> conversion on Cu(111) can be induced in an unidirectional fashion by injecting tunneling electrons from the STM tip or heating the surface, respectively. We find that the cis ↔ cis tautomerization on Cu(111) occurs spontaneously via tunneling, verified by the negligible temperature dependence of the tautomerization rate below ∼ 23 K. Van der Waals corrected DFT calculations are used to characterize the adsorption structures of porphycene and to map the potential energy surface of the tautomerization on Cu(111). The calculated barriers are too high to be thermally overcome at cryogenic temperatures used in the experiment and zero-point energy corrections do not change this picture, leaving tunneling as the most likely mechanism. On Ag(111), the reversible <b>trans</b> ↔ <b>cis</b> conversion occurs spontaneously at 5 K and the cis ↔ cis tautomerization rate is much higher than on Cu(111), indicating a significantly smaller tautomerization barrier on Ag(111) due to the weaker interaction between porphycene and the surface compared to Cu(111). Additionally, the STM experiments and DFT calculations reveal that tautomerization on Cu(111) and Ag(111) occurs with migration of porphycene along the surface; thus, the translational motion couples with the tautomerization coordinate. On the other hand, the <b>trans</b> and <b>cis</b> configurations are not discernible in the STM image and no tautomerization is observed for porphycene on Au(111). The weak interaction of porphycene with Au(111) is closest to the gas-phase limit and therefore the absence of <b>trans</b> and <b>cis</b> configurations in the STM images is explained either by the rapid tautomerization rate or the similar character of the molecular frontier orbitals of the <b>trans</b> and <b>cis</b> configurations...|$|R

LevyA {{series of}} chiral {{titanium}} and manganese complexes with helix-directing salen ligands have been prepared, characterized and studied. Their structures displayed as a chiral helical motif as expected. And {{it was also}} found that all M(salen) units were exclusively M-helimeric in the solid state, except Ti(cyclohexyl-benz[a]anthryl) as P-helix. This {{may be due to}} the energy difference between P and M helice, which enables crystal packing forces to control and drive the molecular structure. This is also in agreement with the previous computational studies that the M configuration predominates in THF solution. All metal centers adopt a cis-β octahedral geometry except in Mn(binapthyl-phenanthryl-salen). Most of M(salen) complexes in this work afforded μ–oxo dinuclear helicates, instead of the expected monohelicate, except Mn(binapthyl-phenanthryl-salen), which is bridged by a third salen ligand. The titanium salt affected the complex solution behavior. In the presence of Cl[superscript]-, only mononuclear species was found by ESI-MS, while both di- and mononuclear species was found in MeOH in the presence of –O[superscript]iPr. The NMR spectra of Ti(salen) indicated one major species with cis-β geometry exist in most solution, which could be monomer or dimer, except Ti(binapthyl-salen). No counterions have been found in the solid state of Mn(salen) complexes in this work, but they affected the ligand decomposition in the solution in Mn(binapthyl-phenanthryl-salen).

Structures of these compounds are as follows: Preliminary reports (3, 4) suggest that this <b>trans</b> to <b>cis</b> conversion is a nonenzymic photochemical reaction.

The present paper deals with an investigation of the conversion of o-coumaric acid glucoside to coumarinic acid glucoside in intact sweetclover leaflets and in leaflet extracts.

The pyridine ligands in 2 are labile, exchanging slowly into free pyridine with a rate constant of 0. 4 s− 1 for 2 a at 335 K in a dissociative process where ΔH = 134 ± 1 kJ mol− 1 and ΔS = 151 ± 5 J mol− 1 K− 1. Pyridine ligand exchange in 2 proves to be slower than that determined for 3. Parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) based on the hydride ligands of 2 and 3 is transferred efficiently to the 15 N nuclei of the bound pyridine ligand by suitable insensitive-nuclei-enhanced-by-polarization-transfer (INEPT) based procedures. Related methods are then used to facilitate the sensitization of the free pyridine 15 N signal by a factor of 120 -fold through ligand exchange even though this substrate does not contain parahydrogen. This therefore corresponds to the successful polarization of an analyte by parahydrogen induced polarization methods without the need for the actual chemical incorporation of any parahydrogen derived nuclei into it...|$|E
40|$|Structures and {{properties}} of the low-lying states in 4 -(dicyanomethylene) - 2 -methyl- 6 (p-dimethylaminostyryl) - 4 H-pyran (DCM) have been investigated theoretically. Calculations show that the dimethylamino and dimethylanilino twisted conformations of DCM on the potential energy surface of the first excited state (S- 1) have relatively high stabilities and remarkable intramolecular charge transfers (ICT). Both structures can serve as candidates for the red-shifted emissive state in polar solvent. In particular, the dimethylanilino twisted ICT state has been predicted to have a dipole moment increment of 20 Debye {{with respect to the}} ground state by CASSCF calculations, in good agreement with the suggested experimental values. The optimized geometry of the S- 1 state exhibits a long central CC bond of 1. 458 angstrom, which makes the trans-cis isomerization quite facile through intramolecular rotation around the central CC bond on the S- 1 potential surface. The S- 1 state is a precursor to the formation of the ICT emissive state and photoinduced <b>trans</b> <b>cis</b> isomerization. The S- 1 /S- 0 crossing in polar solvent and avoid-crossing in the gas phase as well as in non-polar solvent are involved in the trans-cis isomerization process. The presence of an early S- 1 /S- 0 crossing in the strong polar solvent reduces the isomerization efficiency.

Despite the different reactive species formed from the two isomers in aqueous solution, similar reaction products are obtained in their interaction with d(T(2) GGT(2)). Both [RuCl 2 (DMSO) (4) ] isomers bind to the oligonucleotide in the bidentate mode to form thermodynamically stable bis-guanosine adducts, Ru(G-N 7) (2), Significant differences were observed in the reaction rates, however the reaction with trans[RuCl 2 (DMSO) (4) ] is ca. 5 - 10 times faster in comparison to that observed for the cis analogue. This difference is interpreted in terms of different rate-limiting steps for the trans and cis complexes, respectively. It is suggested {{that the rate of}} the reaction with the trans isomer is controlled by dissociation of a Cl- ligand from the initially formed <b>trans,</b> <b>cis,</b> cis-[RuCl 2 (DMSO) (2) (H 2 O) (2) ].

An example are azobenzenes on surfaces which {{have been shown to}} be switchable between <b>trans</b> and <b>cis</b> forms. Here, we examine the “direct” (rather than substrate-mediated) channel of the <b>trans</b> → <b>cis</b> photoisomerization after ππ* excitation of tetra-tert-butyl-azobenzene physisorbed on surfaces mimicking Au(111) and Bi(111), respectively. In spirit of the direct channel, the electronic structure of the surface is neglected, the latter merely acting as a rigid platform which weakly interacts with the molecule via Van-der-Waals forces. Starting from thermal ensembles which represent the trans-form, sudden excitations promote the molecules to ππ*-excited states which are non-adiabatically coupled among themselves and to a nπ*-excited and the ground state, respectively. After excitation, relaxation to the ground state by internal conversion takes place, possibly accompanied by isomerization. The process is described here by “on the fly” semiclassical surface hopping dynamics in conjunction with a semiempirical Hamiltonian (AM 1) and configuration-interaction type methods. It is found that steric constraints imposed by the substrate lead to reduced but non-vanishing, <b>trans</b> → <b>cis</b> reaction yields and longer internal conversion times than for the isolated molecule.

We find that the <b>trans</b> to <b>cis</b> isomerization reaction of the molecules in the monolayer shows deviation from the first-order kinetics unlike those reported on Langmuir monolayers of azobenzene molecules. We attribute the deviation from first-order kinetics to the simultaneous photoisomerization of trans isomers to form cis isomers and the reverse thermal isomerization of cis isomers to form trans isomers. Our analysis of {{the rate of change}} of mole fraction of trans isomers to form cis isomers indicates a first-order kinetics for <b>trans</b> to <b>cis</b> photoisomerization reaction and a second-order kinetics for <b>cis</b> to <b>trans</b> thermal isomerization reaction. This second-order kinetics mechanism is similar to the Lindemann-Hinshelwood mechanism for the unimolecular reactions at low concentration of reactants. The formation of the activated cis isomer by collisions is a slow process as compared to the decay of the activated <b>cis</b> isomer to <b>trans</b> isomer in the liquid expanded phase.

40|$|The siglecs {{comprise}} 13 {{members of}} the immunoglobulin superfamily that recognize sialic acid containing glycans, and are differentially expressed on leukocytes and glial cells. The natural ligands of siglecs typically occur on the same cell (in cis) and/or on adjacent cells (in <b>trans).</b> <b>Cis</b> ligands mask the binding of multivalent synthetic sialoside ligands and are thought to regulate the activity of siglecs as modulators of cell signaling. However, synthetic ligands of sufficient avidity can compete with cis ligands, demonstrating a dynamic equilibrium of cis and trans ligand probes. We have explored the relationship between valency, affinity and geometry for achieving avidity sufficient to compete with cis ligands of CD 22 (Siglec- 2) in situ. A notable achievement is a hetero-bifunctional ligand approach to create multivalent ligands using antibodies as a protein scaffold. The ligand is comprised of a CD 22 ligand, 9 -biphenylcarboxyl-NeuAc&#x 3 b 1; 2 - 6 Gal&#x 3 b 2; 1 - 4 GlcNAc (BPCNeuAc), coupled to an antigen, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrophenylacetic acid (NP) (BPCNeuAc-NP). The BPCNeuAc-NP ligand is able to efficiently assemble complexes of anti-NP antibodies with CD 22 on both asialo- and native B cells. Surprisingly, assembly of the tertiary complex occurs with anti-NP IgM (n= 10), IgA (n= 4) and IgG (n= 2). The results suggest that spacing of ligands using an antibody optimizes the contribution of geometry to achieve high avidity with low valency. Other multivalent configurations also show promise for targeting B cells. In particular, liposomes bearing BPCNeuAc ligands bind avidly to B cells and are endocytosed. Thus, BPCNeuAc-lipososomes may prove effective in delivery of therapeutic agents to B cells (Supported by NIH grants GM 60938, AI 50143). |$|E

A good way to raise the CLA content in the diet without a radical change in eating habits {{seems to be the}} enrichment of commonly consumed food products with CLA supplements. This study analyzed the total fatty acid content and the CLA isomer composition of 6 commercially available CLA-fortified dairy products during processing and 10 wk of refrigerated storage. Research was carried out by combining gas chromatography and silver-ion HPLC. The tested samples were a CLA oil supplement, and several skim milk dairy products fortified with the supplement (milk, milk powder, fermented milk, yogurt, fresh cheese, and milk-juice blend). The CLA oil supplement was added such that the consumer received 2. 4 g/d of CLA by consuming 2 servings. The predominant isomers present, C 18 : 2 cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA and C 18 : 2 cis 10, trans- 12 CLA, were in at a similar ratio, which ranged from 0. 97 to 1. 05. These major isomers were not significantly affected by processing but a decrease in total CLA in fresh cheese samples was detected after 10 wk of refrigerated storage. Refrigerated storage and thermal treatment resulted in significant decreases or disappearance of some of the minor CLA isomers and a significant increase of trans, trans isomers from both cis, trans, <b>trans,</b> <b>cis,</b> and cis, cis isomers especially in CLA-fortified milk powder but also in fermented milk, yogurt, and milk-juice blend. © American Dairy Science Association, 2007.
