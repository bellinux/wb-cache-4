5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to collect the eight pieces of the Android Queen's body then stitch her back {{together}} again. The player must first find and approach the refrigerator in order to be told where the first body part can be found. Once this has been returned to the player's trapped father, the next body part location will be revealed. Once all eight body parts have been collected and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> the player must find a needle and thread in order to restore the Android Queen.

At this time, she experienced mental and physical agony, being bullied by other models. According to a contemporary, those who teased Tsuchiya had recognized her as [...] "tough" [...] while other [...] "overweight" [...] models, like Kaela Kimura, were always called by extremely vulgar nicknames. Just a few, but some, praised Tsuchiya afterwards, saying things like [...] "well done."
