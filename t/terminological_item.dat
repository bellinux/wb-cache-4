40|$|We look at {{the problem}} {{connected}} with methods of teaching Chinese field-specific terms to international students in technical institutes of higher education. The basis of our research is represented by Chinese scientists' articles {{in the sphere of}} manufacturing polymer. Our research is focused on the solution of problems connected with teaching Chinese field-specific terms to international students in technical institutes of higher education. The task required analysis of teaching and studying issues of field-specific disciplines in Tomsk Polytechnic University, study of terminological processes in Chinese, description of how field-specific terms are adopted from foreign languages into Chinese. Studying the above listed aspects provided a basis for developing a classification of polymer production terms. The way the Chinese language borrows a <b>terminological</b> <b>item</b> is considered when dividing terminological elements into groups for further systematization. We structured our classification of terms and terminological combinations by taking into account the fundamentals of high-molecular composition chemistry for easier understanding of polymer production terminology by teachers and students of technical institutions of higher education...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the issues involved}} m the translation of culture-specific terms from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. As {{a starting point for}} the analysis, the linguistic corpus was collected from tourist information brochures published by both Bord Failte Eireann and The Northern Ireland Tourist Board From these sources, not only terminology used in Ireland as opposed to other English speaking countries could be assessed but also terms employed in different regions within the island. Firstly, a review of how data was collected along with the type and function of the text introduces the linguistic corpus in Chapter 1. This is followed by the arrangement of cultural categories and classification of the data. Chapter 1 also includes some considerations on the topic of culture-specific terms per se, as well as an analysis of tlie most common translation strategies used as potential solutions to this problem. Following an in-depth study of the data collected, several points of discussion arise. These points are then considered in detail in Chapters 2 to 6. The contextual example in the English SL text where the term appears is presented and an analysis of the <b>terminological</b> <b>item</b> and its implications follow. In addition, a translation of the contextual example m Spamsh is offered. By way of a conclusion, Chapter 7 presents an overview of relevant considerations and points to bear in mind when translating culture-specific terms...|$|E
40|$|By Bulgarian {{anatomical}} terms we {{mean the}} names established by scientific tradition, duplicating the Latin anatomical terms and coined {{with the means}} of the Bulgarian language or loan-words which are grammatically integrated (assimilated) into the Bulgarian anatomical text and are written in the Cyrillic alphabet. In their integrity and systemic relationships, the Bulgarian anatomical terms make up the Bulgarian anatomical terminology. The modern Bulgarian anatomical terms are formed in conformity with the basic term formation methods in Bulgarian literary language: lexico-morphological, lexico-syntactical and lexico-semantic. Besides them, word-borrowing in its two varieties – borrowing through translation (literal and free) and borrowing existing foreign <b>terminological</b> <b>items</b> – has {{had an impact on the}} terminological norm and is currently an active modern process lending itself to control. Main points in the research: Terms, terminolgy and nomenclature; Definitions in the anatomical scientific literature; Term formation; Links and interrelationships; General linguistic characteristics of the anatomical terms; Norm, codification and standardization in anatomical terminology...|$|R
40|$|In the {{presented}} thesis {{about developing}} reading skills in teaching German {{as a foreign}} language in Secondary-Grammar schools, it has been both theoretically and practically shown how important teaching of reading skills is. It was the author's original aim to complete a work that would address the readings' basic role in the communicative didactics and summarize its general significance in learning a foreign language. The general psychological character of reading and its biological, cognitive and affective aspects were the subjects of chapter two, together with the basic <b>terminological</b> <b>items</b> such as transfer and interference, context sensibility or semantic ambiguity tolerance. The communicative skills - such as linguistic, lexical, grammatical, semantic, phonological, orthographical and orthoepic - were presented {{with regard to their}} knowledge and mastery at the level of B 1 and B 2, as they are defined in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: learning, teaching, assessment. The objectives of both learning and teaching languages (pragmatic, cognitive and emotional) and their specificity are discussed {{in the second part of}} chapter three. The following chapter is dedicated to the definition of reading as a skill and its receptive character, especially in connection with the other [...] ...|$|R
