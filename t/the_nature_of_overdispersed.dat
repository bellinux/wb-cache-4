50|$|Specifying a Bayesian network {{meta-analysis}} model involves {{writing a}} {{directed acyclic graph}} (DAG) model for general-purpose Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software such as WinBUGS. In addition, prior distributions have to be specified {{for a number of}} the parameters, and the data have to be supplied in a specific format. Together, the DAG, priors, and data form a Bayesian hierarchical model. To complicate matters further, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> MCMC estimation, <b>overdispersed</b> starting values have to be chosen for a number of independent chains so that convergence can be assessed. Currently, there is no software that automatically generates such models, although there are some tools to aid in the process. The complexity of the Bayesian approach has limited usage of this methodology. Methodology for automation of this method has been suggested but requires that arm-level outcome data are available, and this is usually unavailable. Great claims are sometimes made for the inherent ability of the Bayesian framework to handle network meta-analysis and its greater flexibility. However, this choice of implementation of framework for inference, Bayesian or frequentist, may be less important than other choices regarding the modeling of effects (see discussion on models above).|$|R

As stated by him, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist should promote the harmony between those natures according to certain standards. If <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material prevails over the others, the result is rude. If <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist is predominating, then the work of art becomes mannered. The style is the creation of ideals. That means that the pure objectivity of the representation should be admitted as the highest principle of art.
