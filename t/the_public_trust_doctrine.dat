5000|$|National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (Supreme Court of California, 1983, [...] ) {{was a key}} case in California {{highlighting}} the conflict between <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> and appropriative water rights. <b>The</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Doctrine</b> {{is based on the}} principle that certain resources (such as navigable waters) are too valuable to be privately owned and must remain available for public use. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court, the court held that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> restricts the amount of water that can be withdrawn from navigable waterways. The basis for <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>Doctrine</b> goes back to Roman law. Under Roman law, the air, the rivers, the sea and the seashore were incapable of private ownership; they were dedicated {{to the use of the}} public. In essence, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> establishes the role of the state as having trustee environmental duties owed to the public that are subsequently enforceable by the public. There is judicial recognition of this, dictating that certain rights of the public are key to individual common law rights (such as state recognition of the public right or trust for waterways and coastal zones). Judicial recognition of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> has been established for tidelands and non-navigable waterways, submerged land (such as lake beds) and the waters above them, and preservation of a public interest (such as recreation, swimming, access, and sport fishing).|$|E

40|$|Water {{conflicts}} in the western United States increasingly arise from competition between traditional economic uses (especially irrigation, municipal supply and hydropower) and public uses (especially environmental protection and water-based recreation). Western United States water law, based on the prior appropriation doctrine, has always promoted maximizing ‘beneficial use’ of the resource and has effectively protected water allocations for traditional purposes. Public water uses also enjoy some legal protection, but it exists mostly on paper; in practice, neither statutory public interest provisions nor <b>the</b> non-statutory <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> has been widely effective.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} problem of {{inadequate}} access and why owners of private property abutting public lands cannot fence out <b>the</b> <b>public</b> if their sole or primary purpose is to deny access to <b>public</b> land. <b>The</b> reasons why such landowners {{should not be allowed}} to put up fences, even on their own land, if the effect is to hinder <b>the</b> <b>public</b> 2 ̆ 7 s access to public land are several. First, it is opportunistic and unjustly interferes with citizens 2 ̆ 7 ability to enjoy the interest they hold in public lands. Second, it denies citizens access rights rooted in the common law. Third, and perhaps most compelling, because of general notions of property ownership and <b>the</b> evolving <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> <b>the</b> right to exclude <b>the</b> <b>public</b> to <b>the</b> extent of access to public lands never inhered in the adjoining private land title.

50|$|Justice Field {{determined}} that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> {{applies to the}} Great Lakes, {{despite the fact that}} they are not subject to the ebb and flow of the tides. Initially, the United States adopted English Common law which limited the definition of navigable waters to those that were subject to the ebb and flow of the tides. In the United States the tidal requirement was removed because many rivers can be navigated for great distances by large commercial vessels. Great Lakes, while not subject to the tides, are the conduit of a great deal of transnational and interstate commerce, and it was this value the common law sought to protect in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> limits private property rights to lands submerged by navigable waters.

40|$|South Africa faces {{significant}} inequities {{in access}} to and use of water for productive purposes. The National Water Act seeks to address these inequities and introduced a public rights system where water {{is owned by the}} people of South Africa and held in custody by <b>the</b> state. This <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> forms <b>the</b> basis for the State to give effect to its constitutional obligation for redress. Compulsory licensing is a mechanism to proactively reallocate water on a catchment basis to achieve redress, {{while at the same time}} promoting economic efficiency and ecological sustainability. During compulsory licensing, all users are required to reapply for their water use entitlement, and a process is followed to allow for a fairer allocation of water between competing users and sectors. Some concerns have been raised that equity may not be achieved through compulsory licensing as historically disadvantaged individuals may not have the capacity to partake in the process. Similarly, the administrative burden of processing large numbers of licences from small scale users may cripple licensing authorities. Moreover, the compulsory licensing process, while encouraging Historically Disadvantaged Individuals (HDIs) to apply, may have little impact on poverty if the poorest are not able to participate in the process. General authorisations are proposed as a way of addressing these concerns by setting water aside for specific categories of users. This paper introduces the concept of general authorisations in support of compulsory licensing and outlines some of the implementation challenges...|$|R
40|$|Many issues, {{especially}} potential environmental catastrophes {{caused by}} climate change, affect {{not just the}} living, but also future generations. The bias in our political system against addressing the interests of future generations poses serious obstacles in solving long-term environmental problems such as global warming. Because future generations cannot vote, unelected federal judges are more suited to protect their interests than the political branches. An important question is whether anyone has standing to sue on behalf of future generations in the federal courts. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s Article III standing test requires plaintiffs to demonstrate that they have personally suffered an injury that is actual and imminent, and not merely conjectural or hypothetical. For non-governmental plaintiffs, there is arguably conflicting law regarding whether and when probabilistic risks justify standing, especially where a plaintiff seek a substantive remedy. For uncertain risks that have a probability of less than fifty percent of occurring during the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime, a court might deny standing because the risks are too uncertain. In Massachusetts v. EPA, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), the Supreme Court held that Massachusetts had standing to challenge the EPA 2 ̆ 7 s refusal to regulate carbon dioxide because states are entitled to more lenient standing criteria than ordinary citizens. The Court considered evidence from computer models that climate change through the year 2100 would result in ever rising sea levels and damage to Massachusetts coastline. It is unclear whether an ordinary citizen could raise a claim involving global warming because the harm is generalized and probabilistic. Despite the actual and imminent requirement limitation of suits on behalf of future generations, Massachusetts supports the protection of future generations in some circumstances. Under the parens patriae doctrine, states have a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting {{the health and safety}} interests of their citizens. There is a good argument that states have a quasi-sovereign interest in not just their current citizens but also their future citizens. Furthermore, <b>the</b> modern <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> and several state laws recognize that states have a duty to protect natural resources for future generations. Because both federal and state law recognizes the important role of states in protecting natural resources for future generations, federal courts should apply a liberal approach to standing issues when states bring parens patriae or <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> suits to protect those resources for the state 2 ̆ 7 s future citizens...|$|R
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} provide in {{property}} legal theory {{an alternative to}} law-and-economics theory, the dominant mode of theorizing about property in contemporary legal scholarship. I call this alternative the social obligation theory. I argue that American property law, both on <b>the</b> private and <b>public</b> sides, includes a social-obligation norm but that this norm has never been explicitly recognized as such nor systemically developed. I argue that a proper understanding of the social obligation explains a remarkably wide array of existing legal doctrine in American property law, ranging from the {{power of eminent domain}} to <b>the</b> modern <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine.</b> In some cases social obligation reaches the same result as law-and-economics, but in other cases it will not. Even where it reaches the same result as law and economics, social obligation theory provides a superior explanation. At a normative level I argue that the version of the social-obligation norm that I develop here is morally superior to other candidates for the social-obligation norm. It is so because it best promotes human flourishing, i. e., enabling individuals to live lives worthy of human dignity. Drawing on Martha Nussbaum 2 ̆ 7 s capabilities approach (which itself is based on the Aristotelian notion that the human being is a social and political animal, not self-sufficient alone), the social obligation theory holds that all individuals have an obligation to others in their respective communities to promote the capabilities that are essential to human flourishing (e. g., freedom, practical reasoning). For property owners this has important consequences. if we accept the existence of an obligation to foster the capabilities necessary for human flourishing, and if we understand that obligation as extending to an obligation to share property, at least in surplus resources, in order to enhance the abilities of others to flourish, then it follows that, in the predictable absence of adequate voluntary transfers, the state should be empowered and may even be obligated to step in to compel the wealthy to share their surplus with the poor so that the latter can develop the necessary capabilities. None of this is meant to suggest that the state 2 ̆ 7 s power, even as it touches on the facilitation of the capabilities we are discussing, is unbounded. But the limits to the state 2 ̆ 7 s proper domain are supplied by the same principles that justify its action: the demands generated by the capabilities that facilitate human flourishing - freedom, practical rationality, and sociality, among others...|$|R
5000|$|In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court, it was alleged by {{the plaintiffs}} that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> was being {{violated}} due to environmental damages to Mono Lake {{in the form}} of significant water level declines as a result of water diversions by the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP). DWP based their defense on the fact that they held permits, issued by the state for the diversions, and so the diversions were allowable. The central issue in the case was whether appropriative water rights (granted in the past) must consider <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> requiring protection of natural resources by the state. More specifically, the issue being addressed by the court was whether Mono Lake was subject to a public trust, which would invalidate Los Angeles’ use of the streams feeding the lake. The California Supreme Court held that the state, under <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> had continuing responsibility for the state's navigable waters and that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine,</b> therefore, prevented any party from appropriating water in a manner that harmed the public trust interests. However, the court also recognized that LA depended on these diversions as a critical water source, and this in turn mitigated the rule of law as the court held that water transfers were permissible even though some damage to the environment would occur as long as this was kept to minimal harm to the extent feasible. This ruling established that <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>trust</b> <b>doctrine</b> and appropriative water rights are [...] "part of an integrated system of water law" [...] and so both must be considered when determining appropriate use of water in California.|$|E
