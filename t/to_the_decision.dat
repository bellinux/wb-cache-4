40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Church Polity)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{tradition}} of the Reformed church polity, believers commit themselves on grounds of their common faith and confession <b>to</b> certain matters. <b>The</b> critical question which has to be answered in this study, is: To what extent do believers commit themselves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church {{and what are the}} implications of such a commitment? The central theoretical argument of this study is: The mutual agreement between believers to commit themselves <b>to</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church is 'n voluntary commitment, because believers consider themselves as devouted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Scriptures, confession and church order on which grounds <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church are taken. Chapter 2 investigates the origin and leading thought of the binding and commitment <b>to</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church. Then there is a short historical overview on the shaping of the concept "binding and commitment <b>to</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church". Subsequently the scope of this binding agreement <b>to</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church as well as the role of fundamental and indifferent matters are explored. Chapter 3 focuses on the way in which believers commit themselves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> confession and also on the conflict surrounding <b>the</b> binding agreement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> confession. Furthermore the importance of church denomination and the negative consequences when <b>the</b> binding agreement <b>to</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church are ignored, are examined. In the last instance, the way in which churches should bind themselves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church order and the positive results of such a binding, are investigated. Chapter 4 highlights the main problems which lead to a misconception in the understanding of <b>the</b> binding agreement <b>to</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church. Then the history of deviation from <b>the</b> binding agreement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church, is reviewed. Furthermore the conflict in South-Africa about <b>the</b> binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church, especially within the Reformed Churches in South-Africa, is looked at. In chapter 5 the misconceptions about binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church are pointed out. Next, the distinctive character of <b>the</b> binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church is dealt with. Subsequently the demands and commitments which arise from <b>the</b> binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church are explored, as well as the positive results obtained when maintaining <b>the</b> binding agreement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church. The final part emphasizes <b>the</b> responsibility <b>to</b> extend and <b>to</b> bring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of believers the concept of binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>the</b> church.

5|$|According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona {{asked the}} {{guardian}} of Matsatso, {{one of the three}} most prominent royal idols, to ask the idol which of his sons should rule after him. The guardian hesitated to declare the idol's choice, but after the king promised no ill reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision,</b> the man declared the successor to be Andrianavalonimerina. However, the king had hoped that the successor would be another son, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. He decided to test the prophecy by sending one of his wives to the guardian's house, where the population showed her respect by offering zebu for her to eat. The zebu cooked inconsistently, and the king interpreted this as a sign that the guardian was dishonest and intended to seize power himself, so Andriamasinavalona ordered him put to death and had the idol Matsatso discarded in a lake. He then asked the guardians of the two other idols (Kelimalaza and Soratra) to declare a successor; {{the guardian of}} Soratra fled, while the guardian of Kelimalaza stated that only the king could choose his successor.|$|E
