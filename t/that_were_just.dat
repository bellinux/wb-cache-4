5|$|Christopher Landsea {{noted that}} the efforts to reanalyze the Atlantic {{hurricane}} database {{will not be able}} to recover observations of open ocean tropical cyclones <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> never taken. Researchers cannot assume that the Atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction of frequency of events before the advent of satellite imagery in the mid-1960s. Moreover, newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional Atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002. Thus large, long-term 'trends' in tropical cyclone frequency are primarily manifestations of increased monitoring capabilities and likely not related to any real change in the climate in which they develop.|$|E

At the time this was non-trivial, as there were no development tools for the Mac, and programmers had to buy an Apple Lisa for this.|$|E

Oil Company highway maps from the late 1960s and early 1970s show “Tobacco Root Mountains” in the north, and “Jefferson Range” in the south (northwest of Ennis and north of Virginia City). Preliminary {{topographic}} maps of the area (Bureau of Reclamation, Missouri Basin Project) from 1947-48 show Jefferson Range, but on the 1950 15-minute sheet (Harrison Quad) the identical topography is labeled “Tobacco Root Mountains” in the same place as “Jefferson Range” on the maps <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> two years older.|$|E

25|$|The first {{crossing}} of the Tennessee River was accomplished by the XX Corps at Caperton's Ferry, 4 miles from Stevenson on August 29, where construction began on a 1,250-foot pontoon bridge. The second crossing, of the XIV Corps, was at Shellmound, Tennessee, on August 30. They were quickly followed {{by most of the}} XXI Corps. The fourth crossing site was at the mouth of Battle Creek, Tennessee, where the rest of the XIV Corps crossed on August 31. Without permanent bridges, the Army of the Cumberland could not be supplied reliably, so another bridge was constructed at Bridgeport by Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's division, spanning 2,700 feet in three days. Virtually all of the Union army, other than elements of the Reserve Corps kept behind to guard the railroad, had safely crossed the river by September 4. They faced more mountainous terrain and road networks <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as treacherous as the ones they had already traversed.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{research}} has extended established findings of age related decline in executive functioning, by examining related cognitive processes that underlie healthy older adults’ sequential performance. Sequential performance refers to the execution of a series steps needed to complete a routine, such as the steps required to make {{a cup of coffee}} or drive a car. An important part of healthy aging involves older adults’ use of memory and inhibitory processes to carry out daily activities in a fixed order without forgetting the sequence of steps <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> completed while remembering {{the next step in the}} sequence. A recent study examined how young and older adults differ in the underlying representation of a sequence of tasks and their efficiency at retrieving the information needed to complete their routine. Findings from this study revealed that when older and young adults had to remember a sequence of 8 animal images arranged in a fixed order, both age groups spontaneously used the organizational strategy of chunking to facilitate retrieval of information. However, older adults were slower at accessing each chunk compared to younger adults, and were better able to benefit from the use of memory aids, such as verbal rehearsal to remember the order of the fixed sequence. Results from this study suggest that there are age differences in memory and inhibitory processes that affect people’s sequence of actions and the use of memory aids could facilitate the retrieval of information in older age.|$|E
500|$|In March 1984, {{the film}} began {{production}} in Los Angeles. Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, {{the style of}} the film changed, explaining that [...] "the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just found myself on the set doing things I didn't think I would do– scenes <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> purely horrific that just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant." [...] Most of The Terminators action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.|$|E

500|$|As a {{freshman}} at Fairfax High School, Slovak formed a band with Irons on drums and two other high school friends, Alain Johannes and Todd Strassman. They called their band Chain Reaction, then changed the name to Anthem after their first gig. [...] After one of the group's shows, Slovak met audience member Anthony Kiedis, and invited him to his house for a snack. [...] Kiedis later described the experience in his autobiography Scar Tissue: [...] "Within {{a few minutes of}} hanging out with Hillel, I sensed that he was absolutely different from most of the people I'd spent time with...He understood a lot about music, he was a great visual artist, and he had a sense of self and a calm about him <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> riveting." [...] Slovak, Kiedis and Flea became best friends and often used LSD, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine recreationally.|$|E

Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold {{states that}} Iron Maiden [...] "are {{by far the}} best live band in the world and their music is timeless", while Trivium singer Matt Heafy {{comments}} that [...] "without Iron Maiden, Trivium surely wouldn't exist". Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor says that [...] "Steve Harris does more with four fingers than I've ever seen anybody do. And Bruce Dickinson? Dude! To me, he was the quintessential old-school heavy metal singer. He could hit notes <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> sick, and he was a great showman. Everything made me a fan. And there wasn't a dude that I hung out with that wasn't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks", while their music also helped Jesper Strömblad of In Flames to pioneer the melodic death metal genre, stating that he had wanted to combine death metal with Iron Maiden's melodic guitar sounds.|$|E
500|$|In June 1972, {{the band}} reconvened in Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next album at the Record Plant. The {{recording}} process was plagued with problems, many {{as a result of}} substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song [...] "Cornucopia" [...] after [...] "sitting {{in the middle of the}} room, just doing drugs", Ward was nearly fired from the band. [...] "I hated the song, there were some patterns <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just...</b> horrible" [...] Ward said. [...] "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired". The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating [...] "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".|$|E

500|$|Ultima Underworld is {{considered}} the first example of an immersive sim, a genre that combines elements from other genres to create a game with strong player agency and emergent gameplay, and has influence many games since its release. The game's influence {{has been found in}} BioShock (2007), and that game's designer, Ken Levine, has stated that [...] "all the things that I wanted to do and all the games that I ended up working on came out of the inspiration I took from [...]" [...] Gears of War designer Cliff Bleszinski also cited it as an early influence, stating that it had [...] "far more impact on me than Doom". Other games influenced by Ultima Underworld include , Deus Ex, , , and Half-Life 2. Toby Gard stated that, when designing Tomb Raider, he [...] "was a big fan of ... Ultima Underworld and I wanted to mix that type of game with the sort of polygon characters <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> being showcased in Virtua Fighter." [...] Ultima Underworld was also the basis for Looking Glass Technologies' later System Shock.|$|E
500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, Late Registration {{serves as}} an {{exhibition}} of [...] "the stealthy power of West's storytelling." [...] West stated that his goal for the album was to touch on topics that {{people from all walks}} of life could find relatable, while remaining true to himself: [...] " [...] raps <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith." [...] The opening track [...] "Heard 'Em Say" [...] is a [...] "mournfully contemplative" [...] song that [...] "talks about being honest with yourself in a world that is not." [...] The song is written from the perspective of an afflicted, impoverished American quietly lamenting the fallacies of society and questioning the ways of the world around him. West delivers a tongue-in-cheek lyrical narrative within [...] "Gold Digger" [...] in which he critically depicts the disastrous life of a man married to a woman who manipulates him for financial gain. However, another story arises within the third verse, which illustrates a once destitute black male who earns a fortune and decides to leave a loyal, unselfish girlfriend for a white woman.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, the United Leagues Coalition (ULC) was an {{informal}} electronic message board through which established leagues compared notes {{in order to}} prepare for inter-league play, {{and it was also}} used to exchange information to help new leagues <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> getting started. The ULC evolved into a more formal organization in July 2005, when representatives of 20 leagues met in Chicago to discuss establishing a governing body for women's flat-track roller derby.

[...] Among these goals was the production of a standard track design, and standard game rules. [...] The design and rules were settled upon and distributed later that year. [...] In November 2005, the ULC voted to change its name to the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA), with initial membership of 22 leagues (soon expanded to 30 members by early 2006).|$|E
