5|$|Đính and {{the leading}} generals in the MRC {{also had a}} secret plan to end the {{communist}} insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent {{of the government of}} North Vietnam. They claimed that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground,</b> which they claimed on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner. However, the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|Henry had a {{problematic}} relationship with Louis VII of France throughout the 1150s. The {{two men had}} already clashed over Henry's succession to Normandy and the remarriage of Eleanor, and the relationship was not repaired. Louis invariably attempted to take <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> in respect to Henry, capitalising on {{his reputation as a}} crusader and circulating rumours about his rival's behaviour and character. Henry had greater resources than Louis, however, particularly after taking England, and Louis was far less dynamic in resisting Angevin power than he had been earlier in his reign. The disputes between the two drew in other powers across the region, including Thierry, the Count of Flanders, who signed a military alliance with Henry, albeit with a clause that prevented the count from being forced to fight against Louis, his feudal lord. Further south, Theobald V, the Count of Blois, an enemy of Louis, became another early ally of Henry. The resulting military tensions and the frequent face-to-face meetings to attempt to resolve them has led historian Jean Dunbabin to liken the situation to the period of the Cold War in Europe in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Shaw's major {{plays of}} {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century address {{individual}} social, political or ethical issues. Man and Superman (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw's interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated printed text. The Admirable Bashville (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw's novel Cashel Byron's Profession, focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa. John Bull's Other Island (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. Major Barbara (1905) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> must invariably be held by the latter. The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero.|$|E

25|$|Aderca's take on fascism {{was more}} {{ambiguous}} than his stance on antisemitism. In {{addition to the}} retrospective parable in Muzică de balet, {{a number of his}} earlier texts feature more or less explicit anti-fascist tropes. This is the case of 1916, with its grim prognosis of radical nationalism, and Oameni excepționali, where Nazism appears as a heterogeneous ideology. Aderca saw Adolf Hitler as a pale copy of Stalin and a reluctant follower of Marxian economics, propelled into high office by the inconsistencies of the German Communist Party. According to Zalis, anti-fascistm is even present in the 1940 study of Peter the Great: Hitler was destroying a Europe that Peter had once helped civilize. In the late 1940s, investigating the wartime antisemitic crimes, Aderca objected to violent retribution, noting that victims had gained <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

An impulsive and impetuous man, he thought highly of himself and liked to assume <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> to criticise and disparage others. While serving in the selection bureau (the equivalent of a present-day human resources department), he came up with radical ideas to reform the bureaucracy by demoting or dismissing officials based on assessments of their moral character. His ideas proved to be highly unpopular as he incurred much resentment from his colleagues, who accused him of being unprofessional and biased. When his colleagues Lu Xun, Lu Mao and Zhu Ju advised him to change his offensive behaviour, he ignored their well-meaning advice. In 224, he committed suicide after he was removed from office on allegations of unprofessional conduct.|$|E

40|$|In Australia, {{as in many}} nations, each of {{the major}} {{political}} parties fully understands the importance of effective public relations strategies in gaining public acceptance of their policies. Indeed, public relations specialists playing {{a key role in}} managing and shaping political debates. Yet, in 2011, the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government were repeatedly positioned by the Liberal National Party (LNP or Coalition) Opposition as using 'spin' and 'PR stunts' to promote its policies in relation to a proposed price on carbon pollution. In this study the speeches of then ALP Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and then LNP Opposition leader,Tony Abbott, were examined over a three-month period using a new provisional conceptual intentional positioning framework for public relations. The study specifically tests the framework's applicability as a method for conducting a positioning discourse analysis of public relations texts. Using the positioning framework to conduct a discourse analysis encouraged a systematic analysis of these texts, as well providing a firm theoretical basis from which to analyse the texts in terms of their discourses. Findings suggest that the positioning of public relations in this context was an intentional self-positioning strategy by the LNP, and that the goal was to position the LNP and Abbott as taking <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>higher</b> <b>ground</b> (relative to Gillard and the ALP) by inferring that they (the LNP) were exemplary and 'above' using similar public relations strategies and tactics. This positioning strategy arguably feeds into popular (mis?) conceptions of public relations in Australia as lacking an ethical basis, and as being, at best, a semi-profession. It is anticipated that {{the results of the study}} will add to current knowledge about positioning strategies in political contexts, and will provide fresh insights into how public relations is represented in Australia...|$|R

40|$|My main aim is {{to argue}} for the {{legitimacy}} of ‘regulatory’ criminal law. Historically more significant as a feature of statecraft than its critics have been prepared to admit, I defend {{a number of the}} controversial characteristics of such law. Such features include its tendency to {{come in the form of}} numerous discrete offences (where the common law was satisfied with one or two general offences), its preoccupation with less ‘serious’ forms of wrongdoing, and its reliance on omission-based liability. The plausibility of these claims comes through shifting the focus away from <b>the</b> favoured <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> of traditional critics of bureaucratic criminal law: the interests and concerns of the individual, as the object of criminalisation. A very large proportion of bureaucratic criminal law is aimed at companies, as objects of criminalisation. Whilst companies must be dealt with in a fair and proportionate manner by the criminal law, as entities they lack the capacity for emotional suffering, dignity and autonomy that would otherwise place greater constraints on the scope for the criminalisation of their activities. In developing my views, I try to maintain a healthy scepticism about the viability of identifying a set of laws that are uniquely and distinctively ‘criminal’...|$|R

He arrested an elderly leader on a trumped-up charge and made him stand all night without sleep or food, before releasing him minutes before the March was due to start, so that he would collapse from exhaustion along the way, undermining morale. Dredd ordered Weather Control to produce rain to reduce attendance. By the time the March started, numbers were well below the expected turnout. Undercover judges planted as agitators in the crowd first undermined morale by defeatist talk, and then incited violence by throwing things at uniformed judges, giving Dredd the excuse he needed to send in riot squads to break up the March and make arrests. The organisers were sentenced to significant terms of incarceration. Yet publicly, the Judges appeared to have <b>the</b> <b>moral</b> <b>high</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

When he replaced some of these officials with his own cronies, however, political conditions were ripe for a schism at court and within the gentry class that would be favorable to a strong, unified force led by Kublai. Kublai used various ploys and gestures in order to entice defectors from the Southern Song to his side. Kublai Khan established Dadu (Beijing) as his new capital in 1264, catering {{to the likes of}} the Chinese with his advisor Liu Bingzhong and the naming of his dynasty with the Chinese word for [...] "primal" [...] ("Yuan").

In 1261 Kublai personally released seventy-five Song merchants captured at the border; in 1263 he released fifty-seven merchants; in 1269 he released forty-five merchants.
