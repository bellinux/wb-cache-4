This can be made precise for the ring of continuous real-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space, {{as well as for the}} ring of smooth functions on a smooth manifold (see Serre–Swan theorem <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>a</b> finitely generated projective module over the space of smooth functions on a compact manifold is the space of smooth sections of a smooth vector bundle).|$|E

The present {{incarnation}} of this hall was built in 739 to assuage the Prince's spirit. The hall acquired its present-day common name in the Heian period, after a legend <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>a</b> Buddha arrived as Prince Shōtoku and meditated in a hall that existed here. The hall also contains the famous Yumedono Kannon (also Kuse-, or Guze Kannon); which is only displayed at certain times of the year.|$|E

[...] Gabriel Perna of International Business Times wrote, [...] "Offerman's Ron Swanson {{is one of the main}} reasons to watch Parks and Recreation.

[...] Jonah Weiner of Slate.com said Ron [...] "has regularly stolen his scenes" [...] and that Offerman has [...] "a gift for understated physical comedy," [...] and Steve Heisler of The A.V.

[...] The crowd overwhelmingly enjoyed the song; the Edge recalls that [...] "the place went nuts, it drew a really positive reaction.", also saying that [...] "We {{thought a lot about}} the song before we played it in Belfast and Bono told the audience that if they didn't like it then we'd never play it again. Out of the 3,000 people in the hall about three walked out. I think <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>a</b> lot about the audience's trust in us." [...] The band remained apprehensive, however.

[...] She also wrote that given who their parents are, [...] "that can only mean trouble". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: [...] "Everything he does is for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that." [...] In another interview, he stated of their relationship: [...] "I think Fen’s first love is Summer; he falls in love; he’s infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it’s going is – will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he’s still the same kid, it’s just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase."

That is something they both work hard on to suppress, that comes out now and them." [...] Christian LeBlanc (who portrays his father Michael) stated Michael has [...] "troubled youth to deal with", saying: [...] "It’s the first time on Y that such a young storyline has pulled such focus.

[...] The character was later involved in a cyberbullying storyline with Summer and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo). Michael Logan of TV Guide previewed the storyline, writing: [...] "Adding fuel to the fire is young Fen Baldwin (Max Ehrich), who is so infatuated with Summer that he becomes her partner in crime — in fact, he takes things a few dangerous steps further once he sees Summer's growing fondness for Jamie." [...] Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: [...] "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone. To have a storyline that addresses it, it’s like, [...] "This is real; this is what happens". People need to know the truth {{of what is going on}} out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Given the {{interpretation}} of quantum physics <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>a</b> photon is either in its guise as a wave or in its guise as a particle, the question arises: When does the photon decide whether {{it is going to}} travel as a wave or as a particle? Suppose that a traditional double-slit experiment is prepared so that either of the slits can be blocked. If both slits are open and a series of photons are emitted by the laser then an interference pattern will quickly emerge on the detection screen. The interference pattern can only be explained as a consequence of wave phenomena, so experimenters can conclude that each photon [...] "decides" [...] to travel as a wave as soon as it is emitted. If only one slit is available then there will be no interference pattern, so experimenters may conclude that each photon [...] "decides" [...] to travel as a particle as soon as it is emitted.|$|E
