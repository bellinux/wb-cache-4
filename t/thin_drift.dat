The glow {{of a number of}} small fires lighted the ground only, and brought out the black bulk of men lying down in the <b>thin</b> <b>drift</b> of smoke. Only one of these fires, rather apart and burning {{in front of the house}} which was the quarter of the prisoners, might have been called a blaze and even that was not a great one. It didn't penetrate the dark space between the piles and the depth of the verandah above where only a couple of heads and the glint of a spearhead could be seen dimly in the play of the light. But down on the ground outside, the black shape of a man seated on a bench had an intense relief. Another intensely black shadow threw a handful of brushwood on the fire and went away. The man on the bench got up. It was d'Alcacer. He let Lingard and Mrs. Travers come quite close up to him. Extreme surprise seemed to have made him dumb.|$|E

In this paper we describe a testbeam experiment to examine the angular resolution of the reconstructed track segments in Gossip. We used here the low diffusion gas mixture DME/CO_ 2 50 / 50. An angular r esolution of 20 mrad for perpendicular tracks could be obtained from a 1. 5 mm <b>thin</b> <b>drift</b> volume. However, for the prototype detector used at the testbeam experiment, the resolution of slanting tracks was worsened by poor time resolution of the pixel chip used...|$|E

40|$|Lower Carboniferous volcanics {{have been}} mapped and sampled {{in detail in}} an attempt to {{establish}} the controls, age and genesis of known mineral veins and to locate possible sites of new occurrences. A study of mining records provided additional information on the nature of worked veins and a reconnaissance stream sediment and panned concentrate survey indicated a potential for further geochemical exploration. Baryte veins are particularly concentrated in massive, open-jointed rocks of the Misty Law trachytic complex where they occupy a variety of fracture directions within the limits of a NW-SE swarm of Tertiary dolerite dykes. IS-Ar isotopic dates (Moore, 197913) on veins which are cut by the dykes indicate a Triassic age. Outside the trachytic complex, in the less massive basaltic sequence, baryte veins are confined to major ESE to ENE-trending fault zones and the margins of ENE-trending late- Carboniferous quartz-dolerite dykes, with which they are probably contemporaneous. Similar baryte vein deposits elsewhere in Scotland are also located on major NW-SE or NE-SW fracture systems. It is suggested that baryte mineralisation occurred at intervals from the late Carboniferous onwards during tensional stress regimes when increased heatflow circulated low-temperature, bariumrich brines, which combined with sulphurous groundwaters in near-surface oxidising conditions. Barium may have been leached from Devonian and Lower Carboniferous elastic sediments, or from trachytic rocks within the volcanic pile. Copper mineralisation occurs {{in a wide variety of}} environments ranging from replacement of plant debris by malachite in sandstones to veins of chalcocite, chalcopyrite and malachite on the margins of quartzdolerite dykes. Mineralised rocks include basal Carboniferous to Lower Limestone Group sediments and volcanics and late-Carboniferous dykes. Some of the copper has a direct late-stage hydrothermal association with the basaltic magmas and it is suggested that cupriferous veins were deposited by later, possibly late-Carboniferous hydrothermal fluids which leached copper from the basalt pile. Several new discoveries of isolated, wide veins of pure baryte could be economic if worked on a small scale, and follow-up geochemical work may reveal more extensive deposits. Panned concentrate sampling and analysis is the most sensitive method of detecting outcropping baryte veins near streams, backed-up by stream sediments which may be more effective in detecting finer-grained, more widely-dispersed material. Follow-up in selected upland target areas of relatively <b>thin</b> <b>drift</b> could be possible by overburden sampling and all three methods would benefit from the use of rapid field analysis for barium by portable X-ray fluorescence equipment. Suitable areas for further exploration include extensions of structures with known economic mineralisation, an area of <b>thin</b> <b>drift</b> cover with abundant baryte float, and areas with barium anomalies in drainage samples. Drainage geochemistry is successful in detecting known copper mineralisation and reveal further occurrences in regional surveys...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to quantify amounts of recharge to aquifers overlain by a covering of drift and to understand the flow mechanisms by which this occurs. This requires an identification of the key Chalk and Sherwood Sandstone Drift hydrogeological environments, the understanding of recharge processes and a quantification of recharge for each of these domains. The approach adopted by this project is to investigate three aspects: 1. Identify the various Drift domains, develop conceptual models for each domain and with the help of simple spreadsheet type calculations, perform sensitivity analysis to test recharge rates for a range of parameters and boundary conditions within their range of uncertainty. 2. Determine recharge mechanisms and likely rate at field sites in East Anglia and the Tern catchment. In the Tern catchment the study is based on recharge of the Sherwood Sandstone through a <b>thin</b> <b>drift</b> cover. The East Anglia field site has been established at a site where the Chalk is overlain by thick till. The study here will be largely based on water quality data including geochemical residence time indicators and will include the following objectives: • to ascertain whether recharge occurs through the till and to quantify rates. • to establish the degree of importance of (a) fissure-related bypass flow, and (b) flow through higher permeability sand lenses. • to determine the residence times of the various groundwater components in the till and underlying Chalk. • to determine the extent of denitrification within the till. Calculate catchment scale recharge rates using regional Environment Agency data (groundwater levels, hydrological and water quality) and working closely with the Environment Agency. Review recharge models associated with regional groundwater studies in the Environment Agency...|$|E
40|$|Five {{sites were}} investigated, in the Ingleborough region of Yorkshire, Helwith Moss, Thieves Moss, Scar Close, Moughton, and Howrake Rocks. Samples of peat were {{extracted}} {{by means of}} a borer, or taken from monoliths, and their structure and pollen content examined. Profiles and pollen diagrams were produced for each site. Helwith Moss was found to have developed from a former lake which became invaded by aquatic mosses, then reed swamps and finally raised bog. Peat formation began in zone V, and raised bog was initiated at the Boreal-Atlantic transition, when the climate became wetter. An important recurrence surface was found in, sub-zone VIIb, where the peat changes noticeably from a relatively humified Eriophorum- spaghum type to light brown less humified Sphagnum imbricatum. As this did not coincide with the suggested position of the VII/VIII boundary of the pollen diagram, a transition zone was postulated from the recurrence surface at 235 cms. to the start of zone VIII at 120 cms. Thieves Moss also was found to have developed from a former lake which became colonised by Carex swamp, hypnoid moss, and then Sphagnum bog. The upper layer is of a mixed peat including monocotyledonous material. Pollen is preserved from zones II to VII, the latter zone being the latest to which any of the peat belongs. The change from swamp to bog took place at the end of sub-zone VIa, when a lowering of the water table took place probably caused by the removal of a barrier at the southern side of the Moss. This would lessen considerably the influence of calcareous drainage water allowing more acid conditions to develop with a corresponding vegetational change. The surface of the bog appears to be affected by erosion and peat formation is not actively taking place, probably because of the well developed drainage system of a limestone area. At Scar Close the peat lies in a continuous layer on slopes above the limestone pavement but only in patches on the pavement itself. Profiles and pollen diagrams from eight sites suggest that this peat cover was once continuous over the whole pavement area. The peat belongs to zone VIII. On the slopes above the pavement it has formed on a layer of drift which covers the limestone The peat on the pavement is in actual contact with the limestone. It may have formed on a <b>thin</b> <b>drift</b> layer which has now been washed into the grykes, or directly on the limestone with a later widening of grykes under peat, because of an increase in the rate of solution of the limestone. The series of pollen diagrams from the upper to the lower sites show a progressive truncation from below. These may be interpreted, either as a gradual spreading of the peat onto the pavement from the slopes above, or the result of oxidation of the lower peat layers in contact with the limestone. The information from Moughton and Howrake Rocks suggests that the peat on the limestone pavement at Scar Close has formed in situ, and has not slipped down from the slopes above...|$|E

30|$|In fact, it is {{reported}} that the reverse recovery effect should be mainly from the parasitic inductance and interface trapping of SBDs [25, 26]. Considering that the contribution of parasitic inductance is characterized {{in the form of}} oscillation current which is not obviously observed in these reverse recovery curves, thus, the changing of reverse recovery time and reverse recovery charge should have resulted from the traps [27, 28]. Since the concentration of traps is uniform in vertical SBDs, the Qrr would depend on the contact area of the device and finally increase with the electrode area as shown in Fig.  6. Thus, the traps act as an electric field stopper in the interface. During the ta period, the delay was strongly influenced by carrier trapping in the Schottky junction, while in the tb period, reverse recovery speed is also slowed by the time for sweeping the stored charge out of the junction. These results are consistent with our previous report [29], which suggested the RC time constant increases with the increase of device diameter and shows a good dependency with the reverse recovery time. And a further improvement of reverse recovery characteristics could be expected from a smaller electrode or <b>thinner</b> <b>drift</b> layer in these devices.|$|R
60|$|The {{fortnight}} Agatha {{agreed to}} had nearly gone when, early one morning, Thirlwell and Drummond climbed a hill behind {{the camp and}} stood on the summit, looking about. <b>Thin</b> mist <b>drifted</b> across the low ground in front, but some miles off a forest-covered ridge rose against the sky.

Everything was obscured to the east, but to the west the sky was clear, and a thin, bright moon shone in a patch of dusky blue.

40|$|Using the Fourier series {{solution}} to the ambipolar diffusion equation, the robustness of the body diodes of SiC MOSFETs during reverse recovery has been studied. Parasitic bipolar latch-up during the reverse recovery of the body diode is a possible if there is sufficient base current and voltage drop across the body resistance to forward bias the parasitic BJT. SiC MOSFETs have very low carrier lifetime and <b>thin</b> epitaxial <b>drift</b> layers, {{which means that the}} dV/dt during the recovery of the body diode can be quite high. This dV/dt coupled with the parasitic drain-to-body capacitance can cause a body current.

40|$|Inductive Pulsed Plasma Thruster (IPPT) pulse circuits, such {{as those}} needed to operate the Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT), are {{required}} to quickly switch capacitor banks operating at a period of s while conducting current at levels {{on the order of}} at least 10 kA. [1, 2] For all iterations of the PIT to date, spark gaps have been used to discharge the capacitor bank through an inductive coil. Recent availability of fast, highpower solid state switching devices makes it possible to consider the use of semiconductor switches in modern IPPTs. In addition, novel preionization schemes have led to a reduction in discharge energy per pulse for electric thrusters of this type, relaxing the switching requirements for these thrusters. [3, 4] Solid state switches offer the advantage of greater controllability and reliability, as well as decreased drive circuit dimensions and mass relative to spark gap switches. The use of solid state devices such as Integrated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs), Gate Turnoff Thyristors (GTOs) and SiliconControlled Rectifiers (SCRs) often involves the use of power diodes. These semiconductor devices may be connected antiparallel to the switch for protection from reverse current, or used to reduce power loss in a circuit by clamping off current ringing. In each case, higher circuit efficiency may be achieved by using a diode that is able to transition, or 'switch,' from the forward conducting state ('on' state) to the reverse blocking state ('off' state) in the shortest amount of time, thereby minimizing current ringing and switching losses. Silicon Carbide (SiC) PiN diodes offer significant advantages to conventional fastswitching Silicon (Si) diodes for high power and fast switching applications. A wider band gap results in a breakdown voltage 10 times that of Si, so that a SiC device may have a <b>thinner</b> <b>drift</b> region for a given blocking voltage. [5] This leads to smaller, lighter devices for high voltage applications, as well as reduced forward conduction losses, faster reverse recovery time (faster turnoff), and lowermagnitude reverse recovery current. In addition, SiC devices have lower leakage current as compared to their Si counterparts, and a high thermal conductivity, potentially allowing the former to operate at higher temperatures with a smaller, lighter heatsink (or no heatsink at all) ...|$|R
