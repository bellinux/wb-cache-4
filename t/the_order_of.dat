5|$|The lesser nobility, {{who were}} untitled, were {{made up of}} members of the Imperial Orders. There were six of these: <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Christ, <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Saint Benedict of Aviz, <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Saint James of the Sword, <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Southern Cross, <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> PedroI and <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Rose. The first three had grades of honor beyond the Grand Master (reserved for the Emperor only): knight, {{commander}} and grand cross. The latter three, however, had different ranks: <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Southern Cross with four, <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Rose with six, and <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> PedroI with three.|$|E

5|$|Among his awards {{were the}} Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Soviet Union's Lenin Peace Prize, and the Libyan Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights.

The same year, {{he was awarded}} the Atatürk Peace Award by Turkey; he at first refused the award, citing human rights {{violations}} committed by Turkey at the time, but later accepted the award in 1999. He was appointed to <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Isabella the Catholic and <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada, and was the first living person to be made an honorary Canadian citizen.

5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. <b>The</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E

5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were redrawn by Alan Beddoe {{so as to}} have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended {{the last vestiges of}} British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Garter), the Scottish royal arms <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Canada.|$|E
