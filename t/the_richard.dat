3000|$|In addition, {{a regular}} growth pattern was {{revealed}} in culm height {{development for the}} different DBH classes based on <b>the</b> <b>Richards</b> function. Culm height growth can thus be predicted through the parameters of <b>the</b> <b>Richards</b> function. <b>The</b> parameters of <b>the</b> <b>Richards</b> function have special definitions. Namely, the A parameter implies growth potential, and the k and m parameters will affect the curve shapes of <b>the</b> <b>Richards</b> function (Richards 1959; Pienarr and Turnbull 1973; Yen 2003). In this study, I found that the A parameter ranges from 10.46 to 15.66 and increases with increasing DBH class, indicating that the growth potential of culm height increases with increasing DBH. Reasonably, a larger DBH has a higher growth potential of culm height for moso bamboo, {{and it can be}} predicted through the A parameter. However, the k and m parameters appear similar for different DBH classes, where the k and m parameters ranges are 0.0980 – 0.1006 and 0.8490 – 0.8664, respectively (Table  2). The t [...]...|$|R
5000|$|The finite water-content vadose zone flux method {{represents}} a one-dimensional {{alternative to the}} numerical solution of Richards' equation [...] for simulating the movement of water in unsaturated soils. The finite water-content method is an ordinary differential equation alternative to <b>the</b> <b>Richards</b> partial differential equation. <b>The</b> <b>Richards</b> equation is difficult to approximate in general {{because it does not}} have a closed-form analytical solution except in a few cases. [...] The finite water-content method, is perhaps the first generic replacement for the numerical solution of the Richards' equation. The finite water-content solution has several advantages over <b>the</b> <b>Richards</b> equation solution. First, as an ordinary differential equation it is explicit, guaranteed to converge [...] and computationally inexpensive to solve. Second, using a finite volume solution methodology it is guaranteed to conserve mass. The finite water content method readily simulates sharp wetting fronts, something that <b>the</b> <b>Richards</b> solution struggles with. [...] The main limiting assumption required to use the finite water-content method is that the soil be homogeneous in layers.|$|R

30|$|The culm height {{growth of}} bamboo is rapid and usually uses days as {{the unit of}} {{measurement}} (Lu 2001; Yen 2003). The culm height growth of the observed data showed a sigmoid shape for moso bamboo for different DBH classes in this study (Fig.  2), a phenomenon that has also been found in a previous study (Yen 2003). <b>The</b> <b>Richards</b> function with a sigmoid shape is a famous model that has been widely applied in different fields, such as bamboo height growth (Yen 2003), timber tree growth (Colbert et al. 2004), tree height development (Christian and Oscar 2006), stand development (Pienarr and Turnbull 1973; Huuskonen and Miina 2007) and site index curves (Negash and Hubert 2006; Louw and Scholes 2006). In culm height development, Yen (2003) compared the three growth models, namely <b>the</b> <b>Richards</b> model, <b>the</b> Schumacher model and the Mitscherlich model, for moso bamboo in thinning and fertilization trials and found that <b>the</b> <b>Richards</b> model is superior to the others. Therefore, I directly selected <b>the</b> <b>Richards</b> model to predict the culm growth processes during the first stage and found an accurately simulated effect for all DBH classes.
