6000|$|... 'He is cursedly {{familiar}} with the little Dacre. As the friend of her father, I think I shall interfere. Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it, think you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it, Allan," [...] I whispered. [...] "It {{would be}} too clumsy for any of our friends--and too risky." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's real fun, 'n' its curious how {{it comes}} out, oftentimes. Well, I don't s'pose <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it, {{but it is}} curious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We’ll have {{to chance}} finding water, because the lead’s no guide,” he said. “If <b>there’s</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the sound, {{it will be}} a steep-to rock.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not used}} to making conversation," [...] he said. [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the world which I could talk about likely to {{interest}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it {{as good as}} that waltz {{of yours}} you played us when we were rehearthing 'Mind How You Go?' You remember. The one that went...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> {{what your}} father says?" [...] Mrs. Davenant asked, {{as she passed}} her hand fondly over Walter's head, as {{he sat on a}} low stool beside her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{shall be}} safe in {{promising}} that, Ham," [...] said Austen. [...] "When <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the wind, you generally find it out first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. If <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> heredity, {{the father}} of such a girl must have some good in him. Of course, they wouldn't be allowed to suffer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, boy, I can fix up that {{vertebra}} so it won't {{slip out}} again.... But, if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> {{the world to}} save your life, I don't know what it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But what is {{the meaning}} of all this nonsense, Teddy?" [...] Carrie asked, as soon as she {{recovered}} her composure. [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it, or is it all pure invention?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not quite}} {{understand}} the nature of your question, Gerald," [...] Mr. Fentolin began. [...] "It is unlike you. You do not seem yourself. Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> particular the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> {{the jungle}} {{too little to}} be killed? No. That is why I teach him these things, {{and that is why}} I hit him, very softly, when he forgets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> looks, {{you seem}} to be prospering," [...] he said grimly; [...] "unless you're in the tailorin' line, and you're only showin' off stock. What mout ye be doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe I {{can find}} out if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> life--now--besides working for T. W. till I'm {{scrapped}} like an old machine," [...] she pondered. [...] "How I hate letters about two-family houses in Flatbush!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} will, and ride to hounds {{a great deal}} closer than I can ever do. Mind you come, and if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the stable fit to carry you, you shall have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Brown's {{methods are}} not so crude. In the {{meantime}} we must send for a doctor, but before we do so, is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> this room that might be of value to us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Lorry, {{look again}} upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as those two {{passengers}} were, is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> his bulk and stature to render {{it unlikely that}} he was one of them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Why is this? Was <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> these soldiers' profession, {{in these}} soldiers' training, which {{made them more}} ready than other men to {{acknowledge}} the Lord Jesus Christ? And if so; what was it? ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. [With {{an effort}} at ease of manner.] My dear child, {{what are you}} talking about? You must know that if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the world I can do for you I'm only too anxious to do it.|$|R
6000|$|... "A trifle darker," [...] Curly Parson said. [...] "Most likely Carmack's been {{carrying}} {{a couple of}} silver dollars along in the same sack. And what's more, if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it, why ain't Bob Henderson smoking along to record?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “They seem in a hurry, and that’s quite {{fortunate}} for us,” said Harper. “Anyway, if {{they see}} us they’re {{not going to get}} me while <b>there’s</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the magazine. I’ve no use for being stood up with my hands tied against a wall.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it?" [...] said Geoffrey uneasily, as {{he shifted}} his hat to the right. [...] "I can't {{understand}} the report. She didn't complain to me a bit when I saw her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't confide.... Do I even {{confide in}} myself? I imagine I do.... Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> myself that I haven't looked {{squarely}} in the face?... How much are we going into? Even as regards facts? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are my true friend," [...] she said; [...] "you {{were present}} {{the other night}} when I sang. Was <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> my {{behavior}} on the stage which could justify men who call themselves gentlemen in insulting me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's only my old apron," [...] said Felicity. [...] "I hung {{it there}} to-day when I {{was looking for}} the white hen's nest. Oh, what shall we do? Uncle Roger may not be back for hours. I CAN'T believe <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course,' began Herbert again, 'I don't say <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it--except the--the mere coincidence,' {{he paused}} and glanced out of the open {{casement}} beside him. 'But there's just one obvious question. Do you happen to know of any strain of French blood in your family?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She's right,' he thought; 'I can do nothing. I don't {{even know}} that <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it.' The {{instinct}} of self-preservation warned him to batten down his hatches, to smother the fire with want of air. Unless one believed {{there was something in}} a thing, there wasn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say it-is-a-lie. Suspend the collection, indeed! Will the collectors, {{that have}} taken their oaths to make the collection, dare to end it? Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> law {{requiring}} them to perjure themselves at the bidding of James Shields? ...|$|E
6000|$|The Minister {{signed to}} me to move a little nearer to him. [...] "I must say it," [...] he whispered, [...] "and I am afraid of her hearing me. Is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> her face that reminds you of her miserable mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "it's no use sending for me {{unless you}} mean to tell me everything. Have you been getting {{yourself}} into any trouble apart from our affairs, or is <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> connection with them which I don't know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{bound to}} go, Ashley," [...] I answered, [...] "but I am {{not likely to}} come to much grief. I have a {{revolver}} in my pocket, and I have not studied boxing with Baxter for nothing. I don't fancy <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> Bermondsey going to hurt me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I am {{as strong}} as most of them," [...] Reuben said, smiling too. [...] "Four years' mill-wright's work, and four years on horseback in this bracing air, ought to make one strong, if <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> one to begin with. I think I shall do, in that respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Mr. Eames; you have. If {{she were}} your wife, {{would you like}} her to call a man Conway? Of course you would not. I don't {{mean to say that}} <b>there's</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it. I know Maria's {{principles}} too well to suspect that. It's merely because she's flighty and fevered." ...|$|R
