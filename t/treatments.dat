40|$|The <b>treatment</b> {{modality}} for malignant tumor {{is changing}} from traditional single <b>treatment</b> to combined <b>treatment</b> {{and then to}} multidisciplinary comprehensive <b>treatment.</b> Based on the holistic medicine view, the author proposes the multidisciplinary holistic <b>treatment</b> (MDHT) model to design and implement the comprehensive <b>treatment</b> regimen for cancer. The MDHT model involves three aspects: <b>treatment</b> target, <b>treatment</b> method, and <b>treatment</b> course. To take primary liver cancer as an example, the holistic <b>treatment</b> target {{can be divided into}} six basic targets: local lesion, regional lesions, systemic lesions, organ-based disease, homeostasis, and rehabilitation. Sequential therapy, synchronous therapy, and alternative therapy can be employed for the <b>treatment</b> targets of MDHT model. The implementation of holistic <b>treatment</b> regimen is achieved by different courses of multiple <b>treatment</b> methods. In the MDHT model for cancer, multidisciplinary <b>treatment</b> is the reflection of <b>treatment</b> modality, while holistic <b>treatment</b> is the <b>treatment</b> target pursued. The concept of MDHT contributes to the design and implementation of comprehensive <b>treatment</b> for cancer by multidisciplinary team...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{high-pressure}} and heat pretreatments, used prior to drying, on the rehydration rate {{and quality of}} sweet potato was investigated. Sweet potato was pressurized at 200 Mpa for 5 min and heat <b>treatment</b> was performed at 100 °C for 5 min. Three different types of pretreatments were performed: heat <b>treatment,</b> heat <b>treatment</b> after high-pressure <b>treatment</b> and high-pressure <b>treatment</b> after heat <b>treatment.</b> There were no differences in the color parameters (L*, C* and h) and gelatinization rate of rehydrated sweet potato exposed to the three different pretreatments. However, heat <b>treatment</b> after high-pressure <b>treatment</b> resulted in pronounced texture improvement {{compared to the other}} pretreatments. The relative hardness of the rehydrated sweet potato exposed to heat <b>treatment</b> after high-pressure <b>treatment</b> was higher than with the other pretreatments.

40|$|Background: Alcohol-dependent {{patients}} have different <b>treatment</b> goals when entering <b>treatment.</b> Furthermore, different <b>treatment</b> settings advocate different <b>treatment</b> goals. Earlier studies {{have pointed out}} that <b>treatment</b> goal is important for <b>treatment</b> outcome, both in the <b>treatment</b> setting {{as well as in the}} patients themselves. However, to our knowledge, no study has so far investigated the interaction between patient's goal and the goal of the <b>treatment</b> setting. The aim of the study was therefore to study the interaction between these 2 factors on <b>treatment</b> outcome. Methods: Patients' (n = 201) goals from 2 <b>treatment</b> settings one that had an abstinence-oriented goal and one with a low-risk drinking goal—were investigated. The patients were followed up 2. 5 years after <b>treatment</b> entry and effectiveness of congruent <b>treatment</b> goals on <b>treatment</b> outcome was investigated. Results: There was no significant association between congruent goals and <b>treatment</b> outcomes (p = 0. 060). However, when comparing the effectiveness of congruent <b>treatment</b> goal between the 2 <b>treatment</b> settings, the abstinence-oriented <b>treatment</b> setting was significantly more effective (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: The major finding was that there appeared to be no association between congruence itself and <b>treatment</b> outcome. On the other hand, we found that the <b>treatment</b> outcome was more successful if the patient as well as the <b>treatment</b> setting had abstinence as a goal (i. e., congruent goals of abstinence) ...|$|R
