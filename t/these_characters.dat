5|$|Both Toto le héros and Le huitième jour {{prominently}} featured {{characters with}} Down Syndrome, and portrayed <b>these</b> <b>characters</b> lovingly, emphasizing their childlike characteristics.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>characters</b> {{come from}} three of Sri Lanka's ethnic groups: the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Portuguese Burghers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{signature}} joke is {{the frequent}} visits by main characters to Sue White's office, in which <b>these</b> <b>characters</b> expect Sue {{to act as}} some kind of psychiatric counselor to them, only to be thwarted by Sue's ever more peculiar behaviour.|$|E
5000|$|... a {{technique}} for representing <b>these</b> <b>character</b> sets in both 7 and 8 bit systems {{using the same}} encoding.|$|R
50|$|Some {{people use}} DBCS {{to mean the}} UTF-16 and UTF-8 encodings, while other people use the term DBCS to mean older (pre-Unicode) {{character}} encodings that use more than one byte per character. Shift JIS, GB2312 and Big5 are a few character encodings that can contain more than one byte per character, but even using the term DBCS for <b>these</b> <b>character</b> encodings is incorrect terminology because <b>these</b> <b>character</b> encodings are really variable-width encodings. Some IBM mainframes do have true DBCS code pages, which contain only the double byte portion of a multi-byte code page.|$|R
50|$|Mister Fear is {{the name}} of four fictional characters, all supervillains {{appearing}} in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. <b>These</b> <b>character</b> have all fought with superhero Daredevil on numerous occasions.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the project}} was discontinued, several {{newcomers}} were planned for addition, including Knuckles the Echidna from Sonic the Hedgehog, Lyn from Fire Emblem, and Isaac from Golden Sun.

5|$|Daisuke Namikawa voices Turk (Rod), Ginpei Sato voices Turk (Two Guns), Hōchū Ōtsuka voices Turk (Martial Arts), Mayuko Aoki voices Turk (Shotgun), and Megumi Toyoguchi voices Turk (Gun). <b>These</b> <b>characters</b> are all Turks under Tseng's {{command that}} {{originally}} appeared in Before Crisis.|$|E
5|$|The Subspace Emissary also {{features}} other boss characters. Some of <b>these</b> <b>characters,</b> such as Petey Piranha, Ridley, Porky, and Rayquaza, are from other franchises. Three original bosses are also featured: the aforementioned Tabuu, Galleom and Duon. Galleom {{is a giant}} cyborg that is fought two times in The Subspace Emissary.|$|E
5000|$|Unicode {{supports}} {{a variety of}} characters that resemble transformed characters, primarily for various forms of phonetic transcription. Each of <b>these</b> <b>character</b> names indicates what kind of transformation the characters have undergone: ...|$|R

50|$|Moule {{appears to}} have {{suffered}} from depression and alcoholism, and his life and death were shaped by <b>these</b> <b>character</b> traits; one of his pupils recorded in his diary that Horace was 'a dipsomaniac-and that {{he was suffering from}} D.T'.|$|R
5|$|The {{exception}} {{is a group}} of white supremacists, the only characters portrayed as overwhelmingly negative—though Hernandez gives even <b>these</b> <b>characters</b> a pre-racist past that other characters lament the loss of.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{characters}} are shared between Bright Falls and Alan Wake, including diner waitress Rose, Dr. Emil Hartman, radio host Pat Maine and Alan Wake himself, who appears briefly in the final episode. The actors who play <b>these</b> <b>characters</b> also serve as voice actors and physical models for {{the characters in the}} game.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the series, Yotsuba and her adoptive father, Yousuke Koiwai, {{relocate}} to a new city with the help of Koiwai's best friend, an impressively tall man nicknamed Jumbo. Yotsuba makes a strong impression on the three daughters of the neighboring Ayase family, Asagi, Fuuka, and Ena. Most of her daily activities and misadventures often originate from interactions with <b>these</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Characters adds ten {{character}} cards representing persons. <b>These</b> <b>character</b> cards, once uncovered, {{are immediately}} auctioned {{off to the}} highest bidder and grant the winning player different abilities, some of which are used once, some of which may be used repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|If the Latin {{script is}} parsed {{from left to}} right, longest match first, then without special provisions, the back {{conversion}} would be wrong for the latter. There are several similar examples involving <b>these</b> <b>character</b> combinations: naha nahe nahi naho nahu nahv.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{its most}} memorable use was in American {{broadcast}} television graphics. Chyron's , Max!, and Maxine! series of television character generators used the 68060 {{as the main}} processor. <b>These</b> <b>character</b> generators were a fixture on many American television networks' affiliate stations.|$|R
5|$|Escape from Woomera is a point-and-click {{adventure}} game. The player, controlling Mustafa, {{explores the}} Woomera centre, which is populated with non-player characters—computer-controlled individuals that move about the facility on their own. Some of <b>these</b> <b>characters</b> can speak with Mustafa, giving him {{information about the}} facility, sharing their backgrounds or experiences at Woomera, or directing him to find and retrieve objects scattered throughout the facility. Speaking with characters and completing their tasks allows Mustafa to progress towards his goal of escaping the facility.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the species}} (when {{it was known}} as Calvatia utriformis) has been {{separated}} into three varieties (C.utriformis var. utriformis, C.utriformis var. hungarica and C.utriformis var. gruberi) based on differences in the ornamentation of the exoperidium (outer tissue layer of the wall, or peridium) and spores. However, a 1997 study of <b>these</b> <b>characters</b> revealed that the three varieties are not clearly demarcated. This study and others suggest that variations in the environmental conditions in which the specimens are grown can affect {{the development of these}} characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Ng's main {{characters}} are generally female. <b>These</b> <b>characters</b> {{generally do not}} hold the same employment; some occupations held by her characters include office worker, animal nursery employee, and automotive repair shop owner. Her children's stories are written simply, illustrated, and deal with children's feelings; {{they are intended to}} give children more empathy. The characters' names are chosen to be easy to remember.|$|E
50|$|The escape {{sequences}} therefore do {{not only}} declare which character set is being used, but also, by knowing {{the properties of}} <b>these</b> <b>character</b> sets, know whether a 94-, 96-, 8836-, or 830584-character (or some other sized) encoding is being dealt with.|$|R
2500|$|We {{have to pay}} {{off this}} story, we have to service all of <b>these</b> <b>character</b> relationships, and when we started mapping all that out it just went beyond 110 pages...The studio said, 'You can't fit all that story in one damn movie!' ...|$|R
50|$|The game also {{contains}} a number of guest characters from other games, including Lili from the Tekken series, Taichi Yagami, Sora Takenouchi, and Yamato Ishida from Digimon Adventure, and Takato Matsuda from Digimon Tamers. <b>These</b> <b>character</b> primarily appear in the wireless battles.|$|R
5|$|Other guest {{stars in}} {{recurring}} roles include Linda Lavin as Nana Cohen, Daphne Ashbrook as Ryan's mother Dawn and Michael Nouri as Summer's father Neil. Actors Bradley Stryker, as Ryan's brother Trey, and Shailene Woodley, as Marissa's younger sister Kaitlin, were both only guest stars at this point. However both <b>these</b> <b>characters,</b> portrayed by different actors, {{would return to}} {{a larger role in}} later seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} The Land of Gorch {{featured}} Muppet characters, who {{were members of}} a royal family, in a faraway locale. They behaved boorishly and made frequent references to drug abuse, sexual innuendo, and consumption of alcohol. Characters included King Ploobis, Queen Peuta, their son, and servants Scred and Vazh. <b>These</b> <b>characters</b> often consulted their oracle Mighty Favog for advice.|$|E
5|$|The show {{includes}} {{an array of}} quirky supporting characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of <b>these</b> <b>characters</b> as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted {{the concept of a}} large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV.|$|E
5000|$|In each pair, {{the first}} {{character}} encodes longitude {{and the second}} <b>character</b> encodes latitude. <b>These</b> <b>character</b> pairs also have traditional names, {{and in the case}} of letters, the range of characters (or [...] "encoding base number") used in each pair does vary.|$|R

25|$|In the {{following}} character sequences a kana from the /k/ row is modified by a handakuten combining mark {{to indicate that}} a syllable starts with an initial nasal, known as bidakuon. As of Unicode 10.0, <b>these</b> <b>character</b> combinations are explicitly called out as Named Sequences.|$|R
5|$|Van Dormael's films, while few, {{have strong}} common themes between them. They make {{distinctive}} use of naive voiceover {{and examine the}} world from an innocent perspective (the young Thomas in Toto le héros, the mentally handicapped protagonist of Le huitième jour, and the unborn child of Mr. Nobody). <b>These</b> <b>characters</b> views are often colorful, imaginative, and somewhat removed from reality, with slight elements of surreal imagery used to illustrate their active imaginations.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{also are}} quite popular {{inspiration}} for many science-fiction insectoids, {{such as the}} Formics of Ender's Game, the Bugs of Starship Troopers, the giant ants in the films Them! and Empire of the Ants, Marvel Comics' super hero Ant-Man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in Phase IV. In computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the Master of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II. <b>These</b> <b>characters</b> are often credited with a hive mind, a common misconception about ant colonies.|$|E
5|$|Brisingr is told in third-person {{from the}} {{perspectives}} of multiple primary protagonists. <b>These</b> <b>characters</b> include the humans Eragon, Roran, and Nasuada, and the dragons Saphira and Glaedr. The humans Galbatorix and Murtagh return as antagonists, along with Murtagh's dragon, Thorn. The Ra'zac return for a minor antagonist role, and Varaug, a Shade, also appears for a main antagonist role. Many minor characters reprise their roles in Brisingr from previous installments of the Inheritance Cycle, including the elves Arya, Islanzadí, and Oromis; the dwarf Orik; the humans Angela, Katrina and Elva; and the dragon Glaedr.|$|E
50|$|German-American {{psychoanalyst}} Erich Fromm {{was influenced}} by Freudian ideologies when {{coming up with the}} theory of character orientation. The basis of character orientation comes from Freud who said that character traits underlie behavior and that they must be inferred from it. <b>These</b> <b>character</b> traits can be powerful forces which are totally unconscious to the person. Fromm along with Freud believed that the most important aspect in one's character was not a single character trait, but rather, the total character organization from where many single <b>character</b> traits follow. <b>These</b> <b>character</b> traits can be understood as a syndrome resulting from a particular character orientation. In other words, the character of any given person is a blend of all, or some of the orientations, but where one is more predominant.|$|R
50|$|To {{compensate}} for this, the producers focused some stories on previously overlooked DC Comics <b>characters.</b> <b>These</b> included <b>characters</b> like Deadman, Warlord, and an unnamed modern equivalent of The Seven Soldiers of Victory.|$|R
5000|$|For the IANA {{registered}} charsets UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE, a byte order mark {{should not}} be used because the names of <b>these</b> <b>character</b> sets already determine the byte order.
