5000|$|The most {{prevailing}} bonding {{theory in}} cold spraying {{is attributed to}} [...] "adiabatic shear instability" [...] which occurs at the particle substrate interface at or beyond a certain velocity called critical velocity. When a spherical particle travelling at critical velocity impacts a substrate, a strong pressure field propagates spherically into the particle and substrate {{from the point of}} contact. As a result of this pressure field, a shear load is generated which accelerates the material laterally and causes localized shear straining. The shear loading under critical conditions leads to adiabatic shear instability where <b>thermal</b> <b>softening</b> is locally dominant over work strain and strain rate hardening, which leads to a discontinuous jump in strain and temperature and breakdown of flow stresses. This adiabatic shear instability phenomena results in viscous flow of material at an outward flowing direction with temperatures close to melting temperature of the material.

50|$|A thermosonic bond {{falls in}} the {{category}} of a solid state metallic bond which is formed by mating two metal surfaces well below their respective melting points. Coucoulas introduced Thermosonic bonding which significantly improved upon the bond-reliability produced by available commercial solid-state bonding machines where he pre-heated the lead wire (and/or metallized silicon chip) prior to introducing the ultrasonic energy cycle. In addition to <b>thermal</b> <b>softening</b> the lead wire, the subsequent delivery of ultrasonic energy produced further softening by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the heated wire (known as ultrasonic softening). These two independent softening mechanisms (pre-heating lead wire and deliverying the ultrasonic energy at the atomic lattice level) eliminated the incidences of cracking the fragile and costly silicon chip which were observed by Coucoulas when using earlier commercially available solid-state bonding machines. The improvement occurs because pre-heating and ultrasonic softening the lead-wire dramatically facilitated its deformation in forming the required contact area while using a relatively low set of bonding parameters. Depending on the temperature level and material properties of the lead wire, the onset of recrystallization (metallurgy) or hot working of the deforming wire can occur while it is forming the required contact area. Recrystallization takes place in the strain hardening region of the lead wire where it aids in the softening effect. If the wire was ultrasonically deformed at room temperature, it would tend to extensively strain hardened (cold working) and therefore tend to transmit damaging mechanical stresses to the silicon chip. Thermosonic bonding, initially referred to as Hot Work Ultrasonic Bonding by Alexander Coucoulas, was found to bond a wide range of conductive metals such as aluminum and copper wires to tantalum and palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide and glass substrates all of which simulated the metallized silicon chip.|$|E
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{in the mid}} 1960s, Alexander Coucoulas, {{reported the}} first thermosonic wire bonds {{using a combination of}} heat, ultrasonic vibrations and pressure which led to his first invention. He first set up a commercial ultrasonic wire bonder (capable of transmitting vibratory energy and pressure) in order to investigate the attachment of aluminum wires to tantalum thin films deposited on glass substrates which simulated bonding a lead wire to the fragile metallized silicon integrated circuit [...] "chip". He observed that the ultrasonic energy and pressures levels needed to sufficiently deform the wire and form the required contact areas significantly increased the incidences of cracks in the glass or silicon chip substrates. A means of heating the bond region was then added to the ultrasonic bonder. The bond region was then heated during the ultrasonic bonding cycle which virtually eliminated the glass failure mode since the wire dramatically deformed to form the required contact area while using significantly lower ultrasonic energy and pressure levels. The enhanced wire deformation during the ultrasonic bonding cycle was attributed to the transition from cold working (or strain hardening of the wire) to near hot working conditions where its softness was enhanced. As the bonding temperature was increased the onset of recrystallization (softening mechanism) occurs where the strain hardening is most extensive. Thus the dual mechanisms of <b>thermal</b> <b>softening</b> and ultrasonic softening which is caused by vibratory energy interacting at the atomic lattice level, facilitated the desired wire deformation. Christian Hagar and George Harman stated that in 1970 Alexander Coucoulas reported additional work in forming thermosonic-type bonds which he initially called hot work ultrasonic bonding. In this case, copper wires were bonded to palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide substrates. As a result of these earliest reported thermosonic wire bonds, G.Harman stated [...] "as such, Alexander Coucoulas is the Father of Thermosonic Bonding".At present, the majority of connections to silicon integrated circuits (the chip) are made using thermosonic bonding because it employs lower bonding temperatures, forces and dwell times than thermocompression bonding, as well as lower vibratory energy levels than ultrasonic bonding, to form the required bond area. As a result of using lower bonding parameters to form the required contact area, Thermosonic Bonding largely eliminates damaging the relatively fragile silicon integrated circuit micro-chip during the bonding cycle. The proven reliability of thermosonic bonding has made it the process of choice, since such potential failure modes could be costly whether they occur during the manufacturing stage or detected later, during an operational field-failure of a micro-chip which had been permanently connected inside a computer or a myriad of other electronic devices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this dissertation, inelastic (Raman) light {{scattering}} techniques {{are used to}} probe the temperature- and magnetic-???eld-induced phase transitions of two strongly correlated systems ??? the magnetoelectric multiferroic TbMnO 3 and the layered dichalcogenide TiSe 2. In general, strongly correlated materials have a strong coupling between charge, spin, lattice and orbital degrees of freedom. Because of the inter- play between various competing orders, these systems have highly complex phase diagrams and exhibit interesting phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), high temperature superconductivity and charge/orbital ordering (COO). Magnetoelectric multiferroics are an important and interesting sub-class of strongly correlated systems. These are systems whose magnetic and electric orders are strongly coupled, thereby showing exquisite tunability of the electric polarization via applied magnetic ???elds, and vice-versa. One such system is the perovskite manganite, TbMnO 3, which shows magnetic-???eld-tuned rearrangement of the electric polarization vector in the ferroelectric phase below a critical temperature, Tc ??? 28 K. This ferroelectric phase transition is accompanied, and in fact caused, by a magnetic phase transition from an incommensurate spiral magnetic arrangement of the Mn 3 + ions to a commensurate magnetic phase {{as a function of}} applied ???eld. We use Raman scattering to carefully probe this magnetic-???eld-tuned phase transition in microscopic detail. Our measurements indicate that ???eld-induced quantum ???uctuations of commensurate domains, which likely drive the ???eld-induced polarization ???op in this material, are found near the ???eld-tuned incommensurate-commensurate phase transition. The second focus of this dissertation is the study of quantum phase transitions in TiSe 2 as a function of temperature and Cu-intercalation, and the comparison of the e???ects of intercalation and pressure on the charge-density-wave (CDW) order in this system. All these parameters ??? temperature, pressure and Cu-intercalation ??? suppress the CDW state in TiSe 2. Our Raman measurements on Cux TiSe 2 show that the x-dependent mode softening exhibits identical scaling behavior to <b>thermal</b> mode <b>softening</b> in undoped TiSe 2, suggesting that, like <b>thermal</b> mode <b>softening,</b> the x-dependent mode softening is also associated with a critical point.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that strain {{hardening}} and <b>thermal</b> <b>softening</b> are two important factors affecting the surface quality.
