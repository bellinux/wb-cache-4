50|$|The {{battalion}} was reactivated at Ft Sill, Oklahoma on 16 April 1996. There {{it gained}} {{the distinction of}} having been the first battalion to equip with <b>the</b> <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> self-propelled howitzer.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Army's {{principal}} {{artillery weapons}} are <b>the</b> <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> self-propelled howitzer and the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), both mounted on tracked platforms and assigned to heavy mechanized units.|$|E
50|$|During Operation Iraqi Freedom II (2004), {{the camp}} was {{occupied}} by elements of the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division (1-77 Armor Bn.). It was during OIF II (2005) that the Balad Joint Cooperation Center (B-JCC) was established by TF 1-77AR. OIF III saw 3rd U.S. Army Infantry Division elements (Task Force 5-7 Cavalry, consisting of Bulldog, Combat, Devil and Headhunter Troops), commanded by Lt. Col Jody Petery and under operational command of the 42nd I.D., occupied the post. Serving as the main counter battery and route security between samara and North Baghdad (Al Taji) some major actions that happened included The fall of 2005 coordinated insurgent bombing attack on the city of Balad that resulted in approximately 125 local civilian deaths including the District Police Chief, and 100 wounded, due to 3 VBIEDs detonated in coordination with a 60mm mortar attack as a major mosque was ending its service, overflowing the local medical treatment centers and causing massive casualty evacuations by both US and Iraqi forces. Over 130 counter battery missions were fired by 1-41 Artillery in support of Samarra, LSA Anaconda, Fob Dragon, Fob Paliwoda, and Fob Orion within 30 km of <b>the</b> <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladins</b> stationed 24/7 at poliwoda to combat constant indirect fire threats in the area. In October 2006, as part of Task Force Lightning under the umbrella command of the 25th Infantry Division, elements of the U.S. 3rd Battalion 8th Cavalry Regiment (Warhorse), 1st Cavalry Division took control of FOB Paliwoda. The warhorse battalion was charged with monitoring and clearing the Jabauri Peninsula, a hot bed for terrorists fleeing from places like Syria, Iran, and Pakistan. In Oct. 2007, 3/8 Cav, 1CD turned over control to elements of 1/32 Cav 1st BCT 101st Airborne Division. In Oct 2008, the 101st conducted Relief in Place/Transfer of Authority (RIP/TOA) with 3-4 CAV (Nightraiders), 3BCT (Broncos), 25ID (Tropic Lightning). Early in 2009, Bravo and Charlie Troops, 3-4 CAV would leave the FOB and live on Joint Base Balad (JBB). The HHT elements of 3-4 CAV (including both the SCO and SCSM) and Apache Troop, would remain on FOB Paliwoda until OCT 2009, when they turned {{over control of the}} FOB to HHC 1-28 INF, an Infantry Battalion from 1st ID based out of Fort Riley, Kansas.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21st century the Army's modernization was in full swing. Some of these new advances in technology and war fighting included the fielding of the M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank, the M2A2 Operation Desert Storm (ODS) Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, <b>the</b> <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> Howitzer, the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, the AH-64D Apache Longbow Helicopter, and the M6 Bradley Linebacker.|$|E
50|$|The {{battalion}} {{was equipped}} with <b>the</b> <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> Self Propelled Howitzer, which fires a 155mm family of munitions, and is the most technologically advanced cannon in the Army inventory.

50|$|In 1997, the DIVARTY redeployed from Bosnia and {{executed}} a re-training program of command post exercises, including Operation Victory Strike, a corps BCTP focused on high intensity conflict. The battalions also conducted field artillery live fires and multinational exercises and demonstrations. The 4th Battalion, 29th Field Artillery reflagged as the 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery and Battery C, 333rd Field Artillery reflagged as Battery C, 25th Field Artillery. The DIVARTY returned to Bosnia {{in the fall}} and winter of 1997. The DIVARTY Headquarters remained deployed to Bosnia through June 1998, controlling two fire support elements for two brigades and an organic firing battery, as well as two firing batteries from 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment and additional Army National Guard elements. The two cannon battalions fielded <b>the</b> <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> howitzer, with 4th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery completing training in May and 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery completing training in July. The DIVARTY then again returned to training for high intensity conflict, participating in Operation Rolling Steel 98, the largest maneuver rights exercise in Germany since 1990.|$|E
50|$|The newest M109 {{version for}} U.S. service is the M109A7, {{formerly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> Integrated Management (PIM). The M109A7 shares common components with the Bradley Fighting Vehicle such as the engine, transmission, and tracks. This creates commonality with other systems and maximizes costs-savings in production, parts inventory, and maintenance personnel. The M109A7's on-board power systems harness technologies originally developed for the Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon; the electric drive is faster than the previous hydraulic system, and the automatic rammer more consistently rams the round into the gun for consistent velocities and better accuracy. It features a 600-volt on-board power system to accommodate additional armor and future networking technologies as they become ready. The M109A7 can sustain a one round per-minute rate of fire and a maximum rate of fire of four rounds per-minute. Weighing 78,000 lb, the M109A7 is 10,000 lb heavier than its predecessor, {{and it has the}} capacity to grow to 110,000 lb. Even with the weight increase, the M109A7 can travel faster than previous versions at 38 mph and is more maneuverable than a Bradley Fighting Vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The {{battalion}} {{consists of}} two firing batteries of <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> 155 mm Self-Propelled Howitzers. Each firing battery consists of eight guns, eight Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicles (FAASV), two Fire Direction Control (FDC) vehicles, and various support vehicles. Firing batteries are staffed with approximately 100 men, sub-divided into three platoons (1st, 2nd, and Headquarters).|$|R
5000|$|The 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division [...] "Highlanders", {{is a heavy}} brigade combat team (HBCT) of the 1st Armored Division, United States Army.

5000|$|The {{battalion}} {{consists of}} three firing batteries of <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> 155 mm self-propelled howitzers. Each firing battery consists of six guns, six field artillery ammunition supply vehicles (FAASVs, {{also referred to as}} CATs), two fire direction control (FDC) vehicles, and various support vehicles. Firing batteries are staffed with approximately 100 men, sub-divided into three platoons (1st, 2nd, and Headquarters).|$|R
5000|$|... 1st and 2nd Squadrons have 2 tank {{companies}} {{each and}} 2 mechanized infantry companies each. Each tank company (troop) {{is equipped with}} 14 M1A1 SA (situational awareness variant) main battle tanks. Each Infantry company (troop) is equipped with M3A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle. 3rd squadron is an ARS (armored reconnaissance squadron and consists of Bradley Fighting Vehicles and wheeled scout vehicles (HMMWV). The Field Artillery Squadron (FAS) consists of two artillery batteries (fielding <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladins),</b> a support company, and Headquarters platoon.|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} unguided M549A1 155 mm artillery projectile has {{a circular}} error probability (CEP) of 267 m at its maximum range, meaning {{that half of}} the rounds can be expected to land within 267 meters of their intended target. This has made unguided artillery dangerous to use in close combat for fear of friendly fire and collateral damage. The M982 Excalibur was fielded as a guided shell that effectively hit within 6 m of a target, but the Army developed the XM1156 as a cheaper alternative. The PGK fuse can be screwed onto existing M549A1 and M795 projectiles, be fired from <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> and M777A2 Howitzer artillery systems, and hits within 50 m of the target at any range.|$|R
50|$|The M119 is {{currently}} fielded with all Regular Army and National Guard infantry brigade combat teams, {{including those in}} the 10th Mountain, 82nd Airborne, and 101st Airborne divisions, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team. Other divisions may be of mixed composition between armor, Stryker, and infantry brigade combat teams, with armor having <b>M109A6s</b> <b>Paladins</b> and Stryker having M777s for their fires battalions. For example, two of four are IBCTs with M119s in the 25th Infantry Division. National Guard light field artillery battalions assigned to IBCTs also have M119s, for example the 86th IBCT (Mountain) headquartered in Vermont. It is routinely airdropped in airborne operations and sling-loaded under CH-47 Chinook or UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters in air assault operations.|$|R
2500|$|During OIF II, the 1–206th FA was {{equipped}} with the M102 howitzer, a Vietnam War era, 105mm, towed howitzer. The battalion fired over 1500 rounds in 154 fire missions in support of 39th BCT combat operations. The 1–206th FA was the only U.S. Army unit to deploy the M102 howitzer to Iraq. The battalion was also equipped with the M114 [...] "Up-Armored" [...] HMMWV which were utilized for patrolling and convoy escorts. The 1–206th was reinforced by two <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> Howitzers from 2nd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery, which assisted with counterfire missions beyond {{the range of the}} 1–206th FA's howitzers. [...] The Paladin could range targets out to thirty kilometers from Camp Taji, while the M102 howitzers could only range targets to eleven kilometers.|$|R
50|$|Following fielding in Afghanistan {{under an}} urgent {{materiel}} release, the PGK underwent First Article Acceptance Tests to verify performance, reliability, and safety. During tests, PGK-fuzed rounds had consistent performance across towed and self-propelled artillery platforms, passing the accuracy objective requirement of 30 m or less CEP {{with a majority}} of rounds being placed within 10 m. On 6 February 2015, ATK announced that the PGK had passed acceptance testing and been approved for low-rate initial production (LRIP). In April 2015, the PGK completed a first Production Lot Acceptance Test to assess the reliability and provide acceptance of the first low rate initial production lot. 41 out of 42 PGK rounds fired from an <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> performed reliably, a 97 percent success rate.|$|R

CNN reporter Jane Arraf entered the city with US troops and covered the battle live. Fighting continued for two more days before the entire city was secured.|$|R
50|$|The US Army {{uses the}} Fire Support Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (FSCATT) in two {{versions}} for initial and sustainment training of <b>the</b> <b>M109A6</b> and M109A5. <b>The</b> system uses an actual surplus turret and a simulated ammunition system.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 1990s, the DIVARTY {{remained}} in South Korea, conducting live fire and command post exercises aimed at deterring North Korean aggression, and remained ready to respond should deterrence fail. During 1990, the DIVARTY converted its three direct support cannon battalions from 3 x 6 (3 firing batteries of six howitzers each) to 3 x 8 organization, and converted a 8-8 FA from M198 towed howitzers to M109A2 self-propelled howtizers. In October 1991, the DIVARTY closed Firebase 4P3, the Army's last active firebase, {{and turned the}} DMZ mission to the Republic of Korea Army. During 1992, the DIVARTY inactivated 1-4 FA and B/6-32 FA. In 1993, the DIVARTY activated Battery A, 38th Field Artillery as a separate MLRS battery. In 1996, 8th Battalion, 8th FA reflagged to the 2nd Battalion, 17th FA. In 1997, both 1-15 FA and 2-17 FA fielded <b>M109A6</b> <b>Paladin</b> howitzers. During 1997, the DIVARTY fielded Improved Position Determining System MLRS launchers in C/6-37 FA, and assisted the ROK Army with fielding its initial MLRS battalion, bringing the capability to deliver ATACMS Block 1A missiles.|$|R
50|$|The British Army {{replaced}} its M109s {{with the}} AS-90. Several European armed forces have or are currently replacing older M109s with the German PzH 2000.
