[...] "Illegal is illegal, though. I don't {{think the answer is}} deporting 12 million people, though." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ribbentrop became Hitler's {{favourite}} foreign-policy adviser, {{partly by}} dint of his familiarity with the world outside Germany, but also by flattery and sycophancy. One German diplomat later recalled that [...] "Ribbentrop didn't understand anything about foreign policy. His sole wish was to please Hitler". In particular, Ribbentrop acquired the habit of listening carefully to what Hitler was saying, memorizing his pet ideas, and then later presenting Hitler's ideas as his own – a practice that much impressed Hitler as proving Ribbentrop was an ideal National Socialist diplomat. Ribbentrop quickly learned that Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem, and accordingly tendered his advice in that direction as a Ribbentrop aide recalled:When Hitler said 'Grey', Ribbentrop said 'Black, black, black'. He always said it three times more, {{and he was always}} more radical. I listened to what Hitler said one day when Ribbentrop wasn't present: 'With Ribbentrop it is so easy, he is always so radical. Meanwhile, all the other people I have, <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> they have problems, they are afraid, they think we should take care and then I have to blow them up, to get strong. And Ribbentrop was blowing up the whole day and I had to do nothing. I had to break – much better!' ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Owen was {{a social}} {{reformer}} and wealthy industrialist who made his fortune from textile mills in New Lanark, Scotland. Owen, his twenty-two-year-old son, William, and his Scottish friend Donald McDonald [...] sailed to the United States in 1824 to purchase a site to implement Owen's vision for [...] "a New Moral World" [...] of happiness, enlightenment, and prosperity through education, science, technology, and communal living. Owen believed his utopian community would create a [...] "superior social, intellectual and physical environment" [...] based on his ideals of social reform. Owen was motivated to buy the town {{in order to prove}} his theories were viable and to correct the troubles that were affecting his mill-town community New Lanark. The ready-built town of Harmony, Indiana, fit Owen's needs. In January 1825 he signed the agreement to purchase the town, renamed it New Harmony, and invited [...] "any and all" [...] to join him there. While many of the town's new arrivals had a sincere interest in making it a success, the experiment also attracted [...] "crackpots, free-loaders, and adventurers whose presence in the town made success unlikely." [...] William Owen, who remained in New Harmony while his father returned east to recruit new residents, also expressed concern in his diary entry, dated March 24, 1825: [...] "I doubt whether those who have been comfortable and content in their old mode of life, will find an increase of enjoyment when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>here.</b> How long it will require to accustom themselves to their new mode of living, I am unable to determine." ...|$|E
