5|$|Generally, {{given that}} the way {{airborne}} ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> type will occur, {{as a function of}} distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. <b>The</b> <b>ash</b> from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> properties have large variations.|$|E

5|$|Land {{rehabilitation}} after {{ash fall}} {{may be possible}} depending on <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> deposit thickness.

5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. <b>The</b> <b>ash</b> erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. <b>The</b> <b>ash</b> melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. <b>The</b> <b>ash</b> then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} is physically, socially, and {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas {{many hundreds of}} kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide variety}} of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> is wet or dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.|$|E

5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At {{a point where the}} bulk density of the column {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of <b>the</b> <b>ash</b> and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E

Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. <b>The</b> <b>ash</b> contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces.

5|$|Paleomagnetic orientations from beds of tephra (volcanic ash) {{that lie}} between {{the layers of}} the Touchet Formation show secular variation, which {{indicates}} that the beds must have been formed by many floods.

30|$|Elemental {{analysis}} of wood fuels and ashes from a biomass power plant {{was carried out}} using particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) to confirm that <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> can be utilized safely.

Ignition loss tests revealed that the cinder included little unburned carbon, while the unburned carbon concentrations in <b>the</b> fly <b>ashes</b> were considerably higher. From PIXE analysis, more than 20 elements were found in all <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> and it was shown that aluminum, silicon, calcium, potassium, and iron were the major elements in <b>the</b> <b>ashes.</b> In <b>the</b> fly <b>ash</b> collected in a bag filter, sodium, sulfur, and chlorine were also classified as major elements. Although chromium, arsenic, and lead were detected in all <b>the</b> <b>ashes,</b> leaching tests indicated {{that there were no}} potential problems associated with landfill treatment of <b>the</b> <b>ashes.</b> It was assumed that temporal fluctuation in the concentrations of major elements in <b>the</b> <b>ashes</b> was not significant. Nine kinds of waste wood fuels were analyzed by PIXE and 24 elements were determined. Lead was detected in all the woody fuels, but arsenic was not detected.|$|R
