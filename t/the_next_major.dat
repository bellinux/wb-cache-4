5|$|Dublin Bay is {{the next}} {{sizeable}} inlet, while the eastern coast of Ireland is mostly uniform until Wexford Harbour {{at the mouth of}} the River Slaney. On the southern coast, Waterford Harbour is situated {{at the mouth of the}} River Suir (into which the other two of the Three Sisters (River Nore and River Barrow) flow). <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> inlet is Cork Harbour, at the mouth of the River Lee, in which Great Island is situated.|$|E
5|$|During Leisler's Rebellion Jacob Leisler {{demanded the}} {{charters}} of Albany {{and the city}} of New York be forfeited, and New York yielded but Albany's mayor, Pieter Schuyler, refused. Schuyler went on {{to become one of the}} major leaders in suppressing the rebellion. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> threat to the charter government came during the American Revolution when the Common Council stopped meeting in 1775.

5|$|In 1840, {{about six}} camels were shipped from Tenerife to Adelaide, {{but only one}} survived the journey to arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the {{explorer}} John Ainsworth Horrocks. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the route}} {{began in the}} 1950s, but the first segment between Wattle Grove and Cloverdale was not opened until 1980. Over the next five years, the highway was {{extended}} north to Great Eastern Highway and south to Albany Highway, and a discontinuous section was constructed north of the Swan River. In 1988 the Redcliffe Bridge linked these sections, and three years later, Reid Highway became the northern terminus. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> works on the highway, between 2003 and 2005, extended the highway south to Thomas Road.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
5000|$|The top eight {{teams from}} the {{previous}} major will receive automatic bids to the major; these teams are known as [...] "Legends."

This branch is updated continually until it is frozen. Testings CDs and DVDs {{can be found on the}} Debian website.|$|E
5|$|The first English-language {{histories}} of the battle were written and published by Texas Ranger and amateur historian John Henry Brown. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> treatment of the battle was Reuben Potter's The Fall of the Alamo, published in The Magazine of American History in 1878. Potter based his work on interviews {{with many of the}} Mexican survivors of the battle. The first full-length, non-fiction book covering the battle, John Myers Myers' The Alamo, was published in 1948. In the decades since, the battle has featured prominently in many non-fiction works.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} not as well-received as the prior two Guitar Hero games, {{due to the lack}} of new {{gameplay}} features and reduced soundtrack. Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> installment of the series, , was developed by Activision's Neversoft division.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> Japanese {{reinforcement}} effort failed {{during the}} Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, undertaken as Shōji and his troops struggled to reach friendly lines near the Matanikau. Although most of Shōji's troops had escaped from Koli Point, {{the inability of}} the Japanese to keep their forces on Guadalcanal adequately supplied or reinforced prevented them from contributing effectively to {{what turned out to be}} Japan's ultimately unsuccessful effort to hold the island or retake Henderson Field from Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> {{change to}} SH-34 {{occurred}} in 1954. On November 1 of that year, the highway was realigned {{to follow a}} new road extending north of Woodward, intersecting US-64 east of Buffalo, and following existing highways north to the state line. This would put SH-34 on its present-day route north of Woodward. SH-50 would remain concurrent with SH-34 north of US-64 until November 9, 1964.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> {{change to}} SH-34 {{would be brought}} about by the {{establishment}} of the southern part of State Highway 6. The new highway was introduced on July 7, 1975. SH-34 remained in place; the two highways were concurrent from northwest of Eldorado to the Red River bridge, where they both ended. On January 5, 1987, the redundant section of SH-34 was removed, truncating it to its current southern terminus.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> {{incident}} was on 22 July, when the British administrative and military headquarters {{located in the}} King David Hotel were bombed. No members of the division were directly involved, but the Royal Engineers of the 9th Airborne Squadron were called in {{to take charge of}} the search for survivors and secure the part of the building left standing. Over the next three days they located six survivors and the bodies of ninety-one victims. To assist in the search for those responsible, the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions moved into Jerusalem on 23July.|$|E

He finished his career having made a total of 44 appearances for national teams, including 42 for the Czech Republic and 2 for Czechoslovakia. He scored a total of 18 international goals, all for the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|To help design <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> show, Laliberté and Caron hired Franco Dragone, another {{instructor}} {{from the}} National Circus School {{who had been}} working in Belgium. When he joined the troupe in 1985, he brought with him his experience in commedia dell'arte techniques, which he imparted to the performers. Although his experience would be limited in the next show due to budget restraints, he would go on to direct every show up to, but not including Dralion.|$|E

5|$|After the siege, Maltese {{military}} engineer Girolamo Cassar drew up {{plans to}} reduce Mdina's size by half {{and turning it}} into a fortress, but these were never implemented due to protests by the city's nobles. The city's main gate was reconstructed in the early 17th century, but <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> alterations were not made until the 1650s, when the large De Redin Bastion was built at the centre of the land front. Despite these modifications, by 1658 there were also proposals to abandon or demolish the entire fortress due to its state of disrepair, although these plans were opposed by the locals. In the late 17th century, some of Mdina's medieval double walls began to be encased in sloping ramparts.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the {{division}} comprised the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade, both consisting of parachute infantry, and the 6th Airlanding Brigade, composed of glider infantry. However the 5th Parachute Brigade {{had been sent}} to] India ahead {{of the rest of}} {{the division}}. So when the division was dispatched to the Middle East, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was assigned to bring them up to strength. In May 1946, after the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded, the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division, replacing the 6thAirlanding Brigade. In August1946, the 5thParachute Brigade returned from the Far East, and joined the division, but was disbanded soon afterwards. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> manpower development came in 1947, when the 3rdParachute Brigade was disbanded and the 2ndParachute Brigade, while remaining part of the division, was withdrawn to England, then sent to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{was first}} {{released}} to the public as an open beta in December 2005. After several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small adjustments to the modification, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>major</b> release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0.80 in December 2006. Its changes included the addition of the Sabaean faction, new music, and the inclusion of a new military–industrial complex system.
