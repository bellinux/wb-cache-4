5|$|The Upanishad's {{structure}} is notable as it embeds key parts of verses from early Principal Upanishads, thus referencing them and yet building its own message. <b>The</b> <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> earlier major Upanishads it thus integrates within it, include Mundaka Upanishad and Shvetashvatara Upanishad.|$|E

5|$|Platform E6 is {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of the Group E plaza. It is roughly built from irregularly sized, poorly cut stones. The platform faces east towards Pyramid E1 and has four access stairways. The platform once supported perishable residences; these were built from maize stalks bound together with clay, as evidenced by the imprint of the maize stalks in <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> clay wall recovered during excavations. The platform itself was once covered with stucco.|$|E
5|$|After these events, Sazh {{leaves to}} help the civilians of Cocoon, then decides to move onto Gran Pulse. At {{some point during the}} events of XIII-2, Sazh is sucked through a rip in time, is {{separated}} from Dajh and ends up in Serendipity, a palace in the Void Beyond. While there, he meets Chocolina and learns of the fate facing the world from Serendipity's owner. Reuniting with Dajh and deciding to fight no matter what the future holds, they go through a time gate and help Serah and Noel in their battle against Caius. Sazh then helps Hope save Fang and Vanille from the crystal pillar before Cocoon falls. In Lightning Returns, Sazh has set up his home in the Wildlands. After Dajh's soul is lost and his body falls into a coma, Sazh becomes tormented by his seeming failure to protect his son. Lightning helps retrieve <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> Dajh's soul, lifting Sazh's burden.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni. Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that will enable him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The present paper gives a {{classification}} of the expressive power of two-variable least fixed-point logics. The main results are: 1. <b>The</b> two-variable <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> monadic least fixed-point logic with parameters is as expressive as full monadic least fixed-point logic (on binary structures). 2. <b>The</b> two-variable <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> monadic least fixed-point logic without parameters is as expressive as <b>the</b> two-variable <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> binary least fixed-point logic without parameters. 3. <b>The</b> two-variable <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> binary least fixed-point logic with pa-rameters is strictly more expressive than <b>the</b> two-variable <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> monadic least fixed-point logic with parameters (even on finite strings). 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} image {{gave the}} first hint that comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was an unusual comet, as it appeared to show multiple nuclei in an elongated region about 50arcseconds long and 10arcseconds wide. Brian G. Marsden of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams noted that the comet lay only about 4degrees from Jupiter as seen from Earth, and that although this could of course be a line of sight effect, its apparent motion in the sky suggested that it was physically close to it. Because of this, he suggested that the Shoemakers and David Levy had discovered <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> a comet that had been disrupted by Jupiter's gravity.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the comets C/1843 D1, C/1880 C1, C/1882 R1, C/1887 B1, C/1963 R1, C/1965 S1, and C/1970 K1 are all members of a family known as the Kreutz Sungrazers, which are all descended from one comet. Current models {{do not support the}} frequent supposition in the prior literature that the famous comet of 372 BC is in fact the ultimate parent of the Sungrazers. The comet of 372 BC is often associated with Aristotle who, along with others from his time, described that comet in his writings. However, Aristotle was only twelve {{at the time of the}} comet's appearance and the historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, who also wrote about it was born ten years after its appearance. Consequently, their reports should not be taken as eye-witness accounts. Further, there is no mention of the comet in Chinese literature of the time. Instead either the comet of February 423 or of February 467 with orbital periods of around 700 years is now considered the likely progenitor of the Sungrazers. <b>The</b> <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> the Great Comet of 1882 will return in several hundred years' time, spread out over perhaps two or three centuries.|$|E
5|$|The early Church Fathers {{believed}} {{there was only one}} Jewish–Christian gospel, perhaps in different versions; however, scholars have long recognized the possibility there were at least two or three. Jerome's references to a Gospel of the Hebrews, or variants of that name, are particularly problematic because it is unclear which gospel he is referring to as the source of his quotations. Hegesippus, Eusebius, and Jerome all used an Aramaic gospel, which Jerome referred to as the gospel used by a Jewish Christian sect known as the Nazarenes. Gospel of the Nazarenes is the name adopted by scholars to describe <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> quotations believed to originate from an Aramaic gospel that was based on traditions similar to the Gospel of Matthew. A third gospel was known only to Epiphanius of Salamis, which he attributed to a second Jewish Christian group known as the Ebionites. Scholars have conventionally referred to seven fragments of a Greek gospel harmony preserved in quotations by Epiphanius as the Gospel of the Ebionites. The existence of three independent Jewish–Christian gospels with distinct characteristics has been regarded as an established consensus. However, that conclusion has recently been challenged with respect to the composition of the gospel known to the Nazarenes and its relationship to the Gospel of the Hebrews. The relationship between the Gospel of the Hebrews and the other Jewish–Christian gospels, as well as a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel, is uncertain and has been an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation.|$|E
