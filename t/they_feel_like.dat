While jumped in <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> they are the machine, using the vehicle or drone's sensors to replace their own. This allows the rigger to control the machine at Matrix speeds and with greater precision. The downside is if the machine takes damage the rigger {{will have to deal}} with dangerous levels of biofeedback. Likewise the rigger may have to engage in cybercombat with other hackers that are attempting to hijack their devices.|$|E
25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans {{do this because}} <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> they shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances {{it can be seen}} as a racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{different}} causes of pica related to assessment, the clinician will try to develop a treatment. First, there is pica {{as a result of}} social attention. A strategy might be used of ignoring the person’s behavior or giving them the least possible attention. If their pica is a result of obtaining a favorite item, a strategy may be used where the person is able to receive the item or activity without eating inedible items. The individual’s communication skills should increase so that they can relate what they want to another person without engaging in this behavior. If pica is a way for a person to escape an activity or situation, the reason why the person wants to escape the activity should be examined and the person should be moved to a new situation. If pica is motivated by sensory feedback, an alternative method of feeling that sensation should be provided. Other non-medication techniques might include other ways for oral stimulation such as gum. Foods such as popcorn have also been found helpful. These things can be placed in a “Pica Box” that should be easily accessible to the individual when <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> engaging in pica.|$|E

Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel listed it at number nine on his 2004 {{list of the}} show's [...] "Top 10 Sporting Episodes". Nancy Basile of About.com wrote in her 2003 review that {{the plot of the}} episode [...] "allowed us to see more secondary characters than usual. It also gave Springfield a sense of community that we sometimes don't get in recent seasons. Though the blatant use of guest stars has sweeps written all over it, the tennis stars were funny and able to make fun of themselves. Homer had some wonderful lines, too, such as, 'Take your hands off me. [...] <b>They</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> salad tongs.' [...] Overall, a very funny episode."

Prather said, [...] "The music {{has never been the}} question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> they're there with you." [...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.|$|E

2500|$|Adopted {{children}} also often {{find it hard}} to form comfortable and meaningful relationships. These relationships can be friendly, familial or romantic. Because many adoptees feel that their biological parents left them, they may be afraid to form new relationships in fear that those involved may [...] "leave" [...] them as well. This can lead to holding back and withdrawing from relationships when <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> they are becoming too attached as well as not forming relationships at all. The fear of being left or forgotten is what often holds adoptees back from creating such relationships. Many adoptees feel that they can never truly relate to or trust anybody because their family experiences can be so vastly different from those of people who have not been adopted. It is because of such fears that so many adoptees {{find it hard to}} create relationships in their lives.|$|E

[...] Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who [...] "don't want to leave", and he encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: [...] "I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it.

2500|$|Qin {{pieces are}} usually around three to eight minutes in length, with the longest being [...] "Guangling San", [...] which is 22 minutes long.

The average player will {{generally}} have {{a repertoire of}} around ten pieces which they will aim to play very well, learning new pieces as and when <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it or if the opportunity arises. Players mainly learn popular well transcribed versions, often using a recording as a reference. In addition to learning to play established or ancient pieces very well, highly skilled qin players may also compose or improvise, although the player must be very good and extremely familiar with the instrument to do this successfully. A number of qin melodies are program music depicting the natural world.|$|E
2500|$|Writers {{have also}} {{changed their minds}} over time. In the 2000s ABC Warriors stories, there's no attempt at fitting the Volgan War into Dredd's {{timeline}} or Harlem Heroes (but he does refer to Nemesis The Warlock in Dredd: Blood of Satanus II, in order to declare Satanus Unchained out of canon). Other writers have also {{made no mention of}} this, and generally don't link up non-Dredd strips. It's also a habit of writers who created a strip to ignore the work of others if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it. The John Wagner story Origins refers to Pat Mills' Dredd stories but makes no attempt to acknowledge Invasion!, ABC Warriors, and Ro-Busters (or Harlem Heroes); The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha acknowledges and retcons his death under Alan Grant, but deliberately erases Strontium Dogs (with a narrator calling Peter Hogan's strips the work of [...] "notorious fantasist Ho Gan"). In the sequel series Savage, Mills acknowledges the original Invasion! (to the extent that there's a King Charles III in the 2000s, just as prog 1 said) but ignores the prequel strip Disaster 1990!. And while Harlem Heroes was linked to Dredd, the sequel strip Inferno was left separate until Al Ewing's Dredd Year One: Wear Iron novella.|$|E

2500|$|Bieber's early fanbase {{developed}} on YouTube and predated {{the release of}} his debut album My World. According to Jan Hoffman of The New York Times, part of Bieber's appeal stems from his YouTube channel. Chicago Tribune noted that Bieber's fanbase, [...] "Beliebers", was among the top words of 2010. Long before the November 2009 release of My World, his YouTube videos attracted millions of views. Braun recognized the appeal. Before flying him to Atlanta, Braun wanted to [...] "build him up more on YouTube first" [...] and had Bieber record more home videos for the channel. [...] "I said: 'Justin, sing like there’s {{no one in the}} room. But let's not use expensive cameras.' We'll give it to kids, let them do the work, so that <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it's theirs", recalled Braun. Bieber continues to upload videos to the same channel and has opened a Twitter account, from which he interacts with fans regularly; his account was reported in November 2010 to have more than six million followers. Bieber surpassed Lady Gaga for having the most followed person on Twitter in January 2013. In early November 2013, Katy Perry surpassed him for having the most followers. As of 2017, Bieber remains the second most followed user of Twitter, while his VEVO channel makes him the third most subscribed user of YouTube.|$|E

The track has been compared to songs by Lily Allen, Goldfrapp and Kylie Minogue. The next track is a cover of The Korgis' [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime". Roberts explained the inclusion of the track on the album saying [...] "The lyrics mean a lot to me. I identified with the song in general. It might not be powerful to everybody, but it's powerful to me. I wanted to do it, I love the song." [...] The cover is preceded by the song [...] "Say It Out Loud", which has gathered comparisons to Katy Perry, and is a high-energy pop song featuring [...] "Crystal Castles-ish 8-bit bleeps here and there" [...] and a chorus with a [...] "big old fuzzy hollering rush". [...] "Gladiator", the ninth track, {{has been described}} as a Berlin-style dance track. The disco track hears Roberts perform [...] "girly" [...] vocals, with comparisons to Teena Marie and Heartbreak, whilst the following song [...] "Fish Out of Water" [...] garnerered comparisons to Metronomy. Track eleven, [...] "Take a Bite" [...] has been compared to singer Robyn; and features a rap from Roberts including [...] "Called me a rude ginger bitch, they're gonna eat all their words" [...] – referencing a 2003 feud with a member of pop group Busted. The final track [...] "Sticks + Stones" [...] describes a time when she would beg her driver to buy her vodka despite being underage, in relation to the subject matter Roberts explained [...] "How funny that I was too young for so many things, yet you thought I'd cope with being told I'm ugly, Over and over". Roberts explained the concept of the track, noting [...] "What it is with Sticks + Stones is I wanted all the people out there who hurt like that to know that they’re not the only ones in that position. Sometimes there's so many people in the world suffering from the same thing or hurting from the same thing, but <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> they’re on their own.
