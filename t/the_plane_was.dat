5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} to be on sale in March 2011, even though repairs to the left wingtip and stabilizer were still being completed in August 2011. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> then sold to a private owner in 2013 and registered in Mexico as XA-MHA.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> impounded at London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom, {{following}} unpaid debts of £4 million {{owned by}} the national carrier to parts supplier AJ Walters Aviation, causing services between Accra, the UK and Italy to be temporarily suspended. The airline went bankrupt in 2005. Following this, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> abandoned and left at Kotaka Airport; {{over the course of}} the following years, various parts were sold for scrap, including the three engines.|$|E
5|$|The 33-seat Saab 340B {{airplane}} {{used for}} Crossair Flight LX498 had been leased to Crossair from Moldavian Airlines since 1 October 1999. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> scheduled {{to depart from}} Zurich Airport on Monday, 10 January 2000, at around 6:00p.m. and arrive at Dresden Airport a few hours later. The cold, drizzly weather was normal for the area, there were no indications that anything {{was wrong with the}} aircraft, and, although this particular aircraft had 24,000 flying hours since its November 1990 delivery, this type of airplane had a very good safety record. Captain Pavel Gruzin, 41, had 8,100 hours of flying time, with 1,900 in the Saab 340 type. Co-pilot Rastislav Kolesár, 35, had about 1,800 total hours, with 1,100 hours in the Saab 340 type. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> carrying no unusual payload such as freight or mail and <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> not due for its next regular maintenance check for another 21 days, on 31 January 2000.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} other superselection sectors; for instance, {{states where the}} left half of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> mostly plus and the right half of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> mostly minus.|$|R

40|$|An oval script O {{sign of a}} {{projective}} <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> called two-transitive {{if there}} is a collineation group G fixing script O sign and acting 2 -transitively on its points. If <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> has odd order, then <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> desarguesian and <b>the</b> oval is a conic. In the present paper we prove that if a plane has order a power of two and admits a two-transitive oval, then either <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> desarguesian and <b>the</b> oval is a conic, or <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> dual to a Lüneburg plane. © de Gruyter 2006...|$|R
5|$|Airplanes began {{being used}} in the Sudan in the 1920s, with revolutionary effect on {{military}} and civilian administration. Flying was hazardous, however. On 4 July 1929 a Fokker FViib/3m owned by the Belgian financier Albert Lowenstein crashed at Mongalla. There were no deaths, but <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|At 15:16, while <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> in {{a shallow}} right turn at 37,000 feet, the fan disk of its {{tail-mounted}} General Electric CF6-6 engine explosively disintegrated. Debris penetrated the tail in numerous places, including the horizontal stabilizer, puncturing the lines of all three hydraulic systems.|$|E
50|$|A {{plane of}} {{rotation}} for a particular rotation <b>is</b> a <b>plane</b> that <b>is</b> mapped to itself by <b>the</b> rotation. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> not fixed, but all vectors in <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>are</b> mapped to other vectors in <b>the</b> same <b>plane</b> by <b>the</b> rotation. This transformation of <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> to itself <b>is</b> always a rotation about the origin, through an angle which is the angle of rotation for <b>the</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|R
30|$|For a {{deformity}} that {{is mainly}} angular, <b>the</b> final <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> close to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> of angular deformity (horizontal axis). For deformity that <b>is</b> mainly rotational, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> closer to <b>the</b> transverse or axial plane (vertical axis).|$|R

5|$|Flight 253, a Northwest Airlines Airbus A330-323E twinjet, {{registered}} N820NW, with 279 passengers, 8 flight attendants, and 3 pilots aboard, left Amsterdam around 08:45 local time. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{scheduled to}} arrive in Detroit at 11:40 EST, and was painted in Delta Air Lines' livery, as Northwest was a subsidiary of Delta at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 a small {{aeroplane}} {{landed on the}} summit plateau of Helvellyn and took off again. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> an Avro 585 Gosport, a two-seater biplane flown by Bert Hinkler, a test pilot who worked for A V Roe, the plane's manufacturers, at Woodford Aerodrome near Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In heavy rain, Baker {{took off}} and began to level off at 600 feet. A {{quarter of a mile}} into the flight, the engine failed. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{generally}} easy to crash-land if necessary, something he had done previously at the cost of a few broken ribs.|$|E
5000|$|When complete, a <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> rigorously {{inspected}} {{to search}} for imperfections and defects. After approval by inspectors, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> put {{through a series of}} flight tests to assure that all systems are working correctly and that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> handles properly. Upon passing these tests, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> ready to receive the [...] "final touchups" [...] (internal configuration, painting, etc.), and is then ready for the customer.|$|R
50|$|A general {{rotation}} is not simple, and has {{the maximum}} number of planes of rotation as given above. In the general case the angles of rotations in these <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> distinct and <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> uniquely defined. If any of the angles are the same then <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> not unique, as in four dimensions with an isoclinic rotation.|$|R

5|$|On 11 March 1958, base {{personnel}} {{were the first}} members of the Air Force to land a B-52 in a wheels-up configuration at Westover AFB near Springfield, Massachusetts. After being lifted up and onto its wheels, <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> flown to Kelly AFB at San Antonio, Texas, for a complete overhaul and inspection, before it was returned to the 42nd.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, Mihdhar boarded American Airlines Flight 77, which was hijacked {{approximately}} 30 minutes after take off. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> deliberately crashed into the Pentagon, killing all 64 people aboard the flight, along with 125 on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Although Faxai {{never made}} landfall, outer bands {{associated}} with the storm produced torrential rains, amounting to 458mm (18in) on Miyakejima. A Japan Airlines flight to Narita Airport encountered severe turbulence during the afternoon of October27. One person sustained serious injuries, and five others received minor injuries; <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> damaged during the event. One person was killed near Tokyo as the storm passed by, and three others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to ¥150million (US$1.5million).|$|E
25|$|Due to this construction, <b>the</b> Fano <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} to <b>be</b> a Desarguesian <b>plane,</b> even though <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> {{too small to}} contain a non-degenerate Desargues configuration (which requires 10 points and 10 lines).|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} it was {{purchased}} by the wife of the Togolese Minister in 2011, there had been preparations to salvage the plane for its aluminium. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> converted and re-opened as a restaurant on 11 November 2013 as a public-private partnership between the Ghana Airport Company Limited and Vindira Company Limited.

5|$|Camouflage may {{extend beyond}} an {{aircraft}}'s airframe. High-flying aircraft {{can sometimes be}} detected by their vapor contrails. Researchers have considered whether these might be reduced {{with the use of}} chemical additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot to see if <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{celebrate}} Scully's birthday. They are {{approached by}} a woman named Sharon Graffia, who claims to be Max's sister; she tells them that Max planned to deliver something to Mulder, but that his flight to Washington has crashed. The agents head to the crash site in Northville, New York, and attend an NTSB meeting where Flight 549's final transmissions are shown. Mulder theorizes that <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> forced down by aliens attempting to abduct Max; the NTSB team, led by chief investigator Mike Millar (Joe Spano), dismisses his claims.|$|E
50|$|By 1941 <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> ostensibly {{assigned}} {{to defend the}} Manfred-Weiss plant, but were actually used for training. When the Allied bomber raids started {{in the spring of}} 1944 <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> no longer airworthy, and it appears all were destroyed in a massive raid on the Budapest-Ferihegy airport on 9 August.|$|R

5|$|Four {{people were}} killed in the Philippines by Koni, and an {{additional}} person was injured. Damage reports from the Philippines remained scarce, though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67.250million Philippine pesos (US$1.26million). On July18, an Airbus A330-242 carrying 242passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather. However, the plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe turbulence, resulting in three minor injuries on board. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> later able to exit the area of turbulence and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E
5|$|In July 1950, {{soon after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 Superfortress bombers to Guam as a deterrent to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, and possible future use in Korea. They were loaded with Mark 4 nuclear bombs, but without the fissile cores. Travis was one of twenty passengers and crewmen on board B-29 Superfortress 44-87651 when it commenced take off from Fairfield-Suisun at 2200 on 5 August 1950. <b>The</b> <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> piloted by Captain Eugene Q.
