5|$|As a Jew, Kyle often defends {{and shows}} {{pride in his}} {{religion}} and ancestry. He is nevertheless lonely in <b>this</b> <b>regard,</b> particularly around Christmas time, though he takes solace in anticipating the annual appearance of Mr. Hankey, an anthropomorphic piece of feces who emerges from the sewer to spread Christmas cheer.|$|E
5|$|During the Bahraini uprising, Bahrain foreign {{minister}} Khalid ibn Ahmad Al Khalifah labeled Hezbollah {{a terrorist group}} and accused them of supporting the protesters.

5|$|Lemurs are {{primates}} {{belonging to}} the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral traits with early primates. In <b>this</b> <b>regard,</b> lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes, but evolved independently on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Smoke-lifting {{devices were}} not a {{priority}} with the normal single-chimney Pacifics. However, with its double chimney and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued to pose a problem in <b>this</b> <b>regard</b> and always had small wings {{on either side of}} the chimney. Finally, in the 1950s, it acquired the Peppercorn-type of deflector plates.|$|E

5|$|The later {{accounts}} of Prester John borrowed heavily from literary texts concerning the East, including the great body of ancient and medieval geographical and travel literature. Details were often lifted from literary and pseudohistorical accounts, {{such as the}} tale of Sinbad the Sailor. The Alexander romance, a fabulous account of Alexander the Great's conquests, was especially influential in <b>this</b> <b>regard.</b>|$|E
5|$|A high {{percentage}} of ADF personnel are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson {{has argued that the}} ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in <b>this</b> <b>regard</b> and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E

5|$|Alpha {{transparency}} in PNG-format images: The {{eyes of the}} smiley face use alpha transparency, {{which is part of}} the 1996 Portable Network Graphics specification. Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows into the face smoothly and elegantly. This was a significant issue because Internet Explorer 6, the most widely used web browser at the time Acid2 was released, did not support alpha transparency. This deficiency was rectified in Internet Explorer 7, bringing Internet Explorer in line with other web browsers in <b>this</b> <b>regard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In <b>this</b> <b>regard,</b> Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests {{that he may have}} been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E
5|$|Cairano was {{undoubtedly}} {{affected by this}} period of sudden and profound decay, if {{only because of the}} sharp decline in commissions. After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a new stage in his career began, one which is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document in <b>this</b> <b>regard</b> is the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works from the period attributed to him, including the complex question of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum.|$|E

5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in <b>this</b> <b>regard,</b> the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E
5|$|For torpedo {{training}} it {{was even}} more difficult. Shallow water was needed to recover training duds. Torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run. Thorney Island was selected but then quickly ruled out as a useful site. It was later used, but at the time, its location near Portsmouth was considered too near the English Channel and as a result Turnberry in south-west Scotland was selected instead with Fighter Command giving up the site to Coastal Command. These Torpedo Training Units (TTU) were formed in January 1943. Training in <b>this</b> <b>regard</b> enabled the Command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews.|$|E
5|$|Hibiki is a {{young girl}} with little {{confidence}} in her abilities, except in tea making. When she met Shirotsuki, Hibiki was a shy girl who would hide {{in the corner of}} a room in his house speechlessly. Eventually, Hibiki warmed up to Shirotsuki's affectionate personality and came to consider him a very important person. Hibiki can be very lighthearted, and always helps people who need it. She has no talent for magic, and relies on her master to help her in <b>this</b> <b>regard.</b> She is a crybaby and somewhat clumsy, but does her best and wins people over with her abundant kindness and warm heart.|$|E

5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in <b>this</b> <b>regard.</b> First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|In mid-November, Allied forces {{attacked}} the Japanese at Buna-Gona in New Guinea. Japanese Combined Fleet naval leaders, headquartered at Truk {{and under the}} overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in New Guinea posed a greater threat {{to the security of}} the Japanese Empire than an Allied military presence in the southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in <b>this</b> <b>regard.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. In the western United States, {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in <b>this</b> <b>regard.</b>|$|E
