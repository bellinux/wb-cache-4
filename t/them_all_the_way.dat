25|$|Hale then links up with Lieutenant Stephen Cartwright, a British Royal Marines Commando. The two of {{them learn}} that the Chimera have {{established}} a series of metallic towers throughout Britain, connected by a network of tunnels and power conduits. To make the matter even more puzzling, Parker learns that the towers were excavated, not built. After the Chimera destroy the last British command post in Bristol, Hale undertakes a solo mission into the tunnels, following <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to a nexus point in London. Recognizing that the towers are altering the Earth's climate, Hale concludes that destroying them {{is the key to}} victory.|$|E
25|$|In The Return of the King, Sam single-handedly rescued Frodo from Cirith Ungol and, {{dressed in}} {{scavenged}} Orc-armour, the two {{began to make}} their way across the plateau of Gorgoroth. They finally arrived, against all odds, at Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring could be destroyed. However, Gollum had secretly followed <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's life out of pity, and turned his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature and followed Frodo.|$|E

25|$|The Union Army {{occupied}} Tennessee in 1862 and for {{the duration}} of the war, taking control of strategic cities and railroads. Forrest continued to lead his men in small-scale operations until April 1863. The Confederate army dispatched him with a small force into the backcountry of northern Alabama and west Georgia to defend against an attack of 3,000 Union cavalrymen commanded by Colonel Abel Streight. Streight had orders to cut the Confederate railroad south of Chattanooga, Tennessee, to cut off Bragg's supply line and force him to retreat into Georgia. Forrest chased Streight's men for 16 days, harassing <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Streight's goal changed to escape the pursuit. On May 3, Forrest caught up with Streight's unit east of Cedar Bluff, Alabama. Forrest had fewer men than the Union side, but he repeatedly paraded some of them around a hilltop to appear a larger force, and convinced Streight to surrender his 1,500 exhausted troops.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164, Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus' {{daughter}} Lucilla. Lucilla's thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen. Marcus had moved up the date: perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and Marcus Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius' father. Marcus may have planned to accompany <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Smyrna (the biographer says he told the senate he would); this did not happen. Marcus only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium, where they boarded a ship for the east.

Lucilla would bear three of Lucius' children in the coming years. Lucilla became Lucilla Augusta.|$|E
25|$|The {{score was}} 0–0 at the half, even though Denver {{advanced}} into Buffalo territory on {{all five of}} their first half possessions. After the first three drives of the game ended in punts, Vance Johnson gave Denver good field position with a 13-yard return to their 49-yard line. The Broncos then drove to the Bills 34-yard line, but three consecutive plays for negative yardage, including a big sack on third down by Jeff Wright, pushed <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back to their own side of the field. After their punt, Denver quickly got another scoring chance when Ron Holmes deflected Bills quarterback Jim Kelly's pass {{at the line of}} scrimmage and nose tackle Greg Kragen made a diving interception on the Buffalo 29-yard line. But again Denver ended up with negative yardage and failed to score when David Treadwell was wide right on a 47-yard field goal attempt. Buffalo then drove to Denver territory {{for the first time in}} the game, but were stopped there and had to punt.|$|E

Mason and armed guards come to take two small children, Andy and Timmy. Andy's father Andrew attempts to fight back, but is punished by Mason by being forced to put his arm into the extreme cold outside the train, effectively amputating it. Enraged, Curtis initiates their plan {{the next time they}} are to be fed, taking the security and prison cars. Curtis releases security expert Namgoong Minsu and his clairvoyant daughter Yona from the prison car so he can disable the locks between cars, offering them a hallucinogenic drug called Kronole as payment. They take the car where insects are ground up to make their protein bars, and Gilliam suggests that if they take the subsequent water supply car, they will control any negotiation with Wilford. Instead, they are ambushed by a mass of masked men with hatchets led by Franco the Elder under Mason's orders; after a bloody battle Curtis sacrifices Edgar to win the fight. Mason is taken captive and Curtis, Namgoong, Yona, Tanya, Andrew and Gilliam's bodyguard Grey continue on with her as a hostage.|$|E

What could have been a tense affair, since Rhys had seized lands in Ceredigion previously held by the Clare family, passed off with an exchange of courteous compliments, followed by some good-natured banter between Rhys and Gerald about their family connections. Rhys gave Gerald and Archbishop Baldwin a great deal of assistance when they visited Wales to raise troops for the crusade in 1188, and Gerald several times refers to his [...] "kindness" [...] and says that Rhys accompanied <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> from Cardigan to the northern border of Ceredigion [...] "with a liberality peculiarly praiseworthy in so illustrious a prince".|$|E

500|$|Pulaski {{arrived in}} Charleston on May 8, 1779, finding {{the city in}} crisis. General Benjamin Lincoln, {{commander}} of the southern army, had led most of the army toward Augusta, Georgia, {{in a bid to}} recapture Savannah, which had been captured by the British in late 1778. The British commander, Brigadier General Augustine Prevost, responded to Lincoln's move by launching a raiding expedition from Savannah across the Savannah River. The South Carolina militia fell back before the British advance, and Prevost's force followed <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Charleston. Pulaski arrived just as military leaders were establishing the city's defenses. When the British advanced on May 11, Pulaski's Legion engaged forward elements of the British force, and was badly mauled in the encounter. The Legion infantry, numbering only about 60 men before the skirmish, was virtually wiped out, and Pulaski was forced to retreat to the safety of the city's guns. Although some historians credit this action with Prevost's decision to withdraw back toward Savannah the next day (despite ongoing negotiations of a possible surrender of Charleston), that decision is more likely based on news Prevost received that Lincoln's larger force was returning to Charleston to face him, and that Prevost's troops had gone further than he had originally intended. One early historian criticized Pulaski's actions during that engagement as [...] "ill-judged, ill-conducted, disgraceful and disastrous". [...] The episode was of minor strategic consequence and did little to enhance the reputation of Pulaski's unit.|$|E
500|$|In a daylong trip, {{the party}} reached the next station located [...] north {{by the second}} watch of the night. Heavy rains and wind made further advance impossible, but despite rain on the next day, Zhai Yong urged Choe and the Koreans to push on regardless, {{explaining}} that the regulations for prompt arrival times in China's courier system were very stringent. The party covered another [...] on March 11, completely soaked by the rain {{when they reached the}} next station. The station master provided the party with a small fire to keep warm, but a man who thought the Koreans were captured pirates barged in and kicked their fire out in a rage. Zhai Yong dutifully wrote an account of this assault and passed it on to the county magistrate's office before having the party continue en route to their destination on the following day, March 12. They reached the Beidu River on that day, boarding ships that would lead them to the Grand Canal, the central courier and trade artery of China that would carry <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Beijing. At this point, water transport was the preferable means of travel for the courier agents; Choe wrote [...] "all envoys, tribute, and commerce come and go by water. If either the water in the locks and rivers is too shallow because of drought to let boats pass or there is a very urgent matter, the overland route is taken." [...] When the party reached Ningbo on that day, Choe Bu remarked on the beautiful scenery; when they reached Cixi City, he noted the city's many markets and cluttering of warships; upon entering Ningbo and reaching the Supreme Piracy-Defense Office, Choe wrote that the gates and crowds there were three times as great as at Cixi.|$|E
