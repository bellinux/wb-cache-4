5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a {{tailoring}} workshop in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts to go through <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Department,</b> Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E

25|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Department</b> was now {{required}} to submit any reports of possible criminal activity discovered in fund annual {{reports to the}} US Department.

The Lindsay administration stated that it wanted 4,000 minority trainees as part of the plan, but Brennan wanted no more than 1,000 trainees. Schultz warned labor leaders that the federal government would implement the Philadelphia Plan in 18 cities if suitable local plans were not implemented quickly.|$|E
25|$|Obama also issued several {{executive}} orders {{and his administration}} issued regulatory rulings designed to help workers.

25|$|In Taiwan, {{employers}} {{can also}} be fined if they force Muslim workers to {{come into contact with}} pork.

25|$|The {{first problem}} {{occurred}} in July 1930, when the lathers union struck {{to win a}} $2 per day (16.7 percent) pay increase, halting work {{for a short period}} of time on the Archives, Interstate Commerce, Justice, Labor, and Post Office sites. A second strike occurred in late summer 1931 over a new federal wage law. The Davis-Bacon Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Hoover on March 3, 1931. On August 4, 1931, painters working on the Internal Revenue building struck, arguing that out-of-town workers were being imported into the city to work on the building and being paid $5-to-$7 a day rather than the prevailing local wage rate of $11 a day. Both the Treasury and Labor Departments stepped in to arbitrate the strike. The dispute was settled a few days later when <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Department</b> found that the contractor had paid the correct wages, and that no workers were being paid overtime.|$|E
